Ron Hubbard.In his youth, Hubbard had the good fortune to know Commander Thompson (M),U.S.N., who had studied with Sigmund Freud in Vienna. Stimulated by Freud’s investigatoryspirit and by the encouragement of the late Commander Thompson, and equipped withconsiderable personal experience in the Orient with phenomena not generally known in theWestern World, Hubbard bent the exactitudes of Occidental engineering to the investigationand practical application of such data to the human mind.His studies of the subject were extremely broad and varied. They included such thingsas expeditions to investigate the ethnology of twelve widely-separated primitive cultures, anintensive survey of the endocrine system, the study of early writers and philosophers on thesubject of mankind and epistemology, also the direct study of his forte, nuclear physics, as itmight be found to apply to the human intellect.In addition to Sigmund Freud and Commander Thompson, he has credited thefollowing persons as source material:AnaxagorasThomas JeffersonAristotleJesus of NazarethRoger Bacon Count Alfred KorzybskiBuddhaJames Clerk MaxwellCharcotMohammedConfuciusLao TzeRene DescartesVan LeeuwenhoekWill Durant LucretiusEuclidIsaac NewtonMichael FaradayThomas PaineWilliam JamesPlatoSocratesThe Vedic HymnsHerbert SpencerVoltaireL. Ron Hubbard’s work has excited interest and comment throughout the world, andits more elementary forms are today taught in at least two leading universities. Some of hisearlier discoveries have become accepted fact by the medical profession and his methodology isnow in use in several institutions.Some think of his work as the only significant enlargement of the field of the mindsince Freud’s papers in the late 19th century; others think of it as the Western world’s firstworkable organization of Eastern philosophy. It has been called by two of the leading writersin America: “The most significant advance of mankind in the 20th century.”3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Many lay writers have sensationalized these developments in the extreme, and othershave levelled against this work the bitterest of condemnations: whether bad or good, nodevelopment in the field of the mind for many centuries has excited as much interest.L. Ron Hubbard is himself a man of considerable energy and of extremely wideinterests. He has written fiction under many of his pen-names; and, indeed, financed andsupported his own investigations (which have cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars)with his own pen. His interests do not lie in the field of practice but in the field of continuedinvestigation.Probably no philosopher of modern times has had the popularity and appeal ofHubbard or such startling successes within his own lifetime. And mankind has had no betterfriend. THE EDITOR4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE FACTORS(Summation of the considerations and examinations of the human spirit and the materialuniverse completed between A.D. 1923 and 1953.)1.Before the beginning was a Cause and the entire purpose of the Cause was the creationof effect.2.In the beginning and forever is the decision and the decision is TO BE.3.The first action of beingness is to assume a viewpoint.4.The second action of beingness is to extend from the viewpoint, points to view, whichare dimension points.5.Thus there is space created, for the definition of space is: viewpoint of dimension. Andthe purpose of a dimension point is space and a point of view.6.The action of a dimension point is reaching and withdrawing.7.And from the viewpoint to the dimension points there are connection and interchange.Thus new dimension points are made. Thus there is communication.8.And thus there is light.9.And thus there is energy.10. And thus there is life.11. But there are other viewpoints and these viewpoints outthrust points to view. And therecomes about an interchange amongst viewpoints; but the interchange is never otherwisethan in terms of exchanging dimension points.12. The dimension point can be moved by the viewpoint, for the viewpoint, in addition tocreative ability and consideration, possesses volition and potential independence ofaction; and the viewpoint, viewing dimension points, can change in relation to its ownor other dimension points or viewpoints. Thus comes about all the fundamentals thereare to motion.13. The dimension points are each and every one, whether large or small, solid. And theyare solid solely because the viewpoints say they are solid.14. Many dimension points combine into larger gases, fluids or solids. Thus there ismatter. But the most valued point is admiration, and admiration is so strong its absencealone permits persistence.15. The dimension point can be different from other dimension points and thus can possessan individual quality. And many dimension points can possess a similar quality, andothers can possess a similar quality unto themselves. Thus comes about the quality ofclasses of matter.16. The viewpoint can combine dimension points into forms and the forms can be simple orcomplex and can be at different distances from the viewpoints and so there can becombinations of form. And the forms are capable of motion and the viewpoints arecapable of motion and so there can be motion of forms.17. And the opinion of the viewpoint regulates the consideration of the forms, their stillnessor their motion, and these considerations consist of assignment of beauty or ugliness tothe forms and these considerations alone are art.5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"18. It is the opinion of the viewpoints that some of these forms should endure. Thus thereis survival.19. And the viewpoint can never perish; but the form can perish.20. And the many viewpoints, interacting, become dependent upon one another’s formsand do not choose to distinguish completely the ownership of dimension points and socomes about a dependency upon the dimension points and upon the other viewpoints.21. From this comes a consistency of viewpoint of the interaction of dimension points andthis, regulated, is TIME.22. And there are universes.23. The universes, then, are three in number: the universe created by one viewpoint, theuniverse created by every other viewpoint, the universe created by the mutual action ofviewpoints which is agreed to be upheld -- the physical universe.24. And the viewpoints are never seen. And the viewpoints consider more and more thatthe dimension points are valuable. And the viewpoints try to become the anchor pointsand forget that they can create more points and space and forms. Thus comes aboutscarcity. And the dimension points can perish and so the viewpoints assume that they,too, can perish.25. Thus comes about death.26. The manifestations of pleasure and pain, of thought, emotion and effort, of thinking, ofsensation, of affinity, reality, communication, of behavior and being are thus derivedand the riddles of our universe are apparently contained and answered herein.27. There is beingness, but Man believes there is only becomingness.28. The resolution of any problem posed hereby is the establishment of viewpoints anddimension points, the betterment of condition and concourse amongst dimensionpoints, and, thereby, viewpoints, and the remedy of abundance or scarcity in all things,pleasant or ugly, by the rehabilitation of the ability of the viewpoint to assume points ofview, and create and uncreate, neglect, start, change and stop dimension points of anykind at the determinism of the viewpoint. Certainty in all three universes must beregained, for certainty, not data, is knowledge.29. In the opinion of the viewpoint, any beingness, any thing, is better than no thing, anyeffect is better than no effect, any universe better than no universe, any particle betterthan no particle, but the particle of admiration is best of all.30. And above these things there might be speculation only.And below these things there is the playing of the game.But these things which are written here Man can experience and know. And some may care toteach these things and some may care to use them to assist those in distress and somemay desire to employ them to make individuals and organizations more able and so giveto Earth a culture of which we can be proud. Humbly tendered as a gift to Man by L. Ron Hubbard, April 23, 1953. 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE BEINGNESS OF MANAny study of knowledge could not but be intimately connected with the beingness ofMan and the earliest axioms of Scientology began to predict and the later developmentseventually discovered the highest level data so far obtained on the identity and capability of life.The well-beingness and, indeed, the continued survival of mankind depend upon anexact knowledge of his own capabilities; and thus, more particularly, of his own relationship toknowledge itself.The basic goal of Man which embraces all his activities is apparently survival. Survivalmight be defined as an impulse to persist through time, in space, as matter and energy.The impulse to survival is found to contain eight sub-impulses. These are, first, theurge to survive as self; second, the urge to survive through sex in the procreation of children;third, the impulse to survive as a group; fourth, the impulse to survive as mankind itself; fifth,the urge to survive as animal life; sixth, the impulse to survive as the material universe ofmatter, energy, space and time; seventh, the impulse to survive as a spirit; and eighth, theimpulse to survive as what may be called Supreme Being.The above sub-impulses are called dynamics; combined, they form the overall urgetowards survival, but each one of itself plays its important role, both in the individual and inthe wider sphere named as a part of each impulse. Thus we see the interdependency of theindividual with the family, with the group, with the species, with life-forms, with the materialuniverse itself, with spirits, and with God; and we see the dependency of each one of theseentities upon the individual as a part of it.The human mind might be conceived to be the recorder, computer and solver ofproblems relating to survival.Scientology introduces new and more workable ways of thinking about things. It hasfound that an absolute is unobtainable; neither zero nor infinity are as themselves discoverablein a real universe but, as absolutes, may be posed as symbols for an abstraction which could besupposed to exist but which does not exist in fact. Therefore, there would be no absolute goodand no absolute evil. A thing to be “good” would depend on the viewpoint of the observer, andthe same condition would exist for “bad.”Several new concepts germane to the fields of science and humanities almostindependent of its own work have been introduced by Scientology. The first of these is theproper definition of a static. The next is the first actual definition of zero and its differentiationfrom infinity in terms of mathematics. Another is the basic definition of space which hithertowas omitted from the field of physics except in terms of time and energy.An optimum solution to any problem would be that solution which brought the greatestbenefits to the greatest number of dynamics. The poorest solution would be that solution whichbrought the fewest benefits to the least number of dynamics. And here a benefit would bedefined as that which would enhance survival. Activities which brought minimal survival to alesser number of dynamics and damaged the survival of a greater number of dynamics couldnot be considered rational activities.While there could be no absolute right or absolute wrong, a right action would dependupon its assisting the survival of the dynamics immediately concerned; a wrong action wouldimpede the survival of the dynamics concerned.Thought is subdivisible into data. A datum would be anything of which one couldbecome aware, whether the thing existed or whether he created it.Creativeness could be found to exceed existence itself; by observation and definition itis discoverable that thought does not necessarily have to be preceded by data, but can createdata. Imagination can then create without reference to pre-existing states, and is not necessarily7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"dependent upon experience or data and does not necessarily combine these for its products.Imagination could be classified as the ability to create or forecast a future or to create, change ordestroy a present or past.Cause is motivated by the future.Scientology as it applies to life is seen as a study in statics and kinetics, which is to saya study of the interplay between no motion and all motion, or less motion and more motion.In thought itself at its highest range, we discover the only true static known. In physicsa static is represented as a body at rest but it is known in physics that a body at rest is yet anequilibrium of forces and is itself in motion if only on the level of molecular motion. A truestatic would contain no motion, no time, no space and no wavelength. To this static inScientology is assigned the mathematical symbol theta. This designation means solely atheoretical static of distinct and precisely defined qualities with certain potentials.The all-motion or more-motion kinetic is termed MEST. This word represents thematerial universe, or any universe. It is combined from the first letters of the four words:matter, energy, space and time.The interplay between theta and mest results in activities known as life, and causes theanimation of living life forms. In the absence of an interplay, the life form is dead.The beingness of Man, by which is meant homo sapiens, derives its impulse towardthought and action from theta and takes its material form in mest.Man, homo sapiens, is a composite being of four distinct and divisible actualities: theseparts are termed the thetan, the memory banks, the genetic entity and the body.The thetan, which will be described later in greater detail, has the impulse of theta itselfand can exist in matter, energy, space and time, but derives its impulse from the potential oftheta itself and has certain definite goals and behavior characteristics of its own.The standard memory banks and the reactive memory banks compose the memorybanks of homo sapiens. These, in the analogy of an electronic computer, are the file system.The standard banks can be said to contain data of which Man is easily and analytically awareand the reactive banks are those which contain stimulus-response, in other words experiencethe action of which is below the level of his awareness. The content of the reactive banks wasreceived during moments of lessened awareness such as the unconsciousness of early life intimes of weariness, severe pain or heavy emotional stress, such data operating automaticallythereafter to command the person without his consent. The standard memory banks are those inwhich experience is stored for use in the estimation of the effort necessary for survival and areconcerned with analytical thought. There is an additional storage of memory itself in a purerform than in these banks, but this memory is contained in the capabilities of the thetan.The genetic entity is that beingness not dissimilar to the thetan which has carriedforward and developed the body from its earliest moments along the evolutionary line on earthand which through experience, necessity and natural selection, has employed the counter-efforts of the environment to fashion an organism of the type best fitted for survival, limitedonly by the abilities of the genetic entity. The goal of the genetic entity is survival on a muchgrosser plane of materiality.The body itself is a carbon-oxygen engine which runs at a temperature of 98.6 Deg. F.on low combustion fuel, generally derived from other life forms. The body is directlymonitored by the genetic entity in activities such as respiration, heart-beat and endocrinesecretions; but these activities may be modified by the thetan.The human mind could be said to be the primary activity of the thetan with his ownmemory and ability plus the analytical standard memory banks, modified by the reactivememory banks of the genetic entity, and limited by the mechanical abilities and adaptabilities inaction of the body itself. 8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"These four parts of homo sapiens are detachable one from the other.The personality and beingness which actually is the individual and is aware of beingaware and is ordinarily and normally the “person” and who the individual thinks he is, is thethetan; and this awareness can continue, is clarified and is not interrupted by a detachment fromthe body which is accomplished by standard processing.The thetan is immortal and is possessed of capabilities well in excess of those hithertopredicted for Man and the detachment accomplishes in the sober practice of science therealization of goals envisioned but questionably, if ever, obtained in spiritualism, mysticismand allied fields.The anatomy of the beingness of Man is one of the lesser studies of Scientology wherethe beingness relates only to homo sapiens, for the detachment of the thetan by standardoperating procedure is in common practice a simplicity, and it is therefore unrewarding toexplore to much greater depths the remaining combination of the standard and reactive banks,the genetic entity and the body, since the last three are a specialized combination. Neverthelessthe development of the technology necessary to bring about a complete state of beingness ofthat which a man actually is found to be, has provided considerable data and technology in thefield of memory recordings, the peculiarities of energy behavior around and about the body,the history of the evolutionary line, the identity of the genetic entity and much of theconstruction of the body itself, as well as the construction of the real universe. The bulk of thedata which concerns homo sapiens, other than the beingness of the thetan, has been coveredadequately earlier and elsewhere.In earlier efforts to better his state of beingness, Man has considered homo sapiens asan inseparable unit which was either alive or dead. Further, Man has thought it necessary,when he thought about it at all, to address and reduce the inroads of the past before theindividual could assume any high level of beingness in the present.In Dianetics it was found that the mind was sub divisible into two parts, the first wasthe analytical mind which did the actual thinking and computing for the individual but which, inthe present civilized state of Man, was almost submerged.The second was the reactive mind. The reactive mind was considered to be a stimulus-response mechanism which derived and acted upon the data of experience without thought. Thecontent of the reactive mind was found to be the accumulated bad experiences of the organismnot only in its current lifetime, but in the other lifetimes which it apparently had led in order toaccomplish the task of evolution and to arrive at its present state of structural beingness. Thereactive mind was the blueprint but it was also the stimulus-response dictator of action. Theformula which described the reactive mind was that everything is identified with everything.Dianetics accomplished a great deal in the elevation of beingness by reducing the mostviolent incidents in the reactive mind by a process known as the erasure of engrams.An engram was a period of momentary or long pain and unconsciousness such aswould occur in an injury, operation or illness. Such incidents could be reduced simply by“returning” the individual to the moment of the accident and then going over the accident stepby step, perceptic by perceptic, as though it was happening again. After this had been doneseveral times, the accident was found to have no more command value upon the individual.The reduction of the command value of the reactive mind was found to be necessary toa proper resolution of aberration. Understand that the reduction of the command value of thereactive mind was the goal, not merely the reduction of the reactive mind. When one isaddressing the problems of an individual or group of men, the reduction of the command valueof the reactive mind is still the goal where Scientology is used as a process to eradicateaberration.But two other methods are available for reducing this command value.9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The first of these lies in the removal of the analytical mind from proximity to thereactive mind and the increase then of the potential of the analytical mind until it can commandand handle any reactive mind with ease.The second is simply the rehabilitation of the analytical mind by permitting it to use itscreative ability in the construction of a universe of its own.It was found that there was no purpose in reducing incidents out of the reactive mindbeyond the point where the analytical mind could step apart from the reactive mind, and thencommand it. Dianetics is a science which addresses itself directly to the reactive mind to reducethe command value of that reactive mind. Scientology is an embracive subject, much wider inapplication. It has as its goal the beingness that can exist without an energy or matter, which isto say, without time, whether homo sapiens or not. Dianetics was an evolutionary step, a toolwhich had use in arriving at a higher level of knowledge; its use, however, produced slowerresults and much lower goals.Further, Dianetic processes were limited in that they could not be applied more than afew hundred hours without the reactive mind assuming a very high command level over theanalytical mind due to the fact that the reactive mind was being validated continually in theprocess, whereas the better process was to validate the analytical mind.Medicine and psychology, as practiced today, have absorbed and are using many of theprinciples of Dianetics without caring to be aware of the later developments in the field of themind as represented here. Thus, the society absorbs and very often misunderstandsknowledge.The beingness of Man is essentially the beingness of theta itself acting in the mest andother universes in the accomplishment of the goals of theta and under the determination of aspecific individual and particular personality for each being.Scientology is the science of knowing how to know.Scientology is the science of knowing sciences. It seeks to embrace the sciences andhumanities as a clarification of knowledge itself.One studies to know a science. His study is without avail when he does not know thescience of study.One lives and learns of life but life is not comprehensible to him, no matter how muchhe lives, unless he knows the science of life itself.One studies the humanities. If he does not know how to study the humanities he oftenfails.The physicist and the fission bomb expert know physics but not the humanities. Theydo not conceive the relationship and thus physics itself fails.Into all these things -- biology, physics, psychology and life itself -- the skills ofScientology can bring order and simplification.One lives better with Scientology since life, understood and controlled, becomesliveable. A civilization could fare better with Scientology since that would not be pock-markedwith unknowns and rendered null with chaos.The only richness there is is understanding. That is all that Scientology has to give. 1210"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THETA-MEST THEORYScientology is essentially a study of statics and kinetics. If anything, it is more exactthan what are called the physical sciences, for it is dealing with a theoretical static and atheoretical kinetic which are at the opposite ends of a spectrum of all motion.One of the most valuable contributions of Scientology to knowledge is the definition ofa true static. A static has no motion; it has no width, length, breadth, depth; it is not held insuspension by an equilibrium of forces; it does not have mass; it does not contain wavelengths;it has no situation in time or space. Formerly a static was defined only as a motionless objectwhich definition is not adequate, since an object -- or a state of rest for an object -- is attainedonly by an equilibrium of forces and all objects have in themselves, if only on a molecularlevel, motion, and exist in space which is itself an integral portion of motion. Hence we see weare dealing with a higher level static.The capabilities of the static are not limited.The static interacts with the kinetic which is considered to be the ultimate of motion.In Scientology, the static is represented by the mathematical symbol theta; the kinetic iscalled MEST.Theta can be the property or beingness of any individual and is, for our purposes,considered to be individualistic for each individual.MEST stands for matter, energy, space and time, and is a composite of the first letter ofeach. The word MEST appearing all by itself denotes the physical universe. MEST with adesignation word after it designates another’s universe.The original of the Theta-MEST theory may be found in Science of Survival 1951.After the concept of the true static was reached, problems of processing began to solve muchmore rapidly, and the main proof of the Theta-MEST theory is its workability and the fact thatit predicted an enormous amount of phenomena which, when looked for, were found to existand which, when applied, resolved cases rapidly.It is now considered that the origin of MEST lies with theta itself, and that MEST, aswe know the physical universe, is a product of theta.The physicist has adequately demonstrated that matter seems to be composed of energywhich has become condensed in certain patterns. It can also be demonstrated adequately inScientology that energy seems to be produced by and to emanate from theta. Thus it could beconsidered that theta producing energy, condenses the space in which the energy is contained,which then becomes matter. This theory of condensation is borne out by an examination of astate of aberration of many preclears who have been found to have descended down the tone-scale to the degree that their own space was contracted and who were found to be surroundedby ridges and who are thus “solid” to the degree that they are aberrated. Further, they can befound to be an effect in the ratio that they are so solidified. Further, a psychotic treats wordsand other symbols, including his own thoughts, as though they were objects. TimeIt is stated in the 1951 axioms that time could be considered to be the single arbitrary,and might thus be the single source of human aberration. A further investigation and inspectionof time has demonstrated it to be the action of energy in space, and it has been found that theduration of an object roughly approximates its solidity.Time could be considered to be a manifestation in space which is varied by objects. Anobject could be considered to be any unit manifestation of energy including matter.11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"It can be readily established that an individual loses his self-determinism in the ratio thathe possesses objects and utilizes force. Time could be considered to be an abstract term assigned to the behavior of objects. Itcan be found to be regulatable by postulates.The desire, enforcement and inhibition in the possession, giving and receiving ofobjects can be found to establish a time-track.Time in the field of behavior and experience becomes having. Having and Not Havingform between themselves the interchanges which become survival.If the auditor processes having, giving and receiving, energy and items, he willdiscover that he is processing time directly and has processed into a higher level the time senseand reaction of the preclear.The primary manifestation of this is found in criminality, where the individual is unableto conceive the investment of energy to attain an object. He will not “work.” The criminal inparticular wishes to collapse and render without time, desiring and having; whereas this may bepossible in one’s own universe, it is not possible in the MEST universe. The MEST universe isso planned as to make work necessary in order to have, thus establishing a gradient scale ofhaving. The criminal has not made the distinction between his own universe which he possiblyonce had and where he could attain things instantaneously, and the MEST universe. He thushas no “respect for property”. The identification of his own universe with the MEST universeis so marked as to be in itself a highly aberrated identification, thus rendering his conductdestructive to himself and causing him to fail. SpaceSpace is creatable by a thetan. He may also conserve, alter and destroy space.Space is the first condition necessary to action. The second condition necessary isenergy. The third condition is possession or not possession. For the purposes of processing, and possibly for many other purposes, space can beconsidered to be the equivalent in experience of beingness. One is as alive as he has space andas he can alter and occupy that space.The workable definition of space is “viewpoint of dimension”: there is no space withoutviewpoint, there is no space without points to view. This definition of space remedies a verygreat lack in the field of physics, which defines space simply as that thing in which energyacts. Physics has defined space as change of motion or in terms of time and energy. Time hasbeen defined in terms of space and energy; energy has been defined in terms of space and timeonly. These definitions, thus interdependent, made a circle out of which there was no exitunless one had a better definition for one of those items: time, space or energy. In such a waywas the science of physics limited.Space is the viewpoint of dimension. The position of the viewpoint can change, theposition of the dimension points can change. A dimension point is any point in a space or at theboundaries of space. As a specialized case those points which demark the outermostboundaries of the space or its corners are called in Scientology anchor points. An anchor pointis a specialized kind of dimension point. Any energy has as its basic particle a dimension point.The dimension point can be of different kinds and substances. It can combine in various ways,it can take on forms, become objects. It can flow as energy. A particle of admiration or aparticle of force are alike dimension points. Dimension points, by shifting, can give theviewpoint the illusion of motion. The viewpoint, by shifting, can give the dimension points theillusion of motion. Motion is the manifestation of change of viewpoint of dimension points.Viewpoints are not visible, but viewpoints can have dimension points which arethemselves visible. The basic hidden influence is then a viewpoint, A material of the universe12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"cannot exist in any universe without something in which to exist. The something in which itexists is space, and this is made by the attitude of a viewpoint which demarks an area withanchor points.Rather than existing on theory in common with other principles of Scientology thismanifestation of created space can be experienced by an individual, who discovers that spacecan be made coincidentally with any other space. Space then, is not an arbitrary and absolutebut it is creatable or uncreatable by a viewpoint.Any being is a viewpoint, he is as much a being as he is able to assume viewpoints.Thus in any society we would inevitably have a statement of the infinity of viewpoint such as“God is everywhere.” Beings instinctively assign the most beingness to that thing which wouldbe everywhere and when Man desires to assign an unlimited power or command to anything hesays that it is everywhere. EnergyThe basic unit of energy is the dimension point. A specialized kind of dimension pointis the anchor point which demarks space, but this is again the basic unit of energy. Dimensionpoints are created, controlled or uncreated by the thetan.The qualities of energy are three in number: the first is its existing characteristics; thesecond is its wavelength; the third is its direction of flow or absence of direction of flow.The characteristics can be divided into three classes in their turn. These are flows,dispersals and ridges. The flow is a transfer of energy from one point to another, and theenergy in a flow can have any type of wave from the simplest sine-wave to the most complexnoise-wave. Flowingness is simply the characteristic of transferringness. A dispersal is a seriesof outflows from a common point. A dispersal is, primarily, a number of flows extending froma common center. The best example of a dispersal is an explosion. There is such a thing as anin-dispersal. This would be where the flows are all travelling toward a common center. Onemight call this an implosion. Outflow and inflow from a common center are classified alikeunder the word “dispersal” for handy classification. The third type of energy characteristic isthe ridge. A ridge is essentially suspended energy in space. It comes about by flows, dispersalsor ridges impinging against one another with a sufficient solidity to cause an enduring state ofenergy. A dispersal from the right and a dispersal from the left colliding in space with sufficientvolume create a ridge which then exists after the flow itself has ceased. The duration of ridgesis quite long.Wavelength is the relative distance from node to node in any flow of energy. In theMEST universe, wavelength is commonly measured by centimeters or meters. The higher thefrequency the shorter the wavelength is considered to be on the gradient scale of wavelengths.The lower the frequency the longer the wavelength is considered to be on a gradient scale.Radio, sound, light and other manifestations, each has its place on the gradient scale ofwavelengths. Wavelength has no bearing upon wave characteristic, but applies to the flow orpotential flow. A ridge has potential flow which, when released, may be supposed to have awavelength. The various perceptions of the body and the thetan, each one is established by aposition on the gradient scale of wavelengths. They are each one an energy flow.Direction of flow, relative to the thetan, is of primary interest in energy study. Therewould be outflow and inflow. There could be outflow and inflow for a source point exterior tothe thetan and caused by that source point, and there could be outflow and inflow by the thetanhimself. MatterMatter is a condensation of energy. The more energy condenses, the less space itoccupies and the greater its endurance becomes. A flow of energy has a brief duration. Flowsof energy meeting and causing ridges obtain greater solidity and longer duration. The solidification of matter is found to be itself duration or time. Energy becomesmatter if condensed. Matter becomes energy if dispersed.13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The manifestations of energy are essentially at long length the manifestations of matter;one cannot consider matter without also considering energy.In processing, no differentiation is made between matter and energy beyond labellingthe freer-flowing and more instantaneous forms “action” and the more solid and enduringforms “having.”In order to have matter, one must have space, must have had energy, and must have.In order to have space, it is necessary to have a viewpoint and the potential in theviewpoint of creating anchor points. Thus, in order to view matter, much less control or createit, it is necessary to have a viewpoint. 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"AFFINITY, COMMUNICATION AND REALITYIn human experience, which is probably an experience senior to and creative of such athing as the material universe, space, energy and matter become beingness, doingness andhavingness.Beingness is space regardless of energy and matter; doingness requires both space andmatter; and havingness requires space and energy.We have a gradient scale from space to matter which starts at the arbitrary number of40.0 for our purposes and goes down to 0.0 for the purposes of homo sapiens and to -8.0 forthe purposes of estimating a thetan. This gradient scale is called the tone scale.Space is found to be a broad characteristic from top to bottom of the scale andnecessary to each part of it, but it is discovered that one has less and less space the more thescale is descended. If one were to attain zero space for himself, he would attain, even as athetan, zero. That the body has space and the thetan apparently, to himself, does not havespace, is responsible mainly for the feeling of not-beingness on the part of the thetan whichcauses him to forget his own identity.On this tone-scale, we have a theoretical point of no energy at 40.0, and a point whereenergy begins to be solid around 0.0; well below this level we have matter formed of the typeknown in the material universe. Thus one can see that this tone-scale is a gradient scale ofenergy, and that the energy is free toward the top of the scale and becomes less free and morefixed as one descends the scale.A very important triangle in Scientology is the triangle called ARC. This stands forAffinity, Reality and Communication. It was used for some time before its relation to energywas understood. Affinity is wave characteristic and is the range of human emotions. Human emotionsmanifest themselves in energy flows, dispersals and ridges. As the emotions drop down fromhigh on the scale to low on the scale, they are found to follow a cycle of dispersals, flows andridges. Each dispersal has a harmonic on the scale, each flow has a harmonic and each ridgehas a harmonic. Looking up the scale from zero one finds death as a ridge and, in humanemotion, an apathy. Apathy reaches up some extent from death but at this end the harmonicsare very close together and there are two unnamed human emotions immediately above apathy.One of them, next above apathy, is a flow; immediately above that there is a fearlike dispersal.The next named emotion above apathy is grief. Grief is a ridge and is occasioned by loss.Immediately above grief there is a flow. The next named emotion, however, is the next level,the dispersal called fear which is a drawing away. There is a flow immediately above this calledcovert hostility. Above covert hostility is anger which is a solid ridge. Between anger at 1.5and antagonism at 2.0 there is a dispersal -- unnamed but visible in behavior. At 2.0 we havethe flow outgoing called antagonism. Above this at 2.5 there is an idle dispersal known asboredom. Above boredom at 3.0 is a ridge called conservatism. At 4.0 we have another flowcalled enthusiasm. Each one of these points is a harmonic of a lower point. The characteristicof energy whether a flow, dispersal or ridge, expresses itself in human emotion in terms ofaffinity. Affinity is the cohesiveness of human relationships, and can be acceptance or rejectionof such relationships. Affinity as here used is a degree of emotion. Its equivalent in the MESTuniverse is the cohesion and adhesion or revulsion from matter and energy itself as found inpositive and negative currents, and in forms of matter.Communication is an interchange of energy from one beingness to another; in the thetanand in homo sapiens communication is known as perception. It is not solely talk, which is asymbolized form of communication which sums ideas which are themselves either a product ofthe tone-scale or are above the tone-scale as the case may be. Sight, of course, is at thewavelength of light. Sound is recorded as hearing. Tactile and smell are low-level wave typesof the particle variety. And all other perceptions can be found on this gradient scale ofwavelengths, modified by the wave characteristic in terms of type, whether sine or morecomplex. The auditor must realize that communication is essentially directed or received energy15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"and is inhibited by the willingness or unwillingness of the preclear to take responsibility forenergy or forms of energy. Where responsibility is low, perception is low.Reality is established by wave direction or lack of motion.As one ascends the tone scale from 0.0 he finds the realities are strongest at the pointsof flow and are weakest at the points where there are ridges on the scale.The reality of apathy, grief and anger is very poor, but in the immediate vicinity ofthese there are more intense realities. Reality is established by agreement or disagreement or noopinion. Agreement is an inflow to the individual; disagreement is outflow from the individual;no opinion can be established by the proximity of the individual to the center of a dispersal orby a ridge.Because of its wealth of energy and energy forms, the thetan finds himself ordinarilyoutdone in energy emanation by the Mest universe. Thus he is the target of an almostcontinuous inflow which causes him to have a consistent and continual agreement with theMEST universe. He seldom disagrees with the MEST universe, and the best processing onecan do is to break this agreement and turn it into an opposite flow, for only in this wise can apreclear’s ability to handle energy and be responsible for it be re-established. If you ask apreclear to get the concept of agreeing, he will find himself experiencing an inflow uponhimself.Hypnotism is performed by causing a subject to receive a continuous rhythmic ormonotonous flow from the operator. After this flow has continued the subject will accept anyreality which the operator cares to deliver unto him. It is in this case, evidently, with the MESTuniverse, and the solidity of the MEST universe is completely dependent upon one’sacceptance of it in terms of agreement.Reality in essence is agreement or disagreement. When one speaks of reality, he speaksin terms of the MEST universe. The MEST universe, according to any computation one caresto make upon it, is found to consist of a high-level agreement amongst us. Those who disagreewith the MEST universe are punished by the MEST universe.From the standpoint of the MEST universe, the greatest reality would be had by matteritself and this seems to be its evident goal toward the thetan, to make him into solid energy.The reality on one’s own universe is poor because he is in a comatose state of agreement withthe MEST universe. It is found on processing, however, that a preclear is in poor condition indirect ratio that he has accepted and agrees and complies with the MEST universe, and is ingood and active condition in direct ratio to the degree he can break this flow of agreement andestablish his own flows and thus create his own universe. One’s appreciation of the MESTuniverse is almost uniformly the energy which one himself places upon the MEST universe, inother words his illusions. When he loses his hopes and dreams (his illusions), it is because hehas lost his ability to emanate energy back at the MEST universe and is dependent upon theenergy the MEST universe thrusts at him.ARC thus form a tone-scale. This tone-scale at any level finds a comparative state inaffinity, in the reality and the communication abilities of the preclear. Thus, by testing thepreclear and discovering his chronic emotion, his chronic state of agreement or disagreement,and his ability to communicate or not communicate, one establishes a level on this tone-scale.ARC form a triangle the corners of which are all at a single level. Thus if one wishes tocreate an increase of tone for the preclear -- and one must do that to increase his self-determinism -- he will find that he cannot raise the emotional state of the preclear without alsoaddressing the reality and communication of the preclear. He cannot raise the reality of thepreclear without addressing his affinity and communication problems. He cannot raisecommunication with the preclear without addressing his reality and affinity problems. Theworst mistake an auditor can make is to undervalue this triangle in processing. A more or lesscomplete tone-scale can be found in Science of Survival, and Book I of that volume is devotedentirely to an evaluation of the tone-scale and people.16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"There are two positions on the tone-scale for the preclear when he is still a homosapiens. The composite known as homo sapiens is considered to be dead at 0.0 and can rise onthe tone-scale to slightly above 4.0. Thus homo sapiens has this as his range. The thetan,however, who, in homo sapiens, is below the level of awareness of self in terms of space andenergy, has a wider range; and, as the thetan is basically the preclear and the beingness andidentity of the preclear in actuality, this second range is even more important. This secondrange goes from -- 8.0 to 40.0 on the tone-scale. The optimum position for the thetan isconsidered to be 20.0 which is the point of optimum action. A homo sapiens as such could notattain this level of the tone-scale because of his physical limitations. Identity Versus IndividualityThe most common confusion on the part of a preclear is between himself as anidentified object and his beingness. One’s beingness depends upon the amount of space whichhe can create or command, not upon his identification or any label. Identity as we know it inthe MEST universe is much the same as identification, which is the lowest form of thought.When one is an object and is himself an effect, he believes that his ability to be cause isdependent upon his having a specific and finite identity. This is an aberration; as his beingnessincreases his individuality increases, and he quickly rises above the level of necessity foridentity for he is himself self-sufficient with his own identity. The first question a preclear undergoing theta clearing asks himself is quite often: “Howwill I establish my identity if I have no body?” There are many remedies for this. The worstmethod of having an identity is having a body. As his individuality increases and his beingnessexpands -- these two being almost synonymous -- he is less and less concerned with thisproblem; that he is concerned with the problem tells the auditor where he is on the tone-scale.One of the control mechanisms which has been used on thetans is that when they rise inpotential they are led to believe themselves one with the universe. This is distinctly untrue.Thetans are individuals. They do not as they rise up the scale, merge with other individualities.They have the power of becoming anything they wish while still retaining their ownindividuality. They are first and foremost themselves. There is evidently no Nirvana. It is thefeeling that one will merge and lose his own individuality that restrains the thetan fromattempting to remedy his lot. His merging with the rest of the universe would be his becomingmatter. This is the ultimate in cohesiveness and the ultimate in affinity, and is at the lowestpoint of the tone-scale. One declines into a brotherhood with the universe. When he goes upscale, he becomes more and more an individual capable of creating and maintaining his ownuniverse. In this wise (leading people to believe they had no individuality above that of MEST)the MEST universe cut out all competition.BeingnessSpace is not necessary to the beingness of a thetan when the thetan is above the tonelevel of 40.0 and can create space at will. He creates space to have specific beingness. At 40.0space and beingness can be considered to be interchangeable. Beingness can exist without anyenergy or matter, which is to say, without time.However, in this universe, in order to achieve a state of beingness, which is more toour point here, it is necessary to have a viewpoint from which dimension points can be createdor controlled. One has as much viewpoint as he has space in which to view in relationship toother viewpoints having space in which to view, thus one has a condition of relative beingness.DoingnessAction requires space and energy manifestations, and the definition of action could bedoingness directed toward havingness. In order to accomplish action, a preclear must be able tohandle energy.17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Doingness with energy and objects as found in the MEST universe is very far from theonly method of producing existence. This is a specialized form of behavior and may exist inany universe but is very peculiar to the MEST universe. HavingnessTime is an abstract manifestation which has no existence beyond the idea of timeoccasioned by objects, where an object may be either energy or matter. Time can be defined aschange in space, but where one attempts to define motion as change in space, the definitionlacks usefulness since one does not define what is changing in space; there must be somethingthere to change in space in order to have the illusion of time.As was earlier discovered in Scientology, the single arbitrary is time. This is becausetime did not exist as such but stemmed from havingness. When Man experiences “time,” he isexperiencing havingness or not-havingness.Time is summed up as “had,” “have,” and “will have.” Goals in the MEST universe aresummed uniformly under the heading of “will have.” One engages in action in order to have.This is one of the most important points of processing. The individual has made apostulate to have and has then gained something he did not want at every single point on thetime track where you find him stuck. He desired to have a castle. He may have been engagingin an action which would gain for him a castle and was stopped and killed by an explosionwhich destroyed a wall before him. The explosion caught him with a postulate that he wouldhave and gave him something he did not want. Struggling with the facsimile afterwards, theauditor will find that the incident began with the postulate to have and is now in a state ofindecision since the explosion is unwanted.Bluntly, any and all aberrative incidents to be discovered in a preclear are a reversal ofhavingness where the preclear did not want something and had to have it or wanted somethingand could not have it or wanted something and got something else.The entire problem of the future is the problem of goals. The entire problem of goals isthe problem of possession. The entire problem of possession is the problem of time.Time is impossible without possession of objects.Thus is resolved one of the weightier problems of the human mind. The auditor mayfind it difficult to encompass this principle, since time may continue to exist for him as anentity, an unknown and hovering thing. If he will use the principle that the past is had or didnot have, that the present is has or does not have and that the future is will have or will nothave, and that past, present and future are divided and established entirely by desire,enforcement and inhibition of havingness, he will find his preclear recovering swiftly. UniversesA universe is defined as a “whole system of created things.” There could be, and are,many universes, and there could be many kinds of universes: we are for our purposes hereinterested in two particular universes. The first of these is the Mest universe, that agreed uponreality of matter, energy, space and time which we use as anchor points and through which wecommunicate. The other is our personal universe which is no less a matter of energy and space. These two universes are entirely distinct and it could be said that the principal confusionand aberration of the individual stems from his having confused one for the other. Where thesetwo universes have crossed, in the mind of the individual, we find a confusion of control andownership for the reason that the two universes do not behave alike.18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Whereas each one of these universes was apparently founded on the same modusoperandi as any other universe, which is to say, the creation of space by putting out anchorpoints, the formation of forms by combinations of dimension points, the Mest universe andone’s own universe do not behave similarly for him.One’s own universe is amenable to instantaneous creation and destruction, by himselfand without argument. He can create space and bring it into a “permanent status.” He can createand combine forms in that space and cause those forms to go into motion and he can make thatmotion continuously automatic or he can regulate it sporadically or he can regulate it totally,and all by postulate. One’s envisionment of one’s own universe is intensely clear. The realityof one’s own universe is sharper and brighter, if anything, than his reality on the Mestuniverse. We call one’s attitude towards his own universe “actuality,” and his attitude towardsthe Mest universe, since it is based upon agreement, “reality.”Unless an individual is at a very high operating level, he conceives it necessary to usephysical force and to apply MEST universe forces to MEST universe forces in order to getaction, motion and new forms. His activity in the MEST universe is an activity of handlingenergy and his ability to exist in the Mest universe is conditional upon his ability to use force.The MEST universe is essentially a force universe, a fact which is, incidentally, antipathetic tomost thetans. One’s ability to handle the MEST universe is conditional upon his not abdicatingfrom his right to use force, right to give orders, his right to punish, his right to administerpersonal justice, and so forth. We are presented in the MEST universe with a crude and brutalscene wherein gigantic forces are in pressure against gigantic forces and where the end of allseems but destruction. Paradoxically, in the MEST universe, destruction of form only ispossible, since by the law of the conservation of energy, the destruction of actual materialobjects is impossible, only conversion being attainable.In the MEST universe ethics seem to be a liability, honesty is all but impossible savewhen armed with force of vast magnitude. Only the strong can afford to be ethical, and yet theuse of strength begets but the use of strength. In the MEST universe we are confronted withparadoxes upon paradoxes where behavior is concerned, for behavior in the MEST universe isregulated by stimulus-response and not by analytical thought or reason. The MEST universedemands of us complete and utter obedience and agreement on the penalty of extermination, yetwhen one has agreed entirely with the MEST universe he finds himself unable to perceive itwith clarity.In one’s own universe, on the other hand, honesty, ethics, happiness, good behavior,justice, all become possible.It is one of the operations of the MEST universe that it is a jealous universe and thosewho are thoroughly imbued with the principles of the MEST universe have even as their bestefforts the goal of eradicating one’s own universe. A control operation begins early in the lifeof almost every man, whereby his imagination is condemned. His own universe is notimaginary, but it may be said to be so and if his imagination is condemned, then he loses hisability to garnish the hardness and brutality of the MEST universe with hopes and dreams.When he loses this he becomes a slave of the MEST universe, and as a slave he perishes. Hisroad to immortality lies, then, in another direction than in the complete subservient agreementwith the MEST universe and the handling and conversion of its forces. This is a matter whichhas been subjected continuously to test and it is intensely surprising to people to discover thatthe rehabilitation of their creative ability, their own space, their own images, rehabilitates aswell their ability to confront the MEST universe with a strong and ethical face.Creative processing, especially where it divorces all thought from thought of the MESTuniverse and follows out along a line of the rehabilitation of one’s own universe withoutattention to the MEST universe, is one level of processing which produces magnificent resultsand which is a standby in any case, no matter how difficult.On the other hand, the rehabilitation of the MEST universe itself, in the concept of theindividual, accomplishes a very great deal in processing, and could be said to compare with therehabilitation of one’s own universe; but the rehabilitation of one’s ability to perceive theMEST universe is dependent upon his ability to perceive present time and the rehabilitation of19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"that ability. Dwelling upon the MEST universe past or its future is fruitless, thinking about theMEST universe, attempting to predict the MEST universe, planning to reorganize and handlethe MEST universe, all defeat one’s ability to handle the MEST universe. When he simplybegins to perceive the MEST universe in present time and to examine that which he sees, withthe idea that he can be what he sees, he loses all fear of the MEST universe.There is a differentiation process in one’s own universe, a differentiation processexclusively for the MEST universe and a differentiation process which pulls apart one’s ownuniverse and the MEST universe.The first of these processes simply goes about reconstructing one’s own universe withno attention to the MEST universe. The second causes the individual to contact the MESTuniverse present time and to observe that present time continuously. The third differentiatesbetween the MEST universe and one’s own universe and consists of “mocking-up” one’s ownuniverse duplicate of every MEST universe object he can perceive, and then actually comparingthese one against the other.Creating space and mocking-up items in it is the rehabilitation of one’s own universeand is a primary process. Differentiating between two similar objects in the MEST universe such as two books,two chairs, two spaces, with one’s MEST eyesight, accomplishes much in being able to faceand handle the MEST universe.The mocking-up of MEST universe duplicates, which is to say constructing a universeparallel to the MEST universe, is the mechanism by which facsimiles (following) are made andthis process brings under control the mechanisms which make facsimiles.The original definition of Scientology 8-8008 was the attainment of infinity by thereduction of the apparent infinity and power of the MEST universe to a zero for himself, andthe increase of the apparent zero of one’s own universe to an infinity for oneself. This is anideal and theoretical process, it is not necessarily attainable in actuality or reality but it very wellmay be. It can be seen that infinity stood upright makes the number eight: thus, Scientology 8-8008 is not just another number, but serves to fix into the mind of the individual a route bywhich he can rehabilitate himself, his abilities, his ethics and his goals. TerminalsAt every turn in the examination of the MEST universe we discover that it is a two-terminal universe. In the manufacture of electricity it is necessary to have two terminals. Inorder to have an opinion evaluated, it is necessary to have an opinion against which the firstcan be evaluated. A datum can be understood in the MEST universe only when it is comparedto a datum of comparable magnitude. This is two terminals operating in terms of thought. TwoMEST universe terminals which are similar, placed side by side will discharge to some degreeagainst each other. This is observable in gravity as well as in electricity.A primary difference between the MEST universe and one’s own universe is that one’sown universe is not a two-terminal universe necessarily. One can mock up in one’s ownuniverse two terminals which will discharge against each other, but he can also at will mock uptwo terminals which are identical which will not discharge against each other.There are a number of processes which could include double terminals. One terminalmade to face another terminal (in terms of mock-up) can be discharged one against the other insuch a way as to relieve aberration connected with things similar to the terminal thus mockedup. However, these two terminals do not furnish a double terminal of a communication line. Acommunication line is more important than a communication point. Thus, if one wished todischarge anything, he would desire to discharge the communication line. The MEST universeis intensely dependent upon communication lines rather than communication terminals. Onetakes two pairs of such terminals then, and standing them in relationship to each other,20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"discovers that he has now four terminals but these four terminals furnish only two lines. Thesetwo lines will discharge one against the other.This, as a limited process, should not be continued very long. It is of greatest interest inrendering assistance after an accident where it is only necessary to mock up the accident twice,or indeed, to mock up something similar to an injured limb, to have the pain and discomfortand aberration discharged. Should one burn one’s fingers, it is necessary only to mock up hisfingers twice side by side and then twice again, making four mock ups with twocommunication lines, to have the pain in the finger subside. The mock-ups discharge at thesame time as one’s injured finger re-experiences the incident. This manifestation is themanifestation of the MEST universe, it is not a manifestation of one’s own universe and ifpracticed over a long period of time is essentially an agreement with the MEST universe, athing which should be avoided; thus it is a limited process.A terminal is, in essence, any point of no form or any form or dimension from whichenergy can flow or by which energy can be received. A viewpoint then, is a sort of terminal,but a terminal must have a particle in order to do automatic interchanges and one finds that aviewpoint can be affected by the MEST universe only when the viewpoint has identified itselfwith some MEST universe article, such as a body. The rehabilitation of the viewpoint’s abilityto be, or not be, at will is essential in order that a viewpoint be self-determined about what isaffecting him and what is not affecting him. This depends, of course then, upon what aviewpoint identifies himself with and depends upon the ability of the viewpoint to unidentifyhimself rapidly.Terminals are anywhere in the MEST universe and can be manufactured, of course, inone’s own universe. The difference is that any bit of solid, even on the level of an electron inthe MEST universe, is, willy-nilly, a terminal; it is affected in certain ways, whether it likes itor not. Any particle in any object or any flow of energy is in itself a terminal. A terminal can beaffected by any other terminal or can affect, to some degree, other terminals.This cross-relationship of terminals in the MEST universe is MEST universecommunication. In one’s own universe a flow is not necessary for the production of energy orpotentials.It is one of the sources of aberration that the scarcity of things in the MEST universecauses one to own only one of things; this is aberrative, since that one can gather into itselfcharges which are not discharged since there is nothing immediately similar to it. If one ownedtwo of everything he had and if these two things were nearly identical, he would find that hisworry and concern about these objects was greatly decreased. A child, for instance, shouldhave two dolls alike, not simply one doll. The reason for this is that two terminals willdischarge, one against the other. The thetan is capable of mocking himself up to be exactly likeeverything he sees. As a matter of fact, whatever a thetan can see, he can be. Thus, the thetanmakes himself into a terminal for everything he sees whenever there is an absence of aduplicate. Thus the thetan is in the danger of having everything in the MEST universedischarging against him the moment he alters his relationship to the MEST universe, This fixeshim in the belief that he cannot alter his relationship to the MEST universe. Actually he is ratherrapidly disabused of this conception by processing. It is rather interesting to “double-terminal”in mock-up form the childhood toys of an individual. He will find there is an enormous amountof charge simply in the fact that these toys were made out of MEST. The favorite doll has agravitic influence upon him.Completely aside from the terminals one finds in an electric motor and which produceso much current by reason of being separated by the base of the motor, the subject of terminalsgoes into behavior and explains in a great measure behavior on a stimulus-response basis in theMEST universe. Indeed, it could be said that the MEST universe came into being by oneterminal demanding attention from another terminal and these two terminals thereafter facingeach other continuing a discharge one to the other. With very aberrated people, one cannot longdiscuss things with them without getting the manifestation of terminals, for the very aberratedfix on a terminal easily.21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"It could be said that the MEST universe is the average of agreement amongstviewpoints and that the laws of the MEST universe, no matter how physical, are the result ofthis agreement; and, indeed, this definition suffices for those conditions which are supposed tobe “reality.” The MEST universe is very real, but any hypnotist can instruct a hypnotizedsubject into the construction of a universe which has tactile, sight, sound and any othermanifestation possessed by the MEST universe, and who is to say then, that the hypnotizedsubject is not perceiving a universe? For one’s own perception of the MEST universe consistsof his placing an object in proximity to or against another object, and both of these objects arefound to be objects of the MEST universe. This is overlooked by individuals when they, forinstance, strike a desk with their fist. It is the favorite declaration of the materialist (thatindividual who is in a frantic state of insistence upon the existence of the MEST universe) that“this is real.” The effects he is creating are being created by a hand that is made out of MESTon an object which is MEST. The individual has overlooked the fact that the hand with whichhe is doing the pounding is itself MEST and that his knowledge of that hand is actually nomore than his perception of it. This is a problem in two terminals. Behavior of UniversesIt could be said, then, that the difference between the microcosm (one’s own universe)and the macrocosm (the MEST universe) is the difference between commanding it and agreeingabout it. One’s own universe is what he would construct for a universe without the oppositionor the confusion of other viewpoints. The MEST universe is that upon which one agrees inorder to continue in association with other viewpoints. This may very well be the soledifference between these two universes.This is exemplified by one’s behavior-attitude in his own universe as compared withhis behavior-attitude in the MEST universe. In one’s own universe, the individual expansivelyplans and devises (once he is fairly confident of it) along the lines of beauty and happiness. Inthe MEST universe, even when one has been rehabilitated to some degree, one’s attitude stillmust consist of a certain amount of watchfulness and co-operation.One’s universe is an unthwarted sway, the MEST universe is a compromise. When onehas compromised too long and too often, when he has been betrayed and ridiculed and is nolonger able to create what he believes to be desirable, he descends down to lower levels and inthose levels, he is still more compelled to face the MEST universe, and as such, loses muchmore of his ability to handle the MEST universe. When an individual’s ability to create his ownuniverse is rehabilitated it will be found, strangely enough, that his ability to handle the MESTuniverse has been rehabilitated. In fact, this is the most secure route as represented in 8-8008as a road.By actual experiment it can be demonstrated that one’s ability to mock-up a universe ofhis own and the resulting improvement of his perceptions to that universe bring about an abilityto perceive the MEST universe. Indeed, it might be inferred as something like a proof that theMEST universe in itself is an illusion based upon agreement in view of the fact that therehabilitation of the ability to view illusion rehabilitates the ability to view the MEST universe.Thought Emotion and EffortThought is the highest level attainable. It is of two varieties; one is clear thoughtestablished by will which is from 10.0 up on the tone-scale, to well above 40.0; the other isthought established by counter-efforts as in homo sapiens and governed entirely on a stimulus-response basis. The first could be called self-determined thought; the second could be calledreactive thought.Self-determined thought expresses itself as will and consists of the making ofpostulates based on evaluations and conclusions. Will does not exist in time when it is at thislevel. Homo sapiens’ will, as Schopenhauer once remarked, is stubbornness taking the placeof the intellect. Will-power in homo sapiens is most ordinarily demon-circuit power. Free from22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"the body and its ridges which themselves contain stimulus-response thought, the thetan canchange his postulates by making new evaluations and conclusions, and can express his willdirectly. It is very difficult for a thetan inside the head and confronted by the stimulus-responseridges of the body, to do other than obey these stimulus-response flows in agreement with theMEST universe.Ideas are invariably and inevitably senior to force and action, if those ideas stem fromself-determined thought. Ideas born out of stimulus-response thought bear at times an almostindistinguishable similarity to self-determined ideas, but are occasioned by associative logic. Inhomo sapiens, it is quite common for the person to believe himself incapable of originality.This is because the MEST universe will brook no competitor. Operating on a highly self-determined plane, originality is a simple thing to attain. What is called will-power, then, couldhave two manifestations: the first would be actual self-determined thought; the second wouldbe a result of an enforced or inhibited thought. When homo sapiens attempts to exercise hiswill-power, he normally brings into flow the ridges around the body and is nullified by themand is pressed into aberrated behavior.Ideas, when in the form of self-determined thought, exist above the level of 40.0 on thetone-scale and extend down into the action band.Ideas of the stimulus-response variety are occasioned by experience as held andcontained in facsimiles and are actually dictated to homo sapiens by circuits.Postulate processing is that processing which addresses the postulates, evaluations andconclusions of the preclear at the level of self-determined thought, yet postulate processing hassome value when addressed to stimulus-response ideas. Postulate processing is the primaryand highest method of processing a thetan. With creative processing, it constitutes Scientology8-8008.Emotion, as known to homo sapiens, extends from slightly above 4.0 down to 0.0,and depends upon the wave characteristic.Effort is an even lower level manifestation than emotion.Matter would be the lower effort band. FacsimilesThe best description of facsimiles is to be found in Electropsychometric Auditing. Afacsimile is an energy picture which can be reviewed again.Facsimiles can disperse or flow when addressed by new energy, either exterior to thethetan or from the thetan. Thus the environment can set a facsimile into action or the thetan canset it into action. Homo sapiens is most normally controlled by directing energy at hisfacsimiles and setting them into action so as to cause him to dramatize facsimiles and trainingpatterns.Facsimiles are normally found to be fixed in large number upon ridges.A facsimile contains more than fifty easily identified perceptions. It also containsemotion and thought.There are many methods of processing facsimiles. Assist ProcessingAn “assist” is the processing given to a recently injured human being or thetan in orderto relieve the stress of live energy which is holding the injury in suspension. The directrunning-out of the energy contained in the recent facsimile is done by continually running23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"through the incident as though it were just that moment happening to the preclear andrecovering from it all his desire to have it and to not have it. And when this has been done to anextent where the energy is desensitized and the injury less painful, the preclear is led to handleit as energy, placing it in different places and times and reversing it and doing other things withit.The assist is very important, as it can cause an injury to resolve or a person to recoverin a fraction of the time which would otherwise be required and, in many cases, it may save thelife of the individual and has done so many times in the past. The auditor must know facsimileprocessing primarily to run an assist and in order to know more about the anatomy of thehuman mind.As noted earlier under Terminals, an assist can be rendered by mocking-up the injuredpart or the scene of injury as two terminals and holding or recreating these mock-ups until theinjury abates. While doing this it will be noted particularly that the mock-ups are at firstuncontrollable in most cases and then become much more easily controlled. The uncontrollablefactor of the mock-ups is answered by this; whenever a pair of mock-ups or a single mock-upmisbehaves, which is to say, acts without the specific command of the person getting themock-up, the person doing the mock-up should simply abandon the pair or single mock-up andput into its place again one which is doing what he wants it to do; in other words, a disobedientmock-up or pair of mock-ups is either put away or moved to the right or left or forced intocontrol, and in its place the individual simply puts a mock-up which is obedient to his control.An auditor should be careful on this point, for an individual getting mock-ups will strain andworry and eventually discover, he thinks, that it is impossible for him to control his mock-ups.Using effort to control one’s mock-ups is of little avail; one simply creates them. Wheremock-ups are absent, one will appear if the individual will simply keep putting the thoughtforward that it will appear. If he puts forward the thought often enough and long enough, hewill get such a mock-up. Where he can get only one of a pair of mock-ups, if he will keepputting the second one in it will eventually appear. What one is facing in double terminallinghere is so much charge on a single subject that the charge dissipates the mock-up before themock-up can be adequately perceived. No matter how briefly, when an individual has said amock-up will be there a mock-up has appeared; that it has disappeared promptly does not meanthat he cannot put a second mock-up there. Particular attention should be given to this in assistsbecause an assist is essentially dealing with an injured member or a scene which contains pain.In double-terminalling assists it will be found that the preclear becomes ill or in pain inspite of how innocent he may feel it is to hold two terminals out in front of him. The remedyfor this is simply to hold the two terminals (or replace them if they disappear or misbehave)until the illness or feeling has abated.One can handle worries in this fashion. One simply puts up one worry and thenduplicates it facing itself out in front of him and the thought discharges against the thought untilthe worry and the emotion connected with the worry disappear. Thought, emotion, and effortcan be dissipated by double-terminalling in this fashion. It is again remarked that this is alimited technique and should not be continued endlessly as an end in itself. Thirty or fortyhours of double-terminalling is much more than enough. The route pointed out by Scientology8-8008 is a better route than double-terminalling. Double-terminalling is relegated to the levelof assist and changing one’s state of mind. Double-terminalling doubt against doubtundermines and gets at the bottom of every circuit; thus, it, as a technique, should not beentirely neglected.Cycle of ActionA cycle of action is dependent for its magnitude upon a cycle of havingness. Because itis a cycle of havingness and beingness and doingness, it is generally viewed as a cycle of time,but, as we have seen, time is an abstract term to describe havingness.The beginning and ending of a cycle depends upon the state of havingness. A cyclestarts with not-havingness, continues through increased havingness, continues then in changed24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"havingness and ends with no-havingness. These conditions of havingness bring about anillusion of time. Where a person does not possess anything, he does not conceive himself tohave any time. Thus earlier parts of the track are lost to an individual since he has no time inthem, for he has no possession in them.The most basic description of this should be in terms of havingness, but the cycle canalso be stated more abstractly in terms as follows: creation, growth, conservation, decay anddeath or destruction. This would be the cycle of any object; it would also be the cycle of actionas it pertained to an object in the MEST universe.A cycle of action is not necessarily fixed for all universes. It is common to the MEST universe. There is no reason why in some universe the cycleshould not run from decayed havingness into growth, but in the MEST universe it never does,except through the point of not-havingness, death or destruction.A cycle of action can also be stated in another way, and this in terms of energy action.Motion is characterized by only three conditions, and all motion is part of the gradient scale ofthese three conditions. These conditions are: start, change and stop. This compares to creation,alteration and destruction in terms of experience.In the “last 76 trillion years” the preclear has lived through “spirals.” These spirals wereat first very long and then shortened each time until the present spiral for most is about 40,000years as compared with the initial spiral of 100 million years. Thus one can also plot themagnitude of havingness of the individual for each one of these spirals. A spiral is not unlike alife. A life is lived in a cycle of action. A past life is generally obscured because one does nothave the body of that life and conceives himself to have now another identity and is notconnected to the last life by a havingness. He is, however, definitely connected to his last livesby the facsimiles of those lives which he now ignores.Past havingness, present havingness and future havingness mark past beingness,present beingness and future beingness and also past action, present action and future action.The past, present and future are established by havingness, but havingness, doingness andbeingness alike should be processed as intimately connected in this cycle of action.The condition of the body itself and its position on the cycle of action as applied to thecurrent life establishes to a large degree the preclear’s attitude toward processing. He will reacttoward processing much in the manner dictated by the condition of the body and its position onthe cycle. The body goes through the stages of creation, growth, conservation, decay anddeath.A person in his middle years desires no change and may be difficult to process for thatreason, since the auditor is seeking to attain change. A person in the later cycle area will runonly succumb material and will actually make an effort to succumb through processing. Hisincidents are commonly those of grief and loss since these are the manifestations of havingnessin decay. He has no hopes of having before him and all of his havingness ordinarily no longerwith him from the past.The thetan going on the wider cycle of the spiral is discovered early on the spiral to bein a high state of creativeness, a little later to be intent upon a growth of havingness, a little laterattempting to change to avoid conserving, a little later to be conserving, and then to be intentonly on decay and dying, and finally upon death itself. The auditor should differentiate verysharply between the cycle of the spiral as applying to the thetan and the cycle of a lifetime. Hemay find a very young person who is yet on the later part of a spiral. The body of the youngperson is still in the state of growth and apparently the person’s life should be hopeful of muchhaving. Yet the behavior of the person in general is directed almost uniformly towardssuccumbing. When the thetan is exteriorized from the body, he is found to be listless andcertain of the approaching end. He believes that he will be finished entirely at the end of thisspiral. He is not normally aware of the fact that he will have another spiral after this; or, if heis, he thinks it will be a shorter spiral -- which it will be; but this can be remedied by postulateprocessing. 25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Related ExperiencesThere is a table of relationships which the auditor must have.

Association or similarity is a condition which exists from the upper tothe very low range of the scale. And identification is at the bottom of the scale.The condition of the preclear can be established readily by his ability to associate. Hecan, however, associate much too well. Association is the essence of logic. Logic is thegradient scale of relating facts one to another. As logic reaches the lower part of the scale, thisrelationship becomes finer and finer until at last identification is reached and thought could beexpressed in terms of A = A = A = A.An excellent rendition of this -- although one not related workably to experience andwhich did not have with it a truly workable therapy -- is to be found in general semantics in thebook Science and Sanity by Alfred Korzybski. Insanity is the inability to associate ordifferentiate properly. Experience itself becomes ungovernable at the lowest depth of identity.The more fixed the identity of the person may be, the less the experience of which he iscapable. Fame has at its end a completely fixed identification which is timeless, but whichunfortunately is matter and which equally unfortunately, is inaction.The widest possible differentiation exists at the moment of creation. At this moment,one is committed to a cycle of action which, as it continues, is less and less governable byhimself and is more and more governed by his environment. As his degree of havingnessincreases, he is increasingly governed by what he has had and what he has, and this determineswhat he will have which, of course, is less freedom, less individuality and more havingness.Association expresses itself in the preclear in terms of the way he thinks. When hereaches a low level of association, he supposes himself to be thinking connectedly, but isactually thinking in a completely disassociated fashion, for he identifies facts with other factswhich should not be identified. The actions of a man about to die or in extreme fear are notsane. Identification brings as its manifestation a solidity to all things including thought. Theauditor who processes a preclear very low on the tone-scale who is neurotic or psychotic willreadily discover that thoughts are objects to this preclear and that time itself is a matter ofenormous concern to the preclear in many cases. Thoughts and incidents and symbols areobjects. This is commonly seen in the society in the matter of over-concern about words. Aperson who has sunk low enough on the tone-scale so that words have become objects andmust be handled as such, and exist without any real relationship to ideas, will stop a flow ofideas by an outrage of his word sense which, if he is low on the tone-scale, is easily outraged.Differentiation, association and identification belong, rightly, on the tone-scale, and canbe processed as part of the scale above. But they are a close gauge of thought itself and ofideas. An adequate tone-scale can be drawn for any individual using only the above threewords.The auditor will very often find an individual who is intensely logical and quite brilliantwho is yet very difficult to process. This person has agreed with the MEST universe to such adegree that his association has assumed the proportions of near-solidity; the facsimiles andridges of this individual have become much too solid and are consequently quite difficult toprocess. This condition of solidity may refer only to the body of the preclear which itself isold, and it may be found that the thetan -- the preclear himself -- is quite vital and capable ofwide differentiation, but that this differentiation is being grossly limited by the ridges andfacsimiles which surround the body. Such bodies have a heavy appearance. It requires anenormously powerful thetan to handle them in spite of the solidity of the ridges surrounding thebody.Mathematics could be said to be the abstract art of symbolizing associations.Mathematics pretends to deal in equalities but equalities themselves do not exist in the MEST27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"universe, and can exist only conceptually in any universe. Mathematics are a general method ofbringing to the fore associations which might not be perceived readily without their use. Thehuman mind is a servo-mechanism to all mathematics. Mathematics can abstractly form by theirmechanics coincidences and differences outside the field of experience in any universe and areenormously useful. They can best be used when considered to be a shorthand of experienceand in the light that they can symbolize what is beyond actuality. The essence of mathematicslies in differentiation, association, identification, which is to say, equalities must not be viewedas fixed in the real universe. Absolutes are unobtainable in experience but may be symbolizedby mathematics.LogicLogic is a gradient scale of association of facts of greater or lesser similarity made toresolve some problem of the past, present or future, but mainly to resolve and predict thefuture. Logic is the combination of factors into an answer. The mission of the analytical mindwhen it thinks, is to observe and predict by the observation of results. Easily the best way todo this is to be the objects one is observing: thus, one can know their condition completely.However, if one is not sufficiently up the scale to be these objects it is necessary to assumewhat they are. This assumption of what they are, the postulating of a symbol to represent theobjects and the combination of these symbols when evaluated against past experience or“known law,” bring about logic. The genesis of logic may be said to be an interchange of two viewpoints, via otherdimension points by which one of the viewpoints holds the attention (one of the most valuablecommodities in the universe) of the other viewpoint by being “logical” about why thatviewpoint should continue to look. The basis of logic is “it is bad over there” or “there is ahidden influence which you cannot estimate but which we will try to estimate,” “therefore, youshould continue to look towards me.” At its best, logic is rationalism, for all logic is basedupon the somewhat idiotic circumstance that a being that is immortal is trying to survive.Survival is a condition susceptible to non-survival. If one is “surviving,” one is at the samemoment admitting that one can cease to survive, otherwise one would never strive to survive.An immortal being striving to survive presents immediately a paradox. An immortal being mustbe persuaded that he can not survive or that he is not or might become not, before he wouldpay any attention to logic. By logic, he can then estimate the future. Probably the only reasonhe would want to estimate the MEST universe, aside from amusement, is to keep alive in it, orto maintain something in a state of life in it.Logic and survival are intimate, but it must be remembered that if one is worried abouthis own survival and is striving for his own survival, he is striving for the survival of animmortal being. Bodies are transient, but bodies are an illusion. One could bring himself up thetone-scale to a point where he could create an imperishable body with ease.It is interesting that those people who are the most logical are those people who inprocessing have to know before they are. When they are sent somewhere, they want to knowwhat is there before they get there. There would be no point in going there if they knew, and ifeveryone knew what was there before they went there. Yet they will attempt to predict what isgoing to happen there and what is there by knowing. This knowingness is in terms of data andshould not be confused with knowingness in terms of actual beingness. Logic is the use of data to produce knowingness; as such it is very junior to knowingsomething by being it.If you were to double-terminal an individual who is customarily very logical, his bodyfacing his body in terms of mock-up and each of the terminals being very logical, a surprisingviolence of interchange would take place. This is because logic is mainly aberration. The workwhich lies before you is a discussion of beingness and is the track of agreement which becameevidently the MEST universe. Therefore this work appears to be logical but it appears also tobe the central thread of logic.28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Apparently, these conclusions were reached by logic; they were not, they were reachedby observation and by induction. That when tested they proved themselves in terms ofbehavior demonstrates not that they are logical, but that they are, at least to a large extent, adiscussion of beingness. Scientific logic and mathematical logic have the frailty of trying tofind out what is there before one goes there. One cannot ever be, if he has to know a datumabout the beingness first. If one is afraid to be, one will become, of course, logical. This is noeffort to be abusive upon the subject of logic or mathematics, it is only necessary at this pointto indicate a certain difference between what lies before you and a logical arrangement ofassumption. Patterns of EnergyEnergy forms into many patterns. The geometry of this formation would make anintensely interesting study. The patterns, however, are formed by postulates and have no otherexistence.The patterns of energy are viewed by the thetan in terms of pressors, tractors,explosions, implosions, pressor ridges, tractor ridges, pressor-tractor ridges, and balls andsheets.The pressor is a beam which can be put out by a thetan which acts as a stick and withwhich one can thrust oneself away or thrust things away. The pressor beam can be lengthenedand, in lengthening, pushes away. A tractor beam is put out by a thetan in order to pull things toward him. The tractorbeam is an energy flow which the thetan shortens. If one placed a flashlight beam upon a walland then, by manipulating the beam, brought the wall closer to him by it, he would have theaction of a tractor beam. Tractor beams are used to extract perceptions from a body by a thetan.Pressor beams are used to direct action. Tractors and pressors commonly exist together, withthe tractor as a loop outside the pressor. The two together stabilize one another.An explosion is an outflow of energy usually violent but not necessarily so, from amore or less common source point.An implosion could be likened to the collapse of a field of energy such as a spheretoward a common center point, making an inflow. It can happen with the same violence as anexplosion, but does not necessarily do so.A pressor ridge would be that ridge formed by two or more pressor beams operatingagainst each other in conflict.A tractor ridge would be that ridge formed by two tractor beams in conflict operatingagainst each other.A pressor-tractor ridge would be a combination of pressor-tractor flows in sufficientcollisions as to form a solidification of energy.A ridge is a solid body of energy caused by various flows and dispersals which has aduration longer than the duration of flow. Any piece of matter could be considered to be a ridgein its last stage. Ridges, however, exist in suspension around a person and are the foundationupon which facsimiles are built.Two explosions operating against each other may form a ridge.Two implosions operating away from each other may form a ridge. An explosion andan implosion operating together -- or many explosions and implosions operating together --may form a ridge.These manifestations of energy are used in handling energy, either in processing or inaction. 29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Black and WhiteBlack and white are the two extreme manifestations of perception on the part of thepreclear.The thetan perceives best his own energy, but when he perceives energy he desires toperceive it in white or in color. Color is a breakdown of whiteness. Seeing whiteness or color,the thetan is able to discern and differentiate between objects, actions and spatial dimensions.Energy can also manifest itself as blackness. A space containing black energy would beblack, but a black space may be a space existing only without energy in it. This point ofidentification is quite aberrative, and drills to permit the thetan to handle blackness aremandatory in processing. If one remembers one’s fear of blackness when a child, and that evilis represented as blackness, one will see the necessity for doing this. Blackness is theunknown, for it may contain energy or it may be empty or may be black energy.Black energy flows are common on the tone-scale of wavelengths. There is, forinstance, what is known as the black band of sound.Some thetans will not perceive anything at all because they conceive themselves to besurrounded by blackness and are not sure whether the blackness has substance or is simplyempty, and they have a timidity to discover which. Such a case is resolved by making the casedrill with blackness until blackness can be turned on and off and located in time and space.Although this is briefly mentioned, it is a point of the largest importance.Black and white running and black and white aesthetic running were old processeswhich are not necessarily vital today to processing. However, white energy runs easily, andwhere the preclear has a black spot of energy somewhere on an organ or somewhere in theenvironment of the body, the auditor asks him to turn it white in order to let it flow away. Itmay not flow away if it is black, either because it does not belong to the preclear (in which casehe would see it as black) or because it is simply a spot of space with which he is not familiar.By turning it white he is able to handle it for he now knows it to be filled with his own energy.One can run own determinism, other determinism, as concepts. In this case the preclearruns the one as long as he gets an area white and then runs the other to continue its whiteness.In such a way all the energy in the area is drained away.The most common manifestation of a ridge is to have one side of a ridge white and theother side black. This is because the preclear conceives one side of it to have on it his ownenergy and the other side to have on it energy belonging to another. By running the conceptthat it is his own and then running the concept that it is another’s, one runs both sides of aridge, if he is running ridges.Although live energy is generally conceived to be white, it can also be black. In runninga preclear with an E-meter, it will be discovered as long as a flow is white and as long as aflow is running, that the needle will gradually rise. When a point of blackness appears in thefield, the needle will halt and either will not rise again or will flick as the preclear gets asomatic. This flick is characteristic of the somatic. The stuck needle is characteristic of a blackfield. The auditor can sit watching a needle and be able to tell the preclear whenever the preclearhas had a black area appear in the field. It is notable that somatics only occur in the presence ofa black patch. This means that the unknown characteristic of the blackness is something thepreclear has been holding away from him so as not to have it or that black wave energy is thatenergy used to impress pain. The latter case is the more probable although a great deal of workmust be done upon this to establish beyond doubt the manifestation of blackness.A preclear who cannot see color in his facsimiles, cannot see it because he is unable touse energy with which to perceive. He will see things in terms of blackness or whiteness. He may be able to get black and white or he may be able to get only blackness. In thelatter case he finds blackness in some way profitable and desirable; and running the concept of30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"havingness, will have and have had blackness, and using drills in handling blackness --moving it from space to space in the environment and moving it into yesterday and tomorrow --will bring about control of blackness on the part of the preclear. PerceptionThe entire subject of perception is the subject of energy. As the preclear goes down thetone-scale, he is less capable of differentiation and is thus less and less capable of handlingenergy and is more and more subject to energy, until at last he will not emanate or handleenergy. Even in the higher ranges of this descent his perception begins to diminish.The rehabilitation of perception is essentially the rehabilitation of force. Force isrehabilitated by rehabilitating the control of energy. This is done by ARC processing and inmany other ways. The chief way in which this is done is by establishing the preclear’s ability,by creative processing, to handle blackness.An entire science called perceptics can easily be constructed and is mentioned in theoriginal thesis (1948).The rehabilitation of sight in the blind, hearing in the deaf, the ability to speak,anaesthesia of the body or body areas or the genital organs, depends upon the rehabilitation ofthe preclear’s ability to handle energy. Creative processing, with particular attention to handlingblackness, is essential in this process. ForceIn the axioms, force is defined as random effort. Effort is defined as directed force.Force is essentially measured effort. It is quite common for individuals to be soprotesting at what the MEST universe is doing that they abandon any and all force and, if askedto reassume force or use it, suppose that one is asking them to condone and assumepunishment and destruction since these in the MEST universe are done with heavy quantities offorce. There is, however, a gradient scale of force, for any energy manifestation may be calledforce. Even matter contains force.For the purposes of processing, in order to avoid upsetting the preclear, who usuallyhas very bad connotations with the word force, the auditor stresses instead the “handling ofenergy.”The use of energy would encompass any activity having to do with energy or matter. ResponsibilityThe responsibility level of the preclear depends upon his willingness or unwillingnessto handle energy. That preclear who is protesting against energy in any direction is abandoningresponsibility in greater or lesser degree.One obtains randomity (see Axioms) by abandoning responsibility in some sphere. Hewill then find himself in conflict in that sphere.The gradient scale of responsibility is as follows: at 40.0 responsibility manifests itselfas will and can be so pervasive that there is no randomity. This would be full responsibility.At 4.0 responsibility would manifest itself in terms of action where roughly half one’senvironment or space had been selected for randomity and for which one would take noresponsibility. At 20.0 responsibility would be 50 per cent of the total energy existing.31"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"At 4.0 we find homo sapiens in his narrow environment disagreeing by using theemotion of enthusiasm with an existing state of affairs and directing energy toward the rightingof that state of affairs. Even so, responsibility is low at this level.At 2.0 blame enters the tone-scale as a major factor. This is the level of the tone-scalewhere fault is envisioned for the first time. Above this level there is sufficient breadth ofunderstanding to see that interdependencies and randomities can exist without fault and blame.At 2.0, with the emotion of antagonism, an individual is assigning blame for lack ofresponsibility rather than trying to enforce responsibility.At 1.5 blaming is almost the sole activity of the individual, and, while taking no realresponsibility himself, yet he blames all on his environment and does so with violence.At 1.1 one pretends to take some responsibility in order to demonstrate that others are atfault but one has no real responsibility.At 0.9 or around the level of fear, one does not think in terms of responsibility but iswilling to accept all blame in an effort to escape all punishment.At 0.75, grief, the individual blames himself, and accepts the fault for what hasoccurred.At 0.375, apathy, there is no question of either blame or responsibility. At this levelone has become MEST.On the tone-scale in Science of Survival one will find what might be expected to happento materiel and communication and persons in the vicinity of those below 2.0 on the tone-scale.This stems normally from responsibility, or rather, its lack.The keynote of responsibility is the willingness to handle energy. The rehabilitation ofthe thetan in the handling of energy brings about a rise in responsibility. If a person is low onthe tone-scale and still exhibits responsibility, then his energy activity initially must beenormous for any segment of responsibility to exist low on the scale.The processing of responsibility is one of the most vital processes. If one processesresponsibility itself, he can expect sooner or later a theta clear. He would process it bybrackets. There is a condition known as the “glee of insanity.” This is essentially a specializedcase of irresponsibility. A thetan who cannot be killed and yet can be punished, has only oneanswer to those punishing him, and that is to demonstrate to them that he is no longer capableof force or action and is no longer responsible. He therefore states that he is insane, and actsinsane and demonstrates that he cannot possibly harm them as he lacks any further rationality.This is the root and basis of insanity. Insanity is the only escape possible besides death.Death has the value of convincing others that one can no longer be punished or feel. Aslong as one has a body, which can die, there is a limit to the amount he can be hurt. When thereis no body, and there is no limit to the amount he can be hurt, his only answer is this plea ofcomplete irresponsibility which is the “glee of insanity.” This is found as an actual energymanifestation in the vicinity of sanitoria and can be felt as an emanation from the insane.If the preclear is unable to conceive of “being happy about being insane” (which heusually cannot), get him to get the feeling of anticipation for a vacation. This is irresponsibilityin one sense and in actuality, when deepened, becomes the “glee of insanity.”Happiness is the overcoming of not insurmountable obstacles toward the known goalof havingness. Stepping away from this track, feeling that one’s work is too hard, these areforsakings of responsibility. A common method employed by low-toned people to reduce thepower and ability of an individual and so place him under control is to convince him that he istired and overworked. If they can so convince him, they can then get him to take a vacation. Anexamination of an individual who has been subjected to this will show that he was happiest32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"when he was working and that before he “needed a vacation” many people worked on him toconvince him that he should not work so hard, and thus turned what was actually play to himinto work. Society almost demands that a man consider whatever he is doing as work anddemands that he consider work as an unhappy thing. In looking around the society at thosewho gain easily, one finds only people who take a great deal of joy in working and who neverthink in terms of a vacation.To run the bracket on responsibility, one would run the desire on the part of thepreclear to be responsible, his desire not to be responsible, times when he has been forced tobe responsible, times when he has been forced not to be responsible, times when he has beenrestrained from being responsible, times when he has been restrained from being not-responsible, times when he has been sympathized with because of his responsibilities and thenall this as a bracket, the preclear doing it to others and others doing it to others. This run roundand round as brackets produces marked results.The joy of responsibility and the joy of irresponsibility should also be run in terms ofbrackets.This becomes most effective when run in terms of responsibilities of having, theirresponsibilities of having, the responsibilities and irresponsibilities of having had, and of willhave.Before this has been run very long on some individuals, the glee of insanity willmanifest itself and it must be very thoroughly run out. It is often a hectic, uncontrolledlaughter. This should not be confused with line-charge laughter to which it is a cousin; apreclear who starts laughing over the serious things of his past is breaking locks, and can bemade to laugh in this fashion for many hours if the chain reaction is started. The laughter whichaccompanies the “glee of insanity” has no mirth in it whatever.Peculiar to this is what might be called the attitude of MEST. MEST is not responsiblefor anything. That preclear who has as his goal complete irresponsibility has also as his goalbeing complete MEST.MEST has no space of its own, it causes no action except when acted upon, and itowns nothing but is itself owned. Slaves are made by giving them freedom from responsibility.The thetan high on the scale can make space or own space, has wide choices of action,and can create, change or destroy anything he wishes.The Chart of AttitudesIn order to do rising-scale processing (as covered later), the auditor should know verywell his Chart of Attitudes and the reasons underlying each column.SurvivesRight Fully responsibleOwns AllDeadWrong No responsibilityOwns nothingEveryoneAlwaysMotion sourceTruthNobodyNever Stopped HallucinationFaithI knowCauseI amDistrustI know notFull effectI am notWinStart DifferenceBeingLoseStopIdentificationHad This chart on the upper line in each of the above represents from 27.0 to 40.0.

In rising-scalerunning, one seeks the attitude of the preclear nearest to the lowest end of this scale and askshim to do a rising-scale to see how high he can change his postulate toward the upper end ofthe scale.The last line is, of course, a repeat without the intermediate position of the earlierinterdependencies of experience. SurvivalOne of the first principles in the MEST universe, and that principle which, whendiscovered. resolved the problems of the mind, is the lowest common denominator of allMEST universe existence; the goal of life in the MEST universe is survival and only survival.Survival equates behavior in homo sapiens or in any life form. It also covers the widefield of ethics. The principle of survival was never intended to embrace theta itself for this has,of course, immortality and does not even necessarily move in MEST time.Survival is nothing if not dependent upon havingness, action and beingness. It is mostordinarily viewed as the attempt in a life form to persist in a state of existence as long aspossible. Right -- WrongRightness is conceived to be survival. Any action which assists survival along themaximal number of dynamics is considered to be a right action. Any action which is destructivealong the maximal number of dynamics is considered to be wrong. Theoretically, how rightcan one be? Immortal! How wrong can one be? Dead!After a certain point on the tone-scale is reached by the preclear, he will tendinstinctively to seek out and do right actions, but ordinarily homo sapiens is thoroughlyengrossed in being wrong. Social politeness, with its violation of the Code of Honor, is quitenon-survival. It might also be said, How wrong can one be? Human!The accident prone and no-responsibility case in general is so intent on being wrongthat he is incapable of conceiving right.All jurisprudence is built upon the principle that sanity is the ability to differentiate rightfrom wrong. Jurisprudence does not, however, give a definition of either rightness orwrongness. Thus, for the first time with this principle, rules of evidence and other matters inlaw can be established with some accuracy.Absolute rightness, like absolute wrongness, is unobtainable. Rightness andwrongness are alike relative states. Responsibility (See text above.) OwnershipIn view of the fact that time can be conceived to be havingness and in view of the factthat time itself is one of the most puzzling concepts which homo sapiens has ever sought tomaster, the whole question of ownership is subject to grave error, particularly on the part ofhomo sapiens.Discussions in the above text demonstrate that individuality depends upon high-tonelevel and freedom, whereas identity, as such, would be at a complete level of reduction, acondition analogous to MEST.34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"It has long been recognized that “a rich man may as well try to get into Heaven as acamel through the eye of a needle.” The auditor will suddenly discover this truth when he triesto process many rich and successful men. These have carried ownership to such an extent thatthey are themselves thoroughly encased in energy which is solidifying into MEST itself.Instead of having things, they themselves are had by things. Their freedom in motion isenormously reduced, although they have tricked themselves into believing that possession willincrease that freedom.The auditor will find his preclear upset nowhere on the tone-scale as he will on thesubject of ownership. A childhood, for instance, is intensely upset by the subject of ownershipsince the child is given to understand that he owns certain things and is then commanded inevery action he takes with those items. A child cannot have possession, free and clear, ofanything in the average family. He is given shoes and is told to take care of them and ispunished if he does not take care of them although he apparently owns them. He is given toysand is harassed whenever he abuses them. He finally becomes convinced that he owns nothingand yet he is in a state of anxiety about owning things. Therefore he will try to possess manythings and will completely overestimate or underestimate the value of what he has. The auditingof childhood ownership is a fruitful field for the auditor.That preclear who is upset on the subject of time, even faintly, is, and has been,enormously upset on the subject of ownership, since havingness and its manifestations arethemselves the MEST universe trick of giving us an illusion of time. Everyone -- Nobody (See material above on Identity versus Individuality.)It may be confusing to the preclear that being everybody can be conceived at both endsof the tone-scale. The difference is that at the bottom end of the scale, the preclear is making themistake of considering the “somebodies” around him as MEST. He can be their MESTidentities. At the top of the scale, while still retaining his own identity, he can be anyone’sidentity but this is on a theta level and is disassociated from MEST. That preclear who goesaround believing he is other people is usually at the bottom end of the tone scale and hasconfused his own body with the bodies he sees because he does not have a proper view of hisown body and so can easily mistake it for the bodies of others.When an individual is low on the tone-scale, he easily does a life continuum for othersbecause he himself is so encased in MEST and so poorly recognizes his own identity that hecan conceive himself to be anyone without knowing what he has done.The question of valences and life continuums is difficult to resolve in direct ratio thatthe preclear conceives himself to be MEST.MEST, lacking the ability to create space and to produce directive action is, of course,nobody. When a man is convinced he is a nobody he has been convinced at the same time thathe is MEST. Always -- NeverWe have already seen that objects give us the illusion of time. The ability to createobjects is interchangeable with the ability to have an actual forever.There would be an illusory forever which would be dependent upon the duration of anobject and its apparent solidity. One might also say that the MEST universe seeks to own oneby pretending that immortality is something difficult to buy and is only purchased by achievingan identity or being an object. The ultimate in this is, of course, being a part of the MESTuniverse. One might say jocularly that every planet in the MEST universe was once one ormore people. A considerable reaction can be got from a preclear by making him conceive afeeling of devotion toward the “older” gods who were here and who built this universe and35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"who have left it to him. Deeply religious feelings are very often based upon this idea. Someastonishing reactions can occur in a preclear when running this concept.The real way to be assured of a great deal of time is to be able, of course, to create time,and this would be to a thetan the true concept of always. Time is created, at least in thisuniverse, by creating energy and objects, and by being able to make the universe agree withoneself, not by having the universe continually making one agree with it. Motion Source -- StoppedThe ability to cause motion is dependent, whether the individual realizes it or not, uponthe ability to conceive space. Creation of space is the first requisite for the creation of motion.When one can no longer create space and cannot conceive any space to be his own, hecan be considered to be stopped.That individual who is tremendously concerned with being stopped is losing his abilityto create space. When he is no longer able to create space, he is himself MEST. Somebody once said that it was a poor man who was not king in some corner. Onemight add to this that one is not only poor but he does not exist when he cannot create a corner.One could obtain a very amusing viewpoint of this by watching the conduct of a dog who,theta-motivated like every life form, is bravest in his own front yard; and even a mastiffproceeds with some caution when in the front yard of a Pekinese. This is a case of ownershipof space and, in some slight degree, the ability to create a space to own.One processes this by moving mock-ups into an auto created space. Truth -- HallucinationThe highest one can attain to truth is to attain to his own illusions. The lowest one candescend from truth is a complete acceptance of MEST universe reality, for this below a certainlevel becomes scrambled and brings on the condition known as hallucination. Hallucination isnot self-generated; it comes about only when a person is an effect to such an extent that he isalmost dead.What is commonly believed to be truth is agreement upon natural law. This would bethe truth of the MEST universe which would be the lowest common denominator of agreementupon any one subject. Where the MEST universe is concerned, acceptance of such truths isdangerous.In Scientology one is studying the lowest common denominators of agreement whichbring about an acceptance of the MEST universe and prohibit the creation of one’s ownuniverse, which latter ability alone makes possible perception of the MEST universe which isitself an agreed-upon illusion.Truth in Scientology is the study of the lowest common denominator of agreement,plus the establishment of the true ability of the thetan. The true ability of the thetan is a truthmuch higher than the truth of the MEST universe itself and, if it has ever before been known,the difficulties of communicating it have been such as to inhibit its promulgation. It can be seen there is truth above what passes for “truth” in the MEST universe.Scientific truths gained from deductive observations of behavior of the MEST universe arethemselves manifestations of agreements on the part of beings -- thetans -- who are capable ofmuch wider creation and agreement than that represented in the MEST universe.36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"We have answered in Scientology a good portion of “what is truth?” Faith -- DistrustThere is no more over-rated quality in existence than faith.The subject who, under the hands of a hypnotist operator, conceives an enormousagreement with the hypnotist, is experiencing faith as it is commonly understood. In this statethe subject can perceive anything which the hypnotist may direct.In order to understand faith, one must be able to differentiate between faith-in and faith.The difference between these two conditions is a direction of flow which earlier we found to bereality itself. Faith-in is an inflow of agreement and the placing of one’s beingness anddoingness under the control of another, and is, in other words, the sacrifice of one’s universe.This is the basic mechanism wherein, all along the whole track, thetans have been recruited insome cause or mystery, and have surrendered to this their own identity and ability. A little ofthis goes a very long distance. It is in essence the basic trick of hypnotism and by it one canconvert and reduce the abilities of a subject for any purpose.Faith-in is an inflow and brings about the acceptance of reality other than one’s own.Faith itself would be without flow where one was in a full state of beingness and, with thiscondition, one could occasion faith itself to occur within his own universe, or could occasionpeople to have faith in him. The auditor will find one of the more aberrative phases of the preclear in his failure toobtain from others faith in himself, and his acquiescence to their demands on any dynamic thathe have faith in them.Because it is entirely true that a being lacking in faith is low in tone, the fact can betraded upon with great ease.Distrust is not the lowest end of the scale, but begins to set in as a neurotic or psychoticcondition at about 1.5. Actually faith interchanges with distrust in gradient levels all the waydown the tone-scale and they alternate one with the other as one goes deeper and deeper intothe MEST universe. The lowest level of this scale is not distrust but complete faith-in, which isthe condition held by MEST which is supine to any sculptor.This column might also be called the column of belief -- disbelief or the column ofreality -- unreality. The auditor can expect the preclear as he rises up the tone-scale to passthrough the various shades of distrust and the various shades of faith. This is often quiteupsetting to the preclear for he cannot conceive himself to be rising in tone.It is very noteworthy that a preclear, when low in tone at the beginning, will passinevitably through various strata of revulsion for the MEST universe and then for his ownuniverse. The revulsion he can conceive for the MEST universe objects and for being in theMEST universe can become unthinkably distressing to him. When this condition has occurred,the auditor can be reassured by the fact that the preclear is rising in scale but has hit upon oneof the levels of this column, and that a higher level and a more comfortable one immediatelysucceeds as processing is continued. This is simply a problem of reversing directions of flow.If the auditor is running flows he will find that an inflow is shortly succeeded by an out-flowand this out-flow is shortly succeeded by another in-flow. These are in essence agreements anddisagreements alternating one after the other and each one is slightly higher on the tone-scalethan the last. I Know -- I Know NotEpistemology has long been the senior study of philosophy; Scientology is itself thescience of knowing how to know.37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The study of knowledge is in essence, in the MEST universe, a study of data. Data inthe MEST universe are usually recorded in facsimiles. Thus one can go in two directionstoward knowledge. The first is knowing what one is, and the second is knowing what hashappened to one in the MEST universe and searching for identity in the MEST universe.There is no more tragic track than the sordid ransacking of facsimiles to discoverTRUTH for all one discovers is what is true for the MEST universe. This wandering andendless trail is bleak with the bones of lost beingness. Earlier explorers have, almost withoutexception, destroyed themselves in this search for TRUTH in the MEST universe, for all theydiscovered was further and further agreement and more and more facsimiles and all theyachieved as individuals were the traps and snake-pits of implants on the whole track.To stand at last near the heights of discovered beingness has withered the sadness ofstanding on other men’s bitter and, until now, probably unrewarded search. It was necessaryto ransack the facsimiles, which are themselves one’s sole inheritance for travail in the MESTuniverse, to discover the common denominators of facsimiles and to discover that they wereonly facsimiles, how they were created and how experience was impressed upon theindividual. One might well have the feeling of having narrowly escaped a terrible tragedy whenhe views the thinness on which he stood to view this brink of oblivion, for it was obviouslynever intended that anyone should recover from participation or even spectatorship in or of thegame called MEST universe. Dante’s inscription above the portals of Hell might very well bewritten best on the gates of entrance into this universe.The common denominator of all difficulty an individual has in the MEST universe maybe summed up under the heading “facsimiles.” Originally, in his own universe, he used themechanism of energy creation to make objects. In the MEST universe this ability reduces to theuse of energy solely for the recording of data about the MEST universe so that one can agreewith that data. And in this process lies death, not only as a body periodically but as a thetan.What has commonly been mistaken for knowledge has been the MEST universe trackof seeking agreement with the MEST universe by discovering all possible data about what oneshould do in order to agree with the MEST universe. The more data one achieved, the morefacsimiles he had; the more facsimiles he had, the more MEST he was. It was necessary to winthrough this trap in order to recognize, isolate and evaluate the common denominators offacsimiles, and to discover that self-created energy has been utilized to enforce agreement upononeself so as to enslave one’s beingness and lead it to its final destruction.No adventure in the MEST universe can exceed the adventure of making orderlyanatomy from the chaos of commingled matter, energy and space which comprise the planets,galaxies and island universes of this Black Beyond which awaited to devour the universe self-constructed of any thetan or group of thetans. The slaying of a roaring beast of fire held in it, inolden times, less action and danger.These lines are not written from any self-congratulatory motive, for fame is a rock. Butby these lines the auditor may be impressed by the actuality of what he handles, and so that hecan appreciate his own gallantry in fronting an adversary of such insentient brutality.The road to knowledge led through the anatomy of the space and energy masses calledthe MEST universe. The data did not lie in the MEST universe. The ransacking of facsimilesfor data about one’s identity, about one’s “past history” in the MEST universe, should betolerated by the auditor only insofar as it gives him materials for creative processing. He shouldnever directly begin the direct processing of facsimiles, whether engrams or secondaries, saveonly in the case of an assist. He needs only to know so much of a preclear’s beingness on thewhole track to know what to mock up for the preclear’s running.The difficulty the preclear is having is not so much the content of various facsimilesbut, on this high echelon of Scientology on which we are now operating, the fact that he hasfacsimiles. The path of better techniques is the path toward permitting the preclear to step awayfrom all his facsimiles.38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The track to knowledge, then, has two directions. It is possible at this time to take thebetter path. The essence of true knowledge is the essence of existing so that one can createbeingnesses and data to know. All other data are junior to this.A control operation of some magnitude was once perpetrated in the late 18th century. Itwas stated with great authority that anything worth knowing would always be beyond thebounds of human experience. This sought, knowingly or unknowingly, further to block thesearch for beingness. It should never be considered by anyone or under any circumstances thatanything which can affect him could be beyond his ability to know the full nature of what he isexperiencing. If any lesson is contained in Scientology, it is the lesson that the gates to allknowingness are open.One should have the knowledge of the composition of the MEST universe as a foxmight have use for the knowledge of a trap. It is cruelty to make a theta clear without at thesame time educating him so as to permit him to avoid those pitfalls which brought him wherehe is found -- in a MEST body on a planet named Earth (Solar System, Galaxy 13, MESTUniverse).Top-scale knowing would be top-scale ability to create beingness. The identity assignedto one by others and the data contained in facsimiles are knowingness not worth having. Cause -- Full EffectAbove the level of all else on the Chart of Attitudes is Cause. Causation is the highestattainment which can be envisaged by the thetan, but this is not necessarily the highest possibleattainment, and much higher levels may be envisionable by the thetan when he has attainedhigh on the level of causation.To be Full Cause, one would have to be able to cause space and many othermanifestations. Everyone, to a greater or lesser degree, attempts to be cause until he is at lastthe full effect. The fullest effect in this universe is to be MEST itself.One of the principles of causation is outlined in the cycle of action, but it is notnecessarily true that one can only cause a cycle of this pattern or that one must cause cycles atall, for it is excellent processing to mock-up with reverse cycles going from death back tocreation with objects which one has mocked up.It is one of the “facts” of objects that space and energy must have been caused beforethe object could exist in the MEST universe. Thus any object has prior cause. For this reasonwhen anyone in the MEST universe begins to study in order to resolve some of the riddles ofthe MEST universe, he falls into the trap of supposing all cause to be prior and time itself toexist. This would make one the later effect of everything he caused. In other words, if he madea postulate, he would then immediately afterwards become the effect of that postulate. Causesmotivated by “future” desire, enforcement and inhibition of havingness, do not lie in the pastbut only in the condition of havingness in this universe which states that any object must havehad a “prior” cause.The preclear has become aberrated by the process of making an effect out of him andtaking from him the ability to be cause by convincing him that it is better to be an effect.Freud had one of the major aberrations in view when he declared his libido theory in1894 and decided therein that sex was the only aberration. It is certainly a major one in homosapiens, for in sex one desires to be the cause of little or nothing and desires to be the effect ofpleasurable sensation.Anything in the MEST universe which one desires, he desires because it will have apleasant effect on him. Thus he is searching for sensation caused exterior to himself which willmake on him an effect. How much of an effect can he become? MEST! The snare ofpleasurable sensation leads one to accept energy other than one’s own. Desire for this energy39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"or objects then puts one in the condition of being an effect. When one is surrounded by asmany powerful possible energy sources as one finds in the MEST universe, he cannot butbecome a low level cause.When a preclear is at a level on the tone-scale where he is concerned with bad and good(above 8.0 both these are seen broadly enough to understand that they are viewpoints) he isvery concerned if he thinks that he is or could be bad cause and is desirous of being what heconsiders good cause. He judges these things by moral codes and so bends his conduct as tomake bad cause antipathetic to himself and others. Thus he gives away responsibility for badcause and in that very action becomes the effect of bad cause. When he has found himself to bewhat he considers bad cause, he ceases to “trust” himself and begins to blame himself and thenothers.All angels have two faces. They are commonly represented in mythology as having ablack and white face. To be complete cause, theoretically, a person would have to be willing tobe bad cause and good cause. Only in this wise, in the MEST universe, could he escape theliability of becoming the effect of bad cause.The criminal who has elected himself bad cause through having found it impossible totrust himself (and a criminal career always begins at the moment when the criminal-to-be loseshis self-respect; a career of prostitution cannot begin until self-respect is lost; and self-respect isonly lost when one considers himself to be bad cause) can only escape becoming an effect byfighting all good cause. The reformation or reclamation of the criminal does not depend uponpunishment, which only seeks to make him more MEST than he is, nor yet upon good cause,which he must fight, but upon the reestablishment of the criminal’s self-respect; for only afterthis is he capable of being good cause.An entire process evolves around “what would you cause on (each one of thedynamics)?” An assessment of the preclear with a meter should seek to establish where thepreclear feels he would be bad cause, for it is on this point that he will be found to have lost hisself-respect and where it will be discovered why he cannot trust himself. Self-trust, self-respectand the ability to be cause are conditions in the same order of magnitude and can beinterchangeably approached. I Am -- I Am NotOn the Chart of Attitudes which accompanies the Handbook for Preclears, it will befound at 22.0 “I am myself.” The only true identity is “myself.” It is not a name, it is not adesignation. Orders, titles, ranks, praise and enduring fame alike do not bring about thecondition “I am” or an actual identity; they bring about instead an identification, with all theliabilities of identification. The finality of identification is 0.0 or lower on the tone-scale.The concept of infinite mind is not new, but it has always been assigned to anotherbeingness than self. The preclear will be found to be intensely aberrated who has swornallegiance to some infinite beingness and has then agreed that all space belonged to thatbeingness, and that the rights of creation and energy belonged to that beingness and did notbelong to self. This is a handy and, to the very badly aberrated, acceptable method of denyingany responsibility for anything. It is also the shortest route toward I AM NOT. Infinite mind isindividualistic. All mankind does not depend upon or share a portion of the infinite mind. Onthe contrary, the highest individualism attainable is the individualism of the infinite mind. Itwas beyond the power and grasp of the intellect applying itself to the field of philosophy, toconceive a multiplicity of infinite minds, and these commentators had agreed sufficiently withthe MEST universe to conceive that the only space was the MEST universe space and theycould not understand that this was an illusion, and that the existence of space does not dependupon existing space. Just as there can be an “infinity” of ideas, so can there be an “infinity” of“infinities” of space. Two beings theoretically, each with an infinite mind, and each capable ofthe production of an infinity of space, could yet co-produce sufficient space to communicatewith each other. This may be difficult to conceive until one has attained a level of the tone-scalesufficient for an expansive viewing of his potentialities, at which moment it becomes simplicityitself.40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"There is a psychosis which has as its manifestation the illusion that one is God and theruler of the universe. This psychosis comes about from the effort of an individual who is wellbelow complete agreement with the MEST universe, to shift into the valence of what he hasalready accepted to be the creator of the universe. Instead of being himself, he has becomeunable even to be a MEST body in a sane condition, has conceived God to be MEST, and hasthen shifted into the valence of God. God, in this case, will be found to be conceived to be aMEST object. As an aside to this, below the level of complete agreement that the MESTuniverse is the only reality, begins the state which could be described by the statement, “Iagree, I am still agreeing, and yet you are still punishing me.” The unfortunate fact about theMEST universe is that it is MEST and is designed to punish and cares nothing about agreementwith it beyond the point that one agrees with it, and has no spirit of fair play wherebypunishment ceases when one has acknowledged the winner. Recognition of this brings oninsanity in an effort to further back away from responsibility and further escape frompunishment. In the MEST universe, this escape from punishment is, of course, impossible.Thus there is a level below 0.0 for any immortal being.One of the first confusions on the part of the preclear which the auditor will encounteris the fact that the preclear considers himself to be in the state of I AM when he has a body anda name. This is high-tone compared to the sub-zero state in which the thetan quite often findshimself, but it is very far from optimum. Here the preclear is confusing identity with his ownsense of beingness. His sense of beingness does not depend upon and, indeed, is confused bya MEST identity such as a name assigned to him and a body with which he can be recognized.To a large degree the society of Earth requires, as part of its structure, names and themeans to identify. The state finds itself very satisfied whenever it increases its ability to readilyidentify its citizenry, and will resort to almost any pretext to collect the fingerprints and dossierof one and all.Identity is such a liability and is so thoroughly MEST that individuality is really notpossible in the presence of sharply defined identity. Reaching down into the sub-zero tone-scale, the thetan finds it expedient not only to mask his beingness, but to hide his identity withgreat thoroughness even from himself. This passion for non-identity is the spasm of clinging tothe last shreds of individuality which would otherwise be lost. Thetans from some of the corpsoperating in space have thoroughly agreed to be amongst themselves completely black, thebetter to hide in the blackness of space. This blackness is found in the occluded case in manyinstances.The commonest plea on the part of the preclear is “Who am I?” He feels that if he couldonly answer this, he would be happy. He then ransacks his facsimiles for all of his pastidentities on his many spirals and as these amount to hundreds of millions, he finds nosurcease. He succeeds only in damaging himself with the many injuries contained in facsimilesthrough which he is searching. He is identifying to the point where he is searching not for thestate of I AM but for WHAT HAVE I BEEN LABELLED? The attainment of the state of I AMdepends upon one’s ability to again be able to create space, energy and objects in and for hisown universe, by himself or in co-operation with other thetans, and the rehabilitation of themany additional abilities of the thetan for the creation of energy is but one of a very largenumber. Thus the state of I AM is reached through creative processing and postulateprocessing rather than the processing of MEST universe facsimiles or endless searching withan E-meter to discover what one has been.There are gods above all other gods. Anything which has wide acceptance and has beensuccessful, wherever suns shine and planets swing, is based upon some fundamental truth.There is no argument here against the existence of a Supreme Being or any devaluationintended. It is that amongst gods, there are many false gods elected to power and position forthe benefit and use of those who would control and make into the basest slaves the mostsublime beings. As an ancient Greek said, when one has examined the descriptions of Godwritten by men, he finds in that Being at best a thirst for self-aggrandizement and adulationwhich would be disgusting in any man. Man has sought to make his God a god of mudbecause the Early Greek and even more distant peoples, made idols in the form of men bywhich they thought to entrap the beingness of some local divinity who troubled them; moremodern man has fallen into the error of making God into the body of a homo sapiens and41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"posting him somewhere on high with a craving for vengeance and a pettiness in punishmentmatched only by the degradation of homo sapiens himself.There are gods above all other gods, and gods beyond the gods of universes, but itwere better, far better, to be a raving madman in his cell than to be a thing with the ego,cruelty, and jealous lust that base religions have set up to make men grovel down. Win -- LoseIt is noteworthy that as the preclear ascends the tone-scale, his desire to win increases.Those low on the tone-scale, even when they think they are trying to win, will almostuniformly set up their problems and solutions so that they will lose.Homo sapiens has little converse with true competence. There is an astonishing level ofwinningness above 4.0 where competence becomes a joy like poetry.Regret of competence ensues when one has employed competence to injure anotherbeing drastically. The duellist begins with joy in competence of sword-handling and beforelong, because of the counter-emotion he receives from his practice of the art, conceives disgustfor competence. In a later life, he will carry this into everything he does, so fearing that he willemploy competence to injure that he dares not practice competence in the smallest things; andby failing to practice competence, so introduces losingness, to the injury of himself and others.A man who instinctively recoils from competence and perfection, at the wheel of a car, willsometimes cause an accident rather than avoid one if competence of a high order is required inthe avoidance.To win one must wish to win; when one no longer desires to win, one no longerdesires to live. (Note -- The remaining three columns of the chart of attitudes are coveredbroadly in the earlier text.) The Emotional Scale and Sub-Zero Tone-ScaleThe emotional scale has been covered often and exhaustively elsewhere. As has beendiscussed in this text, it is dependent upon that characteristic of energy known as affinity whichitself is established by flows, dispersals and ridges.Below zero on the tone-scale is applicable only to a thetan.It has been quite commonly observed that there are two positions for any individual onthe tone-scale. This occurs because there is a position for the composite of the thetan plus hisMEST body operating in a state of unknowingness that he is not a MEST body, and behavingaccording to social patterns, which give him some semblance of sanity. The other position onthe tone-scale is the position of the thetan himself, and it is necessary for us to demonstrate anegative scale in order to find the thetan at all.For the thetan you will find the scale as follows: 40.0 Serenity of beingness 8.0 Exhilaration 4.0 Enthusiasm 3.0 Conservatism 2.5 Boredom 2.0 Antagonism 1.8 Pain 1.5 Anger 1.2 No-sympathy 1.0 Fear 42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"0.9 Sympathy 0.8 Propitiation 0.5 Grief 0.375 Making amends 0.05 Apathy 0.0 Being a body -0.2 Being other bodies -1.0 Punishing other bodies -1.3 Responsibility as blame -1.5 Controlling bodies -2.2 Protecting bodies -3.0 Owning bodies -3.5 Approval from bodies -4.0 Needing bodies -8.0 Hiding This sub-zero tone-scale shows that the thetan is several bands below knowingness as abody, and so he will be found in the majority of cases. In our homo sapiens he will bediscovered to be below zero on the tone-scale. The zero-to-four plus tone-scale was formulatedon, and referred to, bodies and the activity of thetans with bodies. In order, then, to discoverthe state of mind of the thetan, one must examine the sub-zero scale. He has some trainedpatterns as a body which make it possible for him to know and to be. As himself, he has lostall beingness, all pride, all memories and all self-determined ability, but yet has an automaticresponse-mechanism in himself which continues furnishing his energy.EACH ONE OF THE ABOVE POINTS ON THE SCALE IS RUN AS POSITIVEAND NEGATIVE. Example: The beautiful sadness of needing bodies. The beautiful sadnessof NOT needing bodies. The beauty of being responsible for bodies, the beauty of NOT beingresponsible for bodies. Each one is run as itself and then as the reverse with the addition ofNOT.The sub-zero to 40.0 scale is the range of the thetan. A thetan is lower than body death,since it survives body death. It is in a state of knowingness below 0.375 only when it isidentifying itself as a body and IS, to its own thinking, the body. The BODY-PLUS-THETANscale is from 0.0 to 4.0, and the position on this scale is established by the social environmentand education of the composite being and is a stimulus-response scale. The preclear is initiallyabove this 0.375 on the BODY-PLUS-THETAN range. Then, on auditing, he commonlydrops from the FALSE TONE of the BODY-PLUS-THETAN scale and into the true tone ofthe thetan.This is actually the only self-determined tone present -- the actual tone of the thetan.From this sub-zero he quickly rises up scale through the entire range as a thetan and generallysettles at 20.0 and in command of the body and situations. The course of auditing then takesthe preclear, quite automatically, down from the FALSE TONE of the BODY-PLUS-THETANscale to the actual tone of the thetan. Then the tone of the thetan rises back up the scale level bylevel.It is not uncommon to find the preclear (who IS the thetan) quite raving mad under thefalse “veneer” of social and educational stimulus-response training and to discover that thepreclear, while behaving quite normally in the BODY-PLUS-THETAN state, becomesirrational in the course of auditing. BUT DESPITE THIS, the preclear is actually being farmore sane and rational than ever before and the moment he discovers himself as himself, asTHE source of energy and personality and beingness of a body, he becomes physically andmentally better. Thus the auditor must not be dismayed at the course of tone, but should simplypersevere until he has the thetan up into rational range. A raving mad thetan is far more sanethan a normal human being. But then, as you audit, observe it for yourself. The Dichotomies43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"While the auditor can do much solely by reducing facsimiles, he soon will find that hispreclears are not always able to erase facsimiles easily. He will find occasionally that he oftenhas a difficult time when a particularly heavy facsimile is in restimulation and, do what he will,the auditor may find his preclear’s tone remains unchanged and that the preclear’s attitudeshave not evolved to a better high.We now come to “The Governor” mentioned in a lecture in the autumn of 1951. Thespeed of a preclear is the speed of his production of energy.The most important step in establishing a preclear’s self-determinism, the main goal ofthe auditor, is the rehabilitation of the preclear’s ability to produce energy.A being is, apparently, an energy production source. How does he produce live energywithout mechanical means, cellular activity, or food?The basic principle of energy production by a being has been copied in electronics. It isvery simple. A difference of potential of two areas can establish an energy flow of themselves.Carbon batteries, electric generators, and other producers of electrical flows act on the principlethat a difference of energy potential in two or more areas can cause an electrical impulse to flowbetween or amongst them.The preclear is static and kinetic, meaning he is no-motion and motion. These,interplaying, produce electrical flow.A preclear as a static can hold two or more energy flows of different wavelengths inproximity and between them obtain a flow.A preclear can hold a difference of flow between two waves and a static so long (andarduously) that the effect of a discharging condenser can be obtained. This can “explode” afacsimile.The preclear flows electrical currents of command at the body. These hit pre-establishedridges (areas of dense waves) and cause the body to perceive or act. The preclear takesperception from the body with tractor beams. He holds the body still or braces himself againstit by wrapping a tractor (pulling) beam around it while he places a pressor (pushing) beam athis back to command himself into action. (You can almost break a preclear’s spine by askinghim to contract his own tractor around his body and yet withhold the pressor against his spine.)All an auditor really needs to know about this is the elementary method of using adifference of potential. That creates energy.The only thing wrong with a preclear with an aged MEST body is that he has too manyfacsimiles of his tractors and pressors handling his own MEST body and the rickety state of thebody feeds back “slowness” so that he thinks his energy is low -- and until worked with somemethod such as this, facsimiles do not reduce.Any difference of potential played one against the other creates energy. Aesthetic wavesagainst a static produce energy. Aesthetic waves against analytical waves produce energy.Analytical waves against emotional waves produce energy. Emotional waves against effortwaves produce energy. Effort against matter produces energy. The last is the method used on Earth in generating electrical current for power. Theothers are equally valid and produce even higher flows. This is a gradient scale of beingness,from the zero-infinity of theta to the solidity of matter.The differences of potential most useful are easy to run.This is, actually, alternating current running. There can be DC running or chain fissionrunning but these are very experimental at this writing.44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"AC is created by the static holding first one, then the other, of a dichotomy of twodifferences of potential.

How are these used?One asks the preclear to flow agreement, then disagreement. He flows a feeling, athought (NEVER the phrase!) of “agreement” out or in, in the direction he chooses relative tohimself. He lets this flow until it turns smoky grey or white, then black. Then he changes thedirection of flow and gets the thought or feeling of “disagreement”. He runs this until it turnsgrey or white, then black. When this has turned black or dark, he again runs “agreement” in itsdirection until he gets grey or white, then again black. Now he reverses the flow and flows thethought “disagreement” until he gets grey or white, then blackness. And so on and on.45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"It will be noted that at first it may take some little time for a flow to run from blackthrough white to black. As the preclear continues to run, after minutes or many hours, hebegins to run faster, then faster and faster, until at last he can keep a flow blazing andcrackling.A method of aberrating beings was to give them white and black energy sources in theirvicinity. These show up on a very low tone occluded case as blazing white and shining white.That is an electronic incident, not his own energy flow. These run blazing white in onedirection for minutes or hours before they go black. They then run the other way, blazingwhite, almost as long.WHEN BLACK PREDOMINATES IN SUCH INCIDENT WHAT HE “HAS TO DO”TO GET THE INCIDENT ALL WHITE.As the preclear runs, he finds the speed of the change of flow changes, more and morerapidly until it runs like a vibration. This vibration, theoretically, can increase to a strongcurrent which becomes so great it is well to ground your preclear by using an E-meter or lettinghim hold a wire in each hand which is connected to a bare water pipe or radiator. Otherwise,his MEST body may be damaged by the flow.Run a dichotomy only against its mate. Run in alternating directions until the flow turnsblack.Don’t run a black “flow.” It doesn’t flow or run out. Methods a RunningThere are many methods of running facsimiles and of handling ridges and flows. Thesehave been covered in other publications; all of them have validity and can advance cases.In the present publication there are only two processes which are stressed and theseprocesses are superior to others published prior to December 1st, 1952. A great many testshave established the fact that two processes, both of them simple, produce far better resultsthan any of the others.The title “Scientology 8-8008” means the attainment of infinity by the reduction of theMEST universe’s apparent infinity to zero and the increase of the zero of one’s own universe toan infinity of one’s own universe. This road is attained by postulate processing and creativeprocessing.To run any incident or use any process it is necessary for the auditor to have a verysound idea of what he is doing, and to this end it is recommended that he know and be able touse the following: Processing The Code The Theta Entity The Entities Running Engrams Running Secondaries Running Locks Concepts and Feelings Running Ridges (Circuits) Running Live Flow Freeing the Thetan by Concept and Feeling Freeing the Thetan by Present and Future Randomity Freeing by Dichotomies Freeing by Tone Scale Freeing the Thetan by Orientation Freeing the Thetan by Positioning and Exhaustion of Flows 46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Postulate ProcessingActually energy is produced by the thetan simply by postulating that it will be inexistence. What he says will be so, becomes so for him; if he becomes extremely powerful, itbecomes so for others. This condition has been misused by most thetans who, often in thepast, have been afraid of making postulates that will come true. They believe that if they say athing will happen, it will then happen -- to such an extent that they now revulse against statinganything will happen.Another aberrative condition with regard to postulates is that for the sake of randomity,the thetan at some time or another has set up the postulate that every time he makes a postulate areverse postulate will occur which he will not know about, in such a way that he can “playchess with himself” without spoiling the game by knowing what his left hand is doing whenhis right makes the move.It is not true that postulates have to be located all through the facsimiles and worn outby repetition. It is just as easy to make new postulates; but first one must recover from thedepths to which his postulates have taken him. The most dangerous postulates are thosepostulates where one decided to agree with something which would become aberrative.You can see by examining any facsimile in the preclear related to an accident that themost aberrative things in that facsimile are what the preclear himself decided.Postulates are accompanied by evaluations and conclusions. It is often possible to“loosen” a postulate by discovering to the preclear why he made it, or what data he was usingat the time.As a preclear becomes very aberrated and believes himself to be more and more MEST,his postulates become as unwieldy to use as actual objects, and he finds them as difficult tochange as objects.When doing creative processing and moving objects and energy in created space andtime, the preclear is doing this by making postulates. It comes as a shock to some preclears thatthey are handling time by shifting space. One handles time by simply saying that he had a thingand now he does not have it, or that he will have or will view a thing in the future. One doesnot shift time by shifting space, nor does one continue to look at something he has put into thepast. He says it is in the past and so it becomes in the past.When the thetan is unable to handle postulates about time, the auditor should ask himabout some MEST universe incident such as breakfast, and then enquire how he rememberedthat he had breakfast, and if he will have something to eat on the morrow, and then how heknows he will have something to eat on the morrow. He does not look at his breakfast to findout if he had breakfast, he knows that he ate breakfast; and he does not go into tomorrow tofind out if he will probably eat on the morrow, he knows -- or, at least, believes it possible --that he will eat on the morrow. Moving time, as in any other postulate, is knowingness notviewingness. An object goes into the past in the same space as it was in, in the present; and inthe future may be in the same space as it was in in the past. The space does not change thecondition of havingness changes, and one estimates this by some degree of knowingness.The entire subject of postulates is the subject of certainty and self-belief. That preclearwho has a low self-belief finds it difficult first, to make a postulate which he will believe andsecond, to undo one he has made. Creative processing and postulate processing alike remedythis.Rising-scale processing is another way of doing postulate processing. One takes anypoint or column of the Chart of Attitudes as given in this text, which the preclear can reach, andasks the preclear then to shift his postulate upwards toward a higher level.In order to do this the auditor says, “Now, on the subject of rightness and wrongness,how wrong do you think you generally are?” The preclear tells him. The auditor says, “Howhigh can you shift this attitude toward believing yourself right?” The preclear shifts the attitude47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"as high as he can. The auditor takes this as the next level from which he will work upward untilhe attains as nearly as possible a postulate which will “hold” to the effect that the preclearbelieves himself right. Rising-scale processing should not be confused with the processing offlows. One can process all these columns in terms of flows. Rising-scale processing is simplya method of shifting postulates upward toward optimum from where the preclear believes he ison the chart. Rising-scale processing is essentially a process directed toward increasing beliefin self by using all the “buttons” on the Chart of Attitudes.The preclear is generally found to be quite uncertain about his postulates. He does notknow whether or not what he says will take effect or, if he says it and if it takes effect, if it willnot rebound upon him. He becomes afraid to make postulates for fear he will make somepostulate destructive to himself or others and may even discover himself making postulates toconvince himself he should be ill.One has to tell oneself what to be before one is. Recovery of this ability is the essenceof processing a thetan. Postulate processing is a very vital process to apply to the thetan: when he isexteriorized, he can change his postulates rapidly. If he finds himself thinking slowly anddoing other things which are not optimum when he is outside, One can better his situation andcondition by asking him to change postulates. Creative ProcessingStandard Operating Procedure for theta clearing is the backbone of processing inScientology. It is easily followed but the auditor should have an excellent command of all typesof processing in order to use it more successfully.SOP is most easily done and most successfully by an auditor who is a theta clear.Auditors who are not theta clear seldom understand it, and a low-toned uncleared auditor whocannot himself leave his body very often acts to pin a preclear inside his body. It is noteworthythat many auditors have been unable to obtain successes with theta clearing before theythemselves have been cleared, but immediately after the auditor was cleared, he was successfulwith each successive case without exception. The fear of some thetans from various causes ofleaving the body causes the auditor -- who is the thetan -- to make other thetans stay in bodies,and it is actually quite dangerous to be audited by auditors who are not theta clears. Theprocess is not dangerous; uncleared auditors are. Standard Operating Procedure, Issue 3 This process is done in steps. The auditor with EVERY preclear makes no otherjudgment than to begin with Step I and, failing to accomplish that immediately, to go to Step II;if he fails to accomplish this immediately, he goes to Step III; and so on. When he is able toaccomplish a step he labels the case as that step number, i.e., a III. He then begins workingwith that step. After a few hours’ work, he again starts at the top with the preclear with Step Iand progresses on through. Eventually the preclear becomes a Step I. STEP I -- POSITIVE EXTERIORIZING: Ask the preclear to be a foot back of hishead. If he does, make him go back further, then up, then down, practising placement in spaceand time. Then one asks him to see if there are any items in the body he would like to repairand proceeds to let the preclear repair them according to the preclear’s own ideas as to how heshould do it. Then educate the preclear by making him create and destroy his own illusions intofinally getting a certainty of illusion and from this a certainty of perceiving the real universewith all perceptions. (Note. The most real universe is, of course, one’s own illusory universeand should be completely rehabilitated before one attempts to perceive or handle or worry aboutthe MEST universe. Rehabilitated, sonic, visio, etc. of the MEST universe are very clear andvery certain. Clear perception in early stages is not a test of being outside. The only test iswhether the preclear KNOWS he is outside.) Failing the first line of this step, go to Step II.48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"STEP II -- BY ORIENTATION: Ask the preclear, still inside, to locate the inside of hisforehead. Ask him to put a pressor beam against it and push himself out the back of his head.Supplement this by asking him to reach out through the back of his head and grab the wall witha pulling beam and pull himself out. Ask him to steady himself outside and then, by means ofbeams, to raise and lower himself while outside and to move to various parts of the room whilestill outside. Use creative processing. By orientation as a thetan, placing himself as a thetan intime and space, he becomes sure of his whereabouts. Have him find and cast off old lineswhich have their terminals fixed to him. Have him find those lines wherever they are and attachthem to radiators and water taps as the energy will drain out of him. (The II ordinarily hasenough lines to cause him to snap back in the head when he releases beams.) Failing this, go toStep III. STEP III -- SPACE PROCESSING: In that the MEST universe has forced upon thethetan its spatial dimensions and directions, the thetan is likely to become a point which isbeing subjected to all the counter-efforts and counter-emotions of his environment, for hisentire concept of space is being determined by the MEST universe. Have the thetan, still inside,find his feet in the opposite direction from where the MEST body is located by the MESTuniverse. Have him turn the feet around. Have him create differences in his body and reversevarious limbs and positions according to his viewpoint, each one in disagreement with theMEST universe, particularly as appertaining to gravity and other influences. This sets up anability to disagree with the MEST universe in terms of space. Have him locate his eyes in theback of his head, on the soles of his feet and in other places. Have him assume other bodies,each time changing them slightly, and putting them away. Then have him gather himself intohis normal MEST universe spatial areas and go to Step I. STEP IV -- RIDGE RUNNING: Ask the preclear to give himself a command to walk.Let him locate the white flow line which results inside his head. When this line goes dark, havehim locate the tiny ridge inside the skull that stopped it. Have him run the flow from this barrier(these barriers, are tiny ridges and each has a thought with it such as “Can’t walk” or “Toobored to walk”) back toward the spot where he told himself to walk. It will run white for amoment, then go black. Have him give himself the command to walk again and “watch” thisflow line. It may run through two or three tiny barriers and then stop. Again have him run the“objection” to walking. Have him watch this “objection” flow until it goes black. Then havehim give himself the command to walk again and so on and so on. He will wind up at someoutside point. Now have him give himself the command “Listen” and have him run this and itsback flows on “black and white” until he is exterior on the subject of listen. Then use thecommand “Talk” similarly. Then the command “Nod,” then the command “Move,” etc. Give“Look” last for it may “blind” his perception of black and white. He may each time get out to adistance in another quarter. If he can do all this, start with Step I again. Failing this step, failingto “see” black and white energy manifestations, go to Step V.STEP V -- BLACK AND WHITE CONTROL PROCESSING: Give the preclear acomplete E-meter assessment, using the principles of what he would create or destroy or wouldnot create and would not destroy. Use this data to make mock-ups. Then have the preclearcreate and perceive black spots and then white spots, black crosses and white crosses, andmove these here and there through the room or through his own space. Turn them on and off,interchange them, put them in yesterday, put them in tomorrow, make them get larger, makethem get smaller; each time doing as much as the preclear can do. Each time one asks him toperceive one of his own created illusions in terms of black and white spots or crosses, oneattempts to coax him into successful control of it. Audit very persuasively and lightly. Thispreclear ordinarily is frightened of blackness because it either can contain dangerous things orcontains nothing, and he cannot differentiate which. Thus he cannot control blackness and, inbeing unable to control blackness, flounders in it. He also has a more basic computation: thatblackness is the only safe thing in which to hide and, therefore, blackness is a thing to have.Further, blackness “takes” things for him. This preclear may be afraid of the police, maybelieve himself to have a hideous body, thetawise, and has many other reasons why he cannotexteriorize. Drills on creating and perceiving black and white should be continued until he canhandle each easily. The trouble with this preclear and preclears lower than this is that they haveagreed too heavily with the MEST universe and must be very cautious in confronting it, sincein that direction they conceive to lie a much more complete defeat even than that from whichthey are now suffering. Audit him also very heavily on Creative Processing.49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Then go through steps again. If the preclear is immediately perceived to have little or noreality on ANY incident, go to Step VI.STEP VI -- ARC STRAIGHT WIRE: Drill, by direct questioning, on locks until thepreclear can remember something really “real” to him, something which he “really loved,”something with which he was in communication. Then drill him on creating illusions until he iscertain he has created one which really isn’t real, which he is certain HE put the emotion andperceptions into. Then go through steps again. Failing Step VI after a quick test, go to StepVII.STEP VII -- PRESENT TIME BODY ORIENTATION: Have preclear locate a part ofhis body and recognize it as such. Have him locate furniture, fixtures, auditor in room. Havehim locate the town and country he is in. Get him to find something in present time which isreally real to him, with which he can communicate. Work on this until he can do this. Then goto Step VI. Then go to Step I. General ProcessingAnything which rehabilitates the self-determinism of a preclear, whether education,change of environment, running facsimiles, theta clearing or the creation of one’s ownuniverse, is valid processing. Any one of these will raise the tone of the preclear markedly. Atthe end of 80,000 hours of investigation of beingness in the MEST universe, I have concludedthat those processes which make it possible for the preclear to disagree with the MESTuniverse also make it possible for him to handle the MEST universe, or to create his own or bepart of a group which creates a universe, as the case may be.Scientology 8-8008 is remarkable for its ability to better the beingness and actionpotentials of the individual. It is, sadly enough, the only technique which I have seen produceexcellent and fast results in the hands of trained auditors. Mainly the reason is that homosapiens has and will continue to use, any technique delivered into his hands for the control andenslavement of others, for homo sapiens is frightened. Even when an auditor was competentwith earlier techniques, it would often occur that his preclear would return into his pastenvironment and would relapse.This occurred because others had a vested interest in the preclear’s continuation in astate of aberration; and others would lose no moment in starting again to crush this precleardown the tone-scale to a point where they conceived he was more easily controlled. Mest is themost easily controlled item in the MEST universe, and the closer a human being could bepressed toward MEST, the easier, it was thought, to control him.That his value and ethical sense deteriorated in direct ratio to the degree he wasdepressed down the tone-scale, was overlooked by the homo sapiens who had a passion forslavery.The primary benefit of Scientology 8-8008 is that it works so swiftly even whenindifferently used that the persons in the environment of the preclear are over-reached rapidlyby the preclear and find themselves subject to his control when they act to continue hisaberration.Further the auditor is seldom aware of the height his preclear attains until the preclearhas attained it. Processing has always worked in the hands of a competent auditor; and it werebetter for any technique, no matter how dangerous, to be known to Man if it could benefit atleast a few, for homo sapiens has no psycho-therapy. In Dianetics he had his first thoroughlyvalidated psychotherapy and Dianetics worked and still works uniformly in the hands of thoseskilled in its application.In Scientology in general, and in theta clearing in particular, the upper limits of homosapiens as such have been transcended and it would not be good semantics to call a theta clear ahomo sapiens or even, exactly speaking, a person, for he is a thetan with a body he uses forpurposes of action and communication, and his viewpoint is quite altered. His general health is50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"more or less directly under his control, but there is no goal for the body as a final goal inScientology, for the body is a tool. The genetic entity which built the human body reallywanted to be served.The complexities and ridges which he developed speak of a craving for energy and self-service which could only be the basest aberration, and, true enough, the genetic entity isaberrated almost beyond belief, as any thetan discovers when he seeks to clear the geneticentity.The body is quite alive and self-motivated without the thetan, as the thetan soondiscovers; but it is so used to taking orders from successive lines of thetans which themselvessome day would probably become part of this complex system of ridges, that its “mentalactivities” are quite stupid. The thetan who has lived in this association and has believedhimself to be the body is early quite appalled at the character of the genetic entity who iscowardly, a thing of stimulus-response, without further will or goals than to grow a body, andobsessed entirely with the idea of growing one.The thetan can repair the body quite easily if he so chooses, but quite often sees it as apointless activity; for one’s personality is not even faintly dependent upon the body but is onlydebased by association with one. When one has learned to control a body from a distance, he isusually content to let it get along as best it can, for the reduction of all counter-efforts of thegenetic entity would be a reduction of the entire body. The genetic entity has his whole trackand has had his own travails. In other parts of space, not too incredibly, “dolls” are used bythetans -- things which can be animated easily by theta energy and which are disposable andwhich do not have the uncomfortable circumstance of being themselves any more alive thanany other MEST.The MEST universe itself has a considerable cravingness in it. It is composed of energywhich was emanated in order to have, and the energy still contains as its basic characteristicHave and Not Have, and is itself, when contacted, found to possess a craving which does notmake the MEST alive but which speaks of that which made the MEST. This cravingness is anessential part of all matter. Certain metals contain the desire to be had much more than others,and certain other metals contain the craving not to be had. This is one way of looking atpositive and negative reactions.The body’s being composed of such energy makes it feel as though it is holding on tothe thetan. Nothing is really holding on to the thetan since he has no substance which can beheld. Even the genetic entity does not hold on to the thetan, but probably considers him somesort of far off commanding god -- if he thinks of the thetan at all.Space has its own demanding quality and insists on its dimensions being accepted byanything in the universe, for it was erected and is erected on a command basis in the MESTuniverse.Processing must resolve this havingness on the part of matter, and thecommandingness on the part of space. To confront these directly is, for most preclears, animpossibility, for it only drives them further into an apathy of agreement with MEST. Thepreclear has long contested with the MEST universe and has continually sought to create hisown universe only to find the MEST universe declaring itself stronger each time andcompressing the illusion to nothing.The war cry of the MEST universe is: “Must have gotten it somewhere,” and “It musthave gone somewhere.” It will not tolerate the vaguest possibility that one created himself orcould destroy anything himself. The whole sub-zero scale is a manifestation of one’s efforts tocombat this demandingness on the part of the MEST universe. Hiding, protecting, owning, areall mechanisms to answer the question, “Where did you get it?” “What did you do with it?” TheMEST universe, in this light, is essentially a police universe, for it operates upon force andintolerance and demands with pain that its laws be accepted. In that its laws are based solelyupon agreement, it is only necessary to discover how one can disagree with them to abolishwhat has been called “natural law” for oneself. Upon the abolishment of this agreementdepends the health, progress and advancement of the thetan.51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"This universe is a major expanding trap of finite dimensions and rather idioticsimplicity. If one were to leave the MEST universe, one would solely create space of his ownand maintain enough knowledge of what could happen with regard to the MEST universe todefeat its encroachment and its salesmen. No universe, however cunningly constructed, isentirely proof against this expanding trap. The MEST universe is a game which has gone ontoo long and of which even the players are tired. Earth could be considered to be at this time anegress terminal.It is noteworthy that one must not accept or know any of these conditions to have theseprocesses work. They act very swiftly and uniformly on any homo sapiens and upon otherbeings. A considerable number of the principles which have been discovered in Scientologyexist above the MEST universe. The MEST universe itself might be considered to be the“inevitable average” of illusion once it starts in a certain direction. We have in natural law asapplied to the MEST universe the sum of agreement upon illusion. Tracing the principles ofScientology as they apply specifically to the MEST universe, is the tracing of the agreementswhich brought about the MEST universe. The axioms of 1951 are, in the main, a tracing of thisagreement.The inevitability and “diabolical accuracy” of these predictions of human behaviordepend upon their being held in common by Man, which they are. They extend as well to otherbeings below the level of player in this universe and have applied to many sets of players,while much of the data which has been recovered in this investigation seems, to the narrowscope of homo sapiens, quite wild, the wildness depends on the absence of investigation in thepast and can be compared only to the stupidity which remained ignorant of them; for thesematters were an unseen and insidious causation underlying the grief of Earth, at best a pawn ina minor game in a minor galaxy. The Anatomy of SpaceBefore energy can exist in this universe, space must exist. His inability to create spaceis one of the most aberrative characteristics of the thetan whom we find in a MEST body. Hehas become reduced to a point even in his own concept, and perhaps even less than a point forhe has no space of his own but must depend upon bodies and other conditions to believe thathe has space.It is of the utmost importance for the auditor to understand space. Space can beconsidered to be a viewpoint of dimensions. It does not matter how many dimensions there areor what conditions are set up for these dimensions: the resulting condition is known as“space.” There are only three dimensions in space in the MEST universe. Throughout all of itsgalaxies it has only length, breadth and depth. Space warps and other things of equal interestcan exist in one’s own universe, but they do not exist as such, evidently, in the MESTuniverse.The assignation of dimension is the essence of space, but even before dimension can beassigned, one must have viewpoint. If one is assigning dimension from his viewpoint, he iscause; if dimension is being assigned to his viewpoint, he is effect. He is cause or effect to thedegree that he can assign dimension and call it space.The preclear has a viewpoint and is the center of that viewpoint. Splitting his attentionoften finds him occupying several viewpoints. He is capable of assuming many. Where he isaware of being aware is, however, his central viewpoint; and, although this may becommunicated with or interlocked to some other viewpoint which he could call his own -- evenon some other planet or here on earth -- he is yet as himself the center of assignation ofdimension where he is and as he is.In many preclears this becomes so blurred that he does not know whether he is in orout of the body. Here even the center of viewpoint has been overridden by MEST assignationof dimension.52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"An essential in agreement with any illusion is the acceptance of the dimensions itassigns or that one may assign to it, Space is no more complicated than this, but when apreclear has been overridden by enforced assignation of dimension to an enormous degree, hisown viewpoint may be found to be scattered or dispersed. It is this condition which finds thepreclear unable to tell whether he is in or out of his body; when this condition exists he is in thestate of being incapable of confronting the MEST universe, even to the point of asserting theownership of a center of viewpoint.The solution of this problem is simple, in principle, although it may require many hoursof auditing. Where the preclear has a certainty of center of viewpoint he exteriorizesimmediately and can become a theta clear in a very few hours; when he has been compressedby counter-efforts and emotions into an acceptance of MEST dimension to the point where hecannot even be certain of a center of viewpoint, it is necessary to recover this center ofviewpoint in order to recover a point from which space can be assigned and, even moreimportantly to the auditor, where the preclear can be exteriorized easily and in a knowingcondition.One of the first “tricks” in auditing is to get the preclear to look from the center of hishead at his environment and the room. He very often sees it clearly and as it is and does, bythis, adjust his vision to see through his ridges. Even an occluded case can sometimes do this,and can then be exteriorized rapidly. The next “trick” is to find some segment of theenvironment which the preclear can see and ask him what is in the areas where he can seenothing or does not wish to see. He will say this or that may be in these areas. The auditor thenhas him create those things or change those things and shift those things which he is afraid maybe in those areas until he is no longer interested, at which time he can envision the actualsurroundings. By continuing this “trick” of rehabilitation of potential occupation of space (for apreclear will not occupy space which he considers dangerous), the preclear may be found toexteriorize suddenly and sometimes with violence. In such a case he believes himself to beoccupying yet another space, hiding perhaps in the darkness of deep MEST space, as well as ina body. Routine orientation and creative processing remedies this.By making the preclear alter the body he is occupying, making mock-ups which hesuperimposes and changes around in disagreement with the MEST universe -- upside downand right side up -- he becomes better able to have a viewpoint from which he can create spaceor from which he can at least handle MEST universe space.The preclear who does not exteriorize readily is not sure he is here at all and, indeed, hemay be co-occupying other areas. A study of the preclear with the E-meter, locating him inother spaces and bringing him into the space where he is being audited, can best be done withcreative processing, not by running facsimiles, for these only make him disperse even further.This preclear often has difficulties with time and has space confused with time. Time is nothandled by moving space; time is handled simply by having and not having. The MESTuniverse insists that anything that disappears must have gone somewhere; thus the preclear issaddled with the belief that he must create space to put things in whenever time changes.Having the preclear conceive time change in the space which he occupies by refusing to let himgo on looking at it in yesterday or to see it in tomorrow, but simply making him know that it isnow in yesterday and the space is the same, does much to rehabilitate his orientation.Drills in which space is assigned are highly beneficial to any preclear, and particularlyso to those preclears who do not exteriorize readily or who cannot easily find themselves whenthey are out of their body. Simply have the preclear disagree with dimensions round him andsee them with purposeful, creative distortion and he will at length focalize his viewpoint so thathe can handle space and know that he is the center. A being can be knowingly in many placesbut being scattered into many places unknowingly is the worst of conditions. Creation and DestructionSelf-determinism seeks as its goal the attainment of the goal of theta itself.53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Theta has the capability of locating matter and energy in time and space and of creatingtime and space.Any action requires space and time, for space and time are necessary to motion.Motion can be defined as change of location in space, and any change of locationrequires time.Thus we have an interacting triangle, one corner of which could be labelled space,another corner time, and the third energy. Matter is not included in the triangle because matteris apparently cohesion and adhesion of energy.The cycle of a universe could be said to be the cycle of creation, growth, conservation,decay and destruction. This is the cycle of an entire universe or any part of that universe; it isalso the cycle of life forms.This would compare to the three actions of energy which are Start, Change and Stop,where creation is Start, growth is enforced Change, conservation and decay are inhibitedChange and destruction is Stop.The two extremes of the cycle -- creation and destruction or, in the terms of motion,Start and Stop -- are interdependent and are consecutive.There could be no creation without destruction; as one must eradicate the tenementbefore building the apartment house, so, in the material universe, must destruction and creationbe intermingled. A good action could be said to be one which accomplished the maximalconstruction with minimal destruction; a bad action could be said to be one which accomplishedthe minimal construction with maximal destruction.That which is started and cannot be stopped and that which is stopped without beingpermitted to run a course, are alike actions bordering upon the psychotic. Unreasonablenessitself is defined by persistence in one or the other of these courses of starting something whichcannot be stopped (as in the case of an A-bomb) or of stopping something before it has reacheda beneficial stage.Unlimited creation without any destruction would be insane; unlimited destructionwithout any creation would be similarly insane.In actuality, insanity can be grouped and classified, detected and remedied by a study ofcreation and destruction.An individual will not be responsible for that on which he will not use force. Thedefinition of responsibility is entirely within this boundary. That person will not be responsiblein that sphere where he cannot tolerate force, and if one discovers in an individual where hewill not use force, he will find where that individual will also refuse to be responsible.An assessment of a case can be done by use of the accompanying graph. We see herecreation with an arrow pointing straight downward and find there the word insane, and, underthis, we list the dynamics. Wherever along any of these dynamics the individual cannotconceive himself to be able to create, on that level he will be found aberrated to the degree thathe does not believe himself able to create. This might be thought to introduce an imponderablebut such is not the case, for the individual is most aberrated on the first dynamic and, rightly orwrongly, conceives that he could not create himself. This goes to the extent, in homo sapiens,of believing that one cannot create a body and, rightly or wrongly, one is then most aberratedon the subject of his body.Potentially, because of the character of theta itself, an individual in an absolute andpossibly unattainable state, should be able to create a universe. Certainly it is true that everyman is his own universe and possesses within himself all the capabilities of a universe.54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"To the extreme right of the graph we have the word destroy and an arrow pointingdownwards toward insanity and, beneath this, the list of the dynamics.

Use of this graph and these principles enable the auditor to assess hitherto hiddencompulsions and obsessions on the part of the preclear. This is an auditing graph. If one looksat it another way than that of an auditor, he finds there laid out what has been occasionally55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"posed as a philosophy of existence. Friedrich Nietzsche, in his book “Thus SpakeZarathustra,” presents as a desirable code of conduct unlimited willingness to destroy.Philosophically the graph has little or no workability. In order to survive in any universe,conduct must be regulated by a sense of ethics. Ethics are possible on a reasonable level onlywhen the individual is high on the tone-scale. In the absence of such height, ethics aresupplanted by morals, which can be defined as an arbitrary code of conduct not necessarilyrelated to reason. Should one attempt to regulate his conduct on the basis of unlimited creationor destruction, he would find it necessary to act entirely without judgment to put hisphilosophy into effect. It is noteworthy that the late Nazi regime can serve as a clinical test ofthe workability of a scheme of things wherein unlimited creation and destruction are held as anideal. I heard a rumor lately that Adolf Hitler was dead. Be, Have and DoThe physicist has long been on a carousel with regard to the component parts of thematerial universe.He has had to define time in terms of space and energy, space in terms of time andenergy, and energy in terms of time and space, and matter as a combination of all three. Whenthree factors exist at such an altitude in a science, there can be no further clarification unless thematerial can be related to experience of an equal magnitude.The current definition in Scientology has this liability: if self-determinism is thelocation of matter and energy in time and space, and the creation, change and destruction oftime and space, then there is no comparable data by which to evaluate this level. The physicisthas found the interrelationship of time, space and energy to be invaluable and has, indeed,produced a civilization from this interrelationship. Just as, with our definition of self-determinism, it is possible to de-aberrate an individual and increase his potentialities in a waynever before suspected possible, and with a speed which exceeds all past estimates even in thescience of Scientology.Because we are now working from a higher understanding than time, space andenergy, it is possible to compare these to experience in such a way as to broaden their use andmodify their force or increase it. Control of time, space and energy comes now well within ourcapabilities.Space, time and energy in experience become Be, Have and Do, the component parts ofexperience itself.Space could be said to be BE. One can be in a space without change and without time;one can also be, without action.The essence of time is apparently possession. When possession ceases, the record oftime ceases. Without possession change cannot be observed; in the presence of possessionchange can be observed. Thus it is deduced that time and possession are interdependent.The past could be subdivided into Had, Should Have Had, Did Not Have, and Got,Should Have Gotten, Did Not Get, and Gave, Should Have Given, Did Not Give.The present could be subdivided into Have, Should Have, Do Not Have, and Giving,Should Be Giving, Not Giving, and Receiving, Should Be Receiving, Not Receiving.The future is subdivisible into Will Have, Should Have, Will Not Have, and Getting,Will Be Getting, Will Not Be Getting, and Will Receive, Will Not Receive.In each of the above, past, present and future, the word would apply for any individualor any part of the dynamics to all the other dynamics.The way one knows there was a past is by knowing the conditions of the past. Themost revelatory of these is the facsimile which was taken in the past. However, without any56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"important possession in the present stemming forward from the past, the past becomesunimportant; or, because possession ceased, the past is obliterated. The single matter of thebody of a past life not being in the present life invalidates the existence of the past life to theindividual who then does not -- or does not care to -- remember it. Yet the facsimiles can benevertheless effective upon him.Similarly the individual does not conceive to any extent time, past the death of hisbody, since he will have no body.Energy, whether in the field of thought, emotion or effort, can be summed into DO. Itrequires beingness and havingness in order to achieve doingness. Here we have the static ofspace acting against the kinetic of possession to produce action in the field of thought, emotionor effort, the various categories of doingness.Should one care to test this as a process on a preclear, he will find that the missingportions of the preclear’s past have to do with loss of something. Loss itself is the single mostaberrative factor in living. It has long been known in this science that the release of a griefcharge was an important single improvement in the preclear. Grief is entirely and onlyconcerned with loss or threatened loss. Pain itself can be defined in terms of loss, for pain isthe threat which tells one that loss of mobility or a portion of the body or the environment isimminent. Man has pain so thoroughly identified with loss that in some languages the wordsare synonymous.Loss is always identified with HAVE, for if one doesn’t have, one cannot lose.The Hindu sought to depart into his Nirvana by refusing to have anything to do withhaving. He sought thus to promote himself into Being. He saw that so long as he retained agrasp on a body in any degree he was Having, and thus was pressed into Doing.Having and Being are often identified to the degree that many people attemptexclusively to Be only by Having. The capitalist judges his own beingness solely by the degreeof possession, not even vaguely by the degree of action he is able to execute.Possessions absorb and enforce time; only without possessions would one be able toregulate time at will. This is a singular attribute of the cleared theta clear, and to him possessionof MEST is extremely unimportant.One can make up for a lack of Having by Doing, and by Doing accomplishes Havingand thus regulates time.Having enhances either Being or Doing, as is sometimes severely recognized by onewho would like to take a vacation or a trip to foreign lands.Doing can enhance either Being or Having: a balanced Doing slants in both directions,but if one does without Having, his Being increases, as is well known by anyone who insistson doing favors without recompense, and without gain.There is an optimum speed of Doing. If one travels less than that speed he has littleBeing and Having; if one travels greater than that speed, he has to abandon both Being andHaving. This is applicable especially to the MEST universe. The case of a race driver is inpoint. He must assume a contempt for Being and Having in order to achieve the speeds hedoes.When change is too rapid both Beingness and Havingness suffer. When change is tooslow both Beingness and Havingness suffer. For Change is essentially the redirection ofenergy.In the assessment of a preclear one can easily trace, by use of the triangle, Be, Haveand Do, and by placing this over a second triangle with space at the point of Be, time at thepoint of Have and energy at the point of Do, where the preclear is overbalanced and why thepreclear cannot handle time or why he is trying to occupy too much space without being able to57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"fill it, or why his life is complicated with too much havingness and has reduced his beingnessto nought.In the MEST universe as well as in a constructed universe, these three factors should bebalanced for orderly progress.Creative ProcessingThe whole of the data covered in this volume is utilized in creative processing. Whenone has mastered the component parts of the mind and the interrelationships of space, energy,items and experience, he will find creative processing surprisingly easy to apply and productiveof very swift results. The goal of this process is the rehabilitation of as much of the thetan’scapability as possible to permit him to utilize or be free of bodies as he chooses and, even inlesser magnitude, to rid the preclear of psycho-somatics, eradicate compulsions, obsessionsand inhibitions, to raise his reaction time and intelligence level. This process does whatever hasbeen previously intended by earlier processes -- utilizing a knowledge of these in order toassess the state of the preclear, and in order to parallel this difficulty with creation, change anddestruction of mock-ups.Gradient scales are vitally necessary in the application of creative processing. The term“gradient scale” can apply to anything, and means a scale of condition graduated from zero toinfinity. Absolutes are considered to be unobtainable. Depending on the direction the scale isgraduated, there could be an infinity of wrongness and an infinity of rightness. Thus thegradient scale of rightness would run from the theoretical but unobtainable zero of rightness,up to the theoretical infinity of rightness. A gradient scale of wrongness would run from a zeroof wrongness to an infinity of wrongness. The word “gradient” is meant to define lessening orincreasing degrees of condition. The difference between one point on a graduated scale andanother point could be as different or as wide as the entire range of the scale itself, or it couldbe so tiny as to need the most minute discernment for its establishment. The gradient scale ofthe creation of a being could be -- but in creative processing generally is not -- concerned withtime. In creative processing, the gradient scale, as it would refer to the creation of a person,could be, first, the envisionment of an area where the person might have been or might be; thenthe envisionment of an area the person commonly frequented; at last, the creation of a footprintthe person had made, and then perhaps some article of apparel or a possession such as ahandkerchief. The creative steps would then continue until more and more of a person wasestablished, and at last the entire person would have been created. Likewise in the destructionof a person, the gradient scale could, but generally would not, begin with blowing him up ormaking him grow old. If the auditor finds the preclear diffident about destroying an illusion ofsome person, the environment can first be diminished slightly; then perhaps the person’sshadow might be shortened, and so on until the entire person could be destroyed. The essenceof gradient scale work is to do as much creation, change or destruction in terms of illusion asthe preclear can accomplish with confidence, and to go from successful step to greater stepuntil an entire success in destruction, alteration or creation (or their companion states ofexperience, such as start, change and stop) is accomplished.The mind works easily if led through successive successes into a complete confidence.The mind can be confused and set back enormously by demanding that it do too much too fast.The same “too much” can be accomplished by requesting of the mind that it do small portionsof the task; this does not mean that processing should go slowly or that illusions which areeasy to create, change or destroy should have much time spent on them. It does mean that assoon as an auditor has established a disability on the part of the preclear in creating illusions ofcertain places, persons, conditions, things, colors or any other thing in this or any otheruniverse, he approaches the subject gradually by gradient scale and by accomplishing repeatedsuccesses with the preclear of greater and greater magnitude, finally achieving a completebanishment of the disability.The reason a preclear cannot alter a postulate, or change or start or stop, lies in theinfluence upon him of his agreements and experiences in the MEST and other universes. 58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"To run out these agreements and experiences as such would be, in part, to agree withthem over again. The mind is actually quite free to alter postulates and change its owncondition, if permitted to do so at a speed that it finds comfortable. The mind will not take widedivergences which seem to it to tend toward its own diminishment or destruction. It was by agradient scale of agreement that he came at last to accept and very nearly succumb to the MESTuniverse itself. The build-up of illusion was so slow and insidious that only the closestassessment would reveal to the preclear and the auditor how far these tiny steps of agreementled at last.The motto of the MEST universe could be said to be: “Thou shalt have no force norillusion, nor thine own space, nor self-made energy or thing, for all illusion is mine and withthat thou shalt agree. If thou art, I shall not be.” By a series of minute agreements, the preclearhas at last given up all his own belief in his ability to make a universe, or even to create andmaintain minor illusions. He does not know or even suspect that he is capable of producingillusions sufficiently strong to be observable by others, and if he thought this were true, hewould attribute it to some mysterious thing and, so short and final are the punishments of theMEST universe, he would tend to shy away from this; but upon his ability to create illusiondepends the very existence of all his hopes and dreams and any beauty he will ever see or feel.In truth, all sensation which he believes to come from these masses of illusory energyknown as the MEST universe, are first implanted through agreement upon what he is toperceive and then perceived again by himself, with the step hidden that he has extended hisown sensation to be felt and perceived by himself. He is fully convinced that the MESTuniverse itself has sensation which it can deliver to him, whereas all the MEST universe has isan enforced agreement which though of no substance, yet by a gradient scale came to be anillusion which seems very masterful to a preclear.To prove the reality and solidity of the MEST universe, the preclear could pound hisfist upon a desk and demonstrate that his fist bed met something. He is making again the errorof implanting sensation and not knowing he has implanted it, for the fist which he pounds onthe desk is a MEST universe fist consisting of MEST universe energy, which is itself a MESTuniverse agreement, and it is meeting a desk which is MEST universe; he is only demonstratingthat when the MEST universe is perceived to impact upon the MEST universe, one can thenimplant a realistic impact and perceive it for his own wonderful edification. Reality, then, is adelusion because it is one’s own illusion which has been disowned by one and is then receivedby one as being another thing.Only by shedding all responsibility for one’s own energy can one fall into this coverttrap. If one is unwilling to be responsible for energy, he is capable of using energy and thennot perceiving that he uses it. One who blames others continually can be discovered to effectmost of the things for which he is blaming other people. In such a way, an individual with the“very best MEST universe, Mark 10,000 ears” takes no responsibility for having implanted thesensation of sound in order to receive the sensation of sound. A preclear as he comes up thetone-scale more and more often catches himself doing this, and even though he does not knowthe principles involved (for no preclear has to be educated in Scientology to receive benefitfrom it), he recognizes that even in the case of a loud crash, his continuation of associationfrom his environment permits him to perceive with others that a crash has taken place of objectswhich he with others continuously recreates solidly, and that he must actually cause for hisown perception the sound of the crash. In that the beingness of an individual is actuallyextended for miles in all directions around him, if not much further, any idea or thought or pastthought (as there is no past) is part of his beingness, and so he must continually strive to be“faithful to his agreements with the MEST universe.”To undo this state of affairs it is only necessary to rehabilitate the awareness of thepreclear that he himself is capable of creating illusions. As he rehabilitates this faculty, thepreclear, without any coaching or evaluation on the part of the auditor, begins to recognize thathis viewpoint is expanding and that he is becoming all-pervasive, but that he can collect hisawareness at any point, and that the “brutal reality” all around him is continuouslymanufactured by himself out of agreements and association with other viewpoints.59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"So long as he is fixed in a condition where he is in agreement with all spaces andviewpoints, he sees and feels automatically with all other such viewpoints. He is above thelevel of energy, if one can use the term, on the same wavelength with all other beingness, acondition which does not permit differentiation. As he rehabilitates his abilities in independentcreation, he can change this “wavelength” at will, and can go into or out of agreement with allother points of beingness.The matter of perceiving, then, becomes entirely a matter of self-choice. It is, forinstance, quite startling of a preclear to discover that as soon as he is free of the ridges of thebody (which is to say, when he has discovered he can change his viewpoint) that he is alreadypartly out of agreement with other viewpoints, and that the MEST universe becomes slightlyjumbled. He is apt to be very anxious about this, for it is in conflict with the agreements towhich he is subject. He immediately may struggle very hard to regain a state of affairs wherebyhe can view the MEST universe as everyone else views it.Indeed, the auditor must continually be on guard to prevent the preclear from attemptingto reassume these agreements. A badly-trained auditor can always be identified by the fact thathe shares the preclear’s anxiety that the preclear view the environment as the environment“should be.” The reason why a non-cleared auditor does not do well with these processes isthat he is very anxious for the preclear to continue agreement with all others and to perceive thesurroundings as exactly when exteriorized as he did when he was looking through MEST eyesand perceptions (which is to say, when the preclear was at his exact, agreed-upon point ofviewpoint).The ability to perceive the MEST universe is the ability to agree. The preclear’saccuracy of perception of the MEST universe is of no consequence. An auditor can act topermit or even encourage a preclear to try to see, feel and hear the MEST universe whenexteriorized long before the preclear is prepared to do so with equanimity. The auditor whendoing this, is dramatizing his own urge to agree with viewpoints and perceive. A preclear whoexteriorizes readily may find with a shock that he is not perceiving the MEST universe as hecommonly supposes it should be perceived and quickly go back into his body to reassurehimself that he is “keeping his contract of agreement.”If the auditor demands that the preclear perceive the environment when exteriorized,then the auditor will discover that the preclear will drop in tone and that, when he has gone intohis body once more, a great deal of patient auditing is necessary to regain the preclear’sconfidence in himself. The preclear exteriorizing may find himself in all sorts of space and timecross-ups, for he has insufficient command of space and energy to independently sort outviewpoints when unassisted by the orientation of the MEST body itself, which is, of course, indebased and degraded agreement of a very set nature.There are two “shuns.” These are invalidation and evaluation.The auditor must eschew them vigorously. The major invalidation which could bepracticed in using Scientology 8-8008 would be a demand that the preclear see the environmentas it is seen through MEST perception or to criticize him for not being able to do so. Themajority of the preclear’s perceptions may be correct but some percentage of his perception isgoing to be enough “off wavelength” with other agreement viewpoints to cause him to perceivestrangely.After a very large amount of auditing, when the preclear has regained his ability tocreate with considerable solidity his own illusions, it will be found that the preclear can at willperceive the MEST universe and can do so with accuracy. He can further, without the aid of abody, move objects and do a thousand other “interesting tricks” which could very well beviewed with considerable awe, for they have not been seen on earth in recorded history buthave lived in legend.Using Standard Operating Procedure, Issue 3, as given in this volume, the auditor yettakes a very thorough assessment of his preclear with an E-Meter. He discovers, in accordancewith information in this book, what the preclear is unable to start, change, stop; create, alter,destroy; be, do or have; differentiate, associate or identify; on each and every one of the eight60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"dynamics and their component parts. The auditor makes a complete list. This is the Can’t list.Exteriorized, if possible, or interiorized as in the later numbered cases, the preclear is thenmade to “mock-up” illusions about each one of these Can’ts and to change the size, characterand position of the illusion or any part thereof in space, shift it in time simply by knowing ithas been shifted by him, until at last the preclear is able to handle the whole object of the Can’twith complete facility.Can’ts may be an inability to destroy women or snakes or specific persons, or createmachinery, or write legibly. The preclear is requested to accomplish by illusions the smallestgradient of the Can’t with which he can successfully start; and, under auditor direction, bymoving this small portion of the whole here and there in space, tipping it this way and that andmaking it, in particular, disobey “natural laws” in the MEST universe, the preclear is led to anability to create, change or destroy the Can’t.The Can’t is also the Must. Can’t is an inhibition; Must is an enforcement. What mustthe preclear do and what must be done to him? By whom? By creative processing and gradientscales, he achieves mock-ups until each one of these musts becomes a “Can if I want to, butdon’t have to.”There are also the Desires. These are the cravings for sensation or possession oridentification which brought the preclear into and made him continue agreements. Behind everycase the Desires are paramount and of greater importance than the Can’ts. Why does he desirebodies? Why is his second dynamic aberrated? Why does he feel he cannot be free? Can hedifferentiate between his own actual wantingness and the wantingness of MEST itself which istrying to have him? The desires are resolved by creative processing wherein the preclear doesmock-ups of the necessary acts which he desires or the necessary behaviors which brought himinto agreement until he can at last laugh at them.In that creative processing does not take long in terms of time, the assessment list canafford to be very broad and to cover every possible phase through the system of the dynamicsand the cycles of action.This is a list of things the preclear must be able to do with an illusion: Create the condition, energy or object Conserve it Protect it Control it Hide it Change it Age it Make it go backwards on a cycle of action Perceive it with all perceptions Shift it at will in time Rearrange it Duplicate it Turn it upside down or on the side at will Make it disobey MEST laws Be it Not be it Destroy it.In order to accomplish these things, if the whole of any condition cannot be fulfilled bygradient scale some tiny portion of the condition must be fulfilled.When a small condition has been fulfilled, the condition is then enlarged until the wholecondition can be fulfilled.That preclear who cannot get even a shadow of an illusion so that he can perceive it inany manner must be coaxed to see white spots, black spots, of his own creation, and to changethose in space and time, enlarge and contract them, until he has a certain command and control61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"of black and white. This must be done with such a preclear without regard to the number ofhours it takes or the patience of the drill. It can be done with the eyes open or closed,whichever the preclear finds best.When the preclear is discovered to be trying to prevent a motion or condition, theauditor should magnify that very condition with new mock-ups related to it, i.e., if objectskeep rushing in on the preclear, mock up objects rushing in until the action is enormouslymagnified but under the preclear’s complete control. If the preclear cannot start something,make him stop it. If he cannot reverse a direction, make him change the nature of the objectwhich he is trying to reverse enough times to permit him to reverse the original disability. If thepreclear cannot create something, have him create anything even vaguely associated with it, andby association at last have him mock up the actual thing.The essence of creative processing is moving objects in space when they have beenmocked up. They are moved near and far, to the right, left, behind the preclear, below his feet,above his head and in front of him. He must know that he has changed the location of theobject. If he cannot make a large change, have him do a small change of location. If he cannotdo a small change of location, have him alter the object by turning it different colors, or byenlarging or contracting it, or by pushing it away or bringing it near him, until he can make itmove sideways. In failing to do this, have him do a change with some allied object.The essence of creative processing is a continuation of success. Be careful not to givethe preclear things which make him fail. Do not let his failures mount up. Estimate the preclearand pay attention to what he is doing; find out from him continually the condition of hisillusions, if you yourself as an auditor cannot see them. Putting objects into yesterday ortomorrow or well into the future or into the past is vitally necessary to processing.Control of the illusion is the essence of commands. The preclear must be able to create,grow, conserve, decay and destroy; start, change and stop; be, do and have; differentiate,associate and identify; handle in space, with energy and in time, any object, actual or mythical,in all the eight dynamics, and with high preference given to anything which disobeys “naturallaws” of the MEST universe.That auditor with a high order of imagination who is himself clear, finds mock-upsvery easy to “think up” and request of the preclear, but it is not necessary to have such animagination, as a routine assessment will discover immediately that the most ordinary thingsfall into the Can’t, Must and Desire brackets in the preclear’s life.The preclear will be discovered on the first dynamic, quite ordinarily, not to be able tocreate, change or destroy, especially destroy, his own body or bodies in which he thinks he isencased within his own body (old time-track bodies such as a Fifth Invader Force body). Hewill be found to be incapable in many directions with facsimiles, communication lines andother matters on the first dynamic alone. On the second dynamic, many incapabilities will cometo view, and so on along all the dynamics. On the fifth dynamic, he will quite ordinarily befound incapable of handling snakes, spiders, vicious fish, bacteria, wild animals and domesticpets. On the seventh dynamic he will be discovered unable to handle other thetans, even in themost elementary fashion of bringing two dots of light into proximity and then separating them(an exercise which blows head ridges in many preclears quite explosively). On the eighthdynamic his limitations quite ordinarily become too obvious for comment, but on each andevery dynamic he must be able to do or fulfil any of the above cycles or conditions.Standard Operating Procedure tells how to exteriorize a thetan. Creative processing,rising-scale postulate changing, postulate processing, are then necessary to bring him toward astate of a cleared theta clear. The state of theta clear simply demands that the preclear remainsoutside his body when the body itself is hurt, and the state is adequate to prevent his beingtrapped again by a body except in unusual circumstances. There is no guarantee of longcontinuance in the condition. The state of cleared theta clear is, however, another thing, for itmeans a person who is able to create his own universe; or, living in the MEST universe, is ableto create illusions perceivable by others at will, to handle MEST universe objects withoutmechanical means and to have and feel no need of bodies or even the MEST universe to keephimself and his friends interested in existence. 62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE 8The basic technology of this operating procedure is to be found in The Factors,Scientology 8-8008 and at the Professional School.In using this operating procedure, the auditor should give every heed to theAUDITOR’S CODE. Further, he should audit the preclear in the presence of a third person oranother auditor.This operating procedure is best done by an auditor who has been thoroughly trained inall processes involving the reduction of the past and its incidents; the untrained auditor mayencounter manifestations with which only a professional auditor would be familiar.This operating procedure retains the most workable methods of preceding proceduresand, in itself, emphasizes POSITIVE GAIN and the present and future rather than negativegain of eradication of the past.The thetan, exteriorized and rehabilitated, can handle and remedy by direct address ofhis own energy to the body and the removal of old energy deposits, all body malfunctions ormental aberrations attacked by older processes. The goal of this procedure is not therehabilitation of the body but of the thetan. Rehabilitation of a body incidentally ensues.The goal of this procedure is OPERATING THETAN, a higher goal than earlierprocedures.The auditor tests the preclear for each step from Step I on until he finds a step thepreclear can do. The auditor then completes this step and then the next higher step until thethetan is exteriorized. With the thetan exteriorized, the auditor now completes all seven stepsregardless of the step performed before exteriorization. He may complete all these steps and allparts of these steps rapidly. But they must be done to obtain a theta clear and they must be donethoroughly to obtain an OPERATING THETAN.The techniques involved herein were developed by L. Ron Hubbard and after testing byhim, were tested by other auditors on a wide variety of cases. It is doubtful if any earlierprocess of any kind in any age has been as thoroughly validated as this operating procedure.However, it works only when used as stated. Disorganized fragments of this material, givenother names and emphasis, may be found to be harmful. Irresponsible and untrained use of thisprocedure is not authorized. Capricious or quasi-religious exteriorization of the thetan for otherpurposes than the restoration of his ability and self-determinism should be resisted by anybeing. The goal of this process is freedom for the individual to the betterment of the many.STEP I -- Ask preclear to be three feet behind his head. If stable there, have him be invarious pleasant places until any feeling of scarcity of viewpoints is resolved; then have him bein several undesirable places, then several pleasant places; then have him be in a slightlydangerous place, then in more and more dangerous places until he can sit in the center of thesun. Be sure to observe gradient scale of ugliness and dangerousness of places. Do not letpreclear fail. Then do remaining steps with preclear exteriorized.STEP II -- Have preclear mock up own body. If he does this easily and clearly, havehim mock up own body until he slips out of it. When he is exteriorized and knows itthoroughly (the conditions of all exteriorization) do Step I. If his mock-up was not clear, go toStep III immediately.STEP III -- SPACATION: Have preclear close his eyes and find upper corners of theroom. Have him sit there, not thinking, refusing to think of anything, interested only in thecorners until he is completely exteriorized without strain. Then do a spacation (constructingown space with eight anchor points and holding it stable without effort) and go to Step I. Ifpreclear was unable to locate corners of the room easily with his eyes closed, go to Step IV.63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"STEP IV -- EXPANDED GITA: (This is an extension of “Give and Take” processing.)Test preclear to see if he can get a mock-up he can see, no matter how vague.

EXPANDED GITA remedies contra-survival abundance andscarcity. It will be found that before one can accept a very scarce (to him) thing, he has to giveit away. A person with a milk allergy must be able to give away, in mock-up, enormousquantities of milk, wasting it, before he can accept any himself.

Thus there is no single clearing button and search for itis at the dictate of a circuit, the mechanism of circuits being to search for something hidden.Thus your preclear may begin to compute and philosophize and seek to find the “button” thatwill release all this. All this releases all the buttons so tell him to relax and go on with theprocess every time he starts to compute.NOTE: Running the above will bring to the surface without further attention the“computation on the case” and the service facsimile. Do not audit these. Run Expanded Gita.STEP V -- PRESENT TIME DIFFERENTIATION. EXTERIORIZATION OFSCENERY. Have preclear, with his body’s eyes, study and see the difference between similarreal objects such as the two legs of a chair, the spaces between the back, two cigarettes, twotrees, two girls. He must see and study the objects, it is not enough to remember objects. Thedefinition of a CASE V is “no mock-ups, only blackness.” Have him continue this processuntil he is alert. Use liberally and often.Then exteriorize by having the preclear close his eyes and move actual places on Earthunder him, preferably places he has not been. Have him bring these up to him, find two similarthings in the scene and observe the difference between them. Move him over oceans and citiesuntil he is certain that he is exteriorized.Then, preferably while exteriorized, have him do STEP I. This case has to know before he can be. His viewpoint is in the past. Give him presenttime viewpoints until he is a STEP I by the methods given for STEP V.(COMMENT: PRESENT TIME DIFFERENTIATION is a very good general techniqueand resolves chronic somatics and improves tone.)STEP VI -- A-R-C STRAIGHT WIRE using next to last list of SELF ANALYSIS INSCIENTOLOGY which asks preclear to recall something really real to him, etc. Then use thelists in SELF ANALYSIS. This level is the neurotic level. It is identified by the preclear havingmock-ups which will not persist or which won’t go away. Use also PRESENT TIMEDIFFERENTIATION. Then go to STEP IV. At any drop in tone, return case to STEP VI.STEP VII -- PSYCHOTIC CASES.* Whether in or out of body, the psychotic looks tobe in such desperate straits that people often err in thinking desperate measures are necessary.Use the lightest possible methods. Give case space and freedom where possible. HavePsychotic IMITATE (not mock up) various things. Have him do PRESENT TIMEDIFFERENTIATION. Get him to tell the difference between things by actual touch. Have himlocate, differentiate and touch things that are really real to him (real objects or items). Ifinaccessible mimic him with own body whatever he does until he comes into communication.Have him locate corners of the room and hold them without thinking. As soon as hiscommunication is up, go to STEP VI but be very sure he changes any mock-up around until he65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"knows it is a mock-up, that it exists and that he himself made it. Do not run engrams. He ispsychotic because viewpoints in present time are so scarce that he has gone into the past forviewpoints which at least he knew existed. By PRESENT TIME DIFFERENTIATION, bytactile on objects, return his idea of an abundance of viewpoint in present time. If he has beengiven electric shock, do not process it or any other brutality. Work him for very brief periodsfor his attention span is short. Always work psychotics with another person or a companionpresent.NOTE: ALL STEPS FOR ALL CASES. IF IN DOUBT AS TO CONDITION OFCASE, TEST WITH STEP VI.NOTE: An Operating Thetan must also be able to manufacture particles of admirationand force in abundance.STEP I -- The Operating Thetan must be able to manufacture and experience to hiscomplete satisfaction all sensations including pain in mock-up form and all energies such asadmiration and force. It will be found that some STEP I cases will not be able to manufactureadmiration particles.STEP II -- Be very careful not to make a lower step preclear, while still in a body,mock up his own body too long. Any mock-up will appear if it is simply put there oftenenough and long enough -- providing the preclear doesn’t spin in the process. The long termmanufacture of mock-ups of one’s own body and of admiration may not produce quite theresults expected -- communication lines which should remain shut may open with bad results.These lines that are shut appear like hard, black cords to the preclear.There are two types of techniques in general: POSITIVE GAIN and NEGATIVE GAINas defined in the above text. POSITIVE CAN BE ADMINISTERED IN UNLIMITEDAMOUNTS WITHOUT HARM. Negative gain techniques such as the reduction of engramsand locks double-terminalling, black and white, are often limited in the length of time they canbe given: after a few hundred hours of early type auditing the case could be found to slump.Thus we have in POSITIVE GAIN the unlimited technique which improves the analyticalmind; in NEGATIVE GAIN we have a limited (in terms of the time it can be audited)technique. In SOP 8 the following steps and processes may be audited without limit: STEP I,STEP III, STEP V, STEP VI, STEP VII.The following steps are limited and should not be audited many hours without changingto another type (unlimited for a while, after which the following steps could be resumed):STEP II, STEP IV.THE FOLLOWING STEPS CAN BE USED ON GROUPS: Step III, Step V, part 1and part 2, Step VI, Step VII.The following is a list of effective procedures as of April 28th, 1953. If a procedure islabelled (U) it is unlimited and could be audited thousands of hours and only improve a case: iflabelled (L) it is limited and must be handled with discretion and alternated with an unlimitedtechnique: if it is labelled (S) it is seldom used: if labelled (A) it is used in assists.Engram Running, Book One (L) (A)* Grief and Other Secondaries (L) (A)Lock Scanning (L) (A)Emotional Curves (L) (S)Service Facsimile Chain as Engrams (L) (S)Effort Processing (L) (A)ARC Straight Wire, Science of Survival (A)Negative Exteriorization (L)Ridge Running (L)* Ded-Dedex (L) (S) (Current lifetime used for fast releases)Motivator-Overt (L) (S)Matched Terminals in Mock-ups (L) (S)Double Terminals in Mock-ups (L) (A)66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"* Positive Exteriorization (Step I SOP 8) (U)* Own Body Mock-up (Step II SOP 8) (L)* Spacation (Step III SOP 8 and General Usage) (U)* Expanded Gita (Step IV SOP 8) (L)* Present Time Differentiation (Step V SOP 8) (U)* Exteriorization by Scenery (Step V SOP 8) (U) * Self Analysis in Scientology and British S.A. in Dianetics (same volume)(Step VI SOP 8) (U)* Imitation of Things (Step VII SOP 8) (U)* Creative Processing (as in Scientology 8-8008) (U)The symbol (*) before a process above means it is recommended.ADDITIONAL NOTE ON EXPANDED GITA: The governing rule here is that thepreclear craves exactly what he has and must waste whatever he doesn’t have. It is better, inthe opinion of a thetan, to have anything no matter how “bad” rather than have nothing. Hecraves those things which are scarce but he can’t even have those things which are scarcest. Inorder to have what he cannot have he first must be able to waste it (in mock-up) in quantity. Anabbreviated form of this process would involve, over and over, wasting, accepting underduress, the following items in turn:TRY FIRST: HEALTHY BODIES, STRONG BODIES, GOOD PERCEPTION,GOOD RECALL, VIEWPOINTS, PAIN, WORK, FREEDOM FOR OTHERS TO HAVEVIEWPOINTS.The preclear cannot be free himself until he has freed others. This does not work out inthe MEST universe but it works out in mock-ups.CIRCUITS GO INTO ACTION ON MANY OF THESE PROCESSES: DON’TPERMIT YOUR PRECLEAR TO THINK, DON’T BE INTERESTED IN WHAT HETHINKS, FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS RULE WILL CAUSE THE PROCESS TO FAIL.COMPARISON OF MEST OBJECTS TO MOCK-UPS RESOLVES WHYTHETANS MAKE FACSIMILES AND DISCLOSES TO THE PRECLEAR THEMECHANISM, THIS IS A GOOD PROCESS AND CAN BE DONE AT STEP IV AS ANADDITIONAL PART OF IV. HAVE PRECLEAR MAKE A MOCK-UP THE SAME AS AMEST OBJECT AND PUT THE MOCK-UP ALONGSIDE OF THE MEST OBJECT ANDTHEN COMPARE THEM. THE MOCK-UPS WILL GRADUALLY IMPROVE, THEN KEYOUT THE MECHANISM THAT MAKES FACSIMILES.67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"CERTAINTY PROCESSINGSOP-8 Appendix No. 2The anatomy of maybe consists of uncertainties and is resolved by the processing ofcertainties. It is not resolved by the processing of uncertainties.An uncertainty is held in suspense solely because the preclear is holding on so hard tocertainties. The basic thing he is holding on to is “I have a solution,” “I have no solution.” Oneof these is positive, the other is negative. A complete positive and a complete negative are alikea certainty. The basic certainty is “There is something,” “There is nothing.” A person can becertain there is something, he can be certain there is nothing.“There is something,” “There is nothing” resolves chronic somatics in this order. Onegets the preclear to have the center of the somatic say “There is something here,” “There isnothing here.” Then he gets the center of the somatic to say “There is nothing there,” “There issomething there.” Then the auditor has the preclear toward the somatic say “There is somethingthere,” “There is nothing there.” And then he gets the preclear to say about himself “There issomething here.” “There is nothing here.” This is a very fast resolution of chronic somatics;quite ordinarily three or four minutes of this will resolve an acute state and fifteen or twentyminutes of it will resolve a chronic state.This matter of certainties goes further. It has been determined by my investigations thatthe reason behind what is happening is the desire of a cause to bring about an effect.Something is better than nothing, anything is better than nothing. Any circuit, any effect, anyanything, is better than nothing. If you will match terminals in brackets “There is nothing,” youwill find that a lot of your preclears become very ill. This should be turned around into “Thereis something.”The way one does Matched Terminals is to have the preclear facing the preclear or hisfather facing his father; in other words, two of each of anything, one facing the other. Thesetwo things will discharge one into the other, thus running off the difficulty. By bracket wemean, of course, running this with the preclear putting them up as himself to himself as thoughthey were put up by somebody else, the somebody else facing the somebody else, and thematched terminal again put up by others facing others.The clue to all this is positive and negative in terms of certainties. The positive plus thenegative in conflict make an uncertainty. A great number of combinations of things can be run.Here’s a list of the combinations: --The button behind sex is “I can begin life anew,” “I cannot begin life anew,” “I canmake life persist,” “I cannot make life persist,” “I can stop life,” “I cannot stop life, can changelife,” “I cannot change life,” “I can start life”, “I cannot start life.”A very effective process,“Something wrong .., ““Nothing wrong ... “ with “you, me, they, my mind, communications, various allies.”A very basic resolution of the lack of space of an individual is to locate those peopleand those objects which you’ve been using as anchor points such as father, mother and soforth and putting them into matched terminal brackets with this: -- “There is father,” “There isno father,” “There is grandfather,” “There is no grandfather.” In the compulsive line this can bechanged to “There must be no father,” “There must be a father.” One takes all the allies of anindividual and runs them in this fashion.The basic law underneath this is that a person becomes the effect of anything uponwhich he has had to depend. This would tell you immediately that the sixth dynamic, theMEST universe, is the largest dependency of the individual. This can be run out, but then any68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"dynamic can be run out in this fashion. “There is myself,” “There is no self,” and so on up thedynamics. “(Any dynamic) is preventing me from communicating,” “(Any dynamic) is notpreventing me from communicating” is intensely effective. Any such technique can be variedby applying the sub-zero scale as found earlier in this book.One runs any certainty out because he knows that for this certainly there is an oppositenegative certainty and that between these lies a maybe, and that the maybe is suspense in time.The basic operation of the reactive mind is to solve problems. It is based on uncertainties aboutobservation. Thus one runs out certainties of observation. The most general shotgun techniquewould have to do with “There is sex,” “There is no sex,” “There is force,” “There is no force.”This could be run, of course, in terms of matched terminal brackets or even as concepts, butone must not neglect to run the overt act phenomenon which is to say getting somebody elsegetting the concept.The processing out of certainties would then embrace “I have a solution,” “There is nosolution.” These two opposite ends would take care of any individual who was hung on thetrack with some solution, for that solution had its opposite. People who have studied medicinebegin by being certain that medicine works and end by being certain that medicine doesn’twork. They begin by studying psychology on a supposition that it is the solution, and finish upthat it is not the solution. This also happens to superficial students of Dianetics andScientology, thus one should also run “Dianetics is a solution,” “Dianetics is not the solution,”This would also get one off the maybe on the subject.We are essentially processing communications systems. The entire process of auditingis concentrated upon withdrawing communications from the preclear as predicated on the basisof the body and the preclear cannot handle communications. Thus “The preclear can handlecommunication,” “The preclear cannot handle communications” is a shotgun technique whichresolves maybes about his communications.An intensely interesting aspect of Certainty Processing is that it shows up intimatelywhere the preclear is aberrated. Here is the overall basic technique. One runs “There is...,”“There is not...” the following: Communication, talk, letters, love, agreement, sex, pain,work, bodies, minds, curiosity, control, enforcement, compulsion, inhibition, food, money,people. ability, beauty, ugliness, presents and both the top and bottom of the Chart ofAttitudes, positive and negative in each one.Basic in all this is the urge of the preclear to produce an effect, so one can run “I canproduce an effect upon mama,” “I cannot produce an effect upon mama,” and so forth for allallies and one will resolve the fixations of attention on the part of the preclear. Thus fixations ofattention are resolved by Certainty Processing, processing out the production of effect.One can occasionally, if he so desires, process the direct center of the maybe, which isto say doubt itself, in terms of Matched Terminals. This, however, is risky for it throws thepreclear into a general state of doubt.The key to any such processing is the recovery of viewpoints. “I can havegrandfather’s viewpoint,” “I cannot have grandfather’s viewpoint,” and so on, particularlywith sexual partners, will prove intensely interesting on a case. “There are viewpoints,” “Thereare no viewpoints,” “I have a viewpoint,” “I don’t have a viewpoint,” “Blank has aviewpoint,” “Blank has no viewpoint,” resolves problems.One should also realize that when one is processing facsimiles, he is processing at onceenergy, sensation and aesthetics. The facsimile is a picture. The preclear is being affected bypictures mainly, and so “There are no pictures,” “There are pictures,” forwards the case towardhandling pictures; which is to say facsimiles.A person tends to ally himself with somebody whom he considers capable of producinggreater effects than himself, so “I, she, he, it can create greater effects,” “I, she, he, it cancreate no effect,” is quite effective.69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"When one is processing, he is trying to withdraw communications. Reach andWithdraw are the two fundamentals in the action of theta. Must Reach and Cannot Reach, MustWithdraw and Cannot Withdraw are compulsions which, when run in combination, producethe manifestation of insanity in a preclear.“I can reach,” “I can’t reach,” “I can withdraw,” “I can’t withdraw,” open up into thefact that remembering and forgetting are dependent upon the ability to reach and withdraw. Youwill find that a preclear will respond to “You must” or “You can,” “You must not,” “Youcannot,” “There is,” “There is not,” forgetting and remembering.The only reason a person is hanging on to a body or facsimile is because he has lost hisbelief in his ability to create. The rehabilitation of this ability to create is resolved -- forinstance, in a person who has had an ambition to write with “I can write,” “I cannot write” --and so forth. The loss of this creative ability made the person hang on to what he had. The factthat a preclear has forgotten how to or no longer can himself generate force makes him hold onto stores of force. These are very often mistaken by the auditor for facsimiles. The precleardoesn’t care for the facsimile, he simply cares for the force contained in the facsimile becausehe knows he doesn’t have any force any more.It should be kept in mind that reaching and withdrawing are intensely productive ofreaction in a preclear. But that preclear who does not respond to reaching and withdrawing andcertainty thereon, is hung up in a very special condition: he is trying to prevent somethingfrom happening, he is trying to maintain control. If he prevents something from happening, healso prevents auditing from happening. He has lost allies, he has had accidents, and he is hungup at all those points on the track where he feels he should have prevented something fromhappening. This is resolved by running “I must prevent it from happening,” “I cannot preventit from happening.” “I must retain control,” “I must lose all control.”Blackness is the desire to be an effect and the inability to be cause.“I can create grandfather (or ally),” “I cannot create grandfather (or ally),” solvesscarcity of allies. “I want to be aware,” “I want no awareness,” is a technique which is basic inattitudes. Run this as others, in matched terminal brackets or in Expanded GITA.Certainty there is a past, certainty there is no past; certainty there is a future, certaintythere is no future; certainty it means something else, certainty it does not mean anything else;certainty there is space, certainty there is no space; certainty there is energy. certainty there isno energy; certainty there are objects, certainty there are no objects. 70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"GLOSSARYTHETAN: This term designates the beingness of the individual, the awareness ofawareness unit, that quantity and identity which IS the preclear. One does not speak of “mythetan” any more than he would speak of “my me.” Persons referring to the thetan in such away as to make the thetan a third party to the body and the person are not only incorrect, theybetoken by this a bad state of aberration.AUDITOR: The person who “audits,” who computes and listens, a practitioner ofDianetics and Scientology. SOP Theta Clearing is best done by an auditor who has been thetacleared. A Step V commonly acts to force the preclear to stay in his body even while pretendingto free the preclear from his body.LOCATION: The thetan is an energy unit which is commonly located in the center ofthe skull. A thetan who cannot leave the current body very often believes himself to be holdingon only to the current body. and yet in actuality is holding on to a facsimile of an earlier body.The thetan also believes himself to be the size of some earlier body. A thetan from the FifthInvader Force believes himself to be a very strange insect-like creature with unthinkablyhorrible hands. He believes himself to be occupying such a body, but is in actuality simply aunit capable of producing space, time, energy and matter.SELF-DETERMINISM: Self-determinism is a relative state of ability to determinelocation in time and space, and to create and destroy space, time, energy and matter. If one canlocate his facsimiles and ridges in time and space, if one is able to place persons and objects inthe past, present and future in time and space, he can be considered to have high self-determinism. If one’s facsimiles place him in time and space, if people can easily place one intime and space in the past, present or future, one’s self-determinism is low. Willingness andunwillingness to locate things in time and space are the key relative states of sanity.ILLUSION: Any idea, space, energy, object or time concept which one creates himself.REALITY: That agreement upon illusion which became the MEST universe.DELUSION: Things not of one’s own creation or of the MEST universe which locateone in time and space.CERTAINTY: One is certain on a plus or minus basis and can be equally certain oneither. One can be certain a thing is NOT real or he can be certain that it IS real. There are threesides to this. One is certain that a thing is his own illusion: this is the highest level. One iscertain that a thing is a MEST universe reality (illusion). One can be certain that a thing is adelusion. Any certainty is a knowingness. Knowingness is sanity. Thus we have three routesof certainty by which to approach knowingness.KNOWINGNESS: Knowingness depends upon certainty.ABERRATION: Aberration depends upon uncertainty.THETA PERCEPTION: That which one perceives by radiating toward an object andfrom the reflection perceiving various characteristics of the object such as size, odor, tactile,sound, color, etc. Certainty of perception is increased by drilling in certainties as above. Thetaperception is dependent upon willingness to handle energy and to create space, energy andobjects. In view of the fact that the MEST universe can be established easily to be an illusion,one must have an ability to perceive illusions before one can clearly perceive the MESTuniverse. The thetan who cannot perceive the MEST universe easily will also be found to beincapable of handling and orienting other kinds of illusions with certainty. Theta perception isalso a direct index to responsibility, for responsibility is the willingness to handle force. MEST PERCEPTION: Recordings the thetan takes from the organs of perception of thehuman body as a short cut to perception (lazy perception). The body records actual wave71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"emanations from the MEST universe, the thetan uses these recordings. Considerably more datashould be collected on this subject.ORIENTATION: Determination of location in space and time and determination ofenergy quantity present. This applies to past, present, future.RIDGES: “Solid” accumulations of energy which are suspended in space and time.Ridges can be handled variously. They can also explode.FACSIMILES: Energy reproductions of things in various universes. They are fixed toridges.END OF TERMINAL: A communication line to anything has the preclear at one endand something at the other end. When the end of terminal is vacated, flow dams and thepreclear must fix the vacated end to his own body. This is the mechanics behind the loss whichbrings about grief. ARC lines can be mocked-up and handled in the routine of creativeprocessing, which processes will resolve end of terminal difficulties. These terminals are quitevisible to the thetan who sees them either wound around the body or extending to other bodiesor reaching a considerable distance into space. The thetan can actually yank on these terminals,even those which go into space, and free the other end whether he perceives it or not, and sorecover and dispose of such lines.ASTRAL BODIES: Somebody’s delusion. Astral bodies are usually mock-ups whichthe mystic then tries to believe real. He sees the astral body as something else and then seeks toinhabit it in the most common practices of “astral walking.” Anyone who confuses astralbodies with thetans is apt to have difficulty with theta clearing for the two things are not thesame order of similarity. The exteriorization of a thetan, when actually accomplished, is socomplete and thorough and is attended by so many other phenomena, that anyone who hasmade an effort to relate these two things is quite certain to recant after he has been theta cleared.The most note worthy difference is that the thetan does not have a body. Production of illusionto which he then sought to assign MEST reality is probably the underlying factor which makesmysticism so aberrative. Data from India, even that found in the deepest “mysteries” of India,is knowingly or unknowingly “booby-trapped” so that while it contains, though unevaluatedand isolated, many essential truths, it contains as well directions which are certain to send theexperimenter even more deeply into the unwanted state of becoming MEST. Until recently. thenearest one could come to studying the actuality of existence was through the field ofmysticism and its value should not be discounted, but its effect is to deliver an entirely oppositeresult to any experimenter luckless enough to hope to reach cause by becoming an effect asrequired in mysticism. Seeing and feeling “non-existences” is frightening and harmful onlywhen one seeks to believe them to be existences. Only when he knows he has created them,can he obtain a certainty upon them. One can create hallucination for himself only by insistingthat what he has created was otherwise created -- in short, refusing to accept responsibility forhis own created illusions.ELECTRONICS: Lower and cruder manifestations of the same order of actuality asthought.TERMINALS: In facsimiles, ridges and electric motors, terminals operate and currentflows only when they are fixed in time and space. Alternating current becomes possible onlybecause of an overlooked item, the base of the motor, which is fixed in time and space andwhich keeps the terminals apart by fixing them in time and space.THE HUMAN SOUL: The preclear.MYSTICISM: Many right ideas but the wrong way to go about it.

The auditor can make a gamebetter or make it possible for the preclear to play a game. The preclear is being audited becausehe is no longer able to take part in the game.Life is a game consisting of freedom and restrictions. Play is communication.Communication requires freedom and terminals. Life units as-is with thought. To think theremust be something to as-is. To grant life there must be something to grant life to. A preclearwill become as free as he is reassured of the existence of barriers at that level. When a preclearis not assured of (does not have reality on) barriers at a level he will not rise to that level. Athetan will carry to extremes making something and making nothing. Auditing is that processof bringing a balance between freedom and barriers.A game depends upon a restoration of freedom of choice on making something andmaking nothing. One can become obsessed with making nothing. He can become obsessedwith making something. Both of these activities and the rehabilitation of the freedom of choicebring about a gain in case. There can be too many or too few universes, but when an individualis stuck in a universe it is because he does not have enough universes.Therefore it is necessary to remedy his havingness of bodies. Remedying hishavingness of bodies will clear away universes in which he is stuck by letting him havefreedom of entrance into universes.Auditing is a game of exteriorization versus havingness. There is never too much ofanything if the preclear is bothered by it. He may say there is not enough of it but he usuallysays there is something bad about it. When he says there is something bad about it he meansthere is not enough of it. The preclear loses his power to postulate into existence and tounpostulate out of existence energy masses, spaces and forms.Life is a game.Games are composed of freedom, problems, and havingness, awareness and interest.Each of these elements contains “mood of game” (the tone scale), penalties, and thecycle of action.Auditing improves the level of game of the preclear.Auditing is not a game between auditor and preclear on an opposing basis but on a teambasis. The auditor, and eventually the preclear, are engaged upon a game, themselves versusthe opponents to survival in life.The preclear is usually close to a no-game condition. This is reached by apreponderance of win (no-game) or a preponderance of lose (no-game). A frozen mood ofgame or no-mood is reached by assuming that interest can exist on only one emotional level(whereas interest can exist on any emotional tone level) or by misusing the mood of one gamein others concurrently played.A game is any state of beingness wherein exist awareness, problems, havingness andfreedom (separateness) each in some degree. A game is rehabilitated or a no-game-conditioneradicated in processing by handling the elements of games and their subdivision, with reality,with the intention of bettering the game ability of the preclear. IF YOU, THE INDIVIDUAL KNEW THE TRUTH AND YOU WERE PROCESSEDTOWARDS THE TRUTH, YOU WOULD BE FREE. ONLY LIES DEGRADE YOU. THISIS THE LESSON OF SCIENTOLOGY.78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"THE REMEDY OF HAVINGNESSThere is a great deal of upper-echelon theory connected with the Remedy ofHavingness as a process, for here we are dealing with energy and the reasons and operationsof a thetan in regard to it.Just why a thetan should get himself so completely snarled up in energy might be anentire mystery to anyone who did not realize that a thetan has to cut down his knowingness andhis total presence in order to have a game. The awareness of awareness unit builds space to cutdown knowingness. Space makes it necessary, then, to look at something in order to knowabout it. The next thing a thetan does to cut down his knowingness is to create energy and topass it to other thetans and to bring in the energy of other thetans so as to get a duration and atime-span. If the thetan is successful and obtains a game in this wise, he continues on with thismodus operandi of having a game, and when he does not have a game he simply cuts hisknowingness down once more. Of course, he reaches a point eventually where he does not geta game simply by cutting down his knowingness, and eventually assumes a fairly fixed,stupid, aspect. He is below the level of having games, but because he has cut down hisknowingness he does not know, now, that he is below the level of having games and thinksthat all that is necessary to get another game is to further cut down his knowingness. He is bythis time obsessively dramatizing the lowering of knowingness.When one speaks of knowingness, one should realize that one is speaking of anembracive thing. Everything on the Know to Mystery Scale is simply a greater condensation orreduction of Knowingness. At first one simply knows. Then he makes some space and someenergy, and so now he has knowingness in terms of looking.By changing the position of the particles of energy thus created, and by exchangingparticles with others, extant or self-created, the thetan cuts down his knowingness further, andgets time, and so gets emotion and sensation. When these become solid, he has effort particlesand masses. Now, he could cut down his knowingness further by refusing to use emotion andeffort, but by thinking about them, thus introducing new vias into his line of knowingness.And, when he no longer knows entirely by thinking, he ceases to create knowingness andbegins to eat, and from eating he drops into the ready-made sensation of sex instead ofknowing what happens in the future. And from here he drops down into postulated mystery assomething one cannot possibly know about. In other words, one gets a continued reduction ofknowingness in order to have games.The greatest chess player in the world has no game, since he can predict that he willwin and predict everything that opponents will do, so he will simply demonstrate how to playchess. Sooner or later, he will announce that he is “burned out” or has lost his knack forplaying chess, and will go off into some other field where he can have a game. The field hewill choose will be a less wisdom-demanding field than playing chess. A boxer, such as someof the very great ones of the past, will reduce his timing, which is to say his knowingness ofarrival, to a point where he can at least put on a good exhibition, and from this they will furtherreduce their knowingness, and then not noticing how far they have gone, get themselvesthoroughly and consistently beaten. There will be a period, however, when they are fairlyevenly matched against their opponents.To understand this with any thoroughness, one would have to recognize the intentionback of all communication. Creation, Survival, and Destruction is knowingness. Whensomebody talks to you his intention is to continue in a parity where he can have an interchangeof communication, which is to say a game. He takes knowingness from you, and givesknowingness to you, with one form of communication or another. Two soldiers fighting andshooting at each other are using a bullet to make the other man know. What is there to know inthis situation? That one is dead, of course, and for the victor, that one has won.It is dangerous, alike, to a thetan, to have too many wins or too many losses. Give himtoo many wins, and he will correct in the direction of reducing his knowingness as representedby his dexterity, his prediction, his activity. Give him too many losses and he will seek anothergame, even to the point where he will die and pick up another body. Because the decision is on79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"the basis of knowingness, the decision is always downward. One does not decide upwardtoward greater knowingness, actually, unless one has the full and complete intention ofwinning in a new game. If one discovers that there are no wins or losses either to be found inthis new game, even to the point of forgetting all of his knowledge concerning it, one willreduce one’s own knowingness in order to ensure a game.As there is not a infinity of games in progress, one is apt, as he comes down seventy-four trillion years of track, to play out the available games and to put them in the category of “itmust not happen again”. One then becomes bored. One is only bored when there is no gamepossible, from his viewpoint. Actually, all he has to do is become enthusiastic about the gameon his own consideration and he will begin to know more about it again.A thetan considers that some form or mass is necessary in order to have a game. Hegets into the belief that he cannot create new masses, and so he begins to hold on to oldmasses, and here, whether he is exteriorized or in a body, we find him holding on hard to oldfacsimiles, old significances, old decisions, rather than take on new decisions.The Remedy of Havingness directly addresses the problems of giving the thetansomething ‘to play with’. When he discovers that he can have new masses, he will begin to letgo of old masses. It is an easily observed phenomenon while having a preclear RemedyHavingness, that old engrams go into restimulation, go into restimulation and run out, that theyshow up in front of his face and suddenly explode or disappear. The Remedy of Havingnessactively does run out engrams.This process is used from boredom up to conservatism for its best results.This process is done by asking the preclear to mock up something and pull it in, ormock up something and throw it away. When a thetan is exteriorized, if you want to see himget very unhappy, make him change space until he begins to lose all the energy he is holdingon to, and then fail to remedy his havingness. The thetan will become convinced that he is onlya thought, and is therefore, by his standards unable to have a game. Tell him to mock up eightanchor points in the form of the corners of a cube around him and pull them in upon himself.Ask him to do it several more times, and he immediately brightens up and becomes veryhappy. Why is this? You have reassured him that he can have a game.The cutting down of knowingness and the Remedy of Havingness have oppositevectors. The Remedy of Havingness will knock out old energy masses the thetan is holding onto, or that the body is holding on to, which tell the thetan he is stupid. The supplanting of theseby new energy masses which do not have the postulate of cut-down knowingness in them ofcourse makes the thetan brighter.When you find a theory detached from a process and not demonstrating itself in aprocess there must be something wrong with the theory. Similarly, if what I say here aboutcondensed knowingness being all other things, and the cut-down of knowingness, were notdemonstrated in the process of Remedy of Havingness, then we would have to get ourselves anew theory. However, this is demonstrated very definitely. For those people who cannotremedy havingness wherever they are on the tone scale can be brought to a point where theywill remedy havingness simply by asking them what they wouldn’t mind knowing. Theconsideration of what they are willing to know then begins to rise. If you only could see a “black five” operate you would see that his barriers are allerected toward knowing something. Of course he is very afraid of being told something bad,and so doesn’t want to be told anything at all, and when the auditor gives him a command henever receives the command as given, but does something else. He has a block up againstknowingness to such a degree that he will eventually permit himself to be pressed into completeinactive stupidity. What are those black screens for? Basically to keep him from knowing.Knowing what? Then one will have to look closely at the definition of a datum. A datum is aninvention which has become agreed upon and so solidified. In other words, a datum is to somedegree a solidity, even if it is merely a symbol. To get into this state it has to be agreed upon.When it is thoroughly agreed upon it becomes, then, a truth. It is not at all a truth. It is an80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"invention. What made it sure or what made it real was the fact that it was agreed upon. Thisopens the doors further to other processes.In order to get the preclear in good condition we would have to put him into some kindof a condition so that he could create. The first thing he is liable to be able to create in auditingis a lie. The word lie is simply invention with a bad connotation. Society gives invention thatconnotation because of its anxiety to have a game and to agree, and so be able to communicatewith one another.Thus society frowns upon the invention of facts, yet the preclear’s sanity and continuedhappiness absolutely depend upon his ability to create new facts. The technique whichremedies this is included in “The Creation of Sanity”, number R2-29: “Start lying”. One canvary this auditing command with “Tell me some lies about your past”, and then keep thepreclear at it long enough so that the preclear is able to come out of the complete blur whichwill follow on the heels of his taking over the function of and running of his memorymachines. The invention of data is a step immediately toward the remedy of havingness.Simply asking the preclear what he wouldn’t mind knowing, what he wouldn’t mind havingother people knowing about him will bring him into a condition where he can mock up andremedy havingness.The Remedy of Havingness is the companion process to Spotting Spots, which will betaken up in the next PAB. The Remedy of Havingness, simply as a process by itself, if workedup to by getting the preclear willing to know things, and willing for other people to knowthings, and run thoroughly so that whole avalanches of masses can pour into him or pour outof him, will actually run out an entire engram bank, and thus is an extremely valuable process.It has been reported by several auditors that exteriorization was accomplished onpreclears by making them remedy havingness and do nothing else for eight or ten hours.The auditing commands for the Remedy of Havingness are: “Mock up something”,“Pull it in”, until the preclear is doing this easily. Then, “Mock up something”, “Throw itaway”, until the preclear can do this easily. The significance of the object may be added by theauditor with “Pull in an ideal body”, or some such thing, but the actual fact is that the actualsignificance does nothing for the preclear. It is the mass which counts. The auditor can havethe preclear pull things in two at a time, six at a time. He can have the preclear mock upsomething, copy it a dozen times, one time after another, then pull in the whole mass, but thereal reason he is doing this with the preclear should never drop from sight. The auditor isremedying havingness in order to give the preclear enough mass to permit him to discard oldmasses which he is holding on to and doesn’t know anything about. Remedy of Havingness -- The Process “When in doubt, remedy Havingness.”This is a motto which can well be followed by an auditor doing any process on thepreclear. But, if there is a process which one should do with any other process, then that processwould be understood thoroughly, for if done incorrectly it would be likely to produceconfusion into all the other processes of Dianetics and Scientology.Therefore, in the first place, let us examine with rigor the name of this process. It isREMEDY OF HAVINGNESS. By “remedy” one means the correction of any aberratedcondition. By “havingness” one means mass or objects. The process could also be called“Remedy of Unhavingness.” It could also be called “Remedy of Acceptingness.” It could alsobe called “Remedy of Rejectingness.”To those people who are deficient in Havingness, the process is liable to mean that theauditor should increase the Havingness of the preclear. Such an auditor with themisunderstanding would have the preclear put up large masses and push them into his body orhimself. The auditor would neglect having the preclear throw away objects and masses.81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"If the auditor misunderstood the process and simply assumed that it had something todo with Havingness, and if his own Havingness were too great, he would be likely tospecialize on all preclears by having the preclear throw things away.Actually, the auditor should have the preclear push things into himself and his body andthrow things away from himself and his body until the preclear can do both with equal ease.When this has been accomplished the preclear’s Havingness has been “remedied”.What, then, does a Remedy of Havingness mean? It means the remedy of a preclear’snative ability to acquire things at will and reject them at will. Amongst the Havingnesses whichwould require remedy, would be an obsessive inflow of money, sexual objects, troubles,somatics, and difficulties in general. Whenever one of these appeared in the preclear’senvironment it would have a tendency to inflow on the preclear. The reverse difficulty wouldbe an obsessive outflow, whereby the preclear threw away or wasted anything which he had,such as money, clothes, cars, or living quarters. When the process “Remedy of Havingness”has been done thoroughly and completely, the preclear should be able to reject or accept, at hisown discretion, anything in his environment as well as anything in the engram bank.The earliest use of this process is to be found in GITA which is to say “Give and TakeProcessing,” one of the early SOP’s, which became an SOP-8 “Expanded GITA.” In Issue 16-G of the Journal of Scientology we have a long list of key items. The preclear was asked towaste, accept, and desire these items at will. This was the Desire-Enforcement-Inhibit Scale, orDEI Scale. This process is the immediate ancestor of the Remedy of Havingness. Indeed, onecould do far worse than to take the DEI Expanded GITA list as given in Issue 16-G, and in theform of mock-ups use it as such upon the preclear, or more modernly employ it directly on theRemedy of Havingness on these objects.If one were to employ such a list in the Remedy of Havingness, one would, of course,have to employ gradient scales. The use of the gradient scale has never been discarded, and theconcept and principle of doing things by gradient scales is inherent in auditing itself, for onestarts with a process which the preclear can do, and gives him some wins, and on a gradualscale gives him larger and larger wins until he is cleared. Similarly, in remedying Havingness,the preclear must be started at the lowest end of the scale and advanced on up to the higher endsof the scale. Quantity is one of the methods of doing this. At first one can ask a preclear tomock up one of an item and shove it into his body or throw it away, and then go, finally, whenhe is doing that well, to two items, three, four, five, six, all the same, but a greater quantity ofthe item. An even lower gradient on this scale would be to simply get the idea that somethingwas there, and to progress on forward with the idea into the actual mass. An expert auditorworking with this from the idea on through to the object would discover that he had nopreclears who could not mock up.He would have the preclear get the idea out in front of him of a ball, and get the idea ofthe ball being thrown away; get the idea of a ball up in front of him and get the idea of a ballcoming in. He would then, when the preclear could do this excellently, move forward into theactual mock-up of a ball. The mock-up would get better and better as the process progressed,until at last the preclear could mock up and throw away or push into his body, at will a ball. Hewould be able to see this ball, even feel its texture and its weight.Now, exteriorization by Remedy of Havingness is a newer process than the oldRemedy of Havingness. It is accomplished by having the preclear SHOVE or PUSH thingsinto his body. One no longer has the preclear PULL things into his body. Simply by having thepreclear mock up things and shove them into his body, mock them up and throw them away,mock things up and shove them into his body, mock things up and throw them away, apreclear, who has already been run on the earlier steps of the six basic processes, will, at thisstage exteriorize quite neatly after as little as fifteen or twenty minutes of the process. If he doesnot, then the earlier processes have been skimped and the preclear was really not ready for afull, forthright remedy of Havingness.Even when doing Route 1, the preclear is told to push things into himself. This willrather take his flitter away for a moment, for he is there being one viewpoint, and in order topush something into himself, he has to be a second viewpoint. In view of the fact that a thetan82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"gets into trouble by being only one viewpoint, this remedies the viewpoint scarcity of thethetan, and he pushes himself up into two viewpoints with great rapidity. Thus we are doingduplication of the thetan at the same time that we are remedying Havingness, so one even hasthe thetan shove things into himself, rather than pull things into himself.In short, one never has anyone pull things into his body any more. One has peoplepush things into the body. One has, for instance, the preclear mock up a planet, and push itinto the body; mock up a planet and throw it away; mock up a planet and push it into his body;and then one says, “Where are you pushing it from?” The preclear says: “Out here in front ofthe body.” The auditor simply goes on doing the process, and very shortly the preclear will, ifthe earlier steps have been done well -- the Six Basic Processes below Remedy of Havingness-- exteriorize neatly and will be ready for Route 1.One would omit, in such an instance, running Spotting Spots as such, for Change ofSpace Processing and Communication Processing has a great deal to do with spotting spotsalready.If you were to do Remedy of Havingness forthrightly and all-out, and you were toaccept this as the only process we had, we would work with its cousin process R2-63 as givenin “The Creation of Human Ability,” “Accept -- Reject.” One would ask the preclear for thingshe could accept, one after the other until the communication lag was flat, and then would askthe preclear for things he could accept, one after the other until the communication lag was flat,and then would ask the preclear for things he could reject, one after the other until thecommunication lag was flat on that. One would then move into the Expanded GITA list andwould have the preclear mock up and shove into his body (if interiorized) or into himself (ifexteriorized) the various items on the Expanded GITA list as given in Issue 16-G of the Journalof Scientology. This would be a long process, and not entirely successful on all counts, butwould nevertheless be a very effective and efficient process from the standpoint of gain. Onewould certainly get the preclear over a very large number of aberrations and would do a greatdeal for him. However, this is not the advised way of handling this process, for the processitself is not an end-all. Aberrations can be handled much more easily by CommunicationProcessing.The exact use and commands of Remedy of Havingness in ordinary and routineauditing is simple and effective. One has been asking a preclear a great many questions which“as-ised” large masses of energy. One, in handling Change of Space or interiorization andExteriorization into objects while the preclear is exteriorized, has been “burning up” largemasses of energy. Any time the preclear begins to feel dopey or “boil off” he has either run toolong on a flow in one direction, in which case reverse the flow, or he has simply reduced hishavingness down to a point where he feels tired or sleepy. Without waiting for thismanifestation to occur the good auditor simply in the course of Straight Wire or DescriptionProcessing, or many other processes, such as those contained in Route One, remediesHavingness. Having achieved something like a momentarily flat communication lag on aprocess, the auditor says to the preclear: “Mock up a mass out in front of you.” When thepreclear has done this, the auditor says: “Shove it into your body.” When the preclear has doneso, the auditor says: “Mock up another mass out in front of you.” And when the preclear hasdone so, the auditor says: “Throw it away.” That, as given, is for preclears who areinteriorized. It is simply repeated over and over. The mass is not specified. It can be almostanything, and in fact it does not matter much what type of significance the mass has. Any massis better than no mass, according to the thetan.If the preclear is exteriorized, the auditor already starts him on the Remedy ofHavingness in the Route One step where the preclear is asked to copy what he is looking at(R1-5). When one is doing R1-5 one must be very careful to obey the gradient scale principlebehind Remedy of Havingness. One would not make the preclear make twenty copies and thenpush all of them into himself or the body. One would make the preclear make two or threecopies and push them in, one at a time, until the preclear could remedy his Havingness withease.The auditor would then have the preclear mock up a mass and “Shove it into yourself.”And then: “Mock up a mass and throw it away,” and do this back and forth until the preclear83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"could do this easily and well, at which time the auditor would tell the preclear: “Mock up twomasses and shove them into yourself,” and then, “Mock up two masses and throw themaway,” until finally the auditor has the preclear mock up eight masses as though they were thecorners of a cube around the preclear, and “Shove them into yourself,” and then “Mock upeight masses and throw them away.”One must remember that in spite of the fact that he cannot duplicate mass actually ashimself, having no space or mass, natively, the motto of the thetan is “anything is better thannothing.” When you tear up a lot of facsimiles for a thetan and throw them away, he becomesvery unhappy unless you have him reconstruct those facsimiles or remedy the mass accordingto what he has lost. When you are having a thetan go into and out of MEST universe masses, acertain amount of energy is burned up, and after a thetan has been run for a short time on thisstep (R1-9 in the “Creation of Human Ability”), one must be particularly careful to remedy hisHavingness with eight masses shoved into himself and eight masses thrown away, severaltimes. A thetan who has been run a great deal without Remedy of Havingness comes to what isto him a horrible thought: “I am just a concept”, and he will sag in tone. He does not come tothis state as long as Havingness is consistently remedied.It may be, as one looks at Scientology, that one has come to the opinion, watchingRemedy of Havingness work, that all there is to anything is the Remedy of Havingness, that itis all based on the Remedy of Havingness. If one has a preclear shove enough Havingness intohis body he will exteriorize in most cases. If one remedies enough Havingness while the thetanis chasing around the universe, as in the Grand Tour, the thetan will discover and as-is a greatmany communication lines which otherwise might be very detrimental. However, it is not truethat Havingness is the entire key to the Human mind. Havingness is the “gimmick” or“weenie” for which the game is played, and having something is very much like winning.Above Havingness there is Doingness, and above Doingness there is Beingness, andabove Beingness there is Communicatingness, and above Communicatingness there isKnowingness, and above Knowingness there is Postulatingness. We see, thus, that we have along way to go above Havingness in order to get to the top activity of a thetan, which ismaking postulates or unmaking them.One could, of course, rationalize each and every action of the thetan with regard toHavingness. One could even extend Havingness to space, although it normally refers toobjects. One could do all manner of interesting things with Havingness. One could get asspecific and as significant as one likes, or as unsignificant as one likes and still find Remedy ofHavingness working, but we do not have here, in Remedy of Havingness, the total clue, totalkey. But we do have a process and an item which must not be overlooked in auditing.In the Six Basic Processes, the Remedy of Havingness comes after the OpeningProcedure by Duplication as a process, itself, but remember that Remedy of Havingness isdone and can be done at any time during any other process as long as the preclear is evenvaguely in communication with the auditor. It does not matter how vague the mass is that thepreclear is using to remedy his Havingness. Here is a place where certainty is not necessary.An unreal, vague, or flimsy mass, if this is all the preclear can get, will still remedy hishavingness.A case comes to mind out of the Advanced Clinical Course, where a student wasunwilling, after his second day, to continue his studies. He did not believe that he could standthe “hammer and pound”, as he put it, of the terrifically intense schedule. I took him into myoffice, asked him what he was doing in life, and he replied to me that he was a machinist.Also, it seemed to turn out that he had something to do with a ship which had sunk under him,although his recollection of this was very unclear. I asked him what kind of a machine he hadcustomarily run, and he told me. Then I had him mock up this machine, and remedied hisHavingness with it. Then I had him mock up the ship and remedied his Havingness with that,just as given above. I did this for about fifteen minutes, and enough change occurred in hiscase to entirely return his confidence in his ability to stand up to the course and to audit. Yet themockups he was getting were so thin that he could barely vaguely discern them at all.84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Mockups get unreal because the thetan is Not-Ising existence. He is trying to destroymasses by saying that they do not exist, that they are not real. He is so bent upon this systemof destruction that he is making everything unreal or black. One of the cures for this is End ofCycle Processing run in the following fashion:One has the preclear mock himself up dead (no matter how unreal the mockup is). Thenhave the mockup waste away to bone, and have the bones waste away to dust, and then havethe preclear shove the dust into himself, or alternately, throw it away. One once more has thepreclear mock himself up dead, have the mockup waste away to bone, have the bones wasteaway to dust, and then have the preclear remedy his Havingness with the dust. One continuesthis for two or three hours with the preclear if one really wishes the case to make a change.Where a preclear is getting no reality on mockups or blackness he is most commonly stuck inthat Para-Scientological thing, that thing horribly abhorred by psychologists who have becomeDianeticists, or by people who are just plain scared, a past death. If you wanted to convincesomebody that past deaths exist, you would run End of Cycle Processing on them. This is acousin process to the Remedy of Havingness. One could go a very long distance with thisprocess and have the preclear mock up his mother dead, have her waste away to bones, andremedy Havingness with the dust, or do this with the dust, or do this with the father orbrothers, or grandparents, with a considerable change in the case.This End of Cycle Processing, by the way, is a very fine process. It has been with usabout a year and it has been successful whenever used. It has a tendency to fall into disusebecause it has not, until now, had an exact place on the Six Basic Processes. But End of Cycleis actually an additional process to the Remedy of Havingness and is an effective way ofremedying Havingness. Do you remember in the old days the Dianetics “Corpse Case,” whowould lie upon the couch with his arms crossed neatly all ready for a lily, and would alwaysaudit in this fashion? The solution to this corpse case is End of Cycle Processing, as givenhere. The preclear is so fixed in a death that he is trying to make everything unreal, and theonly real thing, to him, would be the unreality of death. The Importance of HavingnessA careful study of staff auditors’ reports reveals that the only advances worthy of thename of Scientology occur when the auditor repairs or remedies havingness on the preclear.Without the repair and remedy of havingness no real gains become apparent. A preclear willnot progress when his havingness is impaired.What are the symptoms of loss of havingness? Running any as-ising techniques thepreclear may become anaten, slightly nervous, agitated, want a cigarette, or seem to break outof the session in some fashion. In either case, he is “down on havingness”. In other words hehas burned up, used up, or as-ised, too much of his physical body energy in the auditing itself.In view of the fact that every subjective technique puts a sort of hole in the middle of theelectronic mass surrounding a preclear, parts of that mass then begin to cave in on the preclear.Thus running an as-ising technique on a preclear beyond the ability of the preclear to sustainthe consequent loss of havingness will bring on in the preclear many new engrams which hedid not have before. A technique which as-ises energy, if used without a repair or remedy ofhavingness, will bring about a worsening of the case of a preclear.Now exactly what is happening is very simple. A preclear starts to go anaten and theauditor keeps on running the process. He hasn’t realised that he ought to interrupt a process atany time if the preclear demonstrates a loss of havingness. Anaten is such a demonstration ofloss of havingness. All right, another example: the preclear becomes agitated or upset; hereaches for a cigarette; he begins to twitch; his foot begins to wobble; he begins to talkexcitedly; he begins to cough while being audited. All of these things demonstrate a loss ofhavingness. These same conditions by the way, can result from the preclear believing that theauditor has broken the auditor’s code in some fashion or has overcome his power of choice.Both a repair and remedy of havingness are immediately indicated on the observation of anatenor agitation on the part of the preclear. In addition the auditor should carefully go over thesession itself to find out, if anywhere, the preclear believed his power of choice was beingovercome, or if the preclear believed the auditor’s code had been broken. You understand that85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"the auditor didn’t necessarily have to overcome the preclear’s power of choice or break theauditor’s code in order that the preclear should believe that this had happened. However, thiscould be overlooked entirely if the auditor had been careful enough to repair or remedy thehavingness of the preclear.The slightest drop of alertness on the part of the preclear, or the slightest agitation orsomatic, should immediately indicate to the auditor that havingness has dropped and must beimmediately repaired or remedied. A great deal of time can be spent on the subject of repair andremedy of havingness, and it is time spent with great benefit. It is better to “waste” time spentrepairing and remedying havingness than to blunder on through. Now there is another thing Ihave noticed with regard to this. Auditors are running these days toward cognition. Very well,if they expect a preclear to cognite they should not expect him to pull in a bank upon himself. Ifan auditor runs a very obvious process which should bring the preclear toward cognition, runsit several auditing commands and then stops and repairs and remedies the preclear’shavingness, and then after that asks him the same auditing question two more times, he willdiscover that he has blown a cognition into view. In other words you could remedy thehavingness of a preclear while his mind was on one particular subject and bring a cognitioninto existence.This becomes particularly important today, since a few months ago I discovered thatyou could remedy the havingness of anybody, and I mean just that!! You can remedyanybody’s havingness and you can turn on mockups on anybody. In view of the fact that thepreclear who has a black field can be caused to mock up blacknesses or invisibilities and shovethem into his body brings us into an era of being able to make anybody turn on mockups. Bygetting the preclear to postulate that the mocked up blackness is bad for the body, will causethat blackness to snap into the body. By getting the preclear to postulate that the invisible masshe has mocked up is bad for the body it will snap into the body. Of course, after this has beendone a few times, the consideration of the preclear will change. Then perhaps the blackness orinvisibility will only snap in when the preclear postulates that it is good for the body. He mayalso have a residue left. It is very important to get rid of these repair and remedy of havingnessresidues. By various postulates such as that the residue is a threat to the body: it is good for thebody; it is bad for the body, the residue too will snap in.Let’s differentiate at once here the difference between a repair of havingness and aremedy of havingness. We used to call repair of havingness “giving him some havingness”. Itneeds a better technical term. Therefore let us call this “Repair of Havingness”. It means havingthe preclear mock up anything he can mock up, and in any way it can be done get him to shove(never pull) that mock up into the body, and by similar means to get rid of the residue whichwent along with the mockup. That is a repair of havingness. It is a one-way flow; it is aninflow.Now a remedy of havingness is getting him to mock up and shove into the bodyenough masses to bring him to a point where he can eventually throw one away. In otherwords repair or havingness is simply having him mock up things and have him shove theminto the body and a remedy of havingness is having him mock up and shove in and throw awaythe same type of mock up. Remedy of havingness is always a superior operation to a repair ofhavingness. Repair of havingness is a very crude stopgap, but can be used any time. However,a preclear who is working well, and on whom havingness can be remedied, should, at alltimes, have his havingness remedied, not repaired. In other words any type of mock up shouldbe both shoved into the body and mocked up and thrown away. This should be done inconsiderable quantity until the preclear is quite relaxed about that particular type of mock up.One does this, remember, every time the attention of the preclear drops, or he becomesagitated.There is one other little point connected with this which is quite important, and that isauditors very often audit a preclear into an area of time when the preclear exteriorized. This, ona preclear who does not exteriorize easily, brings on a considerable grief and sadness. The wayto get rid of this is, of course, to remedy the preclear’s havingness or only repair it, and to askthe preclear to recall times when he was not exteriorized. This will bring up at once times whenhe did exteriorize and where fear of exteriorization was built up considerably.86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"I have noticed another special condition regarding this exteriorization phenomena whichis quite important. A preclear will occasionally repair and remedy havingness up to a pointwhere the body disappears for him. He doesn’t quite know where to put the mass he hasmocked up since he cannot find the body. This is particularly true of preclears who have a verylow threshold on havingness. An auditor would be stupid indeed to simply plow along beyondthat point where the preclear has already said that he couldn’t find any body to push anyhavingness into. The moment the preclear does that the auditor should suspect that the preclearhas gotten into an exteriorization type incident. It is not, however, necessary that heimmediately flounder around and try to find this incident as recommended in the paragraphsjust above. He can also repair and remedy havingness in this fashion, and it is very importantto know this. Although it is disastrous for a preclear to be asked “What could your body have,”since he will simply strip the bank of various old facsimiles, it is a very, very good repair ofhavingness to ask a preclear “What is there around this room (area) which your body couldhave,” and then have him pick out specific objects in the environment which he says the bodycould have. If he does this he will come up the gradient scale of havingness, and hishavingness will be repaired immediately or directly on the Sixth Dynamic. A preclear whocannot get mock ups and where the auditor has either been too clumsy to get the preclear’smock ups turned on, or it really was impossible, more or less, the preclear’s havingness can berepaired by having him do this process. So this is a very, very important process, and one thatought to go down in red letters.This whole subject of repair and remedy of havingness and its effect upon auditing, andthe fact that it has not been stressed at all in training, being up there at level six in the old BasicProcesses, brings us to SLP Issue 8. The entirety of level one in SLP 8 will be devoted to therepair and remedy of havingness.In SLP Issue 7 we have a great many phenomena associated with the remedy of thebody’s havingness. The reason for their position is to bring about an adjustment of thecondition of the body before one goes on to other and more complicated ways of processing.Now, in Issue 8, all of these various things will be retained, but they will be paralleled with acomplete remedy of havingness and that particular level of SLP will be gone over. In actualexperience it is better to remedy the havingness of a preclear, no matter where he is on the tonescale, and no matter by what process, than to run any significant process. Further, if a preclearcannot at least repair his havingness, to run Waterloo Station is to invite disaster because in thisparticular process of level 2 he is liable to get himself into a “down havingness” situation andof course will not be able to not-know anything. He may be chewing up too much energy ortrying to not-know. Thus we would have the failures which have occasionally occurred inWaterloo Station. They were simply havingness failures, not a failure of Waterloo Station.Further there has been a new command suggested for Waterloo Station: “What would you bewilling to not-know about that person?” This seems to be a better command, at least for theBritish Isles.We also take care of the vacuums and separatenesses and everything else with repair orremedy of havingness and running it in with certain other things, such as problems, etc. Whenwe discover by two-way communication a weak universe, we could then ask the individualpreclear “Invent a problem that person (weak universe) could be to you.” Then, watching himvery carefully, and repairing his havingness on the subject of that person’s possessions, get avery rapid separation of universes. I have noticed that the weak universe came about when theperson elected by the preclear to be a weak universe first began to put mest anchor pointsaround the preclear. In other words, valuable presents. I am as pleased as can be to get a fingeron this point and I know well that if east, west, north and south, would begin to repair andremedy havingness, and stop specializing in significances, without repair or remedy ofhavingness, we are going to start shooting people up to the top of these Scientometric graphs.We can’t help it. Let me call your attention specifically to the old phenomena of the emotionalscale and the engram. We find out that when one engram was keyed in it fixed the emotionaltone of the individual. Then we had him run this and as he converted the engram to usablehavingness, we found that his tone rose. We discover on these Scientometric charts that the“unhappy” section does not move if we don’t change the mass of the preclear. Sacrifices87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"The latest news from the research front has to do with the fact that the GE demands andrequires and has to have, evidently, sacrifices. The GE does not run on an overt act-motivatorsequence, which makes one suspect he is not a thetan. A GE runs exclusively on beingsacrificed to. If you have the preclear mock up sacrifices to the GE, you will find these becomevery readily assimilated. On a lower level the body accepts motivators; as soon as it is throughthis motivator band, it accepts sacrifices and finally comes up to a point where it will accept livebodies. When one considers that eating is entirely a matter of absorbing death, one sees thisdeath hunger in processing by running Sacrifices. A person who has had bad legs should havea sacrifice of legs run on him and so forth. This is astonishing material. It is almostunbelievable that the GE will not be sacrificed to anything, but will only be sacrificed to, andthis phenomenon that the GE is thereby demanding death tells us at once that the Atomic Bombwill be used and that there are people in the world who will actually crave this sacrifice of citiesand even nations. Aside from being a fantastically workable process, more of which anon, thismatter of sacrifices tells us at once a great deal about the future. There will be no moral restraintwhere the Atomic Bomb is concerned. For about the highest level in some areas of the worldis, to case, “operating GE.” This tells us, too, why soldiers will go to war. This explains agreat deal of conduct. The GE evidently operates on the postulate that as long as anything elseis alive it can’t live. However, it is becoming more and more doubtful that there is any morelife in the body than the thetan puts there, and that the body is a single machine operating onsome implanted postulate contained in the energy masses which are activated by the thetansomewhat on the order of the old “pole” theta trap. Many of these considerations can bechanged around rather easily. Nothing changes them quite so fast as these sacrifice processes.In mocking up sacrifices the auditor should use all the skills of creative processing and ensurethat the preclear is actually mocking up and is not dragging in old facsimiles from the bank andrestimulating genetic line incidents. This can be obviated by having the persons in the mockups dressed in modern clothing; mocking up the incident as happening tomorrow; altering themock up in some manner, such as turning the face green or something of this nature. Anyreasonable way in which you can ensure that you are dealing with mock ups and not past trackfacsimiles.This gives auditors another tool with which to handle chronic somatics.There is another process which has a great deal of workability with chronic somatics. Iknow that some months ago and earlier than that it seemed rather fatal to us to continue to fixatethe preclear’s attention on the chronic somatic. But that is not a problem with us right now. Itceased to be a problem the moment I invented an auditing command exactly as follows: “Inventa problem that (leg. arm, nose, eye, body) could be to you.” Running this command, which isin itself a sort of remedy of havingness, and repairing and remedying the havingness of thepreclear as we go, we will discover that practically any and all phenomena associated with theservice facsimile will come away and clear up and the limb, nose or eye will get well. This canbe used as a word of warning: ONLY ON ACTUAL TERMINALS. Never use this command,and I mean NEVER, on actual conditions. Never ask him to invent problems lameness couldbe to him. Never ask him what problem blindness could be to him. Lameness and blindnessare conditions. We want to know what problems legs or eyes can be to him, since legs andeyes are terminals. In running this command we reduce havingness too rapidly whenever weare stressing conditions. Therefore we run it only on terminals. In running it use onlyterminals. Handled in this way we do have the answer as of this moment, to chronic somatics.With these processes in SLP and the adequate repair and remedy of havingness we can pushour preclears right up through the top.
