Ron Hubbard"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"PUBLISHER'S NOTE: 1951This volume, Handbook for Preclears, is a popularized application of certaindiscoveries contained in a new organization of epistemology which is an apparently successfuleffort to align epistemology into a complete and workable science.Epistemology is the philosophic term of “knowledge.” The identification of the basiclaws of knowledge and the discovery of some two hundred new phenomena concerningthought open new portals for the investigator in any science, since all sciences are basicallydependent upon epistemology or knowledge itself. Sciences resolve and become workable inthe degree that knowledge itself, as a subject is resolved.Man’s advances into the phenomena of the physical universe have been accomplishedby the isolation of new ways to think. Man’s progress is measured not by phenomena con-verted into understood data but by the organization of new methods of discovering phenomena.Mathematics, until this new science was organized and proofs of it well established, waschiefly a method of thinking about things. The amount of phenomena discovered bymathematics is evidenced everywhere in the civilized world and culminated in atomic fission.Whatever the future of this new science in the field of epistemology may portend, it hasproduced evidence that it may be a forceful new tool in the hands of the biologist, theanthropologist, the political scientist, and, in short, most branches of science. It forms a bridgeamongst these sciences and calls them back from their highly specialized aspects into new unitsof knowledge and will probably make easier the work of those scientists operating in thosefields.Almost incidentally, this new science resolves many of the problems of the human mindand human body which have been resistive. The human mind, as a computer and storage bin ofknowledge receives considerable attention in this new science. But it should not be thought thatthis new science is a therapy although it poses one. It is rather a new codified understanding ofsuch things as interpersonal relations and constructive action. A few of the many phenomenanewly discovered by this science resolve, however, the problems of mental and psychosomaticdisorder in a percentage of cases not previously attained.This small self-help volume is offered to the intelligent layman for his use and toqualified practitioners in the field of the human mind for a quick understanding of the potentiali-ties contained in the new science. Tests so far conducted demonstrate that this volume iscapable of producing complete and lasting results in 88 per cent of the cases to which it isapplied as compared to the temporary results now being obtained by mental practitioners in 22per cent of their cases."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"TABLE OF CONTENTSHOW TO USE THIS BOOK1ON THE STATE OF MAN2AN IDEAL STATE OF BEING4THE GOALS OF MAN7THE HUMAN MIND10THE CONTROL CENTER14EMOTION16PROCESSING17PROCESSING SECTION18THE SECOND ACT20THE THIRD ACT24THE FOURTH ACT28THE SIXTH ACT38THE EIGHTH ACT42THE NINTH ACT49THE TENTH ACT55THE ELEVENTH ACT56THE TWELFTH ACT59THE THIRTEENTH ACT63THE FOURTEENTH ACT71THE FIFTEENTH ACT72GLOSSARY73DEFINITIONS, LOGICS AND AXIOMS78THE LOGICS79AXIOMS82"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HOW TO USE THIS BOOKIMPORTANT NOTE: In studying Scientology be very, very certain you never go pasta word you do not fully understand.The only reason a person gives up a study or becomes confused or unable to learn isthat he or she has gone past a word or phrase that was not understood. If the material becomesconfusing or you can’t seem to grasp it, there will be a word just earlier that you have notunderstood. Don’t go any further, but go back to BEFORE you got into trouble, find themisunderstood word and get it defined.For unfamiliar words in this book there is a Glossary beginning on page 73 to assistyou.This volume of self processing is designed for use in any of four ways:1. As a workbook to be used wholly by the auditor on the pre-clear; or2. As a homework book to be given the pre-clear for use between sessions; or3. As a process done by the pre-clear himself with only occasional auditor help; or4. As a processing manual used wholly by the pre-clear without an auditor.The last use is possible, particularly when the pre-clear knows considerable about thisscience from other sources. But it is possible, by reading this book alone, and withconsiderable stamina, to carry straight on through.If this book is given to you by an auditor, he expects to be consulted concerning anydifficult points and he expects to run out your service facsimile when the time comes by effortprocessing.The intention of this book is to decrease your reaction time, improve your efficiencyand well being, to extend your life. This book is not intended for the people who would usuallyseek help by reason of severe aberration, neurosis or insanity.The optimum individual to which this book would be addressed for total self use wouldbe a person capable of considerable action such as a member of the armed services, a jet pilot,an artist, a musician desiring to speed his playing time and increase his ability. The address ofthis volume is to the person who, though normal enough would like to excel physically andmentally. An engineer, for instance, using this volume, could increase his ability to calculateand perform many times over.DON’T CONFUSE THIS SCIENCE WITH PSYCHOTHERAPY, PSYCHOSIS ORNEUROSIS. JUST BECAUSE IT HANDLES THESE EASILY FOR THE FIRSTTIME IN HISTORY IS NO REASON IT IS DEVOTED TO THE LAME, THE HALTAND THE ABERRATED. THIS SCIENCE HAS AS ONE OF ITS BRANCHES THEIMPROVEMENT OF HUMAN ABILITY ABOVE WHAT IT HAS BEEN. THISBOOK WAS WRITTEN TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF THE ABLE.Anyone using this volume as written can increase his skills, rehabilitate his goals andimprove himself considerably above his fellows. We need people like that if we are going tohave a better world.Use this book as written. Don’t try to combine it with old time mumbo-jumbo.Gasoline and alcohol, this book and psychotherapy mix similarly. Use this book as written andno harm can come to you unless you are a case that badly needs an auditor. Good luck in yourvoyage to YOU.1"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ON THE STATE OF MANMan started his journey to present time some countless eons thence. Through blood andslaughter, earthquake and tidal wave, through muck and parching sand, through misery andstrivings, grief and happiness he has progressed, generation by generation into the master ofthe world and the lord of all kingdoms.What is the ideal state of this animal Man? What are his goals ? What are his limitations? What is there about him that is good and what is bad ?In the course of his adventures, Man made one very important discovery—and it hasworried him ever since. He found that he had a mind. He found that he could think. Finally heunderstood that his mind was his best weapon. And he found that privation and injury orperhaps demons could deprive him of the full we of that weapon—his mind.Through ages of philosophers, shamans and priests, he has attempted to resolve thisprimary worry and thus resolve a primary problem. Man wants to know what there is wrongwith his mind, if anything, and he wants to know what might be the ideal state of his mind, ifsuch a state exists.He has wandered into countless strange by-paths in a quest for answers to theseproblems. He has seated himself on mountain tops and in caves for whole lifetimes just toponder the riddle of himself. He has gone to war, he has starved, he has worked and reviledand written just to solve these two mysteries.And now, as these words are written, his terribly perplexing mind has given birth to anidea and his hands have given form to a weapon which may resolve Man forever by destroyingall civilization. Thus he MUST solve the two principal mysteries of his mind.Can the nature of Man be changed before the works of Man vanish forever under thethud of Man’s most powerful product, the atom bomb?Can the nature of Man be changed at all?Indeed there is nothing more plastic than Man’s ability to think and believe. At one timeor another in one part of the world or another Man has accepted or believed things wilder thananything contained in philosophic books. His capacity for change is almost unlimited. It is noidle postulate, then, that Man’s nature, across the whole world, might change entirely in a spanof a few years. One has but to study his history to find such shifts of viewpoint and alterationsof character. The inertia of populaces is a myth. For instance, the coming of St. Paul to Rome,almost two thousand years ago, changed the nature of all Roman slaves with a firelikeswiftness. The appearance of a monk in England at the beginning of the millennia just endingaltered the insularity of that island in a few months and sent hordes thundering off to theCrusades filled with a piety and zeal which, before his arrival, were markedly absent. And inthe last quarter of a century the idea of collectivism has flooded out from a desperate band ofrevolutionaries to change the customs and methods of living of nearly a majority of thepopulation of the world.If Man can alter in such numbers, the alteration of an individual would seem to berelatively simple. And so it is. With new knowledge and with many of his past and presentproblems suddenly resolved, an individual in a few weeks can present a face to his fellowswhich has markedly changed.Man is accustomed to change. The severity of his aberration is normally due to a feelingthat he must protest against change. For his environment, all down through his evolutionarylife, through any lifetime, has changed almost day by day.2"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Man is successful. That is evident because he is here today after eons of trial and error,good and bad planning. And he is successful because he can change.The conquest of his environment had been his own engrossing purpose. Each time hehas failed to conquer and control his environs, he has made wide changes in form and methodsand has again returned into his kingship.Man does NOT adapt to an environment He adapts the environment to himself. And inthat lies his success. When he fails to adapt the environment, when he lags in his completecontrol of that environment, he has altered himself or his ideas until he could again change theenvironment.Amongst the many things Man has done, in his worries about his mind and his state ofbeing, in his effort to control others, is the adoption of slave philosophies. Each person whoinvents or uses such a philosophy more or less tends to be, himself, exempt from the slaverythus imposed and to hold, by the invention, the force of others nullified. This is a trick of verylimited workability for it leads eventually into the entrapment of the user himself. It is ademonstrable law, not an opinion, that he who would enslave his fellows becomes himselfenslaved. A “therapy” which teaches that Man should adapt himself to his environment ratherthan adapt the environment to him is such a slave philosophy and is not workable only becauseit is quite the reverse from truth.Each Man of the species seeks one way or another to rise superior to all else. In that ishis salvation, and, in terms of his societies, his downfall.Attempts at enslavement arise primarily from fear. Fear comes about with the loss ofconfidence in one’s ability to make his way. Thus is posed a world where self-confidence issought by robbing others of theirs. This cannot succeed in a complex society.Man’s problem today is not new. It is only more urgent of solution. What is wrong, ifanything, with his mind ? What is his ideal state?3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AN IDEAL STATE OF BEINGBefore one can determine what is wrong with a state of being, one should have someidea what an ideal state of being might be. In other words, before one can repair, for instance, aradio, one must have some knowledge of what the radio is supposed to do and how well itcould play in a good state of repair.What, it should have been asked a few millennia ago, is an ideal state of being for Man?In what state of mind does he best prosper? What is a well man? What is a happy man? Whatare the goals of Man? In what state of mind and body does Man live longest and fare best?What does Man want to do? What is he trying to do? What is he?Before one could presume to advance libido theories and pre-frontal lobotomies andmagic healing crystals, one should have had some idea of the goal of his efforts.The engineer in repairing a bridge, has to have some idea of what a bridge is supposedto do, what loads it is supposed to carry, how strong it has to be and what might be expected towreck it again. This is simple reasoning. The engineer does not look at this bridge he issupposed to repair, sigh, say the problem is too complicated, bicker with several other“authorities” on bridges, put some dynamite in the wrong place and blow it up and then wonderwhy there isn’t any bridge left and begin to explain to passers-by that he was called too late,that was all, that bridges aren’t much good anyway.Yet one fears this has been the method of address to the problem of the human mindand body.To begin a rehabilitation of a human mind and body, one should know something abouttheir optimum state. That would be the beginning of the answer as to how the mind and bodycould be rehabilitated. Further, it would be the beginning of an answer as to what environmentand conditions best favor the human body and the human mind. After that, one could devisemeans of achieving an optimum condition.In this new science there are over two hundred axioms which, one to the next, form alogical structure concerning the mind and body, which structure is demonstrated to be workableby the discovery of many new phenomena. This structure also predicts where phenomenamight be found— and when one looks to see if the prediction was true, finds that it is.Accomplishments which people are calling miracles come about because of the logic andphenomena of these axioms.The goal of Man here on this earth is apparently “SURVIVAL.” And by survival ismeant everything necessary to survival including honor and morals and idealism and otherthings which make life bearable. A Man survives as long as he can in one lifetime at the highestlevel he can attain in activity and happiness. When he can no longer attain to some hope of thisideal, he succumbs. And although one is chary of exciting incredulity, the fact is so easilydemonstrated in so many ways with such machine-like scientific consistency, it should beknown that Man apparently dies in body only and gets born to live another day. The value ofdeath is not small since without death Man would still be an algae in the sea, without death Manwould be forced to live in a body which no longer fitted the environment. Your auditor canshow you such an incident as an earlier death unless you are very occluded. Death has lost itssting in this new science and is seen to be rather practical after all.Physically, on the evolution chain, Man is attempting a greater and greater control of hisenvironment. The environment does not control a healthy Man. He controls the environment.The surroundings of a sick Man, a neurotic or insane Man have a tendency to control him. Onesees this clearly as one advances, by this new science, into happier states of mind. One’s healthand ability rises directly as one asserts greater and surer control over his surroundings.4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Conversely, one asserts better and better control of his surroundings as he becomes healthierand happier.Thus there is a second goal. Man is evidently surviving to attain a higher and strongercontrol of the physical universe. The physical universe is composed of matter, energy, spaceand time. The coined word for the physical universe in this new science is “MEST.” That iseasy to remember because it is composed of the first letter in each of the four words, “Matter,”“Energy,” “Space” and “Time.”Of course Man may have other goals outside of the physical universe, but we note thathe is most concerned here on earth with a conquest of MEST. Naturally he is concerned abouthis fellows and living organisms in general for he is in a sort of brotherhood with all life.Life in general is engaged upon this conquest and Man is the highest form of Life onearth. Without this cooperative effort of all life, a conquest of the physical universe or evensurvival on a barest necessity basis would be impossible. Man is sufficiently complex as amechanism that he must live upon lower orders of life which only in their turn can take sunlightand chemicals and evolve complex foods such as proteins.Now one hopes that his reader is not engaging upon that trick common to manyreaders—people often search and recall only items which validate their old ideas. Pick up abook on philosophy which has been read by a reader who underscores with a pencil and onewill find that the most utter banalities have been noticed; only things which AGREED with theold ideas of the reader were noted. One often wonders why such a fellow reads at all. The datain this new science aren’t isolated opinions but a structural whole and with that whole one canaccomplish an occasional miracle and can almost always effect a marked improvement in anindividual. This has never been done before with any consistency, and so one hopes that thesedata are being studied a little for themselves, not for how well they may agree with old ideas.For they don’t agree with old ideas—and old ideas produced unhappiness, starvation, quickdeath, wars, insane asylums and much other unwanted bric-a-brac. This is not just a plea forunderstanding. If you want to get better than you ever could have been before, let’s try these onfor size and wear them until we clearly see their workability. If, after a thorough trial, you findthey do not work, then you have every right to discount them. One can say this to you withoutany fear that you’ll discover otherwise—too many miracles have been happening in this newscience.The list of axioms in the back of this book will give you definitions for pain, pleasure,anxiety and other such things in case you are curious. Here we are only treating the ideal stateof being in the framework you will need to pursue the exercises in this volume.The first item in the ideal state is I AM. Shakespeare was quite correct with hisquestion, “To be or not to be?” When a Man is trying to make a decision, that decision breaksdown into a matter of choosing one of two courses: to be or not to be. The highest level of thedesirable state is I AM. No doubts of the advisability of being, no qualms about the future. Thelowest level on a survival course would be I AM NOT. In between we have the doubts andwrithing and indecision’s of the weary, the angry, the frightened. When a Man has made up hismind as to a course he is only then comfortable. So long as he hangs in a maybe on anydecision he is uncomfortable. In any course there are just two decisions possible, to assume astate of beingness or to assume a state of not-beingness.Included in these pages is a tone scale which is fronted with its own descriptive data.The ideal state of being is to be found across the top of that scale. The states of death or not-beingness are found across the bottom of the scale.And here we have the matter of gradient scales. Successes are little bits of living.Failures are little bits of death. Like the battle that was lost all for the loss of a horseshoe nail, asmall failure can begin a series of failures which end in actual death. Not that death is very5"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"important, besides being painful, but that one tends, then, to give a very heavy weight tofailures.The ideal state of being could be said to be wholly successful in all things. This isopposed by being so unsuccessful that one is dead.The next point in the ideal state of being is I KNOW, opposed by I KNOW NOT.Doubts, worries, grinding efforts at study, all these are simply gradients between I KNOW andI KNOW NOT. What Man does not quiver a trifle when confronted with the Unknown?The next point in an ideal is SERENE. This drops away and, at the bottom rung,having gone downwards through Exhilaration, Enthusiasm, Cheerfulness, Antagonism,Anger, Fear, Grief and Apathy is DEAD.TRUST is the ideal point on the scale of TRUST DISTRUST. The most distrustful onecan become is, again, dead.The ideal point of longevity would be ALWAYS in a perfect body. The bottom of thatscale would again be dead.FULL RESPONSIBILITY would be in an ideal, opposed by NO RESPONSIBILITYas an undesirable state.And finally, but not least, there is CAUSE and EFFECT. The subject of CAUSE andEFFECT is so important that it will be mentioned several times in the exercises themselves.One’s ideal state is to be the CAUSE. The least desirable state would be EFFECT. The ultimatein being EFFECT is death.Thus we have a brief statement of what an ideal state might be. Only a few of the pointshave been given but they will serve.Ideally, one would be fully aware of being and would be. That is I AM. One would beentirely SUCCESSFUL. One would KNOW. One would be SERENE. One would TRUST.One would be in perfect HEALTH physically. One could assume FULL RESPONSIBILITY.And one would be CAUSE without being unwilling to be CAUSE.Of course, it would be not entirely desirable to attain these ultimates since one wouldthen lack for action. But attaining them as nearly as possible would be a desirable condition.The odd part of it is, when one drops on any one of these things he drops on all theothers, so interactive are these portions of life.This volume and its exercises and auditing seek to assist the individual upwards towardthis state of being which one could call ideal. How closely the individual may attain such a statedepends largely upon his own willingness to work at the matter rather than the validity of thetenets themselves.An ideal state of being, it goes without remark, would not include illnesses and inabilityto control oneself or his environment. Control of oneself and one’s environment depend uponhis attainment toward the ideal state of being.6"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE GOALS OF MANThe goal of life in the finite universe may be easily and generally defined as an effort toSURVIVE as long as possible and attain the most desirable state possible in that survival and,in accomplishing this, to conquer the physical universe.The cycle of survival is Conception, Growth, Attainment, Decay, Death, Conception,Growth, Attainment, Decay, Death, over and over again. This is the major cycle.There is an inner cycle in a lifetime which has to do with emotion or action. This isAction, Attempt, Success, Attempt, Failure. Happiness, down to Failure is the emotional cycle.But these are only part cycles. Just as every death begins new life, so does every failureeventually challenge forth new attempt until death itself is reached. Actually both failure anddeath alike are transient. They are educational building blocks on a much longer road.Occasionally however, an individual becomes so overwhelmed that even successive attempts atlife decline.There is undoubtedly a much, much higher goal which prompts this effort to surviveand to conquer. There is probably reason above that level. In this new science we are interestedin HOW life is surviving, not WHY. Perhaps we know much of WHY right now. Perhaps wewill know all of it someday. At the moment it is enough to know HOW life is surviving.What is embraced in the survival and actions of one Man ? We see clearly that animaland vegetable efforts are necessary for Man’s survival. We can see that living is teamwork onthe part of all Life. How much of this teamwork is included in the activities of one individual?We have what we call DYNAMICS. Dynamics, in Life, resemble somewhat effort inphysics. A dynamic is the urge to survive along a certain course. A dynamic is the persistencein living. It is the effort to live.Very low on the tone-scale, in the psychotic or neurotic band, individuals think theysurvive for themselves alone. This, of course, would not be possible. As one rises up the tonescale into better states of being, he expands his sphere of interest and action. But no matterwhat he thinks in a low tone state, he is still surviving on the many dynamics, even if in alimited state.There are eight dynamics. These embrace all the goals of survival an individual has.They embrace all the things for which he survives.None of these dynamics is more or less important than another. And, oddly enough,when one is blunted or shortened, so blunt or shorten all the rest. When one offends againstone he automatically offends against all the others. These dynamics are very easy todemonstrate.The FIRST dynamic is SELF. This is the effort to survive as an individual, to be anindividual. It includes one’s own body and one’s own mind. It is the effort to attain the highestlevel of survival for the longest possible time for self.The SECOND dynamic is SEX. This dynamic has two sections, 2s and 2c. The firstsection is sex itself, the sexual act, anything relating to the physical action of sex. The secondsection is the urge for survival through children, the product of sex. This dynamic also includesa portion of family since the family as a unit affects the rearing of children.The THIRD dynamic is GROUP. This is the effort to survive through a group such as acommunity, a state,. a nation, a social lodge, friends, companies, or, in short any group. Onehas a definite interest in the survival of a group.7"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The FOURTH dynamic is MANKIND. This is the effort to survive as a species. It isthe interest in the species as such.The FIFTH dynamic is LIFE FORMS. This is the effort to survive for any and everyform of life. It is the interest in life as such.The SIXTH dynamic is MEST. This is the effort to survive as the physical universe andis the interest in the survival of the physical universe.The SEVENTH dynamic is LIFE SOURCE. This, in this new science, is separate fromthe physical universe, and is the source of life itself Thus there is an effort for the survival oflife source.The EIGHTH dynamic is SUPREME BEING. This is written with the figure eightturned on its side, meaning infinity oo. It is the postulated ultimate Creator of All and the effortto survive for the Supreme Being.When one has a problem which embraces many of the subjects in these dynamics, theoptimum solution of that problem lies in benefiting the largest possible number of dynamics.Solutions which injure one dynamic for the benefit of another dynamic result in eventual chaos.However, optimum solutions are almost possible to attain and human thinking seeks at itshighest level only to bring the greatest order and the least chaos. At low levels on the tone scalean individual will stress one or two dynamics at the expense of the rest and so lives a verydisorderly existence and is productive of much chaos for those around him.The soldier, flinging away his life in battle, is operating on the third dynamic (hiscompany, his nation) at the expense of his first dynamic, the fourth and all the rest. Thereligionist may live on the eighth, seventh, fifth, and fourth at the expense of the first and sixth.The “selfish” person may be living only on the first dynamic, a very chaotic effort.There is nothing particularly wrong with bad emphasis on these dynamics until suchemphasis begins to endanger them broadly as in the case of a Hitler or a Ghengis Khan or theuse of atomic fission for destruction. Then all Man begins to turn on the destroyers.The goal of an individual is to be, as much as possible, CAUSE or partner of CAUSEon all these dynamics at once without becoming EFFECT or partner of EFFECT on any ofthem. He cannot do this completely. But the degree of his success depends upon how closelyhe can approximate CAUSE and how little he can be an EFFECT on each.The whole of SURVIVAL is a dynamic, the only dynamic. But SURVIVE breaksdown into these eight.Philosophies in the past have laid emphasis on one or another of these dynamics to theexclusion of others and so such philosophies had but limited workability. Psychotherapies havestressed this or that dynamic independent of the others and so did not achieve very greatresults. Freud, for instance, laid very heavy emphasis on the second dynamic, sex. There issome reason to give this a lion’s share in therapy but only because of the peculiarities ofCAUSE and EFFECT and the sexual aberrations of the general culture, not because 2s is moreimportant as an urge or drive than any of the others.Not one of these dynamics will “drive one mad” when one fails more than anotherdynamic. But it is quite true that failure or impedance on any one of these dynamics causesimpedance on all the rest. Fear on one becomes fear on all. Offense on one is offense on all.Success on one is success on all. Defense on one becomes defense on all.The proofs of the existence of these dynamics are contained in the workability of theprocesses which develop from them. It happens that when one thinks of an individual as8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"running wholly on the first dynamic and tries to make a workable therapy on that supposition,the individual does not lose his psychosomatic ills and he does not improve. When one tries totreat the second dynamic exclusively as a therapy, the individual does not improve. When oneuses all these dynamics in resolving his problems, one obtains marked and startling results.Perhaps the authoritarian will argue that just because a thing works is no reason one should useit. Authoritarians do not achieve any results beyond their own satisfaction—which is not reasonenough for the student or technician who wishes to get things done.The goals of Man, then, stem from the single goal of survival through a conquest of thematerial universe. The success of his survival is measured in terms of the broad survival of all.One man, working hard to save the first dynamic, might short-sightedly destroy all the others.Where then would be the first dynamic?9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE HUMAN MINDIt is common to think of the human mind as something which just happened in the lastgeneration or so. The mind itself is actually as old as the organism. And according to earlierguesses and proofs established by this new science, the organism, the body, is rather old. Itgoes back to the first moment of Life’s appearance on Earth.First there was a physical universe which happened, we know not how. And then, withthe cooling planets there appeared in the seas a speck of living matter. That speck becameeventually the complicated but still microscopic monocell. And then, as the eons passed, itbecame vegetable matter. And then it became jellyfish. And then it became a mollusk and madeits transition into crustacea. And then as a land animal this particular track of Life which becameMan evolved into more and more complex forms, the tarsus, the sloth, the anthropoid, andfinally Man. There were many intermediate steps.A very materialistic Man, seeing only the material universe, becomes confused andvague about all this. He tries to say that living organisms are simply so much clay, wholly apart of the material universe. He tries to say that after all it is only the “unending stream ofprotoplasm,” generation to generation by sex that is important. The very unthinking Man islikely to make many mistakes not only about the human mind but the human body.We discover now that the science of life, like physics, is a study of static’s and motion.We find that Life itself, the living part of Life, has no comparable entity in the physicaluniverse. It isn’t just another energy or just an accident. Life is a static which yet has the powerof controlling, animating, mobilizing, organizing and destroying matter, energy and space, andpossibly even Time.Life is a CAUSE which acts upon the physical universe as an EFFECT. There isoverwhelming evidence to support this now. In the physical universe there is no true static.Every apparent static has been discovered to contain motion. But the static of Life is evidently atrue static. The basic text of axioms of this new science demonstrates this conclusively.Life began with pure CAUSE evidently. With the first photon it engaged in handlingmotion. And by handling motion ever afterwards accumulated the experience and effortcontained in a body. Life is a static, the physical universe is motion. The effect upon motion ofCAUSE produced the combination which we see as the unity of a live organism. Thought isnot motion in space and time. Thought is a static containing an image of motion.Thus one can say that with its first impingement upon motion, the first thought aboutthe physical universe began. This static, without volume, wave length, space or time yetrecords motion and its effects in space and time.This is, of course, analogy. But it is a peculiar analogy in that it sweepingly resolvesthe problems of mind and physical structure.A mind, then, is not a brain. A brain and the nervous system are simply conduits forphysical universe vibrations. The brain and nerve trunks are much like a switchboard system.And there is a point in the system where the vibrations change into records.An organism is motivated by continuing, timeless, spaceless, motionless CAUSE. Thiscause mirrors or takes impressions of motion. These impressions we call “memories” or moreaccurately, facsimiles.A facsimile, as you know, is a simple word meaning a picture of a thing, a copy of athing, not the thing itself. Thus, to save confusion and keep this point before us in this newscience, we say that the perceptions of the body are “stored” as facsimiles.10"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Sights, sounds, tastes, and all the other perceptions of the body store as facsimiles ofthe moment the impression was received. The actual energy of the impression is not stored. Itis not stored if only because there is insufficient molecular structure in the body to store theseenergies as such. Physical universe energy is evidently too gross for such storage. Further,although the cells perish, the memories go on, existing, evidently, forever.A facsimile of yesterday’s hurt toe can be brought back today with the full force of theimpact. Everything which occurs around the body, whether it is asleep or awake, is recorded asa facsimile and is stored.There are facsimiles of anything and everything the body has ever perceived—seen,heard, felt, smelled, tasted, experienced—from the first moment of existence. There arepleasure facsimiles and bored facsimiles, facsimiles of sudden death and quick success,facsimiles of quiet decay and gradual struggle.Memory usually means recalling data of recent times; thus we use the word facsimile,for while it is the whole of which memory is a part, the word memory does not embrace all thathas been discovered.One should have a very good idea of what a facsimile is. It is a recording of the motionsand situations of the physical universe plus the conclusions of the mind based on earlierfacsimiles.One sees a dog chase a cat. Long after dog and cat are gone one can recall that a dogchased a cat. While the action was taking place one saw the scene, one heard the sounds, onemight even smell the dog or cat. As one watched, his own heart was beating, the saline contentof his blood was at such and such a point, the weight of one’s body and the position of one’sjoints, the feel of one’s clothing, the touch of the air upon the skin, all these things wererecorded in full as well. The total of all this would be a unit facsimile.Now one could simply recall the fact that one had seen a dog chase a cat. That would beremembering. Or one could concentrate on the matter and, if he was in good mental condition,could again see the dog and the cat, could hear them, could feel the air on his skin, the positionof his joints, the weight of his clothing. He could partially or wholly regain the experience.That is to say he could partially or wholly bring to his consciousness the “memory,” the unitfacsimile of a dog chasing a cat.One does not have to be drugged or hypnotized or have faith in order to do this. Peopledo variations of this recall without any knowledge of this science and suppose that “everybodydoes it.” The person with a good memory is only a person who can regain his facsimiles easily.A little child in school learns, today, by repetition. It isn’t necessary. If he gets good grades itis usually because he simply brings back “to mind,” which is to say, to his awareness, thefacsimile of the page of text on which he is being examined.As one goes through Life he records twenty-four hours a day, asleep and awake, inpain, under anesthetic, happy or sad. These facsimiles are usually recorded with all perceptics,which is to say, with every sense channel. In the person who has a missing sense channel suchas deafness, that portion of the facsimile is missing.A full facsimile is a sort of three-dimensional color picture with sound and smell and allother perceptions plus the conclusions or speculations of the individual.It was once, many years ago, noticed by a student of the mind that children had thisfaculty of seeing and hearing in memory what they had actually seen and heard. And it wasnoted that the ability did not last. No further study was made of the matter and indeed, soobscure were these studies that I did not know about them during the early stages of my ownwork.11"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"We know a great deal about these facsimiles now—why they are not easily recoveredby most people when they grow up, how they change, how the imagination can begin to re-manufacture them as in hallucination or dreaming.Briefly, a person is as aberrated as he is unable to handle his facsimiles. He is as saneas he can handle his facsimiles. He is as ill as he is unable to handle his facsimiles. He is aswell as he can handle them.That portion of this new science which is devoted to the rehabilitation of the mind andbody deals with the phenomena of handling these facsimiles.A person ought to be able to pick up and inspect and lay aside at will any facsimile hehas. It is not a goal of this new science to restore full recall perception, it is the goal to re-habilitate the ability of a person to handle his facsimiles.When a person CANNOT handle his facsimiles, he can pull them into present time anddiscover himself unable to get rid of them again.What is psychosomatic illness ? Demonstrably, it is the pain contained in a pastexperience or the physical malfunction of a past experience. The facsimile of that experiencegets into present time and stays with the person until a shock drops it out of sight again or untilit is processed out by this new science. A shock or necessity, however, permits it to comeback.Grief, sorrow, worry, anxiety and any other emotional condition is simply one or moreof these facsimiles. A circumstance of death, let us say, causes one to grieve. Then one has afacsimile containing grief. Something causes the individual to bring that facsimile into presenttime. He is unaware of it, is not inspecting it, but it acts against him nevertheless. Thus he isgrieving in present time and does not know why. The reason is the old facsimile. The proofthat it is the reason lies in processing. The instant the facsimile is discharged of its painfulemotion, the individual recovers. This is processing in one of its phases.The human mind is only a phase of the continuing mind. The first spark of life whichbegan animating matter upon Earth began recording facsimiles. And it recorded from there onout. It is interesting that the entire file is available to any mind. In previous investigations Ioccasionally found facsimiles, which were not hallucination or imagination, which seemed togo back much earlier than the present life to the pre-clear. Having by then the tool of effortprocessing, it was possible to “turn on” a facsimile with all perceptics at will and so it waspossible to examine the earliest periods possible. The genetic blueprint was thus discovered andI was startled to have laid bare, accessible to any future investigator, the facsimiles of theevolutionary line. Many auditors have since accomplished the same results and thus thebiologist and anthropologist come into possession of a mine of fascinating data.There are those who know nothing of the mind and yet who get amply paid for it whowill talk wisely about illusion and delusion. There happen to be exact and precise laws todelusion. An imaginary incident follows certain patterns. An actual incident is entirelyunmistakable. There is a standard behavior in a facsimile of an actual experience: It behaves in acertain way; the individual gets the efforts and perceptions with clarity and the content of theincident expands and remains fairly constant on several recounting An imaginary incidentcontracts in content ordinarily and the individual seeks to keep up his interest then byembroidering it. Further, it has no constant efforts in it. Those who cannot take time toestablish the actuality of facsimiles before becoming wise about “delusion” are themselvespossibly quite delusory people.The human mind, as the present mind of mind, differs not at all from the mostelementary of minds, that of the monocell, except in the complexity of brain appendage. Thehuman being is using facsimiles to evaluate experience and form conclusions and future planson how to survive in the best possible manner or how to die and start over again.12"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The human mind is capable of very complex combinations of facsimiles. Further, it canoriginate facsimiles on the basis of old facsimiles. Nothing goes wrong with the mind except itsabilities to handle facsimiles. Occasionally a mind becomes incapable of using a facsimile aspast experience and begins to use it in present time continually as an apology for failure. Thenwe have aberration and psychosomatic illness. A memory of pain contains pain and can becomepresent time pain. A memory of emotion contains emotion and can become present timeemotion.13"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"THE CONTROL CENTEREvery mind may be considered to have a control center. This could be called the“awareness of awareness unit” of the mind, or it could be called simply “I.”The control center is CAUSE. It directs, through emotional relay systems, the actionsof the body and the environment. It is not a physical thing. Here is a diagram of the controlcenter, “I,” in relation to the emotions and the body and environment.The total function of “I” is the estimation of effort. It thinks and plans and resolves theproblems or future effort.When “I” has estimated a needful effort and puts it into action, its impulses impingeagainst the glandular system switchboard. The glandular system is a relay unit. It turns theemotional impulse into action.The motor switchboard is a complex set of physical circuits and these go to variousparts of the body and channels of perception in order to coordinate physical action at thedirection of the glandular system.On a return circuit, the environment or the body, through the nerve channels ofperception and the channels in the body itself, an impulse from the environment or the bodygoes into the switchboard and is directly recorded by “I” facsimile. The emotional system, in amind in good condition, is bypassed on an incoming impulse unless “I” directs it expressly intothe glandular system.The physical body is a carbon-oxygen motor. It has been built out of the eons ofexperience, the summaries and conclusions of “I.” Its internal motions and actions can beplaced by “I” in the category of “automatic response.” Thus the heart beat and circulatorysystem are automatic in action. Thus many other motions of the body are automatic. But, as canbe demonstrated, any of these motions can be altered by “I.”The glandular system is quite complex as such, but its function is simple. It is thetranslation medium, evidently, for thought. The system is partially physical and partiallythought.Thought is definitely comparable to nothing in the universe of matter, energy, space ortime, having no wave length, weight, mass or speed and being, therefore, a zero which is an14"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"infinity or, in short, a true static. Thought, thinking and life itself are of the same order ofbeing. Demonstrably they have no wave length, therefore contain neither time nor space.Thought only appears to have time because in it is recorded physical universe time. There isobviously an “action” in thought but, as obviously, it is not action in this universe. (To see theproofs of this character of thought, see the axiomatic text.)15"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"EMOTIONAs the operating mechanism between thought and action, EMOTION should be wellunderstood.Emotion exists to monitor motion. Thought itself seems to have an emotional impulsewhich is free of physical universe waves. This is studied in various ways, but it is onlyimportant to us in the resolution of the problems of the human mind.Various emotions produce various actions. Anger, for instance, is the catalyst forattack. Fear is the signal to withdraw. Grief is the signal to be quiet and initiate nothing. Apathyis the signal to be dead or to fain death so that a marauder will go away. Various glandularcompounds are injected into the system to produce these results. Fear and grief, for instance,have an added compound to make the flesh taste bad—for Man is but recently a food animal.There is an entire scale of emotions to produce certain motions And there is a herdreaction, as witnessed in mass hysteria, whereby emotion acts upon others mechanismdeveloped in the control of hunting packs whereby the entire pack could feel afraid and run orfeel angry and attack without any other command. This shows up additionally in any modernleadership. The leader is that one who emotionally affects others most strongly toward positiveaction.In interpersonal relations, emotion plays an enormous role. In this new science we havewhat is called COUNTER EMOTION. Incidents quite often will not reduce until the pre-clear ismade to feel the emotion of others toward him. But quite aside from this manifestation as anethereal something, there is the real mechanism of sympathy. One person shows grief in orderto get support from the other. The other shows sympathy and gives the support. Man is sointerdependent and the physical universe so occasionally rigorous that all interpersonal relationsare built upon this dependency or its denial.The broad field of the dynamics indicates the generalized character of emotion.The test of these conclusions is their workability. You will discover in processing theenormous importance of emotion. The emotion of an individual can be frozen by somefacsimile he once wanted but now does not want, and he thereafter handles motion according tothat emotion. Thus a person can be chronically angry or chronically in apathy and his behavioron all dynamics is the behavior of that emotion. By knowing this and the activities of any levelon a tone scale of emotion, one can predict completely the actions of any given individual orhandle him with ease.The ideal state is fully self-determined emotion. Only then can one be happy andsuccessful.16"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PROCESSINGThe effort in processing is devoted to the goal of raising the individual on the tonescale. This involves rehabilitating his ability to handle his own facsimiles.Processing may necessitate the reduction of a number of facsimiles by thought, emotionor effort processing.It is a peculiarity of a facsimile that no matter how violent may be the efforts andcounter-efforts of its content, no matter how sad or terrible may be the situation it involves,once that facsimile is processed by impressing it against reality several times, it no longer hasany power, force, effort or thought content. There are many ways of accomplishing this. Inearlier works cruder and longer methods were used but they accomplished the same purpose.A memory, a facsimile, contains a record of everything that happened in the actualincident—sight, sound, taste, pain, emotion, efforts of the individual, efforts of theenvironment against the individual. The individual moves it into present time and keeps it forvarious reasons and then believes he is unable to rid himself of it. It produces strangecompulsions or obsessions or aberrations in general and it can produce, with its efforts, itsoriginal physical pain.A facsimile so held by the individual can make him ill. It can even kill him. Suchfacsimiles produce over seventy per cent of the illness of Man and make him weak enough tofall prey to the diseases and accidents which account for the other thirty. Sinusitis, arthritis, eyetrouble, liver difficulties, ulcers, migraine headaches, polio after-effects and so on down thelong, long list surrender if one reduces the facsimile causing the trouble. Whether or not thefacsimile is reduced depends to some degree upon the skill of the auditor. For instance, in myfirst book on this new science, I was guilty of overestimating the ability of my fellow man andhave had to work hard since to simplify the techniques and theory so as to make the success ofprocessing much more certain. It is now in the miracle class, so they say. But even now andthen, someone is too old or too inaccessible for the skill of the auditor working upon him andso only an alleviation occurs rather than an eradication of the trouble.The end goal of processing has no finite end. The auditor simply tries to raise hispre-clear up the scale as far as possible in the time allowed and to eradicate the most evidentpsychosomatic. There are levels of the tone scale which have not been attained but which seemattainable. These unattainable levels —at this time—are so far above anything ever attained byany Man before this that the pre-clear need not worry about being lifted only a little way.The pre-clear generally starts with the environment in rather heavy control of him. Themodern educational system, various laws and parental authority all seek to cause the preclear tobe an effect of the environment rather than a CAUSE of environmental effects. When he hascome to a level where he can be self-determined on the majority of the dynamics, his case isconsidered closed. This book assists him to attain the goal.17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PROCESSING SECTION(THE FIRST ACT)The processing section of this volume is divided into fifteen acts. Each one of thesecovers a certain phase of a case. If the individual is working with an auditor then he will findthat the auditor is piloting him through these same fifteen acts and that this book is being usedsupplementary to auditor checking. If the individual has given himself the task of goingthrough this volume by himself, he follows the same procedure and each section is of necessityto be taken up in turn.Each act is begun by a description of what the process means and how it is applied andthe end it is intended to accomplish.It is not necessary to BELIEVE what you find in this volume for the material to work.If you begin processing as in the doubtful class, you will find your doubts resolving as youproceed.Another can read these processes to you. You can read them yourself. You can do thembetween sessions with an auditor. You can get an auditor to do all the work for you.You will find included a chart of attitudes toward life. This might be called a “buttonchart” for it contains the major difficulties people have. It is also a self-evaluation chart. Youcan find a level on it where you agree and that is your level of reaction toward life. This chartcomplements the HUBBARD CHART OF HUMAN EVALUATION but is specially preparedfor this volume and for this type of processing. Your use of the chart in your processing isdescribed later.You will also find a disc included with this book. The disc is employed whenever thereis a long list of questions. Its use is described where it is first used in the section.You may find these processes too difficult for you and would therefore desire someassistance. There are many professional people all over the United States qualified in theapplication of the processes of this new science. By writing to the publisher of this book youmay obtain the name and address of the professional auditor nearest you.This new science has moved very rapidly and new developments have cut down thenumber of hours required in processing to below 100 with the new techniques. You shouldcount on spending at least a hundred hours with this present book including any effortprocessing you may receive from an auditor.This book, by itself, will do more for you than professional processing could havedone in June of 1951, much less June of 1950. Into it has gone an additional two years ofintensive work and investigation. Anywhere that this text or these processes disagree withbooks or data earlier than December of 1951, this book, not the earlier work, is correct. Theline of advance has been very consistent but sometimes a superficial student cannot follow thelogical advance line.While an individual does not have to understand this new science if he is being audited,one who is working this volume by himself should have a fairly good understanding of basictheory.It will save time if you will review the text of this volume up to this point andunderstand it. Then answer the following questions. Write in the book with a pencil.What is the goal of life?18"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"What is life trying to accomplish ?How many fields is the life organism interested in?What is a facsimile?What is the purpose of the human mind?What is meant by CAUSE and EFFECT?Is a facsimile permanent?How does “memory” or “remembering” differ from reexperiencing facsimiles?19"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE SECOND ACTThe anatomy of the static of Life demonstrates it to have three interdependentcharacteristics. Each one of these three is as important as the other two. They are Reality,Affinity and Communication.Reality itself could be considered that on which Man agrees to be real. There is an old,moth-chewed philosophic concern about perception. Are things real only when we see them ?Or are things real? In other words, is there any reality. Well, desks and chairs seem very real tome. And they seem very real to you. Thus we agree that there are desks and chairs and peopleand cars and a world and the stars. Sane men have a very solid agreement on reality. Theyagree that things are real. Insane people have hallucinations. Hallucinations are imaginedrealities with which nobody else agrees. When an individual does not agree with the rest of therace upon the reality of matter, energy, space and time, the rest of the race locks him up. Ideasare not matter, energy, space or time and so there can be disagreement on ideas and agreementupon the reality of matter, energy, space and time. This agreement upon MEST, then, is reality.Reality could be said to be agreement above 2.0 on the tone scale, agreement not so much withpeople but with MEST’s actuality. This is one corner of our triangle.The next corner is affinity. The physical universe has what is known as cohesion.Matter stays together. This is, in the life static as it operates on matter, AFFINITY. Affinity islove above 2.0. Love, as a word, has too many meanings, and so we use an old, old word,affinity, as meaning the feeling of love or brotherhood from one dynamic to another.The third corner of the triangle is communication. Communication is actually done viathe sense channels. One sees a rock. By sight he is communicating with the rock. He feels ablade of grass. He is then communicating, via a sense channel, with the blade of grass. Whenone talks to another person he is sending an impulse from “I” to the vocal cords which set upphysical universe sound waves which reach the ears of the other person, are translated intonerve impulses and so convert into an impingement upon “I” of the other person. Com-munication by talk, then, goes from Life to Life via the physical universe. It is the same withtouch. One person touches another. This is communication via the physical universe persons.There may be direct, non-physical universe communication channels from “I” to “I.” The mosttangible of these is emotional impact.One cannot have affinity without agreement. One cannot have agreement without someform of communication. One cannot have communication without agreement. One cannot haveagreement without affinity. One cannot have communication without affinity. This inevitabletriangle may be at any level on the tone scale, high or low. If communication is destructive, theaffinity drops to anger and agreement is violent disagreement.At 0.0, which is death, Affinity, Communication and Reality are wholly physicaluniverse for the body and are the cohesion’s, the connections and the aspects of the physicaluniverse.At 1.0, which is fear, the Affinity is poor, being fearful, the Communication is twistedand consists of lies, the reality is poor and is agreed upon for covert purposes.At 2.0, which is antagonism, the Affinity is broken into hostility, the Communication isnagging or disagreeable, the Reality is contradictory to others just to contradict and is thereforepoor.At 3.0 which is above the normal person, Affinity is love, it is present but reserved, theCommunication is conservative, the Reality is cautious but is agreed upon after being proven.20"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"At 4.0 which is cheerfulness, Affinity is affectionate, Communication is free andconstructive, Reality is good and agreement is general.Above 4.0 we have many levels but ARC (Affinity, Reality and Communication) aregetting above a physical universe aspect. Out of ARC we can derive any understanding. In fact,logic evolves out of ARC. At 4.0 we have lower level understanding and understandingincreases to complete knowledge when a very high band is reached—above 20.0.ARC are actually the interplay’s of Life active in the physical universe.When you communicate with an antagonistic person, you have to enter into an“affinity” and a reality of 2.0. When you show affinity for 1.0, which is FEAR, you inherit thecommunication and agreement level of the 1.0. An individual, to escape this inevitabletransaction, has to be above 4.0 on the tone scale.In order to have an understanding of yourself, you must have good ARC with yourself.It is NOT evil to like yourself or love yourself. It is very low toned not to be fond ofyourself.All the dynamics are interactive. If you love others you will love yourself. If you hateothers you will hate yourself. If you hate men, you will hate along the other dynamics evenwhen you cover it with “sympathy” as you will discover in a later act.A healthy state of being is to be a friend to yourself. If you have few friends, if youdon’t like friends, you won’t like yourself either.If you are afraid of people, you won’t trust yourself and will be afraid of what youmight do.If you are afraid of animals you will also be afraid of possessions and sex and peopleand anything else.Occasionally people have special fears. These are only concentrations upon one thing.A person, without admitting it, will also be afraid on the other dynamics, but will not haverecognized it.It is not enough to suddenly determine to LOVE everybody. That is forcing affinity onyourself.Affinity is enforced from 2.0 down to near 1.0. Around 1.0 we have “propitiation,”buying people off, pretending affection. From here on down affinity is inhibited.Thus we see that enforced, demanded ARC is aberrative. And we see that inhibitedARC is also aberrative.Let’s put this to test. Do you recall a person you had to kiss? Well, did you feelagreeable toward this person? Did you want to touch (communicate with) or talk to this person?And another test. Do you recall a person who pushed you away when you feltaffectionate? What was your immediate communication reaction? What was your agreement?And another one. Do you recall a person who demanded that you talk to them ? Whatwas your level of affinity ? What degree of agreeableness did you feel?21"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"And yet another. Do you recall a person who demanded that you agree with him againstyour wishes? What was your level of affinity? What was your level of communication?And still another. Do you recall a person who continually corrected you? This isinhibited agreement. What was your reaction level on affinity ? What was your reaction as tocommunication ?Do you recall a person who was afraid of anything and everything? What was youraffinity? What was your agreement ?A person high on the tone scale reacts down toward but does not necessarily reach thelevel of the person he addresses. However, he tends to reach toward that level. And if he staysin the proximity of a lower toned person long enough he will eventually become chronically inthat tone.Do you know somebody who affects you badly after you have been in his company forawhile? Does this person like people? Does he tell the truth? Does he communicate easily? Doyou agree with his views ? Here is ARC in action in present time.After you have been in the vicinity of somebody who insists you talk, insists you agree,insists you feel as he feels, what is your own tone level toward him?After you have associated with a person who won’t let you talk, won’t agree with you,won’t let you feel as you want to feel, what is your reaction ? Where is this person on the tonescale? This is an inhibited ARC person or below 1.0. This person is afraid or apathetic. Thisperson has endocrine ills. This person lies. This person hides things. This person is physicallyand mentally maladjusted.It happens that anyone on a given level of the tone scale seeks to pull everyone else tothat level of the tone scale. A low level individual is pulled up a bit by a high level individualand then the high level individual comes down a bit.Low toned people work toward succumb. Below 2.0 the effort is toward death, oneway or another, covertly or overtly, toward succumb. The angry person, failing to destroyothers, will destroy himself. The apathetic person is almost dead. The activity of persons below2.0 is directed toward the gaining of sympathy. They try to make higher toned people sympa-thetic and thus destroy them. Sympathy for low toned cases is a social aberration. It is deadly.No low toned person can be “helped.” Try to help a person below 2.0 and the result isingratitude plus in the end. For the goal of that person is to succumb. Higher toned individualsdon’t need help.Low toned persons can be audited to above 2.0 however after which they will seek tosurvive along all dynamics. If you suppose you lie below 2.0 and have persevered this far, youdon’t.There is, by the way, very practical present time use of this data about ARC. If youwant a person to agree with you, address him at his obvious tone level and you will go intocommunication with him and he will feel affinity for you. If you want affinity from a person,use his methods of communication to others with him and go into agreement with him on hisconcept of the other dynamics. A salesman can sell a 1.5 (anger case) anything if that thing isshown to be destructive to other dynamics.This is why the government, a rather 1.5 affair, buys atomic fission as a weapon ratherthan a means to send Man to the stars.Here, then, is the second act. First achieve an understanding of the factors inunderstanding—ARC—contained in this section. Then answer these questions.22"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"List the persons in your present time environment who enforce affinity on you.List the persons in your present time environment who enforce agreement upon you.List the persons in your present time environment who demand that you communicatewith them.List the persons in your present time environment who refuse your affection.List the persons in your present time environment who won’t let you communicate withthem.List the persons in your present time environment who refuse to let you agree withthem.Now go back and put a tone scale number after each name as an estimate.

It is a cycle of nobly accepting something and then, to saveone’s own being, trying to get rid of it in time.

Go to make out an application form for a job and you will find that they are mostlyconcerned with experience. It is a sort of trap to enslave people, giving their experiences suchvalue. Actually a snapping bright mind and an alert body are worth a hundred thousand yearsof “experience” behind some dusty desk or counter and an ability to do a “quick study” of asubject is so much more valuable than an education—complete with a hundred A’s—in thatsubject that one might be led to suppose that maybe “education” as it is laughingly called mightpossibly be over stressed. Check your history and you will discover that the men whose marblebusts adorn the modern halls of learning did not themselves have a formal education: Bacon,Spencer, Voltaire, etc., etc., etc., down the whole list; two or three exceptions prove the rule.Not even long study has as much value as people might have wanted you to believe.

No single person to whom you uttered the confidence would NOT have asimilar list to hide. They’ve all masturbated and had clandestine affairs and a lot of themvenereal diseases. They’ve stolen money and maybe some have even left a cold dead body in aculvert. They’ve lied and cheated and done blackmail. And the funny part of it is, only thosewho have a long, long list of things to hide would even begin to reprimand you.And another thing. Anyone who punished you would someday regret it. A dean incollege who threatened to flunk me for writing a bit of truth in what was the longest sentence inthe English language (500 words without colons or semicolons) had it weigh upon his mind tosuch an extent that he wrote me, years afterwards, when he had retired and was nearly dead,the most astonishing apology.You are treating yourself in present time much as you were treated by others in the past.And you punish yourself far more than anyone would ever punish you. The suicide is simplyself-executioner, having been found guilty by his own court.Next, how hard and to whom are you trying to be RIGHT in the face of anything andeverything including facts?What responsibilities are you shirking?

That from 1.5 to 2.8 is considered to be neurotic. Thatfrom 2.8 to 10.0 is considered acceptable.When these figures were first calculated it was thought that normal was about 2.8. Itisn’t. That is generous beyond generosity. Normal is well below that according to amassed datasince the first computations. The reason for this seems to be in two distinct fields. The first isthe environment, the second is education.Education, continued long enough in the usual school and college, depresses theindividual toward 0.3 or apathy. The person being “educated” is, day after day, immobilized,made into an effect by instructors and denied original thought. He becomes an habitual “effect”and ceases to cause. He begins to respond automatically according to a pattern of mannersgiven him by the home and the school system. This is the primary reason why the moderncollege has yet to turn out an artist from an arts major. An artist must be a cause and continue tobe cause. Majoring in writing, for instance, is a sure route to being an editor, or worse, a critic,rather than a writer. All the editors and critics, according to writers, are failed writers. They arealso arts majors for the most part, with wonderful grades. The writers revolted early. This is nocriticism of modern education or educators, it is a small signpost pointing toward the source oflow tone.Education is also done in the home. The level of that education is the level of the home.The goal of most parents is obedience. Obedience is apathy. Most BAD children become goodthe moment you let them up the tone scale.The general society today may be commented upon by a review of the front pages of thenewspapers. The “public” buys the news it wants. The newspapers, being an expanded versiontoday of the old house-to-house advertising handout, print news to sell papers. The tone rangeof the usual front page today is from 1.5 down to 0.1. A man could invent something thatwould feed all the starving people in the world with ease and get a news notice one inch highnear the obituary column. The blood-soaked and sordid front pages of the world’s newspaperstell you that Man has sunk pretty far down. His newspaper is the modern American’s RomanCircus, his government is becoming his corn. Bluntly, the normal is a very sick man.There are three valid therapies. The first is processing. The second is education. Thethird is environment. We find the first two in this new science. The third must sometimes bechanged for a pre-clear may be in such a vigorously painful environment that his gains inprocessing are lost in his struggle against his surroundings. Very fast processing is one answerto the environmental problem. Wives have been known to practically murder husbands whodared try to get up out of apathy via processing. Apathy is a very docile and obedient, if sick,state of not beingness. Husbands have been known to react similarly when their wives tried toget well. And in the past some mental practitioners have gone raving insane when one of theirpatients started to climb into well being via processing.The chief difference between the severely aberrated, the neurotic and the “acceptable”bands is concerned with TIME.The severely aberrated gives his attention mainly to the past. The neurotic is giving hisattention mainly to the immediate present. The “acceptable” is giving his attention to the future.By forcing attention into the present (raising necessity level) one can raise a severelyaberrated person into a neurotic level. The AAs do this with alcoholics, persuading them to livefor the present only. Your alcoholic, of course, is still trying to untangle the past—with a28"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"forgetter known as alcohol, just as your drug addict is shutting off the agony of yesterday withan anesthetic.However, almost anyone is giving more attention than necessary to the past, reserveshis living in the present and restrains his planning for the future. Your 1.5, for instance,considers it bad taste to be enthusiastic about the future. “Don’t hope too much.” For the 0.5both present and future are unthinkableAttention is a remarkable thing in that it must be at optimum sweep for a person to behappy. When attention is too fixed on one thing, if that thing is a survival threat, it tends toremain fixed. If a threat to survival is understood to be present and yet cannot be located,attention swings endlessly without fixing. This is “fear of the unknown.” Fixed and unfixedattention, when given to dangerous problems, tend to remain that way unless the problem issolved.The human mind’s basic purpose in operation is the posing and resolving of problems itobserves as related to survival along any of the dynamics. A problem is resolved when it isanswered YES or NO. A problem such as SHOULD I GO ? must be answered YES or NO ifthe mind is to file it as a conclusion. If it continues as MAYBE, the problem stays in thecomputer and influences the next solutions. Did you ever know a person who had a lot oftrouble reaching decisions ? Recall a specific time ? Well, somewhere in that person’s past wasa problem which was not answered YES or NO but only maybe. A very “serious” sort of aproblem comes up with WAS IT MY FAULT ? When that one lands on MAYBE the computertends to jam. (The answer by the way is that nothing is anybody’s fault.)Problems do not solve for two reasons: The first is lack of data; the second is an earlierunsolved problem on the same subject.One has to evaluate data in order to resolve problems. When one fixes his attention onsomething dangerous he is probably over evaluating the data. When one is unable to fix hisattention it is because he cannot find data to evaluate.This will become clearer to you when you have completed the following exercise.

Some poet once said that a man’s dreamswere important and that when the last of a man’s dreams were dead, dead was the man. Hedidn’t know about this new science.Dreams, goals, ambitions, these are the stuff Man uses for fuel. SURVIVAL is nothingbut the effort to accomplish action. There is the broad goal of all survival. There is the smallgoal of a good action. SURVIVAL, action and goals are inseparable.Happiness could be defined as the emotion of progress toward desirable goals. There isan instant of contemplation of the last goal in which one is content. But contentment becomesboredom immediately that new goals do not come to view. There is no more unhappy thingthan a man who has accomplished all his ends in life. Gibbon, for instance died immediatelyafter finishing his great work. It is doubtful if men die when they have great goals ahead ofthem, save perhaps in the violent action of some attempted attainments. It is doubtful if it wouldtake more than a flick with a feather to kill somebody who has no goals. The Filipino irregularof 1901, battling for an independent state, would charge seventy-five yards and kill his manAFTER that man had put a Krag-Jorgenson bullet through the heart of the Filipino. A neuroticwithout goals catches a harmless bug, sneezes and dies. Or sneezes and dies without a buggetting near him.People always begin with goals. They often fail. When they have failed often enoughthey stop thinking about the future and start worrying over the present. When the present handsthem a few failures they start worrying about the past. They go “out of present time.” If youwere simply to walk through an insane asylum and tell each inmate, “Come up to PresentTime” a small percentage would immediately become sane and stay sane.

It wasborn, it grew, it died. Surgery and drugs could stem the tide of time a brief moment. But thatwas all. This dramatic struggle for knowledge of the human body was a struggle against time.Time’s scythe in the hands of that grim gentleman, Death, won every contest.Now and then a mystic would rise in the world and with a few passes of the hand causethe crippled, the sightless, the faltering to bloom with life once more. Then the mystic, theadept, the master would vanish and Man would struggle on with attention to their relics butwithout many repetitions of the miracles.That faith or thought could do such astonishing things in the hands of a master or adeptbrought men like Freud into heavy ambition to resolve the human body’s ills by resolving theills of the mind. The medical profession of his day ostracized Freud. Today psychoanalysis andpsychologists speak with contempt of Freud—perhaps they owe him too much. But Freud isthe grand old man of psychosomatic healing. He popularized the idea that something could bedone about human unhappiness via treatment of the mind and that human ills might be handledby handling the “ego,” the “id” and the other mental entities Freud thought he had discovered.Freud has many pupils Jung, Adler and others who decided only they themselves could see thelight and so went sailing off into further and further incredibles. Of all these it now seemsevident that Freud himself was the only one of them who had even started toward the straightand narrow road to complete physical rehabilitation of the body via the human mind.In my boyhood I studied Freud second hand. His brilliant student, the late CommanderThompson of the U.S. Navy, had just left Freud and Vienna when he saw fit to dazzle a youngmind with the idea that perhaps the riddle of thought could be resolved. Studying Freud tenthhand, through his books and what people thought people had said about what Freud said, thepsychoanalysis and psychiatric world had broken cleanly with Freud years before I even cameto a university. There was no studying Freud in any college. They did not teach Freud. He hadbeen abandoned by the professional cliques.34"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"In the meanwhile a new subject had risen in the world. Nuclear physics they call itnow—”atomic and molecular phenomena” they called it then. No atoms had been spliteffectively, but from Newton to Halley to Einstein, men had been studying the physicaluniverse and had now encoded the subjects of matter, energy, space and time. Here was a newfield of knowledge. It was so new that those of us who studied in it were known as the “BuckRogers boys,” a comic strip character of the day who sailed off to Mars or Venus and hadincredible adventures. We experimented with rockets and the doppler effects and later foundemployment difficult to achieve except as orthodox engineers. Although it was my father’sambition that I become one of these orthodox engineers, bless him, I found that with all thisnew knowledge, transits were dull. In order to pursue studies in this field I had to write for anymagazine that would buy. Many of us, in the decade of the thirties, were “Buck Rogers boys”in earnest, writing “science fiction” for a growing audience of fans. Then came Hiroshima and“Buck Rogers boys” started to have such importance to the governments of the world that theyare almost prisoners. Having escaped offered employment by Russia and the United States, Icontinued my work in the field where I had started, the human mind, from the viewpoint ofmathematics and nuclear physics. As late as 1950 I was still acting fast to keep out of U.S.Government research laboratories.Culmination of research in what is popularly known as this new science and morecorrectly known as “Scientology” has yet to occur. But in 1948 a thesis was written andsubmitted to the medical professions which demonstrated that workability of alleviatingphysical ills by an address to mental problems.You as a personal identity are the composite of all your experience PLUS an initialdecision TO BE and occasional decisions NOT TO BE. YOU do not die as an identity or apersonality or an individual. YOU and the MEST body “separate” and the MEST body gets afuneral. YOU then link into the protoplasm line with your genetic blueprint—the plans ofconstruction of a new body in the orthodox manner of conception, birth and growth. Youdepend upon some inherent abilities of protoplasm but you, as experience and identity, monitorthat protoplasm’s ability and modify it. There is a family line, then, from generation togeneration, modified by YOU as experience. YOU are not necessarily part of that family line.Every child, for instance, distrusts his identity as a family member. And there are numerouscases of record wherein a child, up to the age of three or five, recalled entirely who he hadbeen—but forgot it under the pummeling of his “imagination” by adults. Perhaps you take offafter some lifetime and go to heaven. Nobody can argue successfully about that. But YOU arethe source of yourself with regard to various generations. Now this, by effort processing,becomes so irrefutable, so clear and unmistakable that if it can be disproven, then the laws ofheat and fission can be disproven as well. We are on solid ground about immortality and all therest of it for the first time in history.YOU are evidently quite eternal as a personal identity. You get snarled up in the modernsocial aberrations about only living once and play the game as though you would never getanother chance—which you will get as certainly as the sun will rise tomorrow.Now if you can handle a body in construction you can certainly modify one in growthand form. And so you do. You can modify it to the degree of going blind or getting arthritisand being bed-ridden or having migraines or putting any other imperfection on yourself. You,as CAUSE, are continually shouldering the ills of the world and modifying yourselfaccordingly.Once having taken on such an ill to “help” another, you may be very reluctant to give upthe infirmity. Evidently it doesn’t help the other very much but you, with your social aberrationthat a person lives only once and never again, take the illness or demise of another veryseriously. Much too seriously. And so there you are with somebody’s arthritis. Of course, itisn’t his. It’s an old injury of your own—your own facsimile—which you are holding in placefor him. People will give up any illness or infirmity which is theirs—their very own—withimmediate ease and no qualms. But they are quite tenacious of the ills they have shouldered forothers. This caused old workers in the field of the mind to suppose that people simply refused35"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"to get well. No, people simply refuse to give up the illness of others for whom they have madethemselves responsible until they clearly see that holding the illness will not bring back orrestore the health of that other. It’s a wonderful world. Man has condemned Man for selfish-ness for eons and here we find Man only gets lastingly crippled or lame to “help” another.Once it was said that if people knew the world was going to end tomorrow, thecommunication lines of the world would be jammed with calls from people seeking to say theyloved one another. It is probably quite true.In the field of illness, however, once one realizes how little it helps, one can give upanother’s aches and pains and resume his own health. It is quite a decision but one whichprocessing itself assists. You may find that you will be trying to make that decision. The otherday a totally blind man under processing stopped the session on the abrupt realization that hewould see wholly and clearly for the first time in years. Just an instant before his sight turnedon, he balked. Why? His trouble with sight had to do with the death of his brother. His brotherhad been injured and was blinded in an automobile accident. The moment the brother died, thispre-clear had taken on the burdens of his brother.WHICH YOU WISH YOU COULD ATTAIN IN THE TOMORROW’S, SUCH ASPHYSICAL BEAUTY OF STRENGTH, WHETHER YOU THINK YOU CAN ATTAINTHEM OR NOT.

In continuous investigation of mental and physical phenomena, Ichanced upon these manifestations and put them to work immediately. Such was their reachand significance that auditors from coast to coast, within sixty days, were “cracking cases”which they had found hitherto “uncrackable.” Thus you can see that it is well to knowsomething about them.Let us take EFFORT. Your mind is continuously at work estimating efforts. When yougo to open a door, your mind estimates the effort necessary to turn the knob and, via emotion,puts that effort into action. It estimates the effort necessary to pull the door back and puts thatinto action. If the door handle turned as desired and the door opened as desired, yourestimation of effort was correct.Your mind calculates efforts for the present and for the future. It puts efforts into actionnow or in the future. Or it simply estimates them and holds them back and never applies them.Your mind estimates the efforts of the environment, how fast cars go, how hard tea cups haveto fall to break. And it even estimates efforts when it “day-dreams,” which is to say that itthinks of the efforts involved in that and that without even desiring to puts them into action.Thinking of a goal is putting something into the future to which one can build by effort. Anattained goal is a summation of efforts.If you calculated the door properly, you opened it smoothly. If you calculated wrongand the door stuck, you revere wrong. Did you ever have a door or a drawer stick on youconsistently? After a while you became angry with it. Then you began to avoid it. For the mindwhich survives well, estimates efforts well. It is right, which is to say, it estimates effortsrightly.The author writing a story estimates many, many efforts. If he is right, it is aninteresting story and sells. If he is wrong it is not an interesting story and it doesn’t sell.The mind all through evolution was subjected to countless efforts on the part of theenvironment. The wind, sea, sun and other organisms all had efforts to throw at the organism.The organism that handled these counter-efforts well, survived well. It came to use these verycounter-efforts as its own efforts. The evolution of efforts is from counter-effort to employedeffort.Effort means force and direction. Your life is a contest between your own efforts andenvironmental efforts.Any psychosomatic illness you have is some counter-effort, some past effort of theenvironment, you aren’t handling or using right. The facsimile of the effort itself is in thefacsimile. Facsimiles are recordings of effort. Perception is the recording of physical universeefforts and your thoughts, conclusions and efforts about them as well as your emotion.Effort processing is easily done. One finds where the facsimile of an effort is againstthe pre-clear and gets the preclear’s effort against it. A pain or pressure turns on and, byconstant reexperiencing, turns off. But effort processing is something which should be done byany auditor and although it can be done by a pre-clear on himself, must be thoroughlyunderstood by that pre-clear. There is not enough data in this volume to permit a pre-clear toeffort process himself. To do that he would have to study the main body of this science,preferably at the Foundation Auditor’s School, or at least through the basic texts.Emotion and counter-emotion are something else. The preclear should be able to handlethese.38"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"You know what your own emotion is. Anger, fear, grief, apathy. You haveexperienced these things. They are part of facsimiles now. Grief is very important as a blockerin one’s life. Grief takes place where one recognizes his loss and failure as in the death ofsomebody he loved and tried to help.A facsimile which contains chiefly emotion is called, in this science, a SECONDARYENGRAM. This would be a unit of assay with ease. They are flattened simply byre-experiencing them and getting four old conclusions out of then.A word of caution. Don’t try to run yourself around somebody who may be evenfaintly critical. And don’t argue with somebody about it. The wife, mother, father, thehusband, may get into a terrible dither about your effort to feel stronger. They may even havean interest in keeping you down so they can “take better care of you.” Run one of thesesecondaries around such a person and you’ll really fix yourself up.And by the way, be very suspicious of somebody who doesn’t think you ought toindulge in this new science. Auditors are always running into situations where they have a sonor a daughter in good condition and well on the road to recovery when the parents step in andwith every argument in the book, with every “good intention” knock the poor preclear intolimbo again. Such people want the pre-clear under control and instinctively realize that thepre-clear is getting very independent. The pre-clear who argues back simply gets himselfsnarled up again. Best to be calm and do your work in private. Then when you are nine feettall, do your arguing.And don’t plead with a wife or a husband or a friend to study this new science againsthis or her will and use it on you. They will manage one way or another to turn the processesaround and wreck you. You may have an impulse to use your facsimiles to get sympathy fromsuch a person. It is quicker and easier just to blow out your brains. The result will be the same.For when you force somebody to “help you” and “be sympathetic” who has an interest inkeeping you sick, they will manage to make you sick in earnest. Out of their good knowledgeand intentions, of course. There is, for instance, a very sick woman who could be straightenedout by an auditor in about fifteen hours. Yet her husband, hovering like a mother hen, is violentabout letting her be helped: He knows nothing of this new science except that it is successful.She has had three unsuccessful operations for her condition. He is seeing to it that she is goingto get a fourth which will probably kill her. These are desires to help—out of a frame ofreference which doesn’t work. “Keep him calm. Operate on him. Control him. Mama knowsbest” are the sources of the attitude.Further, you have always had and use what is known as a SERVICE FACSIMILE.Every time you fail, you pick up this facsimile and become sick or sadly noble. It’s yourexplanation to yourself and the world as to how and why you failed. It once got you sympathy.Sympathy will turn it on again. It may contain the basic condition of being which is nowpassing for a common cold or sinusitis or a game leg. You fail at something, then you use thefacsimile. And you get sympathy from somebody. Well, heaven help you if you are aroundsomebody who doesn’t get the line signals. You use the facsimile and then they don’tsympathize. You use the facsimile harder. And they are still stone cold. Then you really turn iton. Maybe it was measles that founded this facsimile. Maybe it was when you broke your leg.Well, you’ll use it to a point where you’ll get all the symptoms again if you don’t get sympathyfor it. You have two choices: Run out this service facsimile and the reasons for its use as perthe remainder of these acts or get yourself a new associate or partner. For that service facsimilewill get you by and by. You didn’t believe it yourself the first time you decided to use it. Thenthe use of it became automatic. And now you “wonder what caused it.” You did.We remark on the SERVICE FACSIMILE at this place, not to have it run in this act,but to acquaint you with its existence. For you may hit it in running a secondary and be veryloath to part with it. It is simply a time when you tried to do something and were hurt or failedand got sympathy for it. Then afterwards when you were hurt or failed and wanted an39"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"explanation you used it. And if you didn’t succeed in getting sympathy for it, you used it sohard it became a psychosomatic illness.Let’s take a summary of your body.

It simplymakes you human.The facsimile might release right here. If it doesn’t, there’s a lot of book left.ONE WORD OF CAUTION ABOUT ALL THIS. PROCESS YOURSELF ATSPECIFIC TIMES, NOT ALL THE TIME. CHOOSE A PROCESSING TIME AND USE IT.THEN WHEN IT IS OVER, WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT TIME. DON’T GO AROUNDSELF AUDITING.In the pictures you get of old incidents, you may he seeing yourself “outside ofyourself,” not seeing the scene as you saw it then. This is being “out of valence.” Simply movein valence to run the incident. Running it outside yourself won’t do very much for you. But ifyou run it very many times, you’ll be inside yourself in the scene.Being outside oneself is the cause of “self-auditing.” In an operation or somewhere,you slid out. When you self-audit, you may be in the role of somebody who hurt you (acounter effort) and you’ll just keep on hurting yourself. The section on counter-emotion, later,clears up this condition if it begins.You should know this so that you will not be alarmed on several counts. The first istemporary “euphoria” where you stay happy for two or three days and then get sad again.That’s a temporary shift, evidently. The second is physical unbalance which can occur as atemporary affair, where you get a toothache or a headache on one side and the other side seemsnumb. Another is a shift of interests.You won’t contract amnesia but this shift of centers may be responsible for amnesia. Asudden shift of centers occludes present time experience and then may shift back. It doesn’thappen in processing.There is also a whole set of “pseudo-centers,” the personalities of people whom you’vetried to help and have failed. These are “valences.” A person can have two or ten dozen of these40"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"“valences,” can be one personality to Joe and another to Agnes, can change at a certain periodof life into an “entirely new person.” This is simply a manifestation of the life continuationmanifestation discussed earlier. All these are relieved by getting rid of mis-emotion.The ideal state of affairs is the attainment of a super-center. Right and left centers arealways sub-centers. A “super-center” is acquired on discharging all the sympathy and regret ona case or, in short, the mis-emotion.Think this over carefully. The incidents are marked by sudden changes in physicalhealth, old illnesses disappearing, new illnesses appearing. Falling in love may shift centers. Abump on the head may shift them. Any emotional shock might do it. In particular, incidentswhich diminish one’s concept of his ability to handle his surroundings and people may shiftcenters. A sudden drop, because of an experience, of one’s importance, may shift centers.A death, a severe loss, a realization of one’s unimportance, may shift these centers.Each incident listed should be run. If it is difficult to run as a facsimile, wait until later in thevolume when you have learned how to chain scan yourself and then refer back to this list. Ifpossible use the technique for secondaries as of the sixth act to accomplish the purpose.WRITE DOWN THE NUMBER OF TIMES, WITH APPROXIMATE DATES, WHEN YOUMIGHT HAVE SHIFTED CENTERS.WRITE DOWN, BRIEFLY, THE SHOCK OR LOSS WHICH MIGHT HAVEOCCASIONED THESE SHIFTS.41"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE EIGHTH ACTDone by yourself, without an auditor’s assistance, you may find this processing ratherheavy for you and again you may not, depending on how much life endowment you have.But here is a technique which is relatively simple. It does things for you quickly. In thefall of 1951 I developed this technique from one called chain-scanning, an effort to non pain inwholesale quantities from a case, which did not work. This is lock-scanning. It does work.Take your pencil and draw a line, a vertical line on the space to the right. Make the lineabout five inches high.Now, at the bottom of this line, mark it conception.An inch above the bottom, draw a horizontal line and mark it birth.At the top of the line, mark it present time.Now just above birth, draw a VERY heavy horizontal bar about an inch long.At intervals of every quarter or half an inch, irregularly, above the heavy bar, draw alight line horizontally, half an inch long. There should be a dozen or two of these light lines.Now mark the heavy horizontal bar PAINFUL INCIDENT.Now mark the light bars above it, each one, LOCK. Here is a picture of a TIMETRACK. That is the long vertical line. It is a way to plot your facsimiles, experiences in life,against time. Actually these facsimiles can be sorted around at will by you. But stretching themall out this way, they can be conceived as a track of time through which you have lived.Now during this lifetime, on this TIME TRACK, various things happened to you.Some were good and some were bad. Up to your teens you had the big goal of growth andafter that you had other goals.This track is a continuous facsimile. But it is made up of a lot of facsimiles, particularexperiences which either stand out or remain hidden.PAINFUL INCIDENT is any incident which was painful: a death, an operation, a bigfailure, big enough to render you unconscious such as an accident. You’ve had many of thesebut we are graphing just one to show you what happens to any of them.LOCKS occur when you decide that the environment is similar to the PAINFULINCIDENT. LOCKS occur when an individual is tired or has had a minor failure in life whichreminds him, perhaps, of the major failure.The technique known as LOCK SCANNING starts off from an early lock of thepainful incident but not the painful incident itself. One doesn’t pay any attention to that: it ismore or less inflated by the locks and can be handled as an incident just like any otherfacsimile, which is to say, put aside at will. But sometimes the locks have to be cared forbefore the PAINFUL INCIDENT slips away. Of course the painful incident itself can be runby effort processing but that’s pretty heavy to do by yourself. Further, these locks have to bescanned anyway.A lock, then, can be treated by LOCK SCANNING.42"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"To LOCK SCAN, one contacts an early lock on the track and goes rapidly or slowlythrough all such similar incidents straight to present time. One does this many times and thewhole chain of locks becomes ineffective in influencing one.Now more work with the pencil. Number the locks. Mark the first one abovePAINFUL INCIDENT, 1, the next 2, and so on.When you start to lock scan, you will find an incident of the type required. You willscan yourself through all such similar incidents to present time. Maybe the earliest one youfound on this scan was lock 8 and you scanned from there through the remaining locks topresent time.On your next scan, try to find an earlier lock. The fist scan made an earlier oneaccessible to you. This new start may be lock 5. Scan from lock 5 to present time through allsimilar incidents.On your next scan you may find an even earlier lock. Scan from there to present timethrough all similar incidents.You do this scanning on any one chain until you are “extroverted” about it, which is tosay, until you find yourself in present time thinking about something else, your tone probablyup.If you continue to lock scan after you have “extroverted” you will “drop through” intoanother chain on some other subject. This isn’t bad but you want to stop scanning when youare extroverted. One more scan will find you scanning another chain.It can happen that during scanning you hit what is known as a “boil-off.” This meansthat you become groggy and seem to go to sleep. This is evidently caused by oldunconsciousness coming off. It hasn’t much benefit and apparently occurs when two facsimilesconflict with each other. Actually you could lock scan yourself into a great deal of “boil-off.”You could probably spend five hundred hours lock scanning this and that and boiling off.That’s the slow road. THE OBJECT OF LOCK SCANNING IS NOT BOIL-OFF. BOIL-OFFMEANS TOO MANY SECONDARIES, TOO MUCH GRIEF AND TOO MUCH REGRET.IF YOU FIND YOURSELF BOILING OFF TOO MUCH (A LITTLE IS QUITE IN ORDER)RUN REGRET AND BLAME AS IN A LATER SECTION.This technique has to be known and understood if your processing is to go swiftly.To show you what happens, here’s some work with an eraser. Take the graph youmade. Run your eraser from lock 7 to present time. Some of the lines lightened. Now run theeraser from lock 5 to present time. Now from lock 1 to present time. Now pass the eraser from1 up many times until the lines are almost erased. That is what happens to the facsimiles youlock scan.It is possible for you to “hang-up” in lock scanning. You start to run a chain ofincidents and find yourself “stuck” halfway to present time. Don’t flounder around or getalarmed. You’ve hit a POSTULATE, a decision you have made not to get rid of something ornever to get over that incident. You’ve hit something you yourself thought which keeps youfrom going on by the incident. Possibly it is regret. Feel the feeling of regret and you maybecome unstuck. Or feel the feeling of blaming you or somebody else for the incident. Orsimply feel the counter-emotion, which will be covered in a moment and is a ripe subject forscanning. It’s expected you’ll finish reading all this before you try it.You can lock-scan at various speeds. You can scan so fast you don’t even know whatthe incidents are. That’s MAXIMUM. Or you can scan so slowly that you know every wordsaid. That’s VERBAL. Or you can scan speeds in between. You may have been living withsomebody who insisted you hear every word they said and you may find yourself scanning at a43"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"speed which might, facetiously, be called “turtle.” That is too slow. Most scanning is done atACCELERATED, which simply gives one a glimpse and concept of each successive incident.Light emotion, counter-emotion, blame, phrases, people, anything can be scanned.One of the most important things to scan is COUNTER EMOTION which wasmentioned belt not explained in act seven.Have you ever walked into a room and known that people had been talking about youor fighting just before your entrance? The “atmosphere” seems charged. When somebodystands and bawls you out, do you feel the anger?You have emotion which you discharge at people. You try to make them enthusiastic ormake them see the seriousness of something or you show them your contempt. Well, theysense it not so much as words but as emotion.A good orator is one who can throw out a great deal of emotion and so thrill or energizean audience. The same thing could be done with mis-emotion, anger, grief, etc.Mass hysteria is a well known phenomena. One person in a crowd is panicky. Thewhole crowd becomes panicky without even knowing what is wrong. This is a built up mani-festation of “herd instinct.” Man traveled in packs. It was safer to run or to charge instantlythan it was to dawdle around for verbal orders. Thus, mass emotion. This is a survival instinct.More than that, emotion is the relay between thought and action. Emotion is the glue infacsimiles.There is THOUGHT, EMOTION and EFFORT. Thought is one fringe of emotion.Effort or physical action is the other fringe of emotion.Efforts and counter efforts have been mentioned. Somebody hits you. That is acounter-effort. You resist the blow. That is the effort. You use two kinds of effort, the effort toremain at rest and the effort to remain in motion. There are two counter-efforts which you canexperience. One which moves against you and one which refuses to move. You can see thisvery easily. Right now you are making a tiny effort to hold up this book while thecounter-effort of gravity is pulling it down. Every day the counter-effort of gravity makes aperson shrink during his waking hours, about three-quarters of an inch. At night he gains itback.EMOTION and COUNTER-EMOTION are similar to EFFORT andCOUNTER-EFFORT. You have two goals with emotion. Thought, via emotion, seeks to stopaction, self or exterior. Thought, via emotion, seeks to start action, self or exterior. Anger, forinstance, seeks to stop exterior action. Fear seeks to start self-action to get away.Now emotion is emotion whether it is yours or anothers. Live around a person who iscontinually angry and you will begin to emotionally react toward that anger, for the anger seeksto stop you whatever you do. Live around a person who is afraid and you will pick up theirfear and try to counteract it with emotion of your own, usually seeking to stop their flight. Oryou can get into the unhappy state of duplicating their counter-emotion with your emotion. Youdo this whenever you agree with somebody. (The chief hole in light books which seek to winfriends and influence people. They also make people ill eventually because of agreement onemotion.) Agree with an angry man and you’ll get angry too. Agree with an afraid man andyou’ll get afraid. Agree with a man in grief and you’ll feel your own grief. And so on ascovered in ARC in an earlier act.You can feel your own emotion and the counter-emotion when examining a facsimile.Or you can feel simply your own emotion. Or you can feel the counter-emotion only. You can44"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"take what you want out of a facsimile. The trick is to take what is essentially aberrative out ofit.Now let’s see what happens to a counter-effort. This, let us say, is that pressure yousometimes feel in your stomach. That’s just a facsimile of an old blow but it is sometimes veryuncomfortable. How do we get rid of that facsimile? Well, we can lock scan all the times it everbothered you. And we can lock scan it until it won’t bother you again. That’s one way. It’saround a lot so we can run it as a service facsimile by effort (or an auditor can run it, which isbest when effort is in question). Or we can run a grief charge off grandfather’s death,grandfather having had a stomach that bothered him. Or we can run off the counter-emotion.We have a dozen ways to handle that stomach trouble.Let’s see how the fastest way. That may be COUNTER EMOTION SCANNING.If it’s a pressure or a pain, it is a facsimile of some pain that happened before and whichstill exists “in memory” as a facsimile. Obviously it eludes our control of it or it wouldn’t hurt.What makes it elude our own control of it? Well, after the blow was struck or whatever thecounter-effort was, somebody in the environment began to throw emotion at that very spot.That is counter-emotion to you. The counter-emotion took over that facsimile of thecounter-effort and it is being held there by somebody else’s counter-emotion. That’s the waythe pressure or pain in the stomach may add up.Don’t let’s try to get complicated about this. It’s simple. George has been hit in thestomach by a baseball. Later his mother is sympathetic. That makes it a “good facsimile” soGeorge holds on to it. Then one day he gets married. His wife, a 1.5, begins to nag him abouteating. She gets angry at him. He wants sympathy instead so he holds up this facsimile forsympathy and it doesn’t work. Her counter-emotion, anger, alters the baseball in the stomachsomatic and puts anger on it. Now George doesn’t control it any more. It is controlled by hiswife and her counter-emotion of anger. In processing, George starts to run his wife’s anger.The old baseball facsimile turns on strongly and then goes away, never to return.Where the emotion of others is concerned, an ache or a pain is fair game. But oddlyenough, one has to have loved or felt sympathy for another in order for that person’s counteremotion to have much effect.The cycle is then as serious a blow or a pain becomes a facsimile. Facsimile is used byindividual. Or isn’t handled well by him. Somebody close to him gets angry at him or fearful orsad. That emotion (counter emotion) turns on the old blow or pain. If the counter-emotion isheavy, not even effort processing can touch that old facsimile until the counter emotion isremoved from it.The process is this: You have an ache or a pain. You can’t get rid of it simply byidentifying its source or other light means. You locate a time when somebody you loved threwcounter-emotion at that particular spot. You scan, by lock scanning, all the counter-emotionthrown at that spot, whether it was sympathy or anger or fear. It doesn’t matter what you doabout your own emotion.One of two things will happen: You will find the old facsimile and throw it away or youwill find counter-emotion from a great many people, run that off by scanning, and thendiscover a big secondary which will have to be run or a PAINFUL INCIDENT which has to berun by effort processing and is the service facsimile.Whatever happens, you won’t go wrong by running any and all counter-emotion youcan find.Every atmosphere in which you have lived has an “emotional quality.” You will findthat emotion doesn’t come from humans only. You will find times in your life when you ranaway from an atmosphere alone, not for any other reason than that you did not like the “feel” of45"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"it. You will find you have avoided people, certain persons, certain groups, because you did notlike the counter-emotion. You may discover that that vague blur which you recalled as youreducation was thrust out of sight just because you hated the school atmosphere, itscounter-emotion.Primarily and foremost, you will find counter-emotion sitting around by tar bucketsfulwhenever you failed. This is a mixture of counter-emotion and your own emotion or regret andblame.Counter-emotion has been thrown at you, your thoughts, specific parts of your bodyand, in particular, that great or slight infirmity which you carry around.Don’t be alarmed if, in scanning counter-emotion, some chronic pain begins to turn uplike a five-alarm fire. Don’t run for a water bucket. Just run more counter-emotion. It’sdoubtful if it will kill you for you see, you didn’t die before when you actually experienced it.These are just facsimiles. If the real thing didn’t ruin you the facsimile probably can’t.If you have a very weak heart, however, or some such infirmity which means razor-edgebetween life and death, USE MEMORY ONLY FROM PRESENT TIME, DON’T LOCKSCAN, ON COUNTER-EMOTION. In two years these processes in the hands of the public,an often careless public, have never lost a pre-clear by reason of a weak heart or some suchhair-trigger infirmity but I must state that that doesn’t mean it can’t occur. See a doctor and anauditor but don’t let the doctor talk you out of the auditor. Doctors always tell people with weakhearts to slow down—that’s what’s wrong with the individual. He’s too slow already.The assignment of the eighth act is first a thorough study of lock scanning. Then athorough study of counter-emotion. Then, finally, testing out lock scanning andcounter-emotion separately and then as one process. Do the following practice exercises.LOCK SCAN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE EVER HEARD ABOUT THIS SCIENCE, GOODAND BAD, UNTIL YOU EXTROVERT ON THE SUBJECT.LOCK SCAN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OR READ ABOUT L.

All things are complex when they are poorly understood. The evolution ofknowledge is toward simplicity, not complexity. An evolution toward complexity is anevolution toward authoritarianism and pomposity—”you couldn’t possibly understand this,therefore I, who pretend to, am important” is the attitude which mires learning. The only claimscience has on anyone’s attention or interest is the ability of a science to make phenomenaworkable and align that phenomena for better understanding. A body of data which does notaccomplish this is not only not a science, it is a pretense and a humbuggery. Thus, if you areworking with any idea that the human mind “is too complex to understand” you are taking thestand of those who failed. The problem of resolving the human mind was enormously difficult.The solution of the operation and difficulties of the human mind is very simple.We have three levels of operation. They are THOUGHT, EMOTION AND EFFORT.Thought produces motion or action through the medium of emotion. Motion and effort ingeneral produce thought directly but also through the medium of emotion.THOUGHT is without time. It is instantaneous. Emotion, where its band rests inTHOUGHT is also without TIME. EFFORT, ACTION CONTAIN TIME. A motion is achange of position in space. A change of position requires time. The common partner of timeand space is motion. To have motion we have to have space and time. To have EMOTION wedo not need time. And there is no time what ever in thought. This is the theoretical background.It doesn’t much matter whether it is clearly understood or not.An individual is a collection of “memories” going back to his first appearance on earth.In other words, he is the composite of all his facsimiles plus his impulse TO BE. Individualitydepends upon facsimiles. The very character and shape of the body, its genetic blueprint whichsays whether one has one head or two, is a composite of facsimiles, according to theory andevidences.The facsimiles which occasion behavior were initially counter-efforts. All facsimilescontain counter-efforts. The body and personality are actually old counter-efforts which “I” hasturned into efforts. Thoughts are timeless. You can close your eyes and see, in thought, someitem which you well know is since vanished in the MEST universe. You have it as a facsimilestill. You can in thought, go back and be a small child. You cannot go back in body and changethe past. That you can go back in thought tells us that the thought must be right here in presenttime too. In other words you as mind can handle yesterday as thought. Thought is timeless.Thoughts are FILED by your concept of when they happened. As long as you know the timetab of any thought, it is yours completely. When you do not know the time tab of a thought,you no longer control it.People are very fond of saying they have “bad memories.” They use this as a socialexcuse and to avoid recalling failures. The memory by these processes repairs rapidly until aperson can recall things at will. His ability to recall things depends upon his ability to read thetime tabs on his facsimiles, so to speak. In other words, so long as he recalls accurately, he isin control of the facsimile. When he cannot recall accurately, he is not in control of thefacsimile.At the Foundation we repair psychotics, the despair of thousands of years of civilizedman, in a relatively short period of time. For two thousand years they have been givingpsychotics shocks, restraints and operations—there has been no change. Freud alone suggesteda change but he didn’t have the reason why nor the effectiveness and today, in majorinstitutions, these antique methods pass for “modern” treatment. Out of our present body of49"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"knowledge we are restoring the sanity and effectiveness of psychotics, a thing which has neverbefore been done with regularity or a guarantee of success. We even restore psychotics whohave been given “modern” treatments, shock and the rest of it. How is this done ?Handle it this way: an insane person cannot reason or control himself. That means hecannot handle his facsimiles. By a series of precise steps the auditor gives the psychotic backthe control of the Facsimiles. These steps are as follows:1. By mimicry (a form of communication), tactile (the most direct communication) and bygeneral ARC we get the psychotic into communication with one human being, theauditor. This is sometimes long and difficult and is the most arduous step. It can beassisted by giving the psychotic MEST —time and space and removing restraints.2. The auditor then works to get the psychotic into contact with present time. He callsattention to objects and the general environment until the psychotic sees that these arereal. When the auditor knows the psychotic knows the reality of beds and walls, heturns attention to the psychotic himself as a being. He establishes the fact with thepsychotic that the psychotic controls his own hands and feet and body.3. At this stage the auditor may introduce the psychotic into association with other peopleand a wider environment. This is again more present time. The auditor NEVER evalu-ates anything for the psychotic. The psychotic is insane because of too muchEVALUATION by others and will slump if somebody starts thinking for him again.4. The next step is to get the psychotic to evaluate something. This may be as mild aswhether or not hamburgers are good to eat. The psychotic decides on an evaluation.Then many evaluations in present time.5. Now the psychotic is asked to make minor decisions in present time plus action onthose decisions. This includes getting him to decide to accept something and to decideto throw something away, for the handling of MEST is not unlike the handling ofthoughts and to a psychotic thoughts are as solid as MEST.6. The next step is to get the psychotic to recall something no matter how general about hispast. He is asked to recall things until he strikes an incident he REALLY KNOWS ISREAL. It is real to him. It is a real memory. This is another up point in his tone as eachof these steps listed are. But it is the big point. He has recognized as real one of hisfacsimiles. He isn’t coaxed into admitting it is real. He recalls and knows that it reallyhappened. He is then made to recall many such incidents. HE IS NEVERINVALIDATED OR ARGUED WITH ABOUT WHAT HE THINKS IS REAL. THEAUDITOR SIMPLY IGNORES THE HALLUCINATIONS AND ACCEPTS A REALMEMORY AT LAST.7. The succeeding step is to get the psychotic to recall a past evaluation, a time when hemade up his mind about the character or quality of something. The specific moment ofevaluation is attained. Then the psychotic is made to recall a decision he has made in thepast. Many evaluations and decisions are thus recalled.8. The psychotic is now questioned about the times he has helped people. If possibleheavy failures are avoided. When he has recalled times when he has helped people andknows each incident recalled is real and actually happened, one goes to the next step.9. The auditor now tries to locate the decision, the exact instant, with all perceptionspossible, when the psychotic decided to go crazy. There may be many such decisions.These are recalled many times each.50"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"10. The psychotic is now questioned on the subject of departed or failed relatives or friendsuntil one is discovered who went mad. This is the location of a goal continuation foranother.11. Now the psychotic is worked on the subject of sympathy, what he has had to do to getsympathy, what sympathy he has given others. Probably a grief charge will come intoview and can be run.The individual about step eight is no longer classifiable as very psychotic, by step tenhe is at worst neurotic. And he can be processed by counter-emotion, regret and othertechniques.This is outlined to give you some sort of an idea of what psychosis is and how sanity isrestored. It is the condition of being unable to handle one’s facsimiles. Sanity is restored byrestoring an individual’s ability, little by little, to handle his facsimiles.But by what mechanism does an individual become unable to handle his memories?There are several answers but the main one is COUNTER-EMOTION.Counter-Emotion is felt as the “atmosphere” around a person or place. Ask anyone torecall the “feel” of the “atmosphere” of an area or a person and he can reexperience it at least inpart.Emotion according to present theory, can be laid down by anyone against anyone. Theemotions of A can be infiltrated into the facsimiles of G. The thoughts of A, similarly, can beinfiltrated into the thoughts of B but so far as we are concerned at this writing, the mechanismsof thought and counter-thought are not well known. Emotion and counter emotion are easilyestablished.How does one human being control another? High on the tone scale it is by letting theindividual control himself as thoroughly as possible. Below 2.0, in the mis-emotion band, ahuman being seeks to control or destroy another by COUNTER-EMOTION andCOUNTER-THOUGHT.The atmosphere surrounding a mis-emotion person is easily sensed. When oneadvances a facsimile to a mis-emotion person, mis-emotion is immediately thrown into thatfacsimile. Effort is transferred by physical contact. Emotion is simply transferred by anger,fear, argument, sympathy, etc. from a mis-emotion person into a facsimile of another. Youmay have noticed how you become less sure of yourself or uneasy around people who areembarrassed or uneasy or afraid. This is a simple mechanism. You are getting your facsimiles“colored” by a foreign emotion.Every facsimile you advance, with argument or persuasion, toward a mis-emotionalperson gets counter-emotion thrown into it. THAT COUNTER-EMOTION TAKES YOURFACSIMILE OUT OF YOUR OWN CONTROL AND PUTS IT INTO THE CONTROL OFTHE MIS-EMOTIONAL PERSON.Nothing is easier to prove. You have noticed probably, in lock scanning, that certainpersons were “occluded” or that the whole track was occluded. That occluded person was mis-emotional. The facsimiles you displayed around that person have their emotion on them, notyours. Your thought, then, has ceased to control such facsimiles. They do not come to viewwhen called for by you. They are “occluded.” The facsimiles aren’t owned by you any longerbut by the misemotional person.One by one your facsimiles can be taken out of your control by mis-emotional persons.The end result is no further ownership of your facsimiles or you. The end result is control bythe environment, not self control, mis-emotion instead of self-confidence. Doubt and fear ofacting. In short, reactions such as those which appear along the lower band of the big chart.51"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Slowed reaction time and illnesses and chronic pains result from these facsimiles which are nolonger under your control. Mis-emotion has swamped them, occluded them and so they canhurt you.There is another, even simpler subject in COUNTER THOUGHT. You think onething, somebody else thinks another. Their thought is counter to your thought. Live awhilearound somebody low on the scale and your thoughts get swamped by counter-thought. This isrehabilitated simply by running the ideas of another and the moment they expressed them.Counter-emotion and counter-thought can become sufficiently serious so as to give youthe illusion of having the facsimiles of another. This is a last extreme. This is hallucination.Take a person who is normally occluded in your memory. Think back to a time whenthis person told you a story or an incident. You may have no view of that person telling thestory but instead, a view of the activity in the story. This is a dub-in occasioned by theirmis-emotion. The end product of this is to have the time track of some mis-emotional personwith fake perceptions upon it. This is hallucination complete.A mis-emotional person can become occluded not only in recall but also in present time.Such a person blurs out. When they come into the room, one has the illusion of the light failingslightly.We all have the ambition to see a bright world. The thing which makes it unbright, inthe main, is the mis-emotion we carry on our facsimile from the atmospheres of mis-emotion inwhich we have dwelt.Here is an exercise:GO TO A PLACE ON THE TRACK WHERE THERE IS AN OCCLUSION. NOW TRY TOFEEL THE MISEMOTION WHICH MIGHT BE IN THE ATMOSPHERE. EXPERIENCETHIS COUNTER-EMOTION BY RUNNING THROUGH THE INCIDENT SWIFTLYMANY TIMES.A pain might have turned on. If so, continue to run this counter-emotion until the painis gone. You probably are not running the full length of the incident.New data appeared to you from that occluded area. Your own thoughts and feelings inthe area began to brighten. You knew what you were thinking about and saying after you hadrun it a few times. This exercise is the one necessary to restore recall perception on occludedpeople and areas.Another exercise:GO TO A PLACE IN RECALL WHERE A NORMALLY OCCLUDED PERSON ISTELLING YOU A STORY OR AN INCIDENT. FIND AN AREA WHERE YOU AREGETTING THE PICTURE OF THE STORY, NOT THE PICTURE OF THE PERSONTELLING IT. RUN THE COUNTER-EMOTION OF THE PICTURE SEVERAL TIMESUNTIL YOU GET A VIEW OF THE PERSON TELLING YOU THE INCIDENT.This is how people get occluded. A mis-emotional person specializes in telling peoplewhat to think and what the people think.

This is the EMOTIONALCURVE.On the tone scale you will find a difference of height between various emotions andmis-emotions. The EMOTIONAL CURVE is the drop or rise from one level of emotion toanother.Can you find a time when you were happy and suddenly became sad ?This is easy. Experience or get a concept of how you would feel if you were happy andthen how you would feel if you became sad. Then experience the change from happiness tosadness. Now find a situation where you were happy and became sad. RUN THIS CURVE.Who was present ? Run the drop in tone as your own emotion. Then run the drop intone as counter-emotion, the atmosphere change.Run the emotional curve from happiness to sadness several times until you have fullrecovery on your own ideas and counter-thought. What did you think? What did the other say .There are two emotional curves. One is the emotional curve you experience directly inyourself. The other is the counter emotional curve where you feel a change in tone in theatmosphere.This is an auditor tool and is used to locate the SERVICE FACSIMILE of the pre-clear.54"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE TENTH ACTFor the auditor, if you are being audited part time or full time, the tenth act is therunning out by THOUGHT, EFFORT and EMOTION of the SERVICE FACSIMILE. He willdiscover it from the data you have already written in this book, by looking you over formal-function and by running EMOTIONAL CURVES until you run into the front end of theincident.An individual with a very thorough knowledge from additional texts on this sciencemight be able to run the service facsimile itself. But several things militate against it, the first ofthem being that the pre-clear will try to run it out of valence, (as somebody else), the second,that he considers it valuable and so doesn’t want to lose it, the third being that it takes apre-clear so very much longer to run his own service facsimile than it takes an auditor.55"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"THE ELEVENTH ACTThis entire act is addressed to the subject of SYMPATHY.Probably you could kill a man with sympathy. It has been done. There are three levelsof healing: the first is to do something efficient about the condition, the next, if the first can’t bedone, is to make the patient comfortable, the third, if he can’t be made comfortable, is to givehim sympathy. That is in accordance with old medical practice. However, sympathy is aterrible thing but is considered to be a very valuable thing.The survival value of sympathy is this: When an individual is hurt or immobilized, hecannot fend for himself, get himself good, defend himself. If he is to survive he must countupon another or others to care for him. His bid for such care is the enlistment of the sympathyof others. This is practical. The cheerful good-fellowship of the weak, crippled or ill is part ofthis mechanism. If men weren’t sympathetic, none of us would be alive.The non-survival value of sympathy is this: An individual fails in some activity or effortto help. He then considers himself incapable of surviving by himself. Even though he isn’t sickactually he makes a bid for sympathy. When a person, not actually ill or immobilized by injury,is making a bid for sympathy, he considers that he has failed so badly that he cannot by himselfcontinue on in life. His self-confidence is undermined. He is not able to handle himself well.Counter emotion and counter-thought have garbled his facsimiles He feels he has to havesympathy to get along. And he displays an illness or disability to gain sympathy. This ismechanical and is not to be disparaged: the person is actually in need of help. And almost everyhuman being is prone to this error. Almost every one will make a bid for sympathy by holdingout some old facsimile. A psychosomatic illness is at once an explanation of failure and a bidfor sympathy. That does not make the sympathy, when received, less sweet. And it does notmake the ill any less painful.One is peculiarly liable to sympathy bids around his parents and family. The worst casean auditor can encounter is one which wants auditing only for the auditor’s sympathy andwants to retain the SERVICE FACSIMILE because it is a sympathy source. The answer to thisis to get the pre-clear far enough up the tone scale so that he is sufficiently self-confident not toneed any sympathy. Only then, in some cases, will the SERVICE FACSIMILE (the technicalterm for the facsimile the pre-clear uses to gain sympathy) surrender to auditing.The purpose of this act is to pick up sympathy facsimiles.In other works on this science you will find in detail the role of self-determinism. Weare all self-determined, natively. NOTHING which we do is beyond self-determined action.When you made a decision, it is MADE.A later part of this processing deals thoroughly with this.Nobody ever became ill without wanting to be ill at some earlier moment in his life.Here is a polio case, in bed two years. She became ill because she felt sorry for another littlegirl who got polio and so decided to get it herself. It was a clear-cut decision, followed by twoyears in bed.If you doubt that you ever wished to be ill, what about school? Didn’t you ever beg offby a plaint of being sick?

Blame of self and blame of othersproduce interesting results in recalls. Facsimiles can become clouded with blame and regret.This is the subject of CAUSE and EFFECT.An individual natively desires to be cause. He tries not to become a bad effect.You try to help people and people try to help you because you and they want to beCAUSE. When something bad happens, neither one wishes to be cause.You want to be an effect. Then you find the effect bad. You try not to be an effect. Andthen you blame something or somebody.Blaming yourself or others for being a cause is to deny yourself full control of yourfacsimiles. You say somebody caused something. You make them RESPONSIBLE. They arethen CAUSE. This is a powerful position. It ends up with your having given them control overa facsimile or many facsimiles. If you blame somebody hard enough and long enough you havekept on electing them as CAUSE until they are much more powerful than yourself.If you blame your mother, for instance, you make your mother CAUSE and must thenobey her. And your facsimiles relating to her or to your whole life are out of your control. Ifyou blame yourself, this is an admitted failure and again you have facsimiles out of control.You blame somebody, you elect them as cause. This makes you an effect of the cause.As an effect you are thus placed well down the tone scale.You desire to be an effect in some quarter and thereafter you may continue to be aneffect and will go down the scale to a point where you may develop psychosomatic ills.There are certain main spheres where one wishes to be an effect. Here we have theimportance of aberration on the second dynamic, SEXY You wish to have the pleasure of sex.This is yourself electing yourself an an effect. As an effect you can then be given pain on thesecond dynamic.You wish to be pleasantly an effect in eating. You elect yourself an effect. You canthereafter be effected by pain in the food department. The basis of ulcers or any stomachtrouble including constipation is the original desire to eat.You wish to be amused and entertained. Thus amusement channels, sight, sound,rhythm, can become aberrated by pain.It is natural law that one cannot be aberrated without one’s own consent. One mustwish to be an effect before he can become an effect. If he becomes an effect then he can laterbecome “effected” unpleasantly by counter-efforts.If you want to be an effect of your marital or sexual partner, or any sexual act, youopen the door to being an unpleasant effect.Examine the column of the big chart between CAUSE and EFFECT. This is a gradientscale of causes and effects.Freud was right in selecting sex as being very aberrative. Before him thousands ofyears of mystics knew they had to abstain from material or physical pleasures and sex in orderto remain high and saintly. They did not know the mechanism at work. We now do. The63"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"moment they wanted to be an effect, they could become, in that channel, an unpleasant as wellas a pleasant effect and so go down the tone scale.There are several conditions relating to this. One is the desire not to be a cause. One isthe desire not to be an effect. One is the desire to prevent something or somebody else frombeing a cause. One is the desire to prevent somebody or something else from being an effect.In sex one may not desire to be the cause of children. This would be for either a man ora woman. Children, in this society, can be embarrassing or expensive. One desires at the sametime to cause a sexual partner pleasure. Here is desire not to be a cause fighting with the desireto be a cause. The result is conflict, aberration, impotence, sex punishment and irregularpractices.In sex, again, one desires greatly to be an effect for the sake of pleasure. One wishes toexperience the pleasure of sex. He does not want to experience the pain of childbirth forhimself or his partner nor does he wish the effect of disease. Nor does he wish to be the effectof public antagonism toward sexual practice. Thus his desire to be effect comes in conflict withhis desire not to be effect and the result is aberration, impotence, glandular interruption, maritalbreakdowns, divorces, suicide and sudden death.In food, cause and effect work similarly to sex. One wishes to be pleasantly effected bythe flavor of substance of food. He may not want to have the effect of the work he has to do toeat or the propitiation he has to give to eat. He wants to be cause. He is running acarbon-oxygen engine which has to have the effect of food. People low on the tone scale usethis sure route to making a person into an effect by denying food or forcing people to eat food.The society uses this effect to get work done.Low scale mothers are very strict with their children about food. This is a sure methodof control. By forcing the child to be a non-self-determined effect about food, the mother cancontrol the child in many other ways. All low scale control is done by forcing the individual tobe an effect where the individual naturally has to be an effect. Where a naturally desired effectcan be enforced by command, the enforcer can gain a wide control simply by continualdemonstration that the target individual is an effect, not a cause.The sexual sphere is peculiarly liable to cause and effect action became of thecommunication. Tactile is the most direct method of sensory communication. It is much moreeffective than talk. A close communication with a low scale person brings down as well theaffinity and the reality levels. If a sexual partner is demanding or insatiable, that partner electsthe other into being an unwilling came and denies his right to the effect and then makes ruin ofa personality. An individual aberrated enough about sex will do strange things to be a cause oran effect. He will substitute punishment for sex. He will pervert others.Homosexuality comes from this manifestation and from the manifestation of lifecontinuation for others. A boy whose mother is dominant will try to continue her life from anyfailure she has. A girl whose father is dominant will try to continue his life from any failure hehas. The mother or the father were cause in the child’s eyes. The child elected himselfsuccessor to cause. Break this life continuum concept by running sympathy and grief for thedominant parent and then run off the desires to be an effect and their failures and thehomosexual is rehabilitated. Homosexuality is about 1.1 on the tone scale. So is generalpromiscuity.The facsimiles of an individual can become considerably scrambled by masturbation.Practically all the ape family and Man masturbate. Masturbation is a prohibition result. Itcouldn’t drive anyone crazy. But it can make the individual pull old sex facsimiles into presenttime for self-stimulation and opens the door for him to desire facsimiles to be in present time.After awhile he will be pulling pain facsimiles into present time.These are the exercises of CAUSE and EFFECT processing:64"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"SCAN THROUGH EVERY TIME YOU DESIRED NOT TO BE A CAUSE SEXUALLY.SCAN THROUGH EVERY TIME YOU REGRETTED BEING A SEXUAL CAUSE.SCAN THROUGH EVERY TIME YOU DESIRED NOT TO BE AN EFFECT SEXUALLY.SCAN THROUGH EVERY TIME YOU REGRETTED BEING AN EFFECT SEXUALLY.SCAN THROUGH EVERY TIME YOU DESIRED TO BE A SEXUAL CAUSE.SCAN THROUGH EVERY TIME YOU DESIRED TO BE A SEXUAL EFFECT.Don’t forget that scanning is done until you are extroverted on the subject.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU CALLED UP AN OLD SEXUAL EXPERIENCE FOR YOURAMUSEMENT.SCAN EVERY TIME A SEXUAL PARTNER WAS DEMANDING.SCAN EVERY TIME A SEXUAL PARTNER REFUSED SEX.SCAN EVERY FAILURE CONCERNING SEX.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU OBEYED A SEXUAL PARTNER ABOUT ANYTHING.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU RESENTED SOMEBODY’S SEXUAL CONVERSATION.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU ENJOYED SOMEBODY’S SEXUAL CONVERSATION.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU TRIED TO HIDE SOMETHING ABOUT SEX.Now let us repeat these operations on the subject of food:SCAN EVERY TIME YOU DESIRED FOOD.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WERE FORCED TO EAT.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WORRIED ABOUT FOOD.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU BLAMED FOOD FOR AN ILLNESS.SCAN EVERY FEELING OF QUEASINESS ABOUT FOOD UNTIL ANY PHYSICALSENSATION IS GONE.Now let us go into entertainment.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU TRIED TO ENTERTAIN SOMEBODY AND FAILED.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WANTED TO BE ENTERTAINED AND WEREN’T.SCAN EVERY TIME SOMEBODY WANTED TO BE ENTERTAINED AND YOU DIDN’TWANT TO.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WERE BORED WITH ENTERTAINMENT.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WANTED TO RETAIN THE SENSATION OF HAVING BEENENTERTAINED.65"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Now let us go into perceptions in general.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU DID NOT WANT TO BE TOUCHED.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WERE FORCED TO TOUCH SOMETHING.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WANTED TO TOUCH SOMETHING AND COULDN’T.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU TOUCHED A SEXUAL PARTNER.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU DIDN’T WANT TO LOOK.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WANTED TO BE PLEASED BY LOOKING.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WISHED THINGS LOOKED AS GOOD AS THEY USED TO.SCAN EVERY REGRET YOU’VE EVER HAD ABOUT SIGHT.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU DECIDED YOU COULDN’T SEE WELL.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WERE TOLD YOU COULDN’T SEE.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU AGREED YOU COULDN’T SEE.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU DIDN’T WANT TO LISTEN.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WANTED TO HEAR AND COULDN’T.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WANTED TO HEAR SOMETHING PLEASANT.SCAN EVERY TIME YOUR EARS RANG.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU DECIDED SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH YOURHEARING.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU TASTED SOMETHING BAD.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU TASTED SOMETHING GOOD.SCAN EVERY TIME YOUR MOTHER PUSHED YOU AWAY.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU WANTED A GOOD EFFECT IN YOUR STOMACH ANDFAILED.SCAN EVERY TIME YOU LOOKED WITH FAVOR ON A BOTTLE.

The state of being willing to be processed (technical sense in this science).The state of being willing to have interpersonal relations (social sense). For the individualhimself, accessibility with self means whether or not an individual can recontact his pastexperiences or data. A man with a “bad memory” (interposed blocks between control center andfacsimiles) has memories which are not accessible to him.ACT. A stage of processing. Applies solely to the particular process in use at a certain caselevel.ASSESSMENT. An inventory, an examination, a calculation or evaluation of a case.ASSISTS. The straight perception by perception running over and over of an incident until it isdesensitized as a facsimile and cannot affect the pre-clear. The assist is used immediately afteraccidents or operations. It takes away shock and most of the harmful effects of the incident andpromotes healing. It is done by starting the individual at the beginning of the incident, with thefirst awareness of the incident, just as though the pre-clear were living it all the way throughagain with full perception of sight, sound, etc., as nearly as they can be obtained. An assistrun, for instance, immediately after a dental operation takes all the shock out of the operation.One concludes an assist by picking up the auditing as another incident and running through theauditing and the decision to be audited. An assist saves lives and materially speeds healing.AUDITOR. One who listens and computes. A technician of this science.BROKEN. Slang used in the wise of “breaking a case,” meaning that one breaks the hold ofthe pre-clear on a nonsurvival facsimile. Used in greater or lesser magnitude such as “breakinga circuit” or “breaking into a chain” or “breaking a computation.” Never breaking the pre-clearor his spirit, but breaking what is breaking the pre-clear.CENTER OF CONTROL. The awareness of awareness unit of the mind. This is not part of thebrain but part of the mind, the brain being physiological. The mind has two control centerspossible, by definition, the right and the left. One is an actual, genetic control center, the otheris a subcontrol-center subservient to the control center.CLEAR (verb). The act of desensitizing or releasing a thought impression or a series ofimpressions or observations in the past, or a postulate, an emotion, an effort or an entirefacsimile. The pre-clear either releases his hold on the facsimile (memory) or the facsimile itselfis desensitized. The word is taken from electronic computers or common office addingmachines and describes an action similar to clearing past computations from the machine.CLEAR (noun). A much misunderstood state of being. The word has been used before withother meanings. It has been mistaken as an absolute. It is still used. It is used here aselectronics slang and can apply to a chain, an incident or a computation.COMPUTING PSYCHOTIC. One who is running on a circuit, a circuit being apseudo-personality out of a facsimile strong enough to dictate to the individual and BE theindividual.DRAMATIZING PSYCHOTIC. One who dramatizes one type of facsimile only.DYNAMICS. The central drives of an individual. They are numbered from one to eight asfollows: 1. Self survival; 2. Survival through children (includes sexual act); 3. Survival bygroups including social and political as well as commercial; 4. Survival through Mankind as awhole; 5. Survival through Life including any species, vegetable or animal; (I. Survival73"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"through MEST; 7. Survival through theta or the static of itself; 8. (Written as infinity). Survivalthrough a Supreme Being. Each individual is surviving for all eight.EFFORT. The physical force manifestation of motion. A sharp effort against an individualproduces pain. A strenuous effort produces discomfort. Effort can be recalled and re-experienced by the pre-clear. No pre-clear below 2.5 should be called upon to use effort assuch as he is incapable of handling it and will stick in it. The essential part of a painful facsimileis its effort, not its perceptions.EMOTION. The catalyst used by the control center to monitor physical action. The relaysystem, via glands, interposed between “I” and self and, by thought, others. The mainemotions are happiness in which one has confidence and enjoyment in his goals and a belief inhis control of environment; boredom, in which one has lost confidence and direction but is notdefeated; antagonism wherein one feels his control threatened; anger wherein one seeks todestroy that which threatens and seeks without good direction beyond destruction; coverthostility wherein one seeks to destroy while reassuring his target that he is not so seeking; fearwherein one is catalyzed to flee; grief in which one recognizes loss; apathy in which oneaccepts failure on all dynamics and pretends death. Other emotions are a volume or lack ofvolume of those named. Shame or embarrassment are emotions peculiar to groups orinterpersonal relations and are on a level with grief, denoting loss of position in a group.Emotion is the glandular system parallel of motion and each emotion reflects action to gain orlose to motion. At a high level one is sending back motion, at a mid level one is holdingmotion, at a lower level, motion is sweeping through and over one.ENVIRONMENT. The surroundings of the pre-clear from moment to moment in particular orin general, including people, pets, mechanical objects, weather, culture, clothing or theSupreme Being. Anything he perceives or believes he perceives. The objective environment isthe environment everyone agrees is there. The subjective environment is the environment theindividual himself believes is there. They may not agree.FACSIMILES. A facsimile is a memory recording for a finite period of time. It is consideredthat memory is a static without wave length, weight, mass or position in space (in other words,a true static) which yet receives the impression of time, space, energy and matter. A carefulexamination of the phenomena of thought and the behavior of the human mind lead one to thisconclusion. The conclusion is itself a postulate used because it is extremely useful andworkable. This is a point of echelon in research, that a facsimile can be so described. Thedescription is mathematical and an abstract and may or may not be actual. When a thoughtrecording is so regarded, the problems of the mind rapidly resolve. Facsimiles are said to be“stored.” They act upon the physical universe switchboard called the brain and nervous andglandular system to monitor action. They appear to have motion and weight only becausemotion and weight are recorded into them. They are not stored in the cells. They impinge uponthe cells. Proof of this matter rests in the fact that an energy which became a facsimile a longtime ago can be re-contacted and is found to be violent on the contact. Pain is stored as afacsimile. Old pain can be re-contacted. Old pain, in facsimile form, old emotion in facsimileform, can reimpose itself on present time in such a wise as to deform or other vise physicallyaffect the body. You can go back to the last time you hurt yourself and find there andre-experience the pain of that hurt, unless you are very occluded. You can recover efforts andexertions you have made or which have been made against you in the past. Yet the cellsthemselves, which have finite life, are long since replaced although the body goes on. Hencethe facsimile theory. The word facsimile is used as bluntly as one uses it in connection with adrawing of a box top instead of the actual box top. It means a similar article rather than thearticle itself. You can recall a memory picture of an elephant or a photograph. The elephant andthe photograph are no longer present. A facsimile of them is stored in your mind. A facsimile iscomplete with every perception of the environment present when that facsimile was madeincluding sight, sound, smell, taste, weight, joint position and so on through half a hundredperceptions. Just because you cannot recall motion or these perceptions does not mean theywere not recorded fully and in motion with every perception channel you had at the time. It74"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"does mean that you have interposed a stop between the facsimile and the recall mechanisms ofyour control centers. There are facsimiles of everything you have experienced in your entirelifetime and everything you have imagined.FIFTEEN (noun). A designation to denote a finished case. Solely for case recording todesignate a case advanced to current completion. This is a Foundation number system forpre-clears. A case is noted on record by the act number to which it has been advanced.GENETIC. By line of protoplasm and by facsimiles and by MEST forms the individual hasarrived in the present age from a past beginning. Genetic applies to the protoplasm line of fatherand mother to child, grown child to new child and so forth.LOCK SCANNING. A process which starts the pre-clear from a point in the past with whichhe has made solid contact up through all similar incidents without verbalization. This is doneover and over, each time trying to start at an earlier incident of the same kind, until the pre-clearextroverts on the subject of the chain. BOIL-OFF often results wherein the pre-clear seems togo to sleep. Avoid boil-off for it is not therapeutic and will eventually result in reduced tone.BOILOFF is a lazy auditor’s excuse to be idle and facsimiles in such severe conflict that theywill not resolve without resolving postulates first. Lock scanning is a standardized drill, startedon signal and ended with the pre-clear saying he is again in present time. It can be done on anysubject. ABOVE 2.0 only.MEST. A compound word made up of the first letters of MATTER, ENERGY, SPACE andTIME. A coined word for the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE. THETA IS NOT CONSIDERED ASPART OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE BUT IS NOT CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY ASNOT PART OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.PAST POSTULATES. Decisions or conclusions the preclear has made in the past and to whichhe is still subjected in the present. Past postulates are uniformly invalid since they cannotresolve present environment.PERCEPTIONS. By means of physical waves, rays and particles of the physical universe,impressions of the environment enter through the “sense channels” such as the eyes and opticnerves, the nose and olfactory nerves; the ears and aural nerves; inter-body nerves forinter-body perceptions, etc., etc. These are all perceptions up to the instant they record asfacsimiles at which moment they become recordings. When recalled they are perceptions again,being again entered into sense channels from the recall side. There are over half a hundredseparate perceptions all being recorded at once.POSTULATES (verb). To conclude, decide or resolve a problem or to set a pattern for thefuture or to nullify a pattern of the past.POSTULATE (noun). A conclusion, decision or resolution made by the individual himself onhis own self-determinism on data of the past, known or unknown. The postulate is alwaysknown. It is made upon the evaluation of data by the individual or on impulse without data. Itresolves a problem of the past, decides on problems or observations in the present or sets apattern for the future.PSYCHOSOMATIC ILLNESS. A term used in common parlance to denote a condition“resulting from a state of mind.” Such illnesses account for about seventy percent of all ills, bypopular report. Technically, in this science, a chronic or continuing painful facsimile to whichthe preclear is holding to account for failures. Arthritis, bursitis, tendonitis, myopia,astigmatism, bizarre aches and pains, sinusitis, colds, ulcers, migraine headaches, toothaches,poliomyelitis deformities, fatness, skin malformations are a few of these legion of chronicsomatics. They are traceable to service facsimiles.PSYCHOTIC. An individual who is out of contact to a thorough extent with his present timeenvironment and who does not compute into the future. He may be an acute psychotic wherein75"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"he becomes psychotic for only a few minutes at a time and only occasionally in certainenvironments (as in rages or apathies) or he may be a chronic psychotic, or in a continualdisconnection with the future and present.

Psychotics who are harmful on a lessdramatic basis are no less harmful to their environment and are no less psychotic.PRE-CLEAR. One who has entered processing enroute to becoming a fifteen.RECOVERY. Recovery of one’s own ability to determine one’s existence.RELEASE (verb). The act of taking the perceptions or effort or effectiveness out of a heavyfacsimile or taking away the pre-clear’s hold on the facsimile.REPETITIVE STRAIGHT-WIRE. Attention called to an incident over and over amongst otherincidents until it is de-sensitized. Used on conclusions or incidents which do not easilysurrender.SERVICE FACSIMILE. A definitely non-survival situation contained in a facsimile which iscalled into action by the individual to explain his failures. A service facsimile may be one of anillness, an injury, an inability. The facsimile begins with a down emotional curve and ends withan upward emotional curve. Between these it has pain. A service facsimile IS the pattern whichis the chronic “psychosomatic illness.” It may contain coughs, fever, aches, rashes, anymanifestation of a non-survival character, mental or physical. It may even be a suicide effort. Itis complete with all perceptions. It has many similar facsimiles. It has many locks. Thepossession and use of a service facsimile distinguishes a homo sapiens.SERVICE FACSIMILE CHAIN. The entire chain of similar incidents which comprise the totalrepertoire of the individual who is explaining thus failure and thus seeking support.STRAIGHT-WIRE. A process of recalling, from present time, with some perception or at leasta concept, a past incident. The name straight-wire derives from the MEST communicationsprocess of connecting two points of a communications system. It is essentially memory work.It is applied to postulates, evaluations, incidents, scenes, emotions, or any data which may bein the storage banks of the mind without “sending the pre-clear” into the incident itself. It isdone with the pre-clear sitting up, eyes open or shut. The auditor is very alert. Straight-wire isdone rapidly. The pre-clear is not permitted to wander or reminisce. He responds to questionson the part of the auditor. MANY PRE-CLEARS DISLIKE BEING QUESTIONED. THEAUDITOR MUST THEN FIRST RESOLVE THE POSTULATES AGAINST BEINGQUESTIONED; this would be called “clearing for broad straight-wire.”TEN. A case advanced to the point of released service facsimile.THETA. The mathematical symbol for the static of thought. By THETA is meant the staticitself. By “facsimile” is meant THETA which contains impressions by perception.THOUGHT. The facsimiles one has recorded of his various environments and the facsimileshe has created with his imaginings, their recombination and evaluations and conclusions for thepurpose of determining action or no action or potential action or no action. THOUGHT is usedalso to mean a progress treating awareness level recordings as distinct from non-awarenesslevel recordings.NOTETerms and definitions in this glossary are retained unchanged from the original.76"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Some of the terms and wages are not final.
