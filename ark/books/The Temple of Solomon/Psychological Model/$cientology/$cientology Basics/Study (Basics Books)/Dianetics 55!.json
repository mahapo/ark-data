Ah, the endless quest, thefar, far search, the codes, the vias, the symbols, the complications, thecompilations, the mathematicity and abstractacity of secrets, secrets,secrets.And truth. TRUTH! From Keats to Johnny Jones, we all have trafficwith the truth, truth, TRUTH! The professors have a truth, thereligionists have a truth, the stars and almost anything but governmenthave a truth, truth, TRUTH.Knowledge! Endeared as a precious torch, abhorred as aneurotic’s nightmare, it is all knowledge, knowledge, Knowledge! Youget diplomas for it and buy books full of it, you perish for the lack of it ortriumph in the absence of it, but whatever it might be, knowledge isprecious, dangerous, valueless and horrible and craved.And what is knowledge? And what is the SECRET? and what isTRUTH?Pontius Pilate asked the question when he washed his hands.Alexander executed messengers when the Truth was unpalatable. TheChaldean priest corralled a bit of truth and ruled Chaldea intoyesterday and Babylon into dust motes. And rulers and men, scholarsand generals have condemned with it, dedicated their lives to it, foughtfor it and denied it and – have never defined it.What is TRUTH? What is KNOWLEDGE? What is the SECRET? Arethey s from a shaman’s dream? Are they connected with science? Dothey belong to philosophy? What are they, whence do they come? Dothey exist? Are they owned? Have they ever been written or spoken orguessed? And would one go mad if he knew them?Dianetics moved into the world on May 9, 1950, with thepublication of a book, DIANETICS: THE MODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL . Itmoved with violence although its message was peace. A half a millionAmericans read it, many, many of these acted upon it and are stillacting upon it, and every year it sells still more copies – more copiesthan the average „best seller.“Dianetics was an adventure into the dark realms of the secret toaccumulate knowledge and to establish the truth. Until Dianetics thesecommodities have been owned by philosophy of either the esoteric or"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!3L. RON HUBARDthe monotony schools or had been used by the charlatan – with orwithout surplice – to lure and ensnare.Dianetics moved into a Dark Age of Reason where only a physicaluniverse fact was given credence. When Dianetics was born every freethinker Man had known had long since been burned or poisoned ordust-binned into the curriculums of „universities.“ It was an age whererenown awaited only the manufacturer – not the inventor – of the newcan opener, where sanity was adjusted with electrodes and philosophywas made with Univacs. Knowledge and the SECRET being the totalassets of vested interest, Dianetics was hit with violence from manyquarters. Medicine, entirely cognizant that it could not cure nor evenalleviate the majority of Man’s ills, yet like a prima donna who can butcroak yet resists the incoming next act, bluntly and viciously condemnedin leading weekly magazines, any further glance towards knowledgeand truth. The government, fighting a war at the time, entirelycognizant that its pilot supply was old and slow, yet could notcommunicate on any subject which might remedy the matter. The BetterBusiness Bureaus of the U.S., an organization solidly behind anythinggood and solid, upheld the objection of capital to this new idea; theCommunist Party, being solidly against any alteration of the mind sincethat would undoubtedly alter devotion, went to considerable lengths toassist the stand of capital. To anyone who wanted a monopoly onknowledge and truth Dianetics was an enemy. To them it was adegraded, wicked, fraudulent hoax – or so they said. However, therehappens to be a principle that anything which is thoroughly understoodceases. Their opinion of Dianetics could not have been correct becauseDianetics is still here.During the ensuing four years of commotion, much happened. Theonly orderly and progressive thing which happened was that Dianeticswent on encroaching into the territory of the SECRET along theroadway of KNOWLEDGE to discover nearer TRUTH.The primary assault of Dianetics was upon reverence and forms.The first book was written as a javelin directed into the doubtlesslysacrosanct vitals of philosophical departments and literature. It wascarefully careless with its commas in the belief that commas, contrary tothe prevailing mode, have little power to disturb an ultimate truth. Thefirst book was written to be read and understood, and it was written toupset and override and warn off those who would give it the fate of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!4L. RON HUBARDbeing reverable. And the first book was written to be used by anyonewho could understand it – and the way it was written, this of coursecould not include the extant mental charlatan nor the professionaldabbler in abilities. As one had learned these could not be trained andif they could have been, wouldn’t have been interested in the proposedgoals, it was necessary that a new breed of feline come into being –the auditor – and the auditor did.Now this adventure along the road of knowledge towards truthwas very shiny new in 1950. It was not quite so new but much shinierin 1954. Certain promises were made in 1950 on page 401. And thesepromises have now been kept.Man can be cleared. He can be cleared – brought to the conditiondescribed in Chapter Two of the first book – by a well-studied andcompetent auditor in a relatively short length of time.This book contains processes which were the forerunners of theclearing processes in use today. This means that auditors do have tobe trained – we have found definitely that they do. It also means thatan auditor who has been trained and processed can now take thesenewer processes and run them as directed and can achieve the resultof Clear.Thus, in DIANETICS 55! we have, actually, the SECOND BOOK ofDianetics. Everyone has assigned the title First Book to DIANETICS: THEMODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH. But nobody , published in 1951,as the Second Book. They haven’t because it obviously wasn’t.SCIENCE OF SURVIVAL was a first book in its own right.It was the first book of and under Plan C on page 401 of the realFirst Book. SCIENCE OF SURVIVAL adventured into causation, not intothe resolution of problems outlined in the First Book.Thus there has never been a Second Book of Dianetics. Such abook would have to take the exact problems of the First Book and inthe terms and reference of the First Book resolve these problems.Well, as one looks over fiction novels and technical volumes ingeneral he finds that a four year – almost five – lag between anauthor’s first and second volume would discover his public to havewaned. But when we take up a subject of the status of Dianetics andwhen we realize that it is condensing into a few years some thousands"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!5L. RON HUBARDof years of doing, we see that a lag of four or five years betweenvolumes isn’t so very bad.What happened in those four or five years? Many things.Somehow, for one thing, research and development was financed andthe basic organization, after many limpings, survived. A lot of pettythings happened which in another decade will be bone dust – for noneof these things, none of the tales of terror, the attacks, the financing,the business advances, were permitted to interrupt the only thing thatCAN mean any difference – the product of years of steady gain on theroad of knowledge towards the goal of ultimate truth.Knowledge, Truth, Secrets – they are the guts and anatomy oflife. They must not then be owned. They must not then be hidden orbent. They must be permitted to stand out in the bold sunlight for all tosee for only when they are to be seen are they safe things to have, tohold, to know.This is the Second Book of Dianetics. It could mean a new Earth, itcould mean a new freedom. But whatever it means it cannot meannothing in the sense Man uses that word – for you cannot unveil theSECRET and have it ever be quite so secret ever again.Note: Much of what in this book was termed Dianetics is, intoday’s technical lineup, Scientology technology. The two fields are asfollows:DIANETICS: From the Greek dia (through) and noos (soul), thus„through the soul“; a system for the analysis, control and developmentof human thought which also provides techniques for increased ability,rationality, and freedom from the discovered single source ofaberrations and psychosomatic ills. Introduced May, 1950, withpublication of Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health by L. RonHubbard.SCIENTOLOGY: is an applied religious philosophy and technologyresolving problems of the spirit, Life and thought; discovered,developed and organized by L. Ron Hubbard as a result of his earlierDianetic discoveries. Coming from the Latin, scio (knowing) and theGreek logos (study), Scientology means „knowing how to know“ or „thestudy of wisdom.“"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!6L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER IDIANETICSWhy should anyone want to know anything about the humanmind? And, for that matter, why should anyone believe that knowledgeof the human mind is either unobtainable or undesirable? Why shouldmen ostensibly seeking answers to the mind stray so far from it as toexamine rats and entirely avoid looking at human beings? And whyshould anyone pretending to treat the mind stray so far afield aselectric shock?The answers are relatively simple. Anyone who knows thestructure, function, and dynamics of the human mind is very difficult tocontrol. The only way a mind can be controlled is by enforcing upon itignorance of itself. As far as study and treatment is concerned, a mindwhich has been made ignorant of itself would have to have restored toit awareness of its fundamentals before it could be considered to berecovered. And when one restores full awareness to a mind one is nolonger able to victimize it. And a profession or a society would have tomove out of slave orientation into action by freedom and consent, wereit to be effective.Just as you do not want people to control you, so you shouldwant knowledge of yourself and others. Just as you fight away fromknowingness concerning self, so you will be controlled.A simple and conclusive science of mind is a vital necessity in anysociety which desires to become free and remain free. The onlyelements in a society which would combat, or contest, or dispute aneffort to attain such a science would be those interests which desired,by ignorance, to maintain their control of a slavery. Each and everyimpulse of freedom is an impulse towards sanity, towards health,towards happiness. Every impulse towards slavery is an impulse in thedirection of misery, disease and death. One can say alike of the arthriticand the neurotic that the basic cause of disturbance, physical ormental, germinated in efforts to reduce the freedom of the individual,the group, or Mankind."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!7L. RON HUBARDDianetics is an effort towards the attainment by Man of a level offreedom where decency and happiness can prevail, and whereknowledge of the mind itself would prevent the unscrupulous use of themechanisms of slavery. Dianetics can be contested, it can be vilified, itsfounder and practitioners can be publicly pilloried, but Dianetics cannotbe ignored. It could neither be drowned in praise, nor burned in somepurge to its total eradication, for it is a wonderfully observable fact thatthe one impulse in Man which cannot be erased is his impulse towardsfreedom, his impulse towards sanity, towards higher levels ofattainment in all of his endeavors. This is Man’s one saving grace, andbecause Dianetics is such an impulse, and because its basic purpose,from the moment of its conception, have been dedicated unswervablyto the attainment of even greater freedom it cannot perish – a factwhich will become doubtlessly more annoying to the slave-masters asthe years roll on.There is much argument upon which we could adventureconcerning whether Dianetics is an art or a science, whether it is ahumanity or a hoax, but all this would avail us very little for we wouldonly be quibbling with words. Dianetics is what it is, and the totality ofit can best be summed by the description, ‘an understanding of Man.’We do not care whether or not it is a science. We do not care whetheror not it is more properly catalogued under Adventure or Mystery. Wedo care whether or not it is promulgated and known, for everywhere itwalks slavery ceases. That mind which understands itself is the mind ofa free man. It is no longer prone to obsessive behavior, unthinkingcompliances, covert innuendoes. It is at home in an environment, not astranger. It is the solver of problems and the maker of games. A mindthat is enslaved is weak. A mind that is free is powerful, and all thepower there is, is defined by and contained in freedom.Why should you know something about your mind? A question ofa similar magnitude would be: „Why should you live?“ A science fictionwriter once conceived a world composed entirely of machines,composed to a point where the machines were repaired by othermachines, which, in turn, were repaired by yet other machines, and sothe circle went ‘round and the machines survived. He wrote this storyfrom the fondest belief of nuclear physicists that there is only amachine, that man derives from some spontaneous combustion of mud,that the soul does not exist, that freedom is impossible, that allbehavior is stimulus-response, that causative thought cannot exist."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!8L. RON HUBARDWhat a world this would be! And yet this world, this pattern, is the goalof the slave makers. If every man could be depressed from his freedomto a point where he believed himself but a cog in an enormousmachine, then all things would be enslaved. But who would there be toenjoy them? Who would there be to profit? Not the slave-maker, for heis the first to succumb. He succumbs to his own mechanisms. Hereceives the full jolt of his own endeavors to entrap. What would bethe purpose of this world of machines? There could be no purposeworth contemplating which does not include happiness and experience.When a man is no longer able to envision happiness as a part of hisfuture, that man is dead. He has become nothing but an animatedrobot, without understanding, without humanity, perfectly willing thento compose missiles of such desolating quality that an entire civilizationcan perish, and that the happiness of all can be destroyed in theexperience of radiation – an experience which might be considereddigestible by an atomic pile, but not by a human being. Thus as wedepart from the concepts of freedom, we depart into a darkness wherethe will, the fear, or the brutality, of one or a few, no matter how welleducated, may yet obliterate everything for which we have worked,everything for which we have hoped. This is what happens when themachine runs wild, and when Man, becomes a machine, runs wild. Mancan only become a machine when he is no longer capable ofunderstanding his own beingness and has lost his contact with it. Thusit is of enormous importance that we understand something about themind, that we understand we are minds, that we are not machines,and it is of enormous importance that Man attain at once to somehigher level of freedom where the machine reaction of destruction maybe controlled, and where Man himself can enjoy some of the happinessto which he is entitled.“Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health“ was written intoa world where atomic fission was yet in its early stages. But „Dianetics55!“ is being written in a world where bombs exist of such fury that acontinent could be laid waste. The recent declaration of the Secretaryof War of the United States of America that such weapons exist, andare capable of being used, and his assumption that men exist with suchinsufficiency of humanity that they would use such weapons, tells usthat it is time someone, somewhere, took a hand in this game. Theintimacy of his promises cannot be escaped. You would think anyone amadman who essayed to destroy every book in every library in the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!9L. RON HUBARDUnited States and Russia. You would think a man quite insane if heinsisted upon the destruction of all your personal possessions. Youwould know he was mad when he insisted that the only course for thefuture was the destruction of your body and any future race toremember it. Only a raving, drooling madman could contemplate theending of all goals everywhere on earth. And only an apathetic foolwould stand by motionless before the inevitable destruction of his mostintimate dreams, his fondest hopes, his possessions – even on down tohis identification cards and the money in his wallet. Such destructionpermits no inheritance. It means an end of everything for which wehave all hoped, for which we and our ancestors have striven, and it ismy belief that an individual who can contemplate this with equanimityand without an impulse to act is so lost to the race and lost to himself,to his family, and to his friends, that he must personally believe there isno hope for anything, anywhere, at any time. Such depravity is difficultto envision. We know, definitely, that the wrong thing to do is nothing.Whenever any situation may develop, we always have that answer. Itis wrong to do nothing. The only time anyone has ever gotten intoserious trouble was when he decided he could do nothing aboutsomething.This was the entering threshold towards death. When one knew,at last, that he was powerless in the face of all fates, or of any oneparticular fate, he was, to that degree, a slave of those fates. Thus, thewrong thing to do in this world, at this time, is nothing. No matter whatfantastic or incredible plan we adventure upon, no matter how we putit forward, it would still be better than the abandonment of all plansand all action. It may be that we have better plans than fantastic plans.It may be that we, possessed of a knowledge of the mind and of Man,can yet restrain this dreadful crime of oblivion from occurring.Dianetics, then, is a weapon. It is a timely weapon. It is the onlyweapon of defense in existence which can confront with equanimitynuclear fission. Dianetics can fail only if it is not used, only if those whoknow about it do not use it to its fullest extent. Were you to take thetechnologies of Dianetics this day, and seeking out anyone evenremotely connected with the responsibility for waging atomic war, applythese techniques to them, you would soon have the man into asufficiently high stratum of humanity that he would recognize some ofhis responsibility to the human race. Your task would be made hard, forall those who are connected with the waging of war with atomic fission"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!10L. RON HUBARDare restricted by law from receiving any psychotherapy. If this seemsincredible to you, you should realize that anyone in a top-secret orconfidential classification in government is not supposed to impart anyinformation of his calling. And it is the fear of governments that some ofthis information might be imparted to someone practising in the field ofmental healing. And thus, if anyone connected with nuclear fission isdiscovered to be undergoing processing of any kind, he would beimmediately relieved of his post and his top-secret classification wouldbe cancelled. But this is not a hopeless picture. Supposing oneprocessed them all and had all their top-secret classifications cancelled,who would be left? Or supposing one pointed out this idiocy withsufficient conviction to those in charge of (but who are not responsiblefor) the destinies of Man, and made it mandatory that the sanity ofanyone connected with the creation or use of atomic fission be requiredto have a sanity passport. Only the insane will destroy. Rememberthat! Only the insane would bring about the end of earth. One of thesemen, fumbling forward, uncomprehending, a mere machine, givenprocessing begins to realize that he is not without responsibility for thesafety of humanity. Only when he is a slave could he be forced to usesuch weapons against mankind. There is no argument on earth ofsufficient emergency or violence to require war, much less war byatomic fission with the consequence of the destruction of at least onecontinent, and within a few years, the destruction of the planet earth.Who would believe that anyone could wipe a continent clean oflife without at once so polluting the atmosphere of earth as toendanger or eradicate all further life-forms on this planet? Whatargument could there be amongst men which could occasion such afate for earth? There is no such argument amongst men. Such anargument could arise amongst machines which, conscientiously, mightpush buttons, reach conclusions for which they had no responsibility.There are many ways in which a higher state of security could beattained for earth. None of these ways include violence or revolution,and all of them include a greater freedom for Mankind. Dianetics is thekey technology necessary for the control of atomic fission. Rememberthat, and remember also that Dianetics is a precision science, that itworks only when it is used as a precision science. That if you are toaccomplish anything with it, whether the rescue of a relative from thepain of continued psychosomatic illness, of a group, a nation, or aworld, it works exactly along the lines it is designed.

RON HUBARDCHAPTER IITHE FUNDAMENTALS OF LIFEMuch more broadly covered in Scientology, the fundamentals oflife yet differ in no way for Man.The basic subdivision in life is between ability and mechanics. Thiscould also be described as a subdivision of quality and quantity, butless accurately.Where mechanics have ability, the ability is only apparent and hasbeen endowed into the mechanics by life. It is all right to suppose thatan electronic brain is capable of thought as long as one realizes thatlife itself must necessarily be present in order to give cause, andquality, or direction, to such a brain. An electronic brain will sit all dayand do nothing unless life starts the machine running. It will givemillions of answers, but none of these, no matter how sharp, have anymeaning until they are viewed by life. The machine is never anythingmore than a servo-mechanism to life. Indeed, a machine cannot evenexist in the absence of life.By mechanics we mean any and all of the objects, motions, orspaces which exist. Foremost of these, and foremost in any mechanicalscheme, is space. Next is energy. Next is condensed or solidifiedenergy, called matter. And finally, always present in any mechanicalarrangement or mechanic, that relative change of position of particlesor objects known as time. Thus we have space, energy, matter, andtime. Whether we are considering a body running on any energy, anautomobile or a mountain, we are still dealing with what we call heremechanics. Mechanics are always quantitative. There is always just somuch distance, or so much mass, or so many hours. The quality ofspace, energy, matter, and time has value only when viewed, used, ormonitored by life, and, indeed, cannot exist in the absence of life.Correct or not, this is workable and is our primary assumption. We havea word for mechanics compounded from matter, energy, space, andtime which is MEST. By MEST we mean any or all arrangements ofenergy of whatever kind, whether in fluid or object form, in space orspaces. We do not conceive life to have an energy, and therefore, any"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!13L. RON HUBARDenergy, even if directly produced by life, can be found to be embracedunder the quantitative term „MEST.“Life itself has quality and ability. The products of quality andability are mechanics. Ability is demonstrated by the handling of matter,energy, space and time. Quality means simply „valued,“ or „having avalue.“ No values, that is to say opinions, exist in the absence of life. Inthe matter of such a thing as an automatic switch we might considerthat the switch is capable of making a decision whether to be off or on.However, we must remember that the original decision that a switchwas to be made, and that „off“ and „on“ could be accomplished, andindeed, the design of a switch itself depended entirely upon life –quality.In the field of mechanics we do not discover creativeness. Wediscover varying conditions, varying arrangements, deterioration anddestruction of one or another form, but we do not discover anyalteration in quantity. Indeed, the entire science of physics ispredicated upon the assumption of „conservation of energy,“ which isto say that energy, itself, cannot be created or destroyed but can onlyalter its form. To this we might add „conservation of space,“„conservation of matter,“ and „conservation of time.“ None of thesethings are capable, in themselves, of altering. They are not capable ofmore than change of position or alteration of form. The physicist is veryfond of demonstrating that the breaking of a vase does no more thanthe altering of the relative positions of the particles of the form, andthat the burning of a piece of coal does not change the basic particlesof matter, since if you were to collect all the smoke, and the ash, andthe particles which radiated from the burning and weigh them youwould have the same weight as before the coal was burned. In otherwords, the quantity of matter does not change, and, as above, it doesnot create to itself or add to itself in any way.Life, it has been adequately established, can, however, create. Itcan create particles and it can add to mass. The demonstration of thison a man is an easily accomplished thing and is quite conclusive. Aprocess known as „the remedy of havingness“ is capable of altering theweight of a man upwards of twenty to thirty-five pounds even thoughthere is no change whatsoever in the diet or the living habits of thatperson. In other words, the life which is in the body of the man, andwhich is actually the man, can, by a certain process, increase the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!14L. RON HUBARDamount of mass of this man. Another process known as „perfectduplication“ can reverse this, and, again without change of diet or theliving habits of the man, decrease the amount of mass of a man withoutthe complications of heat or waste-products being present. Thus,forthrightly and directly, in the same frame of reference as that used bythe physicist, it is easily demonstrated that life does create mass andcan cause mass to disappear.As long ago as fifty years, as represented by an article in theEncyclopedia Britannica, it was fairly well understood that the study ofphysics should have begun with an examination of the mind. Thisarticle, under the heading of time and space, states that as space andtime are mental phenomena their proper delineation and study beginsin the field of the mind. Nineteenth century „mental sciences“ wereinsufficiently schooled in science to comprehend this, and the physicist,unaware in general of such facts, did not consider that his properprovince was the mind. Thus a misunderstanding existed in theHumanities and in the Sciences where one was depending upon theother, and the result came about that neither knew his proper field ofendeavor. By undertaking a study of the mind from the orientation ofphysics, and with the application of all the principles known inchemistry, physics, and mathematics (items with which the nineteenthcentury psychologist was entirely unfamiliar, and which the twentiethcentury psychologist utterly disdains), it was only then possible toproduce some comprehension of this thing we call life in this place wecall the physical universe.Thus, that thing which considers, that thing which has opinions,that thing which creates, that thing which monitors, that thing whichhas goals, desires, and which can experience, is Life. What we callspace, time, energy, matter, forms of any kind, are the by-products of,and are monitored by, Life. Energy, whether in the form of a mentalimage, a body, a tree, or a rock, are alike the by-products of life. Thereis no faintest difference, save only density and wavelength, betweenthe space you behold around you with your physical eyes and thespaces and forms you see when you close them and behold a mentalimage. These things, alike, are energies, and obey the various laws ofenergy.Here, then, we have a unit or a quality capable of bringing intobeing quantities such as spaces, energies, masses, and time, capable"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!15L. RON HUBARDof changing and controlling these masses and energies, capable ofadding to them or subtracting from them.There is considerable dissertation in „Dianetics: The ModernScience of Mental Health“ concerning the „awareness of awarenessunit.“ When this subject was first under investigation it wasestablished that all was not a machine. Somewhere, in tracing back thevarious lines, it was necessary to strike a cause point, either simply toassume that there was a cause point or to discover one. Two wordswere used in connection with this causative agent. One of them was„analytical mind,“ and the other, much more properly, the „awarenessof awareness unit.“ The awareness of awareness unit, as its nameimplies, is aware of being aware, or aware of being alive. When onewas looking at or discussing the analytical mind, one was aware ofsomething else: that the awareness of awareness unit becameconnected in some fashion with computers, or analyzers, in order tohandle and control the remainder of the physical being. The term„analytical mind“ then meant the awareness of awareness unit plussome evaluative circuit or circuits, or machinery, to make the handling ofthe body possible.The other item discussed broadly in „Dianetics: the ModernScience of Mental Health,“ was the „reactive mind.“ This mind was astimulus-response mind which depended for exterior direction upon itsaction and reaction. The reactive mind was conceived to be a collectionof records, in picture form, so arranged as to make a complete patternof experience, capable by its pattern alone of evaluating the conduct orbehavior of the individual. The pictures contained in the reactive mindsare now called „facsimiles,“ for they are no more and no less thanpictures, like photographs, taken of the universe around the individualand retained by him. A specialized kind of facsimile was the „engram.“This differed from other mental pictures because it contained, as part ofits content, unconsciousness and physical pain. The definition of anengram is: a picture of „a moment of pain and unconsciousness.“ Thereactive mind was conceived to have more of these engrams than theanalyzer. But the analyzer was seen to have some of these, too,except they were a lighter form and were a lock on the engram in thereactive memory bank. Indeed, when one considered the reactive mindhe was actually considering what is, in the electronic brain, a memorybank. Instead of cards or a card-file system the reactive mind containedpictures. These pictures were filed and were drawn out of the files by"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!16L. RON HUBARDthe environment, which contained restimulators.* The presence ofthese pictures could alter form and could alter behavior. The eradicationof one of these engrams by one of the earlier erasure techniques ofDianetics was found to alter the stimulus-response behavior of theindividual.Here we were confronting three kinds of mind. One was thecausative agent, the awareness of awareness unit, which did notappear to have any by-products but which was impinged upon anothermind called the analytical mind, which on a machine basis analyzedsituations rationally, when sane and rational, and a third kind of mindeven further remote from the awareness of awareness unit, whichacted without the consent of the causative agent and did not in anyway consult it. Now on a very careful review of this we see that theanalytical mind and the reactive mind, alike, are by-product mechanicalminds. Alike, they depend upon energy, spaces, storage, and otherquantitative things. The awareness of awareness unit, however, isitself decision, is itself knowingness. It delivers into the analytical mindand its system various knowingnesses to be handled on a mechanicalbasis, and unwittingly delivers into the hands of the reactive mind –which is totally a mechanical thing – the right to alter and correct theanalytical mind. Apparently, then, we have here a causative agent andtwo machines. We might as well, then, take the obvious conclusion thatthere is the awareness of awareness unit, and that this in somefashion handles machinery, and that the analytical mind, the reactivemind, and even the body and the environment are mechanical. Oneitem here is qualitative and decisional – the awareness of awarenessunit. All other items are subordinate to it and depend for theirconclusions either upon it or upon the environment. Here again wehave quality versus quantity.A further demonstration of this awareness of awareness unit inaction is quite convincing. A machine, a meter, which is built in everytradition of physics and electronics, and which is composed of nothingmore or less than the usual meters and gauges and electrodes, candetect the production of energy by the analytical mind. This machinedemonstrates conclusively that the awareness of awareness unit canpredict and cause an energy reaction to occur at will. It goes furtherand demonstrates that the awareness of awareness unit can bringabout, without further contact, an energy flow in a body at a distance.This is a very startling demonstration, and is one of the more significant"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!17L. RON HUBARDelectrical discoveries of recent times. The conditions of the experimentare sufficiently rigorous to dispel any doubt in the mind of a physicistconcerning the authenticity of occurrence.If there were no energy being created by the awareness ofawareness unit, then one would be at a loss to account for mentalenergy pictures, for these things, being made at a tremendously rapidrate, have considerable mass in them – mass which is measurable on athing which is as common and everyday as a pair of bathroom scales.As soon as it was discovered how facsimiles (these mental energypictures) came into being it was also discovered that they were actualenergy and not „an idea of energy“ as they had been supposed to bein the past. The facsimile and the engram come into action byresistance. The awareness of awareness unit resists a scene in thephysical universe, either resisting its approach or departure, and thusby this resistance makes a print. This print is made in a moving fashion,like a motion picture, and is complete in every detail. Later on theindividual can call back this print and take a look at it, and will find it tohave in it the exact forces which were in the original version in thephysical universe. The awareness of awareness unit does this so easilythat it has been completely unaware of what it was doing. Now, whenthe awareness of awareness unit makes a print, trying to restrainsomething from going away, or trying to restrain it from approaching,and considers that the survival of its body is being violated orthreatened, it files this print in such a way that it will not have to lookat it again. But this does not mean that an approximation of the printby the physical environment cannot reactivate the print independently.In other words, when the awareness of awareness unit puts away anddoes not want to look again at such a facsimile, the facsimile itselfbegins to have a power over the awareness of awareness unit. Thecollected files of these non-survival experiences come together and arethe reactive mind. The awareness of awareness unit could be consciousof these, but chooses not to be. Thus the environment can restimulatethis reactive mind and can cause changes of behavior and bodily formsuch as over-weight, psychosomatic ills, or even fixed expressions orgestures.The essence of time is change. Where there is no change there isno time. Thus, something which is unchanging is enduring. If a thinghas no change in it, it will then „float“ in all time, since it does not"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!18L. RON HUBARDassign itself to any changingness, being a thing of no-change. Thus wediscover that silences and no-motions „float“ in time and we discoverthat every place on the time track where the awareness of awarenessunit has taken a picture of silence, has resented or restrained silence, itthen has an energy mass which will „float“ or stay with it, whatevertime it assigns to itself, and we get the composition of the physicaluniverse. The physical universe is composed of „floating“ or foreverenergy. If this did not work out in processing and if it were not a usableprinciple it would not be included in this text.In view of the fact that these facsimiles, particularly those ofsilence, can „stay with“ the individual, then we get the entiremechanism we call „restimulation“ where the environment reactivates afacsimile, which then acts back against the body or awareness ofawareness unit of the person. This is a very simple system of stimulus-response. We discover then that engrams, or facsimiles in general,have a tendency to hang up on all of their silent or motionless spots.Thus a facsimile may contain considerable action and yet be stuck atone point of no-motion. Here we have a no-motion on either side ofwhich there is motion. The no-motion point hangs up and is notcontacted by the awareness of awareness unit, since the awareness ofawareness unit is looking, in general, for motion. Thus we get aphenomenon known as „stuck on the time track“ where an individualcan believe himself to be at some distant point in the past. Thefacsimile or engram in which he is „caught“ has almost as much realityto him as a condition of existence as his present-time environment.When he becomes entirely psychotic the facsimile or engram has farmore reality to him than his present-time environment. Thus we haveaberration and psychosomatic illness.In early Dianetics, the way this condition was alleviated was byaddressing the pictures themselves and persuading the awareness ofawareness unit to erase them by recounting them and re-experiencingthem. Because this took a long time, and because auditors had atendency to abandon half-erased incidents, the technology – whileworkable – was not conclusive. Thus, more research and investigationhad to be entered upon in order to establish the best way to handlethis situation."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!19L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER IIITHE AWARENESS OF AWARENESS UNITIn examining the individuality and identity of the individual onediscovers that the individual if himself, and not his by-products. Theindividual is not his analytical mind, he is not his reactive mind, he is nothis body any more than he is his house or car. He might considerhimself to be associated with his analytical mind, his reactive mind, hishouse, his body, his car, but he is not these things. He is himself. Theindividual, the personality, is the awareness of awareness unit, and theawareness of awareness unit is the person. As this awareness ofawareness unit confuses itself further and further with the pictures ithas made of its surroundings it conceives itself more and more to be anobject, until at last when it has gone entirely down the tone scale* ithas arrived at the point where its fondest belief is that it is an object.Just as you would not say that John Jones was his car, so mustyou also say – when you perceive this clearly – that John Jones is nothis analytical mind or his reactive mind, his body, or his clothes. JohnJones is an awareness of awareness unit, and all there is of him that iscapable of knowing and of being aware is John Jones, an awareness ofawareness unit.When we have arrived at a state where John Jones himselfknows that he is an awareness of awareness unit and not hisanalytical mind, his reactive mind, his body, his clothes, his house, hiscar, his wife or his grandparents, we have what is called in Dianetics, a„Clear.“ A Clear is simply an awareness of awareness unit which knowsit is an awareness of awareness unit, can create energy at will, andcan handle and control, erase or re-create an analytical mind orreactive mind.The difference of approach is this: instead of erasing all the thingswith which the awareness of awareness unit is in conflict, we make theawareness of awareness unit capable of besting and controlling allthose things with which he thought he had to be in conflict. In otherwords, we raise the determinism of an individual up to a point wherehe is capable of controlling his mental pictures and the various by-products of life. When he is capable, so far as his ability is concerned, of"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!20L. RON HUBARDcontrolling and determining the action of these things, he is no longeraberrated. He can recall anything he wants to recall without the aidand assistance of energy masses. He can be what he wants to be. Hehas had restored to himself a considerable freedom.About the only difficulty we have in accomplishing this state ofClear, with all the power and ability appended thereto, is the fact thatindividuals come to believe that they have to have certain things inorder to go on surviving. Actually, an awareness of awareness unitcannot do anything else but survive. He is unkillable, yet his by-products are destroyable, and confusing himself with his by-productshe begins to believe that he has to have or do certain things in order tosurvive. His anxiety becomes so great on this that he will even believethat he has to have problems in order to survive. An awareness ofawareness unit is very unhappy unless it has some mass or space ofsome kind and if it does not have various problems to solve.For a very long time in Dianetics we looked far for the „One-ShotClear.“ Such a thing has come into existence and is workable on overfifty percent of the current populace of mankind. The One-Shot Cleardepends, of course, upon getting the awareness of awareness unit ata distance from and in control of its various by-products so that it nolonger confuses itself with its by-products. The astonishing speed withwhich fifty per cent of the human race can be cleared is believable onlywhen you put it into action. The magic words are: „Be three feet backof your head.“ This is the One-Shot Clear. If the existence of a One-Shot Clear, or a process is indigestible to people it is because theyhave so long contemplated objects and have their attention sothoroughly fixed upon objects that they can no longer view space. Andthe idea of viewing space, the idea of being without objects is soantipathetic to them that they feel they must condemn any effort whichmight take from them the proximity of some of their fondestpossessions.It is so strongly antipathetic to Man to look at space that one ofthe basic processes of Dianetics – causing him to look at spots inspace – will cause a rather low-toned individual to become quiteviolently ill at his stomach. The nausea resulting simply fromcontemplating empty space is discoverable only in those who have agreat deal of trouble with possessions and who are unable to havethings. From having to have things they have gotten to a point where"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!21L. RON HUBARDthey do not believe they can have anything any more. Thus, beingasked to contemplate an emptiness of any kind is enough to cause aviolent physical reaction. Hence, this whole subject of „Clear“ andexteriorization, as it is technically termed, is very antipathetic to theremaining fifty percent of the human race who cannot be hit instantlywith this one-shot button.Fifty percent of the people you walk up to, if you do not pre-selectyour preclears – a person on the road to being Clear – will immediatelyexteriorize, be a distance from their body, and behold themselves ascapable of handling a great many things they before consideredimpossible to control the moment you say „Be three feet back of yourhead.“ The remaining fifty percent will look at you with varyingpuzzlement. These know they are a body. These know they are anobject, and these know (most of them) that they would get sick at theirstomachs if they contemplated being all by themselves in space. Theywould believe it would be impossible to control a body while beingthree feet behind it. Thus one gets into an immediate argument withsuch people, and they wish to go into the various deeper significances.If these people were lost to us with current Dianetic processes, wewould still have gained many percentile over any past effort to dosomething for the race or about the mind.In the past, even when we locked as short a time ago as 1949,we discovered that Man in general did not possess the ability to get arecovery percentage in patients higher than twenty-two percent. Oddlyenough, whether it was a witch doctor at work, a psychoanalyst,psychologist, a medical doctor, or any other practitioner, simpleassurance and a pat on the back yet brought about twenty-twopercent cured. This fact, not looked at very carefully by practitioners,caused people to believe that the only thing that was wrong with themind was that people thought something was wrong with the mind andall people needed was a cheering word and it would be all right.Twenty-two percent of a population will recover if anything is done forthem. The remaining 78 percent are not quite so lucky. When we canraise the percentages even to 30 percent we are doing more than hasever been done before. When any practice gets less than 22 percentrecovery, then that practice is actually definitely harming people, for ifall the practitioner did was be at home in his office and give cheeryreassurance to his patients he would get this 22 percent. He wouldhave to be very active and depressive in order to decrease this amount"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!22L. RON HUBARDof recoveries. Now, when we suddenly vault to the figure of 50 percentwe know that we are closing with the answer. Thus, we could relax atthis very point, confident that we have done more in this field than hasever before been done.However, it is not good enough within our framework. In the firstplace, if we wish to help people involved with the government, peopleinvolved with ruling, people involved with the material sciences – suchas physicists and chemists – we are dealing with almost entirely theremaining „resistive“ 50 percent. This does not mean that a person,simply by exteriorizing, is weaker. It means that a person withcontinuous contact with the physical universe and continuousharassment and concern over the state of objects or energy is apt toget what we call „interiorized.“A recent series of cases undertaken to demonstrate how far wehad to go and what we had to do in order to bring results in thisremaining 50 percent has now concluded successfully. With moderntechniques, very, very closely followed, auditors trained by the centralorganization have been successfully clearing cases which were resistiveand did not improve on all earlier processes as of 1951, ‘52, ‘53 and thebulk of ‘54. The certainty of clearing the first 50 percent simply with themagic words has been followed now with a certainty of handling theremaining 50 percent. This presents a rather different scene andattitude than in 1950 when an auditor had to be „intuitive“ and had towork endlessly, it seemed, to produce gains on cases, much lessclearing. My own percentages in clearing people do not count, and Ilearned early (with some puzzlement) that what I did with a preclearand the results I obtained with a preclear were not the results whichwould be obtained by another auditor. It was this fact alone whichcaused research and investigation to be continued at such lengths, andprocesses to be codified so closely. For first we had to know processes,and then we had to know how to train auditors, and finally we areobtaining these clearing results.Any Clear earlier obtained was known to be Clear simply by thefact that he could recall at will by pictures, or could perform certainother feats. Actually, a person was only able to stay Clear when hewas not immediately involved with either his analytical or his reactivemind. And those Clears which remained stable had been put unwittinglyinto a much more advanced stage than had been supposed, even by"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!23L. RON HUBARDthe auditor. It was an investigation of these Clears which led forwardinto the techniques we have now. It was found that many of themwere simply wide-open cases which had become rather able to readtheir own facsimiles. Several had simply increased their ability to a pointso senior to other people’s ability that everyone agreed they should becalled „Clear.“ And then there was the actual Clear. The actual Clear,on close questioning, even though he himself had not always noticed it,conceived himself now to be some distance from the body. ThoseClears which remained stable and continued to perform and functiondespite the convulsions of life were these who had been stablyexteriorized. This may be a datum which is very hard for someDianeticists to assimilate, but again the difficulty would stem only fromthe fact that these would be unwilling to look at space or would beafraid of being disenfranchised. Such people are very frightened oflosing their bodies. But this is a fact with which we cannot argue, thatso far as psychosomatic illness is concerned it is best resolved byexteriorization. One has the individual step back from his body, look atit, and patch it up, and that is about all there is to psychosomaticillness. There is, of course, an electronic structure of the body whichone can direct a person’s attention to, but I have seen the shape of aface change in a moment, I have seen psychosomatic illnessesdisappear in seconds, and as long as there was any physical structureleft to work with at all I have seen the problem of psychosomatic illnesspushed so far into the background, as a problem, that we no longerthink in these terms, and we do not consider Dianetics well used whenit is only addressed to psychosomatic illness and aberrations.Our emphasis today is upon ability. We have found that the morewe increase the ability of a person the better the by-products aroundhim become. Simply by increasing an individual’s ability to walk or totalk we can change his physical beingness and his mental outlook.By this theory it would be enough to have somebody learn how tomake pottery, or drive a car, or speak in public, to increase his mentaland physical health. And indeed, on investigation we discover thatthese things are therapeutic, but we discover that they are limited intheir therapy because the talents which an individual learns in thisfashion are talents involved entirely with the handling and orientationof the body, and he is not being entirely influenced merely by his body.He is being influenced as well by the computing machinery which hecalls his analytical mind and by the more insidious and less obvious"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!24L. RON HUBARDmachinery called his reactive mind. Furthermore, by these increases inability he is not brought up to a point where he can control or handlehis entire environment. Such an ability can be developed only by and inthe awareness of awareness unit itself. When it is learning to dosomething via the body it is not learning to do something directly, it islearning to do something with help – the help of arms and legs, face,voice, and thus hobby therapy is limited even though it is quite positive.Looking a little further along this line one discovers that theawareness of awareness unit has peculiar abilities. First and foremostof its abilities is to be where it likes to be, and look. It does not needeyes. It does not need a vehicle in which to travel. All it needs to do isto postulate its existence in a certain location and then look from thatpoint of existence. In order to do this it has to be willing to be cause. Ithas to be willing to be an effect. But if it can do this it can go muchfurther – it can create and change space. Furthermore, it can erase at aglance facsimiles and engrams.Now when we get into such capabilities people are liable tobelieve that we have entered the field of mysticism and spiritualism. Butan inspection of these fields demonstrates the people in them not to bevery able. Mysticism and other such practices are reverse practices.Rather than controlling the reactive bank, the analytical mind, the body,the environment, they seek very markedly to withdraw from thenecessity to control. This is downward ability, and while I might beaccused of maligning these fields, I can only look at the people I haveknown in these fields and add the fact that I, myself have studied inthese fields in the East and know their limitations. People are apt toconfuse exteriorization with astral walking. As you sit there reading thisbook you are definitely and positively aware of sitting there, and of thisbook. There is no question about whether or not you are looking at abook. You don’t believe yourself to be projected, and you don’t have toguess where you are, and you don’t think you have to create some sortof an image in order to look at anything. You are simply sitting therereading a book. This is exteriorization. If you were cleared, and, withyour body at home you were in a library, you could read in the libraryjust as well, with the limitation that you might not have as good agrasp on pages. You would certainly know you were in the library.There would be no question about this. There would be no questionabout the text on the periodicals on the table. There would be noquestion about the quality and personality of the librarian and other"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!25L. RON HUBARDpeople sitting there. Being Clear does not enter into guesswork. Youwould not be concerned with telepathy, with the reading of people’sminds, and other such bric-a-brac. You would simply know what youwanted to know. Further, you wouldn’t have to use a system for findingout what you know. You would simply know it.If Man cannot face what he is, then Man cannot be free. For anawareness of awareness unit surrounded entirely by energy masses,and believing that it itself is completely these masses, is in a difficultand desperate state. It believes, for instance, that in order to go fromone address to another it has to take the energy mass along with it.This is not true. One might carry a body around in order to speed upone’s conversation, in order to have a problem, in order to get someattention and interest from people, but one would not carry a bodyaround because one had to have a body.The general attitude of a person who is cleared is the mostinteresting thing to observe. Only a cleared person has a very definitetolerance for the behavior of others. People before they are cleared arein varying degrees of distrust of other people. They are hiding, orprotecting, or owning things to such a degree that they do not dareseparate themselves from them.There is a certain fear of an exteriorized person. There is a beliefthat he might do them wrong. Actually one is done wrong by theweaklings of this world, not the strong men. One does not have toenslave and control by force those whose conduct he does not fear.When you find an individual who is bent entirely upon a course of thearduously controlled emotions of others you are looking at an individualwho is afraid. By their fear you shall know them.Another slight difficulty in the state of exteriorization is that onehas a tendency to let things be more or less as they are. Up to acertain point one is content to let the game run and take part in it andhave fun with it. The point, of course, is the destruction of the playingfield. Life, to a Clear, is no more and no less than a game, and the onlything which he would consider somewhat unpardonable in behaviorwould be the wiping out of the playing field. But if he were even higherin such a state he should, theoretically, make his own playing field.However, if he did this he would find difficulty getting intocommunication with other live beings, unless, of course, he made them,"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!26L. RON HUBARDwhich is rather an unsatisfactory state of affairs since one never quiteforgets that, he did so.Moral conduct is conduct by a code of arbitrary laws. Ethicalconduct is conduct out of one’s own sense of justice and honesty.When you enforce a moral code upon people you depart considerablyfrom anything like ethics. People obey a moral code because they areafraid. People are ethical only when they are strong. One could saythat the criminals of earth are those upon whom moral codes havebeen too forcefully enforced. (As an example of this take the clicheobject, the minister’s son.) Ethical conduct does not mean promiscuousabandon or lawless conduct. It means conduct undertaken andfollowed because one has a sense of ethics, a sense of justice, and asense of power. This is self-determined morality. A Clear has this to avery marked degree. By actual check of many such cases their moralbehavior is intensely superior to that of people who pride themselveson „being good.“ The point arises because law and order depends forits existence upon its necessity in the field of morals, and it looks with asort of horror on somebody who would be good without recourse to orthreat from the forces of law and order. Such a person would be ratherhard to have around. He would cut down the number on the policeforce quite markedly.The state of Clear, then, is attainable and is desirable, and nowthat we can accomplish it with greater positiveness than in 1950 isfound to be superior to that described in the second chapter of„Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health.“The way one goes about being Clear, or creating a Clear, issimple, but requires a certain code of conduct called The Auditor’s Code,and requires, we have discovered, a considerable amount of training.Clearing another person is a highly specialized ability. This ability mustbe raised in individuals before they can easily and successfullyundertake such a project. Witnessing this is the fact that while many ofthe processes involved in clearing have been available for a very, verylong time, very few people have successfully used them. The discoveryof why this was was quite as important as the state of Clear itself. Theremedy of this disability lies in training and processing. The activity ofcreating a Clear is known as „processing“ and is undertaken by oneindividual on behalf of another individual. „Self-clearing“ has not beenfound possible where the individual was badly mired in his own case."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!27L. RON HUBARDEnormously subordinate to the goal of Clear, but enormouslysenior to Man’s various healing activities in the mind, spirit, and body,the very processes which lead up to Clear resolve, whether one wantsthem to or not, a great many of the physical and mental aberrations ofthe individual. One can take one of these processes and run it all byitself, and accomplish more with Dianetics than Man has previouslyaccomplished in any of the fields that deal with human aberration.When one has the answer, of course applying these answers to minorpsychosomatic difficulties, or aberrations, or spiritual unrest iselementary. But again we have discovered that there is no realsubstitute for training either at the hands of an already trained andskilled auditor, or best, from a central organization.The awareness of awareness unit was not readily discoverable inthe field of physics because physics is entirely concerned withmechanics. Physics starts with the assumption of the conservation ofenergy and the existence of space and goes on into furthercomplexities from there. The awareness of awareness unit is one stepearlier than all this, and its existence was unsuspected by amisdefinition in the field of physics. That was the definition of a static. Astatic, in physics, is called something which is „an equilibrium of forces.“This object at rest in an equilibrium of forces is an interesting semanticpuzzle. If we put a glass upon a table and then say that it is a static,we are telling a very bad lie. It is not in an equilibrium of forces. Thatglass happens to be traveling at 1,000 miles an hour just by reason ofthe fact that the earth is turning. It has seven other directions andspeeds by reason of being part of the planet earth, the solar system,and this galaxy. It cannot, then, be considered at rest. Thus no objectcan be considered at rest unless one considers something relatively atrest. The glass is at rest in relationship to the table, but this is not thephysical definition.The definition of a static discloses something else of interest.There was a missing definition in the field of mathematics, and that wasthe definition of zero. The mathematician for ages has been using in allhis formulas a wild variable without suspecting it was there. He did notreally encounter it until he got into the higher fields of nuclear physics.At this time he encountered it so forcefully and knew it so little that hehad to alter most of his mathematical conceptions in order to work withnuclear physics at all."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!28L. RON HUBARDThis wild variable was no less than zero. Zero, put down as agoose egg in many mathematical formulas, would introduce manyinteresting variables. In the first place an absolute zero has never beenobtained in this universe. It has only been approached. That is in termsof chemistry. That is in terms of non-existence. We can say there iszero of apples, but that is still a qualified zero. We call say there wereno apples, but that is further qualified as being in the past. It is a pastzero. We can say there will be no apples, and again we will have thezero qualified as being in the future. Zero was an absence of a thing,and this immediately violated the definition of zero being no thing. Theabsoluteness of no thing had to be examined while we were examiningthe field of the mind and actually led to some very astonishingdiscoveries with regard to Life itself and immediately pin-pointed theexistence of the awareness of awareness unit.The proper and correct definition of zero would be: „Somethingwhich had no mass, which had no wave length, which had no locationin space, which had no position or relationship in time.“ This would be azero. One could state it more shortly, if a little less correctly as:„something without mass, meaning, or mobility.“It would be almost impossible to detach a dyed-in-the-woolphysicist from the concept that everything was a „somethingness“ andthat there was actually a „nothingness.“ However, there is anothingness which has quality. It has potentials, it has ability. It hasthe ability to perceive, it has the ability to create, the ability tounderstand, and the ability to appear and disappear to its ownsatisfaction in various positions in space. Furthermore, this thing could,we have demonstrated conclusively, manufacture or cause to vanishspace, energy and masses, and could, quite additionally, repositiontime.These new concepts are actually advances in the field of physicsand mathematics, and from the viewpoint of the physicist and themathematician would only incidentally apply to the mind.From this data we get the basic definition of a static, which is: „Anactuality of no mass, no wave-length, no position in space or relation intime, but with the quality of creating or destroying mass or energy,locating itself or creating space, and of re-relating time.“ And thus wehave the definition of an awareness of awareness unit. It is the"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!29L. RON HUBARDdefinition of a static. It does not have quantity, it has quality. It doesnot have mechanics, it can produce mechanics, and it does have ability.The foremost ability of the awareness of awareness unit is tohave an idea, and to continue that idea, and to perceive the idea in itscontinuance in the form of mass, energy, objects and time. In the fieldof Scientology the fact that this awareness of awareness unit can alsocontrol and even make physical bodies is almost incidental. That is onlya specialized branch of the game. In Dianetics this is a very importantfunction, for one in Dianetics is working with Man.A static could also be called an orientation point. It would be fromthat point that it made and directed space, energy and objects. Itwould be from that point that it assigned meanings, and that we havean essential difference between the awareness of awareness unit andits by-products. These by-products we categorize as symbols. When wesay „mechanics“ we actually mean to some degree „symbols.“ A symbolis something that has mass, meaning, and mobility – three M’s. That isthe technical definition of a symbol. An orientation point is somethingthat controls symbols. The difference in ability of an awareness ofawareness unit is how much it is an orientation point in relationship tohow much it believes itself to be a symbol, or to have mass, meaningand mobility. Reduction from the state of awareness is into thecondition of the symbol – mass, meaning and mobility. To get a clearidea of this, you see the word „a“ on this page. That has mass, even ifvery slight mass. It has meaning, since it conveys an idea whenglanced at, and it certainly has mobility, since you can move the bookaround. Now you, looking at this book, have the role of an orientationpoint to the degree that you do not conceive yourself to have a fixedidentity, a fixed position, a fixed mass. If you, looking at the book, haveno real mass, if your name is not a tremendously fixed idea with you,and if you know you can move your body around without having tomove with it, then you would very clearly and decisively be anorientation point. But if you think you have mass and are mass, and ifyou think you are your name, and if you think you have to move aroundonly by moving the body around, then of course somebody else,something else, can be your orientation point. It may be your mother. Itmay be your home town, or, if you are a mystic, it might even be somespirit. You would think of yourself as a symbol. Similarly, a symbol doesnot remember anything more than it symbolizes, and thus your memoryto a large degree might be the memory of past allies – people who took"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!30L. RON HUBARDcare of you and to whom you were attached affectionately – and if youwere in a lecture you would probably take notes rather than rememberwhat is being said. An orientation point has the power of memorywithout record. A symbol has the power of memory only to the degreethat it is a record.Thus we see that it is desirable that an individual does notidentify himself with masses, but that he retain his ability to handlemasses and objects and energies, to remember at will, without theneed of records such as those in the reactive bank, or facsimilemachines such as those in the analytical mind’s bank.In any good, thorough investigation, one investigates to seewhat he will discover and to find better ways to do things. In anyreliable investigation report one tells what he discovered and reportsits character and nature. In this science we are doing just that. Whenwe talk of the awareness of awareness unit we are not talking to bepleasing, to win friends or influence professors, we are simply tellingyou what has been discovered after twenty-five years of research andinvestigation in the field of the mind that has taken off from theplatform of physics and mathematics rather than philosophy. Theawareness of awareness unit is a fact. It is a demonstrable fact, andthe best way to demonstrate it is to use the processes whichaccomplish this, and then discover that the individual is more well, hasa better memory, is better oriented, more capable, is more ethical,happier, has better command of time, can communicate better, is morewilling to have friends, is less anti-social than the average person, andhas a greater zest for living and getting things done. All these thingscan be accomplished by test.In 1950 we often had occasion to demonstrate the existence ofthe engram. It seemed to be highly in question amongst those peoplewho were extremely specialized – it said on their diplomas – in the fieldof the mind. To be accomplished in the field of the mind and yet notknow anything about engrams or facsimiles would be an idiotic stateindeed, because the mind is composed of facsimiles and engrams, ifone wishes to examine it – or energy products. Well, then (as now) wewere only interested in results. What can we do with this technology?If we can demonstrate with this technology that we can better thelives, tolerances, abilities of those around us, then certainly we willhave done something. We have no place for philosophical argument"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!31L. RON HUBARDconcerning this material. It is simply workable material. You do notargue with the directions on how to open a vacuum packed can. If youdon’t follow them you don’t get the can open. Or, not following them,and still being insistent upon it, you smash the can and ruin thecontents. One would not go into a philosophic dissertation about thedirections of opening a can. Obviously they are written by somebodywho knows how to open cans, and any hours spent on getting thisperson to demonstrate that he really could open cans would be wastedtime. The thing to do is simply read the directions, follow them veryclosely, and see whether or not the can is opened. Although this seemsto be a very common sort of example to apply to that noble creature,Man, it is nevertheless, the bluntest statement that could be madeabout the status of Dianetics and Scientology and their uses andpurposes.Dianetics has as its goal the repairing and patching up of thisthing called by the uninitiated, this civilization, taking its destiny out ofthe hands of madmen who think that the entire organism is simply amachine, and putting it in the hands of the same people, only this timewith the ingredient of sanity added. There isn’t even any point in tryingto categorize Dianetics or say that it compares to psychology ormathematics or engineering, or any other activity, because it isobviously senior to all these activities and doesn’t have to take any ofthese activities into account to work. All Dianetics needs to work is atrained auditor, a preclear, and a little time in which to accomplish itsprocesses. If these ingredients – the auditor, the preclear, and a littletime – were not available, then there would be no purpose in havingany Dianetics at all, since there wouldn’t be any human race.The spirit in which these conclusions are advanced is intenselypractical, and now that some nitwits who probably don’t get along withtheir wives and hate dogs, but who have worked themselves into theposition of being able to, can knock a couple of atoms together, eitherby orders or by actual skill, and so tear up a very nice playing field, thepresence of Dianetics in this world is not simply a practicality, but anurgency."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!32L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER IVACCENT ON ABILITYAlmost anyone realizes that he can be better than he is, that hecan do things better than he has been doing them. It is an entirelydifferent thing to ask someone to realize that he is ill, aberrated, orstupid. Why is it that a man can understand that he can be morecapable and very often cannot understand that he is incapable? Itwould seem to follow that if a man realized that he could be morecapable, then he would realize at once that he was, to some degree,less capable than he could be. For various reasons, however, this doesnot follow. One is confronted many times too often by his insistenceupon brilliance of a very stupid man. It could be said with some truththat the person who asserts he needs to know no more to be fully asbright as his fellows, would, upon examination, be discovered to bequite deficient in capability and understanding.Earth has had many examples of this. The Fascist is probably bestdescribed as a very stupid man who insists upon a status quo which isintolerable for all others, yet who believes himself to be brighter thanall others. But even a Fascist of the most modern sort – the FissionFascist – would be the first to admit that both he and others could do abetter job of being fascistic.The basic reason for this is a simple one, almost idiotically simple.One can understand understanding, and can see that understandingcan increase. Stupidity, ignorance, illness, aberration, incapability areonly a fall away from understanding and are, themselves, lessunderstanding and so are less understandable. One does notunderstand that he might get worse, and so does not have any greatcommunication with people who tell him that he will get worse. Thedying man believes right up to the moment of his last breath, no matterwhat he is saying to his doctor and family, that he is going to getbetter. He has no understanding of that state of non-understandingness called death. One can understand theunderstandable. One cannot understand the comprehensible becausethe definition of incomprehensibility is non-understandability. As I said,this is an almost idiotically simple situation."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!33L. RON HUBARDLife in its highest state is understanding. Life in its lower states isin a lower level of understanding, and where life has ceased to functionand has arrived at what one might call total incapability, there is nounderstanding at all.In Dianetics and Scientology we have a great deal to do with thissubject called understanding. Understanding has very specificcomponent parts. These component parts are: Affinity, Reality, andCommunication.Affinity, Reality, and Communication form an interdependenttriangle. It is easily discovered on some inspection that one cannotcommunicate in the absence of Reality and Affinity. Further, one cannothave a reality on something with which he cannot communicate and forwhich he feels no affinity. And similarly, one has no affinity forsomething on which he has no reality and with which he cannotcommunicate. Even more narrowly, one does not have affinity for thosethings on which he has no reality and on which he cannot communicate,and one has no reality on things which he has no affinity for and cannotcommunicate upon, and one cannot communicate upon things whichhave no reality to him and for which he has no affinity.A graphic example of this would be anger. One becomes angryand what one says does not then communicate to the person at whomone might be angry. Even more crudely, the fastest way to go out ofcommunication with a machine would be to cease to feel any affinity forit, and to refuse to have any reality upon it.We call this triangle the ARC triangle. The precision definitions ofthese three items are as follows:1. COMMUNICATION is the interchange of ideas or particlesbetween two points. More precisely, the definition of Communication is:Cause, Distance, Effect with Intention and Attention and a duplicationat Effect of what emanates from Cause.2. REALITY is the degree of agreement reached by two ends of acommunication line. In essence, it is the degree of duplication achievedbetween Cause and Effect. That which is real is real simply because it isagreed upon, and for no other reason.3. AFFINITY is the relative distance and similarity of the two endsof a communication line. Affinity has in it a mass connotation. The worditself implies that the greatest affinity there could be would be the"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!34L. RON HUBARDoccupation of the same space, and this, by experiment, has becomedemonstrated. Where things do not occupy the same space theiraffinity is delineated by the relative distance and the degree ofduplication.These three items, Affinity, Reality and Communication, can bedemonstrated to equate into Understanding. Above Understanding isKnowingness without formula or design, and this might be consideredto be a unit activity. Dropping down from a complete Knowingness wewould arrive into the realm of Understanding, for this is a ThirdDynamic* manifestation peculiar to two or more individuals. Were youto be a clever mathematician, you could discover by Symbolic Logic howall mathematical formulas could be derived from this principle thatUnderstanding is composed of Affinity, Reality, and Communication. Nomathematics falling outside this triangle is valid mathematics to man.There is no additional factor in Understanding except Significance, butthis, of course, is the idea or consideration mentioned in theCommunication Formula (1., above).It is a truism that if we could understand all Life we would thentolerate all Life. Further, and more germane to ability, if one couldoccupy the position of any part of Life, one would feel a sufficientaffinity for Life to be able to merge with it or separate from it at will.When we say „Life“ all of us know more or less what we aretalking about, but when we use this word „Life“ practically, we mustexamine the purposes and behavior, and in particular the formulasevolved by life in order to have the game called „Life.“When we say „Life“ we mean Understanding, and when we say„Understanding“ we mean Affinity, Reality, and Communication. Tounderstand all would be to live at the highest level of potential actionand ability. The quality of Life exists in the presence of Understanding –in the presence, * See full list of Dynamics in Chapter XI. then, ofAffinity, Reality, and Communication. Life would exist to a far less activedegree in the levels of misunderstanding, incomprehensibility,psychosomatic illness, and physical and mental incapabilities. BecauseLife is Understanding it attempts to understand. When it turns andfaces the incomprehensible it feels balked and baffled. It feels there isa secret, and feels that the secret is a threat to existence.A secret is antipathetic to Life, and therefore Life, in searching forthose things which would seem to reduce it, will hit upon various"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!35L. RON HUBARDsecrets it must discover. The basic secret is that a secret is an absenceof Life, and a total secret would be a total unlivingness.Now let us look at this formula of Communication and discoverthat we must have a duplication at Effect of what emanates fromCause. The classic example here is a telegram sent from New York Cityto San Francisco which says „I love you.“ When it arrives in SanFrancisco the machinery of communication has delivered it so that itsays „I loathe you.“ This failure of duplication is looked upon as anerror, and would cause considerable problems and trouble. It could notbe considered to be a very good communication. There was nothingwrong with the basic intention. There was nothing wrong with theAttention which would be given the wire in San Francisco. The onlything that was wrong was a failure to duplicate at Effect whatemanated from Cause.Now if Life is Understanding it would find it very hard tocommunicate with something which was not Understanding. In otherwords, Life, faced with a non-understanding thing, would feel itselfbalked, for Life, being Understanding, could not then become non-understanding without assuming the role of being omprehensible. Thusit is that the seeker after secrets is trapped into being a secret himself.Where one has an effect point which is an incomprehensiblething, and where one is occupying a cause point, in order to get anycommunication through to the effect point at all, it would be necessaryfor the one at cause point to somehow or another reduce hisunderstandingness down towards incomprehensibility. The salesmanknows this trick very well. He looks at his customer, recognizes hiscustomer is interested in golf, and pretends to be interested in golfhimself in order to have his customer listen to his sales-talk. Thesalesman establishes points of agreement and potential duplication,and then proceeds into a communication. Thus searchers after truthhave often walked only into labyrinths of untruth – secrets – and havethemselves become incomprehensible, with conclusions ofincomprehensibility. Thus we have the state of beingness of thephilosophical textbooks of Earth. A wonderful example of this isImmanuel Kant, the Great Chinaman of Koenigsburg, whose Germanparticipial phrases and adverbial clauses, and whose entire reversal ofopinion between his first and second books balks all our understandingas it has the understanding of philosophic students since the late"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!36L. RON HUBARDEighteenth Century. But the very fact that it is incomprehensible hasmade it endure, for Life feels challenged by this thing which, pretendingto be understanding, is yet an incomprehensibility. This is the graveinto which so many philosophers walk. This is the coffin into which themathematician, seeking by mathematics the secrets of the universe,eventually nails himself. But there is no reason why everyone shouldsuffer simply because he looks at a few secrets. The test here iswhether or not an individual possesses the power to Be at his owndeterminism. If one can determine himself to be incomprehensible atwill, he can of course, then, determine himself to be comprehensibleagain. But if he is obsessively, and without understanding, beingdetermined into incomprehensibility, then of course he is lost. Thus wediscover that the only trap into which Life could fall is to do thingswithout knowing it is doing them. Thus we get to a further delineationof the secret and we discover that the secret, or any secret, could existonly when Life determined to face it without knowing and withoutunderstanding that it had so determined this action. The very bestgrade secret, then, would be something which made Life also tend toforget that it was looking at a secret.One can always understand that his ability can increase, becausein the direction of an increase in ability is further understanding. Abilityis dependent entirely upon a greater and better understanding of thatfield or area in which one cares to be more able. When one attempts tounderstand inability he is of course looking at less comprehensibility,less understanding, and so does not then understand lessening abilityanywhere near as well as he understands increasing ability. In theabsence of understanding of ability we get a fear of loss of ability,which is simply the fear of an unknown, or a thought-to-be-unknowablething, for there is less knowness and less understanding in less ability.Because Life does not want to face things which are less Life-like,it has a tendency to resist and restrain itself from confronting the lesscomprehensible. It is the resistance alone which brings about thedwindling spiral, the descent into less ability. Life does not will thisdescent into less ability unless Life is cognizant of the principlesinvolved. Life exists itself into this less-ability. There is a primary ruleworking here: that which one fears, one becomes. When one refusesto duplicate something, and yet remains in its environment, his veryresistance to the thing he refuses to duplicate will cause him eventuallyto become possessed of so many energy pictures of that thing which"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!37L. RON HUBARDhe refuses to duplicate that he will, to have any mass at all, find himselfin possession of those energy pictures, and without actually noticingwhen it happened, is very likely to accept, at their level, those thingswhich he refused to duplicate earlier. Thus we get the riddle of theengram, the facsimile, if we understand, at the same time, that Lifedoes not necessarily find it bad to have masses of energy around, andis, indeed, unhappy unless it does have some energy. For if there is noenergy, then there is no game. Life has a motto: that any game isbetter than no game. And it has another motto: any havingness isbetter than no havingness. Thus we find individuals clutching to themthe most complex and destructive of facsimiles imaginable. They do notnecessarily want these complexities, and yet they want the energy orthe game which these complexities would seem to offer them.If you would make anyone well, you must then concentrate uponan increase of ability, an increase of understanding. The only reasonbad things come to Life is because understanding has impressedfurther life into them. When an individual faces some secret, the factthat he is facing it and injecting life into it alone causes the secret toactivate and have force in action. The only way a bad situation inexistence can continue to have life is by taking life from nearby sourcesof communication. The bad things of life, then, have life only to thatdegree that understanding is invested in them. We have an example inpoliomyelitis, which was at one time an extremely minor and unheard-ofillness. By various publications, by a great deal of advertising, by manyinvitations to combat this illness, it is made to take prominence andmanifest itself in this society. The only life, actually, which poliomyelitishas is the amount of life which can be invested in poliomyelitis. Yet,poliomyelitis, one thinks, would exist and continue its way if it wereignored. If one were to go on ignoring poliomyelitis, now that oneknows about poliomyelitis, yes, this would be the case. It indeed wouldcontinue to exist even though everyone was studiously ignoring it. As amatter of fact it would get worse. If, however, it were to be completelyunderstood, and if an ability on the part of individuals existed by whichthey could face it without having to resist it, then the matter would besolved.One wonders why all the nurses and doctors in contagious wardsdo not immediately pick up the illness, and here we have another factorwhich is the same factor as understanding, but couched in a differentway. People do not acquire obsessively those things which they do not"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!38L. RON HUBARDfear. An individual has to resist something, has to be afraid ofsomething, has to be afraid of the consequences of something before itcould have any adverse obsessive effect upon him. At any time he couldhave a self-determined duplication of it, but this, not being obsessive,not being against his will, would not produce any ill symptom beyondthe length of time he determined it.Part of understanding and ability is control. Of course, it is notnecessary to control everything everywhere if one totally understandsthem. However, in a lesser understanding of things, and of course inthe spirit of having a game, control becomes a necessary factor. Theanatomy of control is Start, Stop and Change, and this is fully asimportant to know as Understanding itself, and as the triangle whichcomposes Understanding, Affinity, Reality, and Communication.The doctors and nurses in a contagious ward have some degreeof control over the illnesses which they see before them. It is onlywhen they begin to recognize their inability to handle these ills or thesepatients that they, themselves, succumb to this. In view of the fact thatof recent centuries we have been very successful in handlingcontagious diseases, doctors and nurses, then, can walk with impunitythrough contagious wards.The fighters of disease, having some measure of control over thedisease, are then no longer afraid of the disease, and so it cannotaffect them. Of course, there would be a level of body understandingon this which might yet still mirror fear, but we would have the samestatement obtaining. People who are able to control something do notneed to be afraid of it, and do not suffer ill effects from it. People whocannot control things can receive bad effects from these things.Here we have an example of what might happen in the realm ofdisease. How about human aberration? We discover that thesanitariums of the world are all too often inhabited, in addition topatients, by these persons who were formerly at work in theseinstitutions. It is a rather shocking thing to discover in Ward Nine thenurse who was once supervisor of a mental hospital. Now here wehave a condition where there was no control or understanding. Peopledo not understand mental illness, aberration, insanity, neurosis. Thefirst actual effort along this line which cut down the tally was FreudianAnalysis, and yet this, requiring much too long, was not an effectiveweapon. These doctors and nurses in institutions who, then, are"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!39L. RON HUBARDthemselves patients in the same institutions knew definitely that theydid not have any real control over insanity. Thus, having no control overit, they became subject to it. They could not start, stop and changeinsanity. The franticness of this state is represented by the medievaltorture which has been utilized in such institutions as „cures.“ By„cured“ the people in such institutions merely meant „quieter.“ Thenatural course of existence would lead them to think in terms ofeuthanasia, and so they have – that it would be best to kill the patientrather than to have his insanity continue. And they have evenaccomplished this at the rate of two thousand mental patients a yeardead under electric shock machines. And they have accomplished it by avery high percentage dead under brain operations. The onlyeffectiveness of electric shock and brain operations would be to renderthe patient less alive and more dead, and the end-product we see somany times of death, which would be the only way to stop the insanity.These people, of course, could not envision the fact of immortality andthat the insanity would crop up as a problem in future generations.They had to conceive that if they killed the patient, or if they simplymade him much quieter, they had then triumphed to some degree. Inview of the fact that Man, sane or insane, is not to be destroyedaccording to law waives against this „solution.“With Dianetics, to use the study in a relatively narrow field ofapplication, we have assumed some control over insanity, neurosis,aberrations, and can actually start, stop and change aberration. In thefirst book, „Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,“ techniqueswere present which would place in view, and then vanquish them,almost any mental manifestation known in the field of insanity andaberration. Where an auditor was unable to do anything for the insaneor the neurotic, the fault (if fault there was) generally lay in the factthat the auditor was actually afraid. His fear was borne entirely out ofhis insecurity in starting, stopping and changing the condition.In modern instruction at Academies of Scientology, there is littleor no emphasis placed upon the case of the student, and yet when thestudent graduates he is discovered to be in a very high tone. Theentire concentration is upon giving the student the ability to handle anyand all types of case, and he becomes sufficiently secure in his ability –if he is graduated – to walk without any fear and considerable calmthrough any and all areas of human aberration. He has been given thetechnologies by which these misbehaviors of Life can be controlled. In"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!40L. RON HUBARDview of the fact that he can start, stop and change them he need nolonger fear them, and could with impunity work around the insane ifthis were his mission.The handling of psychosis, neurosis, and psychosomatic illness donot happen to be the mission of the auditor. Indeed, these things getwell only if they are more or less ignored. As long as the accent is uponability any malfunction will eventually vanish. The mission of the auditoris in the direction of ability. If he increases the general ability of thepreclear in any and all fields then, of course, any misability such asthose represented by psychosis, neurosis, and psychosomatic illnesswill vanish. The auditor, however, is not even covertly interested inthese manifestations. Around him he sees a world which could be farmore able. It is his business to make it so. While business, in general,does not recognize that there is anything wrong with its abilities, it canrecognize that its abilities can be better. One well-trained auditorworking with group processing in the United States Air Force couldtreble the number of pilots successfully graduated from a school, andcould reduce the crash toll of high-speed planes by fully three-quarters.This is not a wild statement. It is simply an application of the researchdata already to hand. The mission is greater ability, not an eradicationof inability.Just to give more understanding to those around him could besaid to be a sufficient mission for a well-trained auditor, for by doing sohe would certainly increase their ability. By increasing that ability hewould be able to increase their Life.The common denominator of all neurosis, psychosis, aberrationand psychosomatic ills is „can’t work.“ Any nation which has a highincidence of these is reduced in production, and is reduced in longevity.And what does he do about „how bad it is“? Well, if one dependsfor a long time upon others to do something about it, or depends uponforce, he will fail. From his viewpoint the only one who can put moreLife, more Understanding, more Tolerance and more Capability into theenvironment is himself, just by existing in a state of higherUnderstanding. Without even being active in the field of auditing, justby being more capable, an individual could resolve for those around himmany of their problems and difficulties.The accent is on ability."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!41L.

The onlyone that has to be obeyed if we wish to obtain results upon a preclearis The Auditor’s Code, 1954. In the first book, „Dianetics: The ModernScience of Mental Health,“ we had an Auditor’s Code which was derivedmore or less from an ideal rather than from practical experience. In theensuing years a great deal of auditing has been done and a greatmany errors have been made by auditors. And when we have takenthe common denominator of what has caused preclears to make smallor negative progress, we discover that these can be codified so as toinform the auditor who wishes to get results what to avoid in hisprocessing.When a psychoanalyst or psychologist uses Dianetics he is veryprone to be operating in his own frame of conduct. It is the conduct ofthe practitioner almost as much as the processes which makesDianetics work. In psychoanalysis, for instance, we discover that thebasic failure of Freud’s work in practice and as used by analysts failedchiefly because of two things done by the analyst in a consultationroom. Whatever the value of Freud’s libido theory, the effectivenesswas reduced by the analyst’s evaluation for the patient. The patient isnot allowed to work out his own problem, or to come to his ownconclusions. He is given ready-made interpretations. In psychologythere is no operating code, for clinical psychology is not much practicedand is, indeed, outlawed in many states. While psychiatry might have amodus operandi, none of those conversant with this handling of theinsane – the function of psychiatry – would call it a code intended toinduce a better state of beingness in a patient.In education, which is in itself a therapy, we discover an almosttotal absence of codified conduct beyond that laid down by schoolboards to regulate the social attitude of, and restrain possible cruelty ineducators. Although education is very widespread, and indeed is thepractice best accepted by this society for the betterment of individuals,it yet lacks any tightly agreed-upon method or conduct-codification forthe relaying of data to the student. Custom has dictated a certain"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!43L. RON HUBARDpoliteness on the part of the professor, or teacher. It is generallybelieved to be necessary to examine with rigor and thoroughness.Students are not supposed to whisper or chew gum, but education ingeneral has no code designed to oil the flow of data from the rostrumto the student bench. On the contrary, a great many students woulddeclare that any existing code was designed to stop any flowwhatever.Dianetics is in an interesting position in that it is itself, andalthough people may try to classify it with mental therapy, it is closer tothe level of education so far as the society itself is concerned. Its goalis the improvement of the mind on a self-determined basis, and itsintended use is upon individuals and groups. Because it is anaccumulation of data which is apparently the agreed-upon factors fromwhich existence is constructed, and although the simple perusal of thisdata very often frees an individual, it is also disseminated on anindividual and group basis directly to individuals and groups, and is aform of self-recognition.If you were to make the best progress along any highway youwould do well to follow the signs. In this Auditor’s Code of 1954 wehave a number of sign-posts, and if their directions are pursued amaximum of result will result. If they are not pursued, one is liable tofind the preclear over in the ditch in need of a tow-truck in the form of abetter auditor. Quite in addition to the command of the processesthemselves, the difference between the Book Auditor and theprofessional Auditor lies in the observance of this code. A very greatdeal of time is invested in the auditor at Academies of Scientology indemonstrating to him the effects of disobedience of this code andobedience of it, and in leading him to practice it closely. This supervisionin the Academies is relatively simple. One takes a look at the class andfinds somebody who is not in good shape. One discovers who auditedhim, and one then knows what auditor is not following the Auditor’sCode. The offending student is then taken aside and briefed oncemore. A graduating auditor has to know this code by heart, and moreimportantly has to be able to practice it with the same unconsciousease as a pilot flies a plane.THE AUDITOR’S CODE, 1954"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!44L.

RON HUBARDIn 12 we discover that the auditor should reduce everycommunication lag encountered by continued use of the same questionor process. Almost every case failure contains some of this. Thedifference between a professional Auditor and a Book Auditor is mostvisible in this and the other two provisos mentioned. A good auditorwould understand what aIn number 13: „Always continue a process as long as it produceschange, and no longer,“ we find the greatest frailty on the part ofauditors. An auditor who is not in good condition or who is not welltrained will „Q and A“ with the preclear. When the preclear starts tochange, the auditor will change the process. (By „Q and A“ we meanthat the answer to the question is the question, and we indicate aduplication.) Here we find an auditor possibly so much under thecommand of the preclear, rather than the reverse, that the auditorsimply duplicates obsessively what the preclear is doing. The preclearstarts to change, therefore the auditor changes. A process should berun as long as it produces change. If the preclear is changing that iswhat the auditor wants. If the auditor were to stop and change off tosome other process just because the preclear has shown somechange, we have discovered some very sick preclears. Additionally, an       17.

A bad auditor would believe, when he hadstruck a communication lag, that he had simply found a blindalley, and would hastily change to some other question."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!46L. RON HUBARDauditor is liable to continue a process long after it has stoppedproducing change. He and the preclear get into a sort of a marathon, amachine-motivated grind, on Opening Procedure by Duplication, whichprobably after ten hours produced no further alteration in the preclear.Yet this pair might go to 50 hours with the process and would be quitedisheartened to discover that for 40 hours nothing had happened. This,however, is much less harmful as an action than just changing aprocess simply because it is producing change.The maintenance of two-way communication is the most touchyactivity of auditing. An auditor being the auditor and concentratingupon control of the preclear, all too often forgets to listen when thepreclear speaks. Many an auditor is so intent upon the process thatwhen it produces a change which the preclear thinks he should adviseupon, the auditor ignores him. Ignoring the preclear at a time when hewishes to impart some vital information generally sends the precleardirectly into apathy. At the same time, an auditor should not permit thepreclear to keep on talking forever, as in the case of a lady recentlyreported who talked to the auditor for three days and three nights. Thetherapeutic value of this was zero, for the auditor was listening to amachine, not to a preclear. One should understand rather thoroughlythe difference between an obsessive, or compulsive communication lineand an actual communication. Listening to circuits* of course validatescircuits. The auditor should pay attention to the rational, the usual, theagreed-upon, and should leave very much alone the bizarre, the freaky,the compulsive and the obsessive manifestations of the preclear. Themaintenance of two-way communication is actually a process in itself,and is the first and most basic process of Dianetics, and continues onthrough all the remaining processes.Simply because we have pin-pointed three of these there is noreason to ignore the others. Every time there has been a „psychoticbreak“ by reason of or during auditing, it has occurred when thepreclear was improperly fed, when the preclear had had a frequentchange of auditors, and when the two-way communication had notbeen maintained. The effort on the part of the preclear to impart a vitalchange to the auditor was ignored. All these „psychotic breaks“ wererepaired, but because these factors were present the patching up wasrather difficult. Audit them early, audit them bright, listen to what theyhave to say about what’s happening, make sure they are eating"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!47L. RON HUBARDregularly, and change auditors on a preclear as seldom as possible,and no „psychotic breaks“ will occur.If you are simply investigating Dianetics to discover whether ornot it is workable, you should be aware of the fact that the Auditor’sCode, following of, is an essential function of Dianetics. Dianeticsfunctions very poorly in the absence of the Auditor’s Code. It is part ofthe process, not simply a polite way to go about handling people. Thus,if Dianetics is tested in the absence of The Auditor’s Code, do notpretend that it has been tested at all.Another phrase might have been added to this code, but it wouldbe more germane to living than to auditing, and that phrase would be:„Maintain silence around unconscious or semi-conscious people.“ Thereason for this is contained in „Dianetics: The Modern Science of MentalHealth“ and in preventive Dianetics. Such statements become„engramic.“ The addition of this to the Auditor’s Code, however, is notpractical, as an auditor often finds himself talking to a „groggy“preclear. Because the auditor is reducing every communication lag heencounters by a repetition of the question, the asking of a question orgiving of a command to a semi-conscious preclear is thus renderedrelatively unaberrative, for sooner or later the question imbedded inthe unconsciousness will work loose and the communication lag will notflatten until this occurs. Thus, simply the reduction of the communicationlag in itself eradicates such phrases. Thus, this is not part of theAuditor’s Code. However, when we encounter unconsciousness orsemi-consciousness, as in moments immediately after the injury of achild, a street accident, an operation, we maintain silence when we arenot auditing a person. Mothers and fathers would spare themselves agreat deal of later mental unrest on a child’s part if they knew andwould follow this injunction, and in many other ways it is a veryimportant one. A man can be killed by too much conversation aroundhim while he is injured. No matter how deeply unconscious he mayappear to be, something is always registering. The questioning by thepolice at the scene of an accident, where the person being questionedis in a state of shock, or where other accident victims are present, isprobably the most aberrative conduct in this society. The questioningby police is quite restimulative in any event, and many severecomplications after accidents have been traced immediately to thisactivity on the part of the police. It might be very important for someledger somewhere to know exactly who caused this. It is more"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!48L. RON HUBARDimportant that the people involved in it live and be happy afterward. Itis not that we do not like police. This is not the case. We simply believethat the police should be civilized, too.Simply memorizing this code is not enough. Memorizing it in orderto practice it is indicated, but it is the practice of this code which isimportant. Observance of it is the hallmark of a good auditor, and itsignalizes the recovery of the case.If an auditor is going to raise the ability of the preclear, his abilityin the field of auditing must be considerable. That ability begins withthe understanding and observance of the Auditor’s Code, 1954,Amended."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!49L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER VITRAPPEDIn Greece, Rome, England, Colonial America, France andWashington, a great deal of conversation is made on the subject ofFreedom. Freedom, apparently, is something that is very desirable.Indeed, Freedom is seen to be the goal of a nation or a people.Similarly, if we are restoring ability to the preclear we must restoreFreedom. If we do not restore Freedom we cannot restore ability. Themuscle-bound wrestler, the tense driver, the rocket jockey with afrozen reaction time alike are not able. Their ability lies in an increase ofFreedom, a release of tension, and a better communication to theirenvironment.The main trouble with Freedom is that it does not have ananatomy. Something that is free is free. It is not free with wires, vias,by-passes, or dams, it is simply free. There is something else aboutFreedom which is intensely interesting, it cannot be erased. In„Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health“ we learned thatpleasure moments were not erasable. The only thing that was erasablewas pain, discomfort, distortion, tenseness, agony, unconsciousness.In more modern Scientological parlance, Freedom cannot be „as-ised,“it is something which is imperishable. You may be able to concentratesomebody’s attention on something that is not free and thus bring himinto a state of belief that Freedom does not exist, but this does notmean that you have erased the individual’s freedom. You have not. Allthe freedom he ever had is still there. Furthermore Freedom has noquantity, and by definition it has no location in space or time. Thus wesee the awareness of awareness unit as potentially the freest thingthere could be. Thus man concentrates on Freedom.But if Freedom has no anatomy, then please explain how one isgoing to attain to something which cannot be fully explained. If anyonetalks about a „road to Freedom“ he is talking about a linear line. This,then, must have boundaries. If there are boundaries there is nofreedom. This brings the interesting proposition to mind that the verybest process, by theory, would be to have an individual assume himselfto be free, and then he would simply be asked to assume himself to be"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!50L. RON HUBARDfree again. Indeed, upon many cases of a high toned variety this is aquite workable process. An individual is „sick,“ he is usually in verygood tone, the auditor simply asks him to assume that he is free, andhe will cease to be „sick.“ The magic, however, is limited to thosepeople who have some concept of what „free“ means. Talk to a personwho works from eight o’clock until five with no goals, and no future, andno belief in the organization and its goals, who is being required bytime-payments, rent, and other barriers of an economic variety toinvest all of his salary as soon as it is paid, and we have an individualwho has lost the notion of Freedom. His concentration is so thoroughlyfixed upon barriers that Freedom has to be in terms of less barriers.Thus, in processing we have to audit in the direction of less and lessbarriers in order to attain Freedom.If Freedom is so very compelling and is so useful, and is in itselfsomething like a synonym for ability – even if not entirely – then it isour task to understand a little more about Freedom as itself in order toaccomplish its attainment, for unfortunately it is not enough for the bulkof the human race simply to say „be free“ and have an individualrecover.Life is prone to a stupidity in many cases in which it is notcognizant of a disaster until the disaster has occurred. The middle-western farmer had a phrase for it: „Lock the door after the horse isstolen.“ It takes a disaster in order to educate people into theexistence of such a disaster. This is education by pain, by impact, bypunishment. Therefore, a population which is faced with a one-shotdisaster which will obliterate the sphere would not have a chance tolearn very much about the sphere before it was obliterated. Thus, ifthey insisted upon learning by experience in order to prevent such adisaster, they would never have the opportunity. If no atomic bomb ofany kind had been dropped in World War II it is probable there wouldbe no slightest concern about atomic fission, although atomic fissionmight have developed right on up to the planet-buster without everbeing used against Man, and then the planet-buster being used onEarth and so destroying it.If a person did not know what a tiger was, and we desired todemonstrate to him that no tigers were present, we would have adifficult time of it. Here we have a freedom from tigers without knowinganything about tigers. Before he could understand an absence of tigers"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!51L. RON HUBARDhe would have to understand the presence of tigers. This is theprocess of learning we know as „by experience.“In order to know anything, if we are going to use educationalmethods, it is necessary then to know, as well, its opposite. Theopposite of tigers probably exists in Malayan jungles where tigers areso frequent that the absence of tigers would be a novelty, indeed. Acountry which was totally burdened by tigers might not understand atall the idea that there were no tigers. In some parts of the world agreat deal of argument would have been entered into with thepopulace of a tiger-burdened area to get them to get any inkling ofwhat an absence of tigers would be. Many cases in processing havesuddenly lost a somatic,* to discover themselves in a new and novelstate. This somatic was so routine and so constant and so pervasivethat they could not intellectually conceive of what life would be likewithout that particular somatic.The understanding of Freedom, then, is slightly complex if, then,individuals who do not have it are not likely to understand it, and thuswe have an individual who knows nothing about exteriorization andknows everything about being in constant contact with the sensationsof a body failing to grasp the idea of the freedom resulting fromexteriorization. These people do not even believe that exteriorizationcan exist, and so combat it. They are so little experienced on thesubject of Freedom that this type of Freedom is „known to be non-existent“ to them.The way to demonstrate the existence of Freedom is to invite theindividual to experience Freedom, but if he does not know whatFreedom is, then he will not exteriorize. We have to hit some sort ofgradient scale on the matter, or make him turn around and looksquarely at the opposite of Freedom.But the opposite of Freedom is slavery and everybody knowsthis – or is it? I do not think these two things are a dichotomy. Freedomis not the plus of a condition where slavery is the minus unless we aredealing entirely with the political organism. Where we are dealing withthe individual better terminology is necessary and more understandingof the anatomy of minus-Freedom is required.Minus-Freedom is entrapment. Freedom is the absence ofbarriers. Less Freedom is the presence of barriers. Entirely minus-Freedom would be the omnipresence of barriers. A barrier is matter or"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!52L. RON HUBARDenergy or time or space. The more matter, energy, time or spaceassumes command over the individual the less Freedom that individualhas. This is best understood as entrapment since slavery connotes anintention, and entrapment might be considered almost withoutintention. A person who falls in a bear-pit might not have intended tofall into it at all, and a bear-pit might not have intended a person to fallupon its stake. Nevertheless, an entrapment has occurred. The personis in the bear-pit.If one wants to understand existence and his unhappiness withit, he must understand entrapment and its mechanisms.In what can a person become entrapped? Basically and foremost,he can become entrapped in ideas. In view of the fact that freedom andability can be seen to be somewhat synonymous, then ideas ofdisability are first and foremost an entrapment. I dare say thatamongst men the incident has occurred that a person has been sittingupon a bare plain in the total belief that he is entirely entrapped by afence. There is that incident mentioned in „Self-Analysis“ of fishing inLake Tanganyika where the sun’s rays, being equatorial, pierceburningly to the lake’s bottom. The natives there fish by tying a numberof slats of wood on a long piece of line. They take either end of this lineand put it in canoes, and then paddle the two canoes to shore, theslatted line stretching between. The sun shining downward presses theshadows of these bars down to the bottom of the lake and thus a cageof shadows moves inward towards the shallows. The fish, seeing thiscage contract upon them, which is composed of nothing but theabsence of light, flounder frantically into the shallows where theycannot swim and are thus caught, picked up in baskets and cooked.There is nothing to be afraid of but shadows.When we move out of mechanics man finds himself on unsureground. The idea that ideas could be so strong and pervasive is foreignto most men. For instance, a government attacked by the Communistsdoes not perceive that it is being attacked only by ideas. It believesitself to be attacked by guns, bombs, armies and yet it sees no guns,bombs, armies. It sees only men standing together exchanging ideas.Whether or not these ideas are sound or not is beside the point, theyare at least penetrative. No 16-inch armor plate could possibly stop anidea. Thus a country can be entrapped, taken and turned towardsCommunism simply by the spread of the Communistic idea. A country"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!53L. RON HUBARDthat fails to understand this arms itself, keeps its guns cocked, itsarmies alert, and then succumbs at last to the idea now entered intothe heads of the armed forces, which it so hopefully employed. Thecollapse of Germany in World War I was an instance of this. Its armies,its grand fleet were all flying the red flag. Although Allied pressure andthe conditions of starvation in Germany had much to do with its defeat,nevertheless, it was keyed into being by the Communist idea infiltratedinto the minds of the men who originally were armed and trained toprotect Germany. And Communism, just as an idea, traps the minds ofmen. They find themselves organized into cells, they find their customsabandoned and are regimented by a militant biological, soullesstyranny, their master. Here is an idea becoming a sort of trap.So, first and foremost, we have the idea. Then, themselves theproduct of ideas, we have the more obvious mechanics of entrapmentin matter, energy, space and time.The most common barrier which man recognizes as such would bea wall. This is so obviously a barrier that individuals quite commonlysuppose all barriers to be composed of solid walls. However, almostany object can be made into a barrier. A less common use of an objectas a barrier would be one which inhibited, by some sort of suction ordrag, a departure from it. A solid lump of considerable magneticproperties will hold to it a piece of steel. Gravity is, then, a barrier of akind. It holds the people or life units of Earth to Earth.Another barrier would be energy. A sheet of energy or somethingcarrying energy, such as an electrical fence, can prove to be aformidable barrier. A cloud of radioactive particles obstructing passageinto another space could also be a barrier. Tractor-type beams, as inthe case of gravity, could be seen to be a barrier of sorts, but in theform of energy.Yet another barrier, easily understood, is that of space. Too muchspace will always make a barrier. Space debars an individual fromprogressing into another part of the galaxy. One of the finest prisonsone could imagine would be one located on a small piece of mattersurrounded by such a quantity of space that no-one could cross it.Space is such an efficient barrier that people in the Southwest of theUnited States, committing crimes, discover their way everywhereblocked by the giganticness of space. In New York City it would be veryeasy for them, after the commission of a crime, to vanish, but in"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!54L. RON HUBARDattempting to cross a space of such size as the Southwest theybecome exposed everywhere to view, there being nothing else uponwhich the police can fix their attention.Quite another barrier, less well understood, but extremelythorough as a barrier, is time. Time debars your passage into the year1776 and prevents your repossession of things which you had in youryouth. It also prevents you from having things in the future. Time is anexceedingly effective barrier. The absence of time can also be a barrier,for here an individual is unable to execute his desires and is soconstricted by the pressure of time itself.Matter, energy, space and time can all, then, be barriers. Anawareness of awareness unit, however, which is the personality andbeingness unit of the person, and which is composed of quality, notquantity, can be anywhere it wishes to be. There is no wall thickenough, nor any space wide enough, to debar the reappearance atsome other point of an awareness of awareness unit. In that this is theindividual, and not some ghost of the individual, and as the individual ishimself an awareness of awareness unit and not his machinery and hisbody, we see that as soon as one understands completely that he isan awareness of awareness unit, he no longer is restricted by barriers.And thus those who would seek entrapment for individuals are entirelyantipathetic towards the idea of exteriorization, and the person whoknows nothing but barriers is apt to believe that a condition of no-barriers could not exist. Yet a condition of no-barriers can exist, andthis is itself Freedom.Examining Freedom, then, we have to examine why people do notattain it easily or understand it. They do not attain Freedom becausetheir attention is fixed upon barriers. They look at the wall, not thespace on either side of the wall. They have entities and demon-circuits*which demand their attention, and, indeed, the body itself could be considered to be an attention-demanding organism. One might believethat its total function was to command interest and attention. It is sointeresting that people do not conceive that behind them lies all theFreedom anybody ever desired. They even go so far as to believe thatfreedom is not desirable and that if they could attain it they would notwant it. One is reminded of prisoners who occasionally go so sufficiently„stir-crazy“ as to demand after their release from prison confining wallsand restricted spaces. Manuel Komroff once wrote a very appealing"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!55L. RON HUBARDstory on this subject, the story of an old man who had served twenty-five years in prison, or some such time, and who on his release askedfor nothing more than the smallest room in his son’s house and washappiest when he could see someone on an opposite roof who had theappearance of a guard, and who actively put bars back on his window.One could consider that a person who has been for a long time in thebody could have such a fixation upon the barriers imposed by the body,that once an auditor tries to remove them the preclear puts them backquickly. You might say that such a person is „stir-crazy,“ yet thecondition is remediable.The anatomy of entrapment is an interesting one, and the reasonwhy people get entrapped, and, indeed, the total mechanics ofentrapment are now understood. In Scientology a great deal ofexperimentation was undertaken to determine the factors whichresulted in entrapment, and it was discovered that the answer to theentire problem was two-way communication.Roughly, the laws back of this are: Fixation occurs only in thepresence of one-way communication. Entrapment occurs only when onehas not given or received answers to the things entrapping him. Thuswe see the ARC Triangle itself, and most importantly theCommunication factor of that triangle, looming up to give us Freedom.It could be said that all the entrapment there is is the waiting onedoes for an answer.Here we find Man. Basically he is an awareness of awareness unitwhich is capable of, and active in, the production of matter, energy,space and time as well as ideas. We discover that he is more or lessfixated upon ideas, matter, energy, space and time and the processesand functions involving these. And we discover that these, being theproducts of the awareness of awareness unit, do not supply answersto the awareness of awareness unit, and thus the awareness ofawareness unit supplies itself those answers.Entrapment is the opposite of Freedom. A person who is not freeis trapped. He may be trapped by an idea, he may be trapped bymatter, he may be trapped by energy, he may be trapped by space, hemay be trapped by time, he may be trapped by all of them. The morethoroughly a preclear is trapped the less free he is. He cannot change,he cannot move, he cannot communicate, he cannot feel affinity and"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!56L. RON HUBARDreality. Death itself could be said to be Man’s ultimate in entrapment,for when a man is totally entrapped he is dead.It is our task in investigation and auditing to discover for theindividual and the group a greater freedom, which is the roadway to agreater ability.The processes the auditor uses today are designed entirely tosecure greater freedom for the individual, for the group, for Mankind.Any process which leads to a greater freedom for all Dynamics is a goodprocess. It should be remembered, however, that an individualfunctions on all Dynamics, and that suppression by an individual of theThird or Fourth Dynamic leads to less Freedom for the individual,himself. Thus, the criminal, in becoming immorally free, harms the groupand harms Mankind, and thus becomes less free himself. Thus there isno Freedom in the absence of Affinity, Agreement, and Communication.Where an individual falls away from these his freedom is sharplycurtailed and he finds himself confronted with barriers of magnitude.The component parts of Freedom, as we first gaze upon it, arethen: Affinity, Reality, and Communication, which summate intoUnderstanding. Once Understanding is attained, Freedom is obtained.For the individual who is thoroughly snarled in the mechanics ofentrapment, it is necessary to restore to him sufficient communicationto permit his ascendance into a higher state of understanding. Oncethis has been accomplished his entrapment is ended.None of this is actually a very difficult problem. In the auditingdone today this is very simple, but where the auditing is being done bya person who does not basically desire the freedom of the individual afurther entrapment is more likely to ensue than further freedom. Theobsessively entrapped are then enemies of the preclear, for they willtrap others.A greater freedom can be attained by the individual. Theindividual does desire a greater freedom, once he has some inkling ofit. And auditing according to the precision rules and codes of Dianeticsand Scientology steers the individual out of the first areas ofentrapment to a point where he can gain higher levels of Freedom,either by further auditing or by himself. The only reason we need aregimen with which to begin is to start an individual out of a mirror-maze of such complexity that he himself, in attempting to wend hisway, only gets lost."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!57L. RON HUBARDThis is Dianetics 55!"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!58L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER VIICOMMUNICATIONCommunication is so thoroughly important today in Dianetics andScientology, as it always has been on the whole track, that it could besaid that if you would get a preclear into communication you would gethim well. This factor is not new in psychotherapy, but concentrationupon it is new, and interpretation of ability as communication is entirelynew.If you were to be in thorough and complete communication with acar on a road, you would certainly have no difficulty driving that car. Butif you were in only partial communication with the car and in nocommunication with the road, it is fairly certain that an accident wouldoccur. Most accidents do occur when the driver is distracted by anargument he has had, or by an arrest, or by a cross alongside of theroad that says where some motorists got killed, or by his own fears ofaccidents.When we say that somebody should be in present time we meanhe should be in communication with his environment. We mean, further,that he should be in communication with his environment as it exists,not as it existed. And when we speak of prediction we mean that heshould be in communication with his environment as it will exist, as wellas as it exists.If communication is so important, what is communication? It isbest expressed as its formula, which has been isolated, and by use ofwhich a great many interesting results can be brought about in abilitychanges.There are two kinds of communication, both depending upon theviewpoint assumed. There is outflowing communication and inflowingcommunication. A person who is talking to somebody else iscommunicating to that person (we trust), and the person being talkedto is receiving communication from that person. Now, as theconversation changes, we find that the person who has been talked tois now doing the talking, and is talking to the first person, who is nowreceiving communication from him."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!59L. RON HUBARDA conversation is the process of alternating outflowing andinflowing communication, and right here exists the oddity which makesaberration and entrapment. There is a basic rule here: He who wouldoutflow must inflow – he who would inflow must outflow. When we findthis rule overbalanced in either direction we discover difficulty. A personwho is only outflowing communication is actually not communicating atall in the fullest sense of the word, for in order to communicate entirelyhe would have to inflow as well as outflow. A person who is inflowingcommunication entirely is again out of order, for if he would inflow hemust then outflow. Any and all objections anyone has to social andhuman relationships is to be found basically in this rule ofcommunication, where it is disobeyed. Anyone who is talking, if he isnot in a compulsive or obsessive state of beingness, is dismayed whenhe does not get answers. Similarly, anyone who is being talked to isdismayed when he is not given an opportunity to give his reply.Even hypnotism can be understood by this rule of communication.Hypnotism is a continuing inflow without an opportunity on the part ofthe subject to outflow. This is carried on to such a degree in hypnotismthat the individual is actually trapped in the spot where he is beinghypnotized, and will remain trapped in that spot to some degree fromthere on. Thus, one might go so far as to say that a bullet’s arrival is aheavy sort of hypnotism. The individual receiving a bullet does notoutflow a bullet, and thus he is injured. If he could outflow a bulletimmediately after receiving a bullet, we could introduce the interestingquestion, „Would he be wounded?“ According to our rules he would notbe. Indeed, if he were in perfect communication with his environmenthe could not even receive a bullet injuriously, but let us look at thisfrom a highly practical viewpoint.As we look at two life units in communication we can label one ofthem „a“ and the other one of them „b.“ In a good state ofcommunication „a“ would outflow and „b“ would receive, then „b“would outflow and „a“ would receive. Then „a“ would outflow and „b“would receive. In each case both „a“ and „b“ would know that thecommunication was being received and would know what and wherewas the source of the communication.All right, we have „a“ and „b“ facing each other in acommunication. „A“ outflows. His message goes across a distance to„b“ who inflows. In this phase of the communication „a“ is Cause, „b“ is"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!60L. RON HUBARDEffect, and the intervening space we term the Distance. It isnoteworthy that „a“ and „b“ are both life units. A true communication isbetween two life units, it is not between two objects, or from oneobject to one life unit: „a,“ a life unit, is Cause, the intervening space isDistance, „b,“ a life unit, is Effect. Now a completion of thiscommunication changes the roles. Replied to, „a“ is now the Effect, and„b“ is the Cause. Thus we have a cycle which completes a truecommunication. The cycle is Cause, Distance, Effect, with Effect thenbecoming Cause and communicating across a Distance to the originalsource, which is now Effect, and this we call a two-way communication.As we examine this further we find out that there are otherfactors involved. There is „a’s“ intention. This, at „b“ becomesattention, and for a true communication to take place, a duplication at„b“ must take place of what emanated from „a.“ „A“ of course, toemanate a communication, must have given attention to „b,“ and „b“must have given to this communication some intention, at least to listenor receive, so we have both Cause and Effect having intention andattention.Now there is another factor which is very important. This is thefactor of duplication. We could express this as Reality, or we couldexpress it as Agreement. The degree of Agreement reached between„a“ and „b“ in this communication cycle becomes their Reality, and thisis accomplished mechanically by Duplication. In other words, the degreeof Reality reached in this communication cycle depends upon theamount of duplication. „B,“ as Effect, must to some degree duplicatewhat emanated from „a,“ now as Effect, in order for the first part of thecycle to take effect, and then „a,“ now as Effect, must duplicate whatemanated from „b“ for the communication to be concluded. If this isdone there is no aberrative consequence. If this duplication does nottake place at „b“ and then at „a“ we get what amounts to anunfinished cycle of action. If, for instance, „b“ did not vaguely duplicatewhat emanated from „a“ the first part of the cycle of communicationwas not achieved, and a great deal of randomity, argument,explanation, might result. Then if „a“ did not duplicate what emanatedfrom „b“ when „b“ was cause on the second cycle, again anuncompleted cycle of communication occurred with consequentunreality. Now naturally, if we cut down Reality, we will cut downAffinity, so where duplication is absent Affinity is seen to drop. Acomplete cycle of communication will result in high Affinity and will, in"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!61L. RON HUBARDeffect, erase itself. If we disarrange any of these factors we get anincomplete cycle on communication and we have either „a“ or „b“ orboth waiting for the end of cycle. In such a wise the communicationbecomes aberrative.The word „aberrate“ means to make something diverge from astraight line. The word comes basically from optics. Aberration is simplysomething which does not contain straight lines. A confusion is abundle of crooked lines. A mass is no more and no less than aconfusion of mis-managed communication. The energy masses anddeposits, the facsimiles and engrams surrounding the preclear are nomore and no less than unfinished cycles of communication which yetwait for their proper answer at „a“ and „b.“An unfinished cycle of communication generates what might becalled „answer hunger.“ An individual who is waiting for a signal thathis communication has been received is prone to accept any inflow.When an individual has, for a very long period of time, consistentlywaited for answers which did not arrive, any sort of answer fromanywhere will be pulled in to him, by him, as an effort to remedy hisscarcity of answers. Thus he will throw engramic phrases in the bankinto action and operation against himself.Uncompleted cycles of communication bring about a scarcity ofanswers. It does not much matter what the answers were or would beas long as they vaguely approximate the subject at hand. It doesmatter when some entirely unlooked for answer is given, as incompulsive or obsessive communication, or when no answer is given atall.Communication itself is aberrative only when the emanatingcommunication at Cause was sudden and nonsequitur to theenvironment. Here we have violation of attention and intention.The factor of interest also enters here but is far less important, atleast from the standpoint of the auditor. Nevertheless it explains agreat deal about human behavior, and explains considerable aboutcircuits. „A“ has the intention of interesting „b.“ „B,“ to be talked to,becomes interesting. Similarly „b,“ when he emanates a communication,is interested and „a“ is interesting. Here we have, as pad of thecommunication formula (but as I said, a less important pad) acontinuous shift from being interested to being interesting on the part"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!62L. RON HUBARDof either of the terminals, „a“ or „b.“ Cause is interested, Effect isinteresting.Of some greater importance is the fact that the intention to bereceived, on the part of „a“ places upon „a“ the necessity of beingduplicatable. If „a“ cannot be duplicatable in any degree, then, ofcourse, his communication will not be received at „b,“ for „b,“ unable toduplicate „a,“ cannot receive the communication. As an example of this,„a,“ let us say, speaks in Chinese, where „b“ can understand onlyFrench. It is necessary for „a“ to make himself duplicatable by speakingFrench to „b“ who only understands French. In a case where „a“speaks one language, and „b“ another, and they have no language incommon, we have the factor of mimicry possible and a communicationcan yet take place. „A,“ supposing he has a hand, could raise his hand.„B,“ supposing he had one, could raise his hand. Then „b“ could raisehis other hand, and „a“ could raise his other hand, and we would havecompleted a cycle of communication by mimicry. Communication bymimicry could also be called communication in terms of mass.We see that Reality is the degree of duplication between Causeand Effect. Affinity is monitored by intention and the particle sizesinvolved, as well as the distance. The greatest Affinity there is foranything is to occupy its same space. As the distance widens Affinitydrops. Further, as the amount of mass or energy particles increases, soagain does Affinity drop. Further, as the velocity departs from what „a“and „b“ have considered optimum velocity – either greater or lesservelocity than what they consider to be the proper velocity – Affinitydrops.There is another fine point about communication, and that isexpectancy.Basically, all things are considerations. We consider that thingsare, and so they are. The idea is always senior to the mechanics ofenergy, space, time, mass. It would be possible to have entirelydifferent ideas about communication than these. However, thesehappen to be the ideas of communication which are in common in thisuniverse, and which are utilized by the life units of this universe. Herewe have the basic agreement upon the subject of communication in thecommunication formula as given here. Because ideas are senior to this,a thetan can get, in addition to the communication formula, a peculiaridea concerning just exactly how communication should be conducted,"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!63L. RON HUBARDand if this is not generally agreed upon, can find himself definitely outof communication. Let us take the example of a modernistic writer whoinsists that the first three letters of every word should be dropped, orthat no sentence should be finished, or that the description ofcharacters should be held to a cubist rendition. He will not attainagreement amongst his readers and so will become to some degree an„only one.“ There is a continuous action of natural selection, one mightsay, which weeds out strange or peculiar communication ideas. People,to be in communication, adhere to the basic rules as given here, andwhen anyone tries to depart too widely from these rules, they simplydo not duplicate him and so, in effect, he goes out of communication.We have seen an entire race of philosophers go out of existencesince 1790. We have seen philosophy become a very unimportantsubject, where once it was a very common coin amongst the people.The philosophers themselves put themselves out of communication withthe people by insisting upon using words of special definitions whichcould not be assimilated with readiness by persons in general. Thecurrency of philosophy could not be duplicated readily by those withrelatively limited vocabularies. Take such jaw-cracking words as„telekinesis.“ While it probably means something very interesting andvery vital, if you will think back carefully no taxi-driver mentioned thisword to you while you were paying your fare, or even during the moreverbose moments of the ride. Probably the basic trouble withphilosophy was that it became Germanic in its grammar, an example setby Immanuel Kant. And if you will recall that wonderful story by Saki, aman was once trampled to death while trying to teach an elephantGerman irregular verbs. Philosophy shed some of its responsibility for acycle of communication by rendering itself unduplicatable by its readers.It is the responsibility of anyone who would communicate that he speakwith such vocabulary as can be understood. Thus philosophy could noteven begin for some hundred and fifty years a sound cycle ofcommunication, and thus is dead.Now let us take up the individual who has become very„experienced“ in life. This individual has a time-track in particular. Thistime-track is his own time-track, it isn’t anyone else’s time-track. Thebasic individualities amongst men are based upon the fact that theyhave different things happen to them and that they view thesedifferent things from different points of view. Thus we haveindividualization and we have individual opinion, consideration and"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!64L. RON HUBARDexperience. Two men walking down the street witness an accident.Each one of them sees the accident from at least a slightly differentpoint of view. Consulting twelve different witnesses to the sameaccident, we are likely to find twelve different accidents. Completelyaside from the fact that witnesses like to tell you what they think theysaw instead of what they saw, there were actually twelve differentpoints from which the accident was viewed, and so twelve differentaspects of the occurrences. If these twelve were brought together, andif they were to communicate amongst themselves about this accident,they would then reach a point of agreement on what actuallyhappened. This might not have been the accident, but it certainly is theagreed-upon accident, which then becomes the real accident. This isthe way juries conduct themselves. They might or might not be passingupon the real crime, but they are certainly passing upon the agreed-upon crime.In any war it takes two or three days for enough agreement tooccur to know what took place in a battle. Whereas there might havebeen a real battle, a real sequence of incidents and occurrences, thefact that every man in the battle saw the battle from his own particularpoint of view, by which we mean severely „point from which he waslooking,“ rather than his opinions – no one saw the battle in itsentirety. Thus, time must intervene for enough communication on thesubject of the battle to take place so that all have some semblance ofagreement on what occurred. Of course, when the historians get to thisbattle and start writing different accounts of it, out of the memoirs ofgenerals who were trying to explain away their defeats, we get ahighly distorted account indeed. And yet this becomes the agreed-uponbattle, as far as history is concerned. Reading the historians onerealizes that one will never really know what took place at Waterloo, atBennington, at Marathon. In that we can consider as a communicationone soldier shooting at another soldier, we see that we are studyingcommunications about communication. This scholarly activity is all verynice, but does not carry us very far towards the resolution of humanproblems.We have seen these two words „Cause“ and „Effect“ playing aprominent role in the communication formula. We have seen that FirstCause became at the end of the cycle Last Effect. Furthermore, at theintermediate point, First Effect immediately changed to Cause in orderto have a good communication cycle. What, then, do we mean by"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!65L. RON HUBARD„Cause“? Cause is simply the point of emanation of the communication.What is „Effect“? Effect is the receipt point of the communication. Inthat we are only interested in life units, we see that we can readilyascertain cause at any time. We are not interested in secondary ortertiary Cause. We are not interested in assisting causes in any way.We are not interested in secondary or tertiary effects. We are notinterested in assisting effects in any way. We consider any time thatwe look at a source point of a communication that we are looking atCause. In that the entire track is composed of this pattern of Causeand Effect, an individual is very prone, whenever he sees a possiblecause point, to look for an earlier cause point, and then an earlier one,and an earlier one, and an earlier one, and after a while takes toreading the Bible, which is very hard on the eyesight.In view of the fact that all Cause is simply elected cause, and allEffect is simply elected effect, and that the primary echelon is the idealevel of communication, that is Cause which we elect to be Cause, thatis Effect which elects to be Effect, and there is no more that can be saidabout it. Cause in our dictionary here means only „source point.“ Effectmeans only „receipt point.“We notice that the receipt point, midway in the cycle ofcommunication, shifts and becomes source point. We could classify thisshift in the center of the cycle of communication in some other fashion,but it is not necessary to do so. We would be getting too complicatedfor our purposes.Now we come to the problem of what a life unit must be willing toexperience in order to communicate. In the first place the primary causepoint must be willing to be duplicatable. It must be able to give at leastsome attention to the receipt point. The primary receipt point must bewilling to duplicate, must be willing to receive, and must be willing tochange into a source point in order to send the communication, or ananswer to it, back. And the primary source point in its turn must bewilling to be a receipt point. As we are dealing basically with ideas andnot mechanics, we see then that a state of mind must exist between acause and effect point whereby each one is willing to be Cause orEffect at will, and is willing to duplicate at will, is willing to beduplicatable at will, is willing to change at will, is willing to experiencethe distance between, and, in short, willing to communicate. Where weget these conditions in an individual or a group we have sane people."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!66L. RON HUBARDWhere an unwillingness to send or receive communications occurs,where people obsessively or compulsively send communicationswithout direction and without trying to be duplicatable, whereindividuals in receipt of communications stand silent and do notacknowledge or reply, we have aberrative factors. And it is veryinteresting to note from the standpoint of processing, that we have allthe aberrative factors there are. We do not need to know anythingfurther about aberration than that it is a disarrangement of the cycle ofcommunication. But to know that, of course, we have to know thecomponent parts of communication and the expected behavior.Some of the conditions which can occur in an aberrated line are afailure to be duplicatable before one emanates a communication, anintention contrary to being received, an unwillingness to receive orduplicate a communication, an unwillingness to experience distance, anunwillingness to change, an unwillingness to give attention, anunwillingness to express intention, an unwillingness to acknowledge,and, in general, an unwillingness to duplicate. We might go so far as tosay that the reason communication takes place instead of occupyingthe same space and knowing – the communication introduces the ideaof distance – is that one is unwilling to BE to the degree necessary tobe anything. One would rather communicate than be. Thus we find thatthe inability to communicate is a gradient scale – it goes down alongwith the inability to be. We get individuals winding up as only willing tobe themselves, whatever that is, and thus becoming „the only one.“ Tothe degree that a person becomes „the only one“ he is unwilling tocommunicate on the remaining dynamics. An individual who has becomeonly himself is in the sad and sorry plight of being off the Second, Third,and Fourth Dynamics, at least.It might be seen by someone that the solution to communicationis not communicating. One might say that if he hadn’t communicated inthe first place he wouldn’t be in trouble now. Perhaps there is sometruth in this, but there is more truth in the fact that processing in thedirection of making communication unnecessary, or reducingcommunication, is not processing at all, but murder. A man is as deadas he can’t communicate. He is as alive as he can communicate.

RON HUBARDremedy for livingness is further communicatingness. One must add tohis ability to communicate.Probably the only major error which exists in Eastern Philosophy,and probably the one at which I balked when I was young, was thisidea that one should withdraw from life. It seemed to me that everygood friend I had amongst the priests and holy men was seeking topull back and cut off his communications with existence. Whatever thetextbooks of Eastern philosophy may say, this was the practice of thepeople who were best conversant with Eastern mental and spiritualknow-how. Thus I saw individuals taking fourteen or eighteen years inorder to get up to a high level of spiritualistic serenity. I saw a greatmany men studying and very few arriving. To my impatient and possiblypractical Western viewpoint this was intolerable. For a very great manyyears I asked this question, „To communicate, or not to communicate?“If one got himself into such thorough trouble by communicating, then,of course, one should stop communicating. But this is not the case. Ifone gets himself into trouble by communicating, he should furthercommunicate. More communication, not less, is the answer, and Iconsider this riddle solved after a quarter-century of investigation andpondering."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!68L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER VIIITHE APPLICATION OF COMMUNICATIONIf you think we are talking about anything very esoteric, or highlymathematical, kindly read the communication formula again. Justbecause we are speaking of the basic fundamentals of sanity,aberration, freedom, ability, truth, knowledge, and secrets is no reasonwhy we have to be complicated. We expect the fundamentals ofbehavior to be complicated simply because so many highly complicatedpeople have discussed the subject. If Immanuel Kant couldn’t, and ifAdler addled communication, there is no reason why we should.As we speak of the applications of communication we are lookingat complexities of these fundamentals, and having isolated thefundamentals, we do not then see any complexity in the product of thebasics. Let us say that we thoroughly understand that two plus twoequals four. Now we write this on a piece of paper and put it on atable. It is still understandable. Now we write on another piece ofpaper that two plus two equals four and put it on the same table. Nowon a third piece of paper we write two plus two equals four and add itto those on the table. We take four tablets full of paper and on eachsheet we write two plus two equals four, and tearing each sheet out,add these. Now we get some blocks of wood, and we write two plustwo equals four on these blocks of wood. We get some leather andcharcoal and write two plus two equals four, and add that to the table.Then we get some blackboards, and on each one white two plus twoequals four and put them on the table. And we get some colored chalkand write two plus two equals four in various colors on anotherblackboard and put it on the table. Then we have two plus two equalsfour bound in vellum and add that to the pile on the table. Then we getsome building bricks and we scratch on them two plus two equals fourand put them on the table. Now we get four gallons of ink and pour itover two plus two equals four, and smear everything we’ve put on thetable. Now we take a bulldozer and push the table out through thewall. We take a steam roller and run over the debris. We take someconcrete and pour it over the whole and let it dry, and we still have notaltered the fact that two plus two equals four."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!69L. RON HUBARDIn other words, no matter what mechanics we add to thecommunication formula, no matter what form we use to communicate,no matter how many types of words and meanings we place into thecommunication formula to become messages, no matter how wescramble meanings, messages, cause points and effect points, we stillhave a communication formula.Here we have an individual. He has been living for a many-evented lifetime. He began life, let us say, with a perfect grasp of thecommunication formula. His experience has been a consistentdeparture from the communication formula only to the degree that hefailed to emanate or failed to receive, twisted, perverted, or failed toreturn communications, and at the end of that lifetime all we have to doto put him into excellent condition would be to restore in its completeclarity his ability to execute the communication formula. The only thingwhich has happened to him has been violation of the communicationformula. He emanated something that was not received; when it wasreceived it was not acknowledged; when it replied he did not receive it;and thus he begins to look further and further afield for communicationand becomes more and more complicated in his view of communicationand becomes less and less duplicatable, is less and less able toduplicate, his intentions swerve further and further, his attentionbecomes more and more altered, what should have been straight lineswind up in a ball, and we have our preclear after a lifetime of living withhomo sapiens. All we have to do to get him into the most desirableclarity would be to restore his ability to perform the various parts of thecommunication formula and his ability to apply that formula to any thingin this or any universe. He would have to be willing to duplicateanything. He would have to be willing to make himself duplicatable. Hewould have to be able to tolerate distance and velocities and masses.He would have to be able to form his own intentions. He would have tobe able to give and receive attention. He would have to be able to takeor leave at will the intentions of others, and more important, he wouldhave to be able to be at any point and make it cause or receipt point atwill. If he were able to do this he could not possibly be trapped, forhere we are intimately walking into the deepest secret of the trap.What is a secret? It is the answer which was never given, andthis is all a secret is. Thus knowledge and use of the communicationformula within the framework of Dianetics and Scientology resolves anyand all secrets and even the belief in secrets."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!70L. RON HUBARDThe only thing that could be said to aberrate communicationwould be restriction, or fear of restriction. A person who is notcommunicating is one who is restricting communication. A person who iscommunicating compulsively is afraid of being restricted in hiscommunication. A person who is talking on another subject than that towhich Cause was giving his attention has been so restricted on thesubject of communication elsewhere, or has experienced such a scarcityof communication elsewhere, that he is still involved withcommunication elsewhere. This is what we mean by „not in presenttime.“When we look at problems without which humanity cannot seemto live we discover that a problem is no more and no less than aconfusion of communication lines, missing cause or effect points,undeterminable distances, misread intentions, missing attention, andfailures in the ability to duplicate and be duplicatable. Move off thecommunication formula in any direction and a problem will result. Aproblem, by definition, is something without an answer, not becausethe two words are similar, but because all of humanity has confusedthem. We find that answer to a communication and answer to aproblem can, for our purposes, be synonymous.When one has failed to get answers consistently to hiscommunications, he begins to run into a scarcity of answers, and he willget problems in order to have solutions, but he will not solve any of theproblems because he already has a scarcity of answers. An auditorwalks in on a preclear who has a scarcity of answers, finds the preclearhas a circuit of problems, tries to resolve some of the problems of thepreclear, discovers that the preclear creates new problems faster thanold ones can be resolved. One thing the preclear knows is that therearen’t any answers – not for his particular kind of problems. He knowsthis is to such a degree that he is unable to conceive of answers, whichmeans to him that he is unable to conceive of solutions. He is like theold man in Manuel Komroff’s story who, after his release from prison,yet created a cell of his own. He cannot look at freedom. He does notbelieve freedom exists. He cannot envision a world without tigers. Theremedy for this, of course, is to have him remedy his lack of answers byhaving him mock up answers.That confused look you see on a mathematician’s face is the taskhe has set himself to procure symbolic answers to hypothetical"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!71L. RON HUBARDabstracts, none of which, of course, are human answers. The longer hesymbolizes, the more formulas he creates, the further he drifts from thehuman race. Answers are answers only when they come from livingunits. All else is a glut on the market. No mathematical formula evergave anybody any answer to anything unless it was to the problem ofcommunication itself, but this I’ll invite to your attention, was notinvolved with, and was not derived from, mathematics as we knowthem. The communication formula was derived from an observation ofand working with life. It could be derived only because one had entirelyabandoned the idea that energy could tell anyone anything. Life is notenergy. Energy is the by-product of Life.Your recluse is one who has become so thoroughly convinced thatthere are no obtainable answers from anyone that he does no longerbelieve that Life itself exists. He is the only living thing alive, in hisopinion. Why? Because he is the only thing which communicates. I daresay every recluse, every „only one,“ every obsessively or compulsivelycommunicating individual has so thoroughly associated with „life units“which were so dead that it became „very plain“ that no one else wasalive. The attitude of a child towards the adult contains the opinion thatadults have very little Life in them. A child, with his enthusiasms, is inhis family everywhere surrounded by communication blocks of greateror lesser magnitude. His questions do not get answers. Thecommunications which are addressed to him are not posed in a waywhich can be duplicated. In other words, the adult does not makehimself duplicatable. Freud and his confreres were entirely in error inbelieving that the child is totally self-centered. It is not the child who istotally self-centered. He believes that he is in communication with thetotal world. Investigation of children demonstrates that they are veryheavy on the First, Second, Third and Fourth Dynamics. The child is soconvinced of his ability to communicate that he will touch a hot stove.Life has no terrors for him. He has not yet learned by experience thathe cannot communicate. It’s the adult who is drawn back into the „onlyone“ and one believes that the inspiration of this continuous belief onthe part of a psychologist and psychoanalyst that the child is entirelyself-centered and living in his own world must be the expression of anopinion held by the psychoanalyst and psychologist out of his ownbank. As one grows one goes less and less into communication withthe environment until he is at last entirely out of it. Only he is out of itin the wrong direction – dead."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!72L. RON HUBARDWhere you see aberration, where you would wish to detectaberration, you must look for violations in the communication formula.People who consistently and continually violate portions of thecommunication formula can be suspected of being just that dead. Thefurther one departs from the communication formula the more deathexists for them. The more concentrated they become on secrets, themore they question intentions, the less they are likely to assume thepoint of view called Cause or the point of view called Effect.One should not go so far as to say that Life is communication. Itis, however, a native condition of Life to be able to communicate. Life,the awareness of awareness unit, the ability to have unlimited qualitywith no quantity, or do produce quantity, is capable of communication.And here again we are consulting ability. Ability, first and foremost,could be conceived to be the ability to BE, and also the ability to varybeing, and this means the ability to communicate. One has to be ableto be in order to communicate. One has to be able to vary one’sbeingness in order to return communication.There is the manifestation, then, known as the „stuck flow.“ Thisis one-way communication. The flow can be stuck incoming or it can bestuck outgoing. The part of a communication cycle that goes fromprimary Cause to Effect may be the flow that is stuck, or it might be theother from „b“ back to „a“ that is stuck. Here we have several possiblemethods of achieving a stuck flow, and several conditions of flow, fourto be exact. The flow can be stuck from primary Cause to Effect, fromthe viewpoint of primary Cause. The flow can be stuck from primaryCause to primary Effect from the viewpoint of primary Effect. The flowcan be stuck from Effect-turned-Cause to final Effect, from the viewpointof Effect-turned-Cause. The flow can be stuck from Effect-turned-Causeto primary Cause, from the viewpoint of primary Cause. These fourstuck flows can become – any of them or a combination of them – theanatomy of a communication lag of a case. A person can hear butcannot answer. A person can cause a communication to begin, butcannot receive an acknowledgement. A primary Cause can be totallyengrossed in keeping the flow from arriving at primary Effect, etc.A failure to complete a cycle of communication will leave some partof that communication in suspense. It will leave it, in other words,silent, and this will stick on the track. It will float in time. It willrestimulate. It will attract and hold attention long after it occurred."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!73L. RON HUBARDUnconsciousness itself results from the receipt of too much, tooheavy, communication. It can similarly, but less often, result from theemanation of too much, too heavy, communication as in the case ofblowing up a large balloon, where one becomes dizzy after theexpulsion of too much breath. Theoretically, one sending a large masstowards another might fall unconscious as a result of sending too muchmass away from himself too suddenly, and we find that this can be thecase. This is degradation because of loss. One gives away too much, orloses too much, and the departure of the mass, or even the idea, canbring about a drop in consciousness. In view of the fact that a thetancan create at will this is not a very dangerous situation. One canreceive too much communication too suddenly, such as a cannon ball.Unconsciousness will result from this. Most engrams are composed oftoo much incoming mass and too much outgoing mass, so as to make aconfusion into which any answer, any phrase interjected can then beeffective since there is a scarcity of phrases and a plus in masses. Onecould even go so far as to say that the only reason a mass interchangeis ever effective in the line of unconsciousness is that it does not haveenough reasons with it. I suppose that if one explained carefullyenough to a soldier why he had to be shot, the arrival of a bullet wouldnot make him unconscious or hurt him. But again this is theoretical, asvery little reason goes on in war, thus it has never been subjected to aclinical experiment.The resolution of any stuck flow is remedying the scarcity of thatwhich stuck the flow. This might be answers, it might be originalcommunication, it might be chances to reply.The communication formula at work is best understood throughthe „communication lag.“"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!74L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER IXTWO-WAY COMMUNICATIONA cycle of communication and two-way communication are actuallytwo different things. If we examine closely the anatomy ofcommunication we will discover that a cycle of communication is not atwo-way communication in its entirety.If you will inspect Graph „A“ below, you will see a cycle ofcommunication:Here we have Joe as the originator of a communication. It is hisprimary impulse. This impulse is addressed to Bill. We find Bill receivingit, and then Bill originating an answer or acknowledgment as Bill’, whichacknowledgement is sent back to Joe’. Joe has said, for instance, „Howare you?“ Bill has received this, and then Bill (becoming secondaryCause) has replied to it as Bill’, with „I’m O.K.,“ which goes back to Joe’,and thus ends the cycle.Now what we call a two-way cycle of communication may ensue,as in Graph „B.“Here we have Bill originating a communication. Bill says, „How’stricks?“ Joe receives this, and then as Joe’ or secondary Cause,answers „O.K., I guess,“ which answer is then acknowledged in itsreceipt by Bill’.In both of these graphs we discover that in Graph „A“ theacknowledgement of the secondary Cause was expressed by Joe’ as a"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!75L. RON HUBARDnod or a look of satisfaction. And again, in Graph „B,“ Joe’s’ „O.K., Iguess“ is actually acknowledged by Bill’ with a nod or some expressionsignifying receipt of the communication.If both Joe and Bill are „strong, silent men“ – highly aberrated –they would omit some portion of these cycles. The most flagrantomission and the one most often understood as „communication lag“by the auditor would be for Joe in Graph „A“ to say „How are you?“ andfor Bill to stand there without speaking. Here we have Joe causing acommunication, and Bill failing to continue the cycle. We do not know orrequire, and we are not interested in, whether or not Bill, as the receiptpoint, ever did hear it. We can assume that he was at least present,and that Joe spoke loudly enough to be heard, and that Bill’s attentionwas somewhere in Joe’s vicinity. Now instead of getting on with thecycle of communication, Joe is left there with an incompleted cycle andnever gets an opportunity to become Joe’.There are several ways in which a cycle of communication couldnot be completed, and these could be categorized as (1) Joe failing toemanate communication, (2) Bill failing to hear communication, (3) Bill’failing to reply to the communication received by him, and (4) Joe’ failingto acknowledge by some sign or word that he has heard Bill’.We could assign various reasons to all this, but our purpose hereis not to assign reasons why we do not complete a communicationcycle. Our entire purpose is involved with the non-completion of thiscommunication cycle.Now, as in Graph „A,“ let us say we have in Joe a person who iscompulsively and continually originating communication whether he hasanybody’s attention or not, and whether or not these communicationsare germane to any existing situation. We discover that Joe is apt to bemet, in his communicating, with an inattentive Bill who does not hearhim, and thus an absent Bill’ who does not answer, and thus an absentJoe’ who never acknowledges.Let us examine this same situation in Graph „B.“ Here we have, inBill, an origination of a communication. We have the same Joe with acompulsive outflow. Bill says, „How are you?“ and the cycle is notcompleted because Joe, so intent upon his own compulsive line, doesnot become Joe’ and never gives Bill a chance to become Bill’ andacknowledge."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!76L. RON HUBARDNow let’s take another situation. We find Joe originatingcommunications, and Bill a person who never originatescommunications. Joe is not necessarily compulsive or obsessive inoriginating communications, but Bill is aberratedly inhibited inoriginating communications. We find that Joe and Bill, working together,then get into this kind of an activity: Joe originates a communication, Billhears it, becomes Bill’, replies to it, and permits Joe a chance to becomeJoe’. This goes on quite well, but will sooner or later hit a jam on a two-way cycle, which is violated because Bill never originatescommunications.A two-way cycle of communication would work as follows: Joe,having originated a communication, and having completed it, may thenwait for Bill to originate a communication to Joe, thus completing theremainder of the two-way cycle of communication. Bill does originate acommunication, this is heard by Joe, answered by Joe’, andacknowledged by Bill’.Thus we get the normal cycle of a communication between twoterminals, for in this case Joe is a terminal and Bill is a terminal andcommunication can be seen to flow between two terminals. The cyclesdepend on Joe originating communication, Bill hearing thecommunication, Bill becoming Bill’ and answering the communication,Joe’ acknowledging the communication, then Bill originating acommunication, Joe hearing the communication, Joe’ answering thecommunication, and Bill’ acknowledging the communication. If they didthis, regardless of what they were talking about, they would neverbecome in an argument and would eventually reach an agreement,even if they were hostile to one another. Their difficulties and problemswould be cleared up and they would be, in relationship to each other,in good shape.A two-way communication cycle breaks down when eitherterminal fails, in its turn, to originate communication. We discover thatthe entire society has vast difficulties along this line. They are so usedto canned entertainment and so inhibited in originating communicationby parents who couldn’t communicate, and by education and othercauses, that people get very low on communication origin.Communication origin is necessary to have communication in the firstplace. Thus we find people talking mainly about things which are forcedupon them by exterior causes. They see an accident, they discuss it."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!77L. RON HUBARDThey see a movie, they discuss it. They wait for an exterior source togive them the occasion for a conversation. But in view of the fact thatboth are low on the origin of communication – which could also bestated as low on imagination – we discover that such people,dependent upon exterior primal impulses, are more or less compulsiveor inhibitive in communication, and thus the conversation veers rapidlyand markedly and may wind up with some remarkable animosities ormis-conclusions. Let us suppose that lack of prime cause impulse onJoe’s part has brought him into obsessive or compulsive communication,and we find that he is so busy outflowing that he never has a chanceto hear anyone who speaks to him, and if he did hear them would notanswer them. Bill on the other hand, might be so very, very, very lowon primal cause (which is to say, low on communication origination) thathe never even moves into Bill’, or if he does, would never put forth hisown opinion, thus unbalancing Joe further and further into further andfurther compulsive communication.As you can see by these graphs, some novel situations couldoriginate. There would be the matter of obsessive answering as well asinhibitive answering. An individual could spend all of his time answering,justifying or explaining – all the same thing – no primal communicationhaving been originated at him. Another individual, as Joe’ in Graph „A“or Bill’ in Graph „B,“ might spend all of his time acknowledging, eventhough nothing came his way to acknowledge. The common and mostnoticed manifestations, however, are obsessive and compulsive origin,and non-answering acceptance, and non-acknowledgement of answer.And at these places we can discover stuck flows.As the only crime in the universe seems to be to communicate,and as the only saving grace of a thetan is to communicate, we canreadily understand that an entanglement of communication is certain toresult, but we can understand – and much more happily – that it cannow be resolved.That which we are discussing here is minimally theory andmaximally derived from observation. The main test of this is whether ornot it resolved cases. and be assured that it does.Flows become stuck on this twin cycle of communication where ascarcity occurs in (1) origination of communication, (2) receipt ofcommunication, (3) answering of communication given, (4)acknowledging answers. Thus it can be seen that there are only four"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!78L. RON HUBARDparts which can become aberrated in both Graph „A“ and Graph „B,“ nomatter the number of peculiar manifestations which can occur as aresult thereof.These observations of communications are so vital that aconsiderable difference amongst case results comes about between anauditor who does acknowledge whatever his preclear answers and anauditor who does not. Let us take „Auditor G“ and we discover that heis running Opening Procedure of 8-C on a preclear, but that at the endof two hours of Opening Procedure of 8-C the preclear has benefitedvery little. Then let us take „Auditor K.“ The auditor does 15 minutes ofOpening Procedure of 8-C and gets very good results on the preclear.The difference between Auditor G and Auditor K is only that Auditor Gnever acknowledges any answer or statement, or communication originon the part of the preclear. He simply continues doggedly with theprocess. Auditor K. on the other hand, is willing to let the preclearoriginate a communication and always acknowledges whenever thepreclear concludes the action called for in a command. or when thepreclear volunteers a verbal answer. In other words. G did not answeror acknowledge – but ran the process with mechanical perfection, andK both answered and acknowledged as well as originated orders. Thefact that the scarcest thing there is is the origin of orders orcommunications, and the fact that G was at least doing this, wasenough to cause G to get some improvement in the preclear, but hewould not get anything like the improvement obtained by Auditor K.Silence is nowhere desirable except in permitting another tocommunicate or waiting for another to acknowledge. The auditing ofsilence will wind the preclear in a perfect fish-net of aberration. Thetotal process which remedies this is remedying the scarcity, bywhatever means, of the four parts of a two-way communication."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!79L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER XCOMMUNICATION LAGYesterday we used an instrument called an E-Meter to registerwhether or not the process was still getting results so that the auditorwould know how long to continue it. While the E-Meter is an interestinginvestigation instrument and has played its part in research, it is nottoday used by the auditor except perhaps in testing the basalmetabolism of the preclear. The E-Meter is no longer used to determine„what is wrong with the preclear.“ As we long ago suspected, theintervention of a mechanical gadget between the auditor and thepreclear had a tendency to de-personalize the session and also gavethe auditor a dependence upon the physical universe and its meterswhich did not have to be there. I knew when we first began to use E-Meters that sooner or later something would have to be evolved, orthat something would turn up which would dispense with them. Iworked along that line rather consistently and about half a year beforethis writing developed „communication lag“ as the only diagnosticinstrument needed by the auditor.*The exact definition of a communication lag is: „the length of timeintervening between the posing of a question, or origination of astatement, and the exact moment that question or original statement isanswered.“ *The Mark V E-Meter, though not a diagnostic instrument,was developed by L. Ron Hubbard since this writing for precisionauditing. See book list in back of this book for titles on this subject.If you will look very closely at this definition you will discover thatnothing is said, whatever, about what goes on between the asking ofthe question or the origination of a communication and its beinganswered. What goes on in between is lag. It does not matter if thepreclear stood on his head, went to the North Pole, gave a dissertationon Botany, stood silent, answered some other question, thought itover, attacked the auditor, or began to string beads. Any other actionbut answering, and the time taken up by that action, is communicationlag. An auditor has to understand this very thoroughly. Usually heinterprets a communication lag as the length of time it takes thepreclear to answer the question and loosely applies this as the length"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!80L. RON HUBARDof time between the asking of the question and the first moment thepreclear starts to speak. This is not communication lag, for the preclearmay start to speak on some other subject, may desire information, mayalmost answer the question, and still not actually answer the question.If you will look around at people you will find them possessed of agreat many communication lag mechanisms. In their effort not to be aneffect, or in their effort not to be cause, in their aberrations aboutcompulsive communication, and inhibitive communication, and inindulging in impulsive, compulsive and inhibitive communication. Theymanage to assemble quite a number of interesting mechanisms, but allthese mechanisms are communication lag.Here is an example of communication lag. Joe: „How are you,Bill?“ Bill: „You look fine, Joe.“ Here the question was never answeredat all and would go on as a communication lag from there until the endof the universe.Here is another example: Joe: „How are you, Bill?“ Bill (aftertwenty seconds of study): „Oh, I guess I’m all right today.“ As this isthe commonest form of communication lag it is the most readilyobserved.Less well known is the following communication lag. Joe: „Howare you, Bill?“ Bill: „What do you want to know for?“ Again, thisquestion goes on unanswered until the end of the universe.The most maddening kind of communication lag is, Joe: „How areyou Bill?“ Bill: _______ silence from there on out. This is dramatizedwhen people anxiously inquire of an unconscious person how he is andthey become entirely frantic. They are simply looking at acommunication lag which they believe will become total, and theiranxiety is simply their multiple suffering on the subject ofcommunication lag.Here is another type of communication lag. Joe: „How are you,Bill? I was saying to Ezra the other day that I have seen a lot of sickmen in my time, but you certainly look pretty bad. Bill, now how areyou? I’ve been down to see the doctor and he was telling me there’s alot of these colds and things going around...“ In other words, Joe nevergives Bill an opportunity to reply, and this is the other side ofcommunication lag."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!81L. RON HUBARDAn auditor’s understanding of the subject of communication lag isbrief if he believes it is the lag between the originator of thecommunication and the person to whom it is addressed. On our Graph„A“ on an earlier page this would be from Joe to Bill’. There is a returnlag, and that is from Bill’ to Joe’, and, as above, there is a lag betweenJoe and Joe’ where Joe simply keeps on talking without ascertaining ifthere is any Bill’ there. You could also call this return lag an„acknowledgement lag.“ Joe to Joe is not a communication at all.Actually, Joe to Bill’ without the completion of the cycle is the samething. Joe never acknowledges a communication and so the return lagis actually Joe to Joe. The proper sequence of such a communication isBill’ to Joe’. In other words Joe, to make a complete cycle ofcommunication, must acknowledge in some manner, verbal or gesture,that Bill’ has said something.Joe to Joe, as a communication lag (which is to say, noacknowledgement) has as its initial root an absence, for Joe, of Bill toBill’ in Graph „B.“ In other words, Joe has been called upon to originatecommunication so consistently that he now does so compulsively andobsessively since there has been an entire scarcity of other peopleoriginating communication.Now let us look at a highly specialized type of communication lag.Here we have Joe to Bill to Bill’ to Joe’, as in Graph „A.“ Then we haveJoe waiting for Bill, in Graph „B,“ to originate a communication. If Billdoes not, and only silence ensues, Joe then originates anothercommunication. In other words, we have no two-way communication.The two-way cycle of communication is not quite as important inauditing as it would be in Life, for in auditing the auditor perforce isoriginating communication in order to get the preclear up to the pointwhere he can originate communication. One does nod remedy Life byapproximating it exactly in the auditing room. The process is sodesigned that it will accomplish a rehabilitation in Life without, to amarked degree, having to live it. As an example of this, the auditordoes not expect the preclear to turn around and originate someprocess to make the auditor well. But the auditor does expect to getaudited by somebody sooner or later, or expects to be at a level wherehe can rise above this need of a communication interchange in order tolive."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!82L. RON HUBARDThe place auditors have the most trouble with the communicationlag is the retum lag. Auditors seldom acknowledge the execution ofcommands on the part of the preclear. As in Opening Procedure of 8-C,a process which is one of the six basic processes, the auditor sends thepreclear over to touch the wall. When the preclear has touched thewall, the auditor is quite prone to give another command withoutacknowledging the fact that the preclear has touched the wall. It is anamazing thing what the lack of acknowledgement will do to slow downa case recovery. Many times when an auditor is doing thisacknowledging, he is doing it in such a perfunctory fashion that thepreclear does not recognize it as an acknowledgement, but as aprelude to a new command. A good auditor makes very, very sure thatthe preclear knows the acknowledgement has occurred, As an example,the auditor says: „Go over to the wall and touch it.“ The preclear doesso. The auditor says: „Very good,“ and with a definite pause after thisacknowledgement says: „Now go over to that wall and touch it.“ Inother words, the auditor who is a good auditor makes sure that thepreclear knows that a complete cycle of communication has occurred onthis particular auditing command.Another failure on the part of auditors is to fail to let the preclearoriginate a communication. The auditor tells the preclear: „Go over tothat wall and touch it.“ The preclear does so but stops midway in thegesture and gasps, then completes the gesture. The bad auditor willfail to note and inquire after this gasp. This is actually the origin of acommunication on the part of the preclear. He does not verbalize it. Hedoes not express it any further than some physical gesture or a look ofdismay, and even these might be slight, but this is usually as far as hecan go in originating a communication. The auditor who fails to pick thisup fails to inform the preclear thus that the preclear is permitted tooriginate a communication. This gasp, this gesture, should at once benoted by the auditor with a „What’s happening?“ or, „What’s thematter?“ or, „Something happen?“ This gives the preclear theopportunity to originate a second cycle of communication. Rememberthat the gesture or the gasp was actually a communication. Thepreclear probably will not acknowledge the auditors statement beyondstarting out on the origin of a new communication, but the fact that hedoes originate a statement on the subject of what is the matter is, initself, an acknowledgement of the fact that he has heard the auditor.This is so vital that many cases have stumbled, tripped, and bogged,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!83L. RON HUBARDsimply because the auditor did not encourage the preclear to make astatement as to something which had occurred. Actually, the moreoften an auditor can do this the better auditor he is, and the moregood will be done by auditing.Now, of course, there is an opposite side of this where theauditor can give credence to an obsessive or compulsive outflow on thepart of the preclear to such an extent that the auditing is entirelyinterrupted. An example of this occurred recently where a preclearoutflowed at an auditor three days and three nights without theauditor recognizing entirely that this, was simply obsessivecommunication in action. But this is not communication. This is notpertinent to the situation, and the definition of compulsive or obsessivecommunication is „an outflow which is not pertinent to the surroundingterminals and situation.“ In other words, compulsive or obsessivecommunication is an outflow which is not in reality with the existingreality.We see, then, that an auditing session really does include two-way cycle of communication, but it does not include it, ever, unless theauditor invites the preclear to comment upon what is going on as hedoes processing.Just as a side comment here, the way to handle an obsessive ora compulsive communication is to wait for a slight break in the flow andinterject an auditing command. Remember that an obsessive outflow isactually not a communication. A communication is on the subject and isin agreement with the environment. It is also in agreement with what isoccurring.Now it doesn’t happen to matter what process is being done, thebasic of that process is two-way communication. In auditing, as inliving, communication is existence. In the absence of communication wehave silence, and where we have silence we have no time. Time ismanifested in communication lag to the extent that the preclear hasbeen subjected to silences, or such a thing as an obsessive orcompulsive outflow which had nothing to do with communicating on thesubject at hand. This is again a sort of silence. Somebody talkingobsessively and continually about things which might or might not exist,and to no one in particular without expecting any cycle ofcommunication to take place."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!84L. RON HUBARDA communication lag is handled by an auditor by repetition of aquestion or command which elicited a communication lag. Here is anexample. Bill: „How are you, Joe?“ Joe: silence; silence; silence – finallya grunt. Bill: „How are you, Joe?“ Silence, silence – “O.K., I guess.“ Bill:„How are you, Joe?“ „I’m all right, I tell you!“ Bill: „How are you, Joe?“Joe: silence _______ „I’m O.K.“ Bill: „How are you Joe?“ Joe: „All right, Iguess.“ Bill; „How are you, Joe?“ Joe: „All right.“ Bill: „How are youJoe?“ Joe: „Oh, I’m all right.“This is an example of flattering a communication lag.* At first wehave silence and no very intelligible reply, then we have silence and areply, and then other manifestations, each one of which demonstratesa changing interval of time until the last couple of commands – three, inactual auditing practice – where the same interval of time was present.Flattening a communication lag requires only that the preclearanswer after a uniform interval of time at least three times. This uniforminterval of time could, for practical purposes, be as long as 10 seconds.Thus we get lengths of time required to answer an auditing question asfollows: answer requires 35 seconds; answer requires 20 seconds;answer requires 10 seconds; answer requires 10 seconds; answerrequires 10 seconds. To all intents and purposes, with these three last10 second intervals the auditor could consider that he has to somedegree flattened this particular auditing command because he isgetting a consistent response. However, with such a long lag as 10seconds, the auditor will discover that if he asked the question two orthree more times he would recover a changing interval once more.This is the mechanical formula of flattening communication lag.Give the order, as in Opening Procedure of 8-C, or ask the question, asin Straightwire, and then continue to give that same order or ask thatsame question until the preclear executes it after a short interval threetimes the same.There is an entirely different manifestation for a completelyflattened communication lag. We get extroversion. The preclear ceasesto put his attention on his mind, but puts his attention on theenvironment. We see this happen often in the Opening Procedure of 8-  * Note that this is an example only, not an actual process orquestion an auditor would use respetitively.—Ed."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!85L. RON HUBARDC where the preclear has the room suddenly become bright to him. Hehas extroverted his attention. He has come free from one of thesecommunication tangles out of the past and has suddenly looked at theenvironment. This is all that has happened. On a thinkingness level thishappens quite often. The preclear is doing the process very well, andthen begins to remember odds and ends of appointments he has, orsome such thing. Just because he does this is no reason the auditingsession should be ended. It simply demonstrates an extroversion. Youhave, in one way or another, pulled the preclear out of acommunication tangle and put him into present time, when heextrovertsCommunication lag as a subject could be a very large one. Wehave all manner of communication lags in evidence around us. Probablythe most interesting one is the shock reaction after an accident, whichone occasionally sees. At times it takes the body 36 hours to find outand reply to the fact that it has received an impact. It is quite commonfor a body to suddenly manifest the impact half an hour after it. This iscommunication lag. There are many humorous angles to communicationlag. Sometimes you ask somebody „How are you?“ and you get a replyfrom his social machinery. He says, „I’m fine.“ Then, two or three hourslater, he is liable to say to you, „I feel terrible.“ This was the preclear,himself, answering. This was the awareness of awareness unitawakening to this communication lag.This universe could be called a consistent and continuouscommunication lag. One is trapped in it to the degree that he is lagging.If there were no remedy for communication lag I would never bring upthe subject. However, there is, and it is a remedy which is easilyundertaken in auditing today.Entrapment is actually communication lag. One has waited forcommunication which never arrived, expected something to answer solong and so often that he becomes fixated upon something, or insomethings, and so does not believe he can escape from it. The firstand foremost factor in communication lag, of course, is time, and thenext factor is waiting. This is also dependent upon time.As has been commented earlier, the only things which float on thetime track are the moments of silence when no communicationoccurred. These are „no time“ moments, and so have no time in whichthey can live, and so they float forward on the time-track. It is an oddity"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!86L. RON HUBARDthat an engram behaves in such a way as to put all its silent momentsin present time with the preclear and leave its talking or actionmoments back on the track. When we took a person back to birth andran out birth, we took out the action moments. If we did not take out,as well, the silent moments in birth, we did not take out the very thingswhich pin themselves to the preclear in present time. In other words,the birth engram did not move at all, but the silent moments in birthmight have a tendency to come up into present time. These silentmoments in engrams and facsimiles do, themselves, compose thematter extant in the preclear. This matter is not so much composed ofaction moments as silent moments. Thus we see that an individual, thelonger he lives in this universe, the more communication lag he runsinto, the more upset he is about existence, the greater hiscommunication lag, the more he is silent. Of course, obsessive orcompulsive communication is just one grade above silence. It is the lastfrantic effort to keep things from going entirely quiet. It is notcommunication and is actually silence of a sort, particularly since veryfew people listen to it.Now we are studying about communication, and we arecommunicating about communication, and you have every opportunityhere to get yourself beautifully snarled, so I would ask you to lookaround your environment and check a number of manifestations ofcommunication lag. You are not controlled by the subject. You can easilycontrol it. The dangerous thing is not to know the answers and simplygo on in these consistent and continual communication lags imposedupon us by the lack of communication in this universe.It is of great interest to note that imagination as a function ofexistence becomes drowned in an absence of communication origin. Anindividual can become so dependent upon others for entertainment andoriginating communications that he himself does not. Indeed, it is veryunpopular in this society at this time to originate communications. Oneshould always say that somebody else thought of it first, or that it goesback to the ancient Ugluks, or that it’s happened many times before, orthat one has just dug up the information after it has been buried, orone is really taking directions from the Archangel Smearel, rather thanstand up and plead guilty to originating a communication. Unless onecan originate communications one’s imagination is in bad shape. Thereverse does not happen to be true. The imagination is not that thingwhich is first imperiled and then results in failure to originate"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!87L. RON HUBARDcommunication. Failure of communication origin then results in failure ofimagination, so the rehabilitation of communication origin rehabilitatesas well the imagination. This is very good news, indeed, for anyone inthe creative arts, particularly, but who is not in the creative arts?Examining the whole subject of communication one discovers thatthere are very few people around him in this day and age who areactively communicating, and there are a lot of people who think theyare communicating who are not."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!88L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER XIPAN-DETERMINISMAn entirely new concept in Dianetics and Scientology is that ofPan-Determinism.In Book One we talked about Self-Determinism. Self-Determinismmeant, in essence, control by the awareness of awareness unit of thatwhich it conceived to be its identity. Some effort was made in Book Oneto move Self-Determinism out into the remaining Dynamics.Pan-Determinism is a word which describes determinism all alongthe Dynamics. Actually, Self-Determinism attempted to do this, and ourearlier idea of Self-Determinism was a sort of Pan-Determinism.We have to remember here that the Dynamics involved inDianetics are the first four. The Dynamics involved in Scientology arethe last four of the total set of eight. The Eight Dynamics are as follows:DYNAMIC ONE is the urge towards survival of self.DYNAMIC TWO is the urge towards survival through sex, orchildren, and embraces both the sexual act and the care and raising ofchildren.DYNAMIC THREE is the urge towards survival through the groupand as the group.DYNAMIC FOUR is the urge towards survival through all mankindand as all mankind.DYNAMIC FIVE is the urge towards survival through life forms suchas animals, birds, insects, fish and vegetation, and is the urge tosurvive as these.DYNAMIC SIX is the urge towards survival as the physical universeand has as its components Matter, Energy, Space and Time, from whichwe derive the word MEST.DYNAMIC SEVEN is the urge towards survival through Spirit andwould include the manifestations or the totality of awareness ofawareness units, thetans, demons, ghosts, spirits, goblins, and soforth."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!89L. RON HUBARDDYNAMIC EIGHT is the urge towards survival through a SupremeBeing, or more exactly, Infinity. It is called Dynamic Eight because it isInfinity turned up on its side.The urge towards survival through self, sex, children, groups andmankind is the proper province of Dianetics.Now let us examine the concept of Pan-Determinism. Pan-Determinism would be the willingness to determine or control self anddynamics, other than self, up to the eight listed above. Like Self-Determinism, Pan-Determinism is self-elected or self- determined, inthat one does it knowingly and directly, not from obsession, compulsionor inhibition. An undetermined individual, of course, does not exist, butan other-determined individual definitely can exist. Where we haveSelf-Determinism, and we interpret Self-Determinism as determinism onthe First Dynamic, we have only willingness to control self and nowillingness to control anything beyond self. If this is the case, in Self-Determinism we have as other-determinism sex, children, groups,mankind, and going on into Scientology, animal life, vegetation, thephysical universe, spirits, and God – or whatever else might composeInfinity. In view of the fact that Self-Determinism was interpreted in thisfashion it left an individual in the state of mind of being willing to bedetermined on all other Dynamics and by all ether Dynamics except hisown personal dynamic. In view of the fact that all auditing is the ThirdDynamic, and in view of the fact that a personal dynamic cannot exist,and that an individual as we see him, a man, is actually a compositeand is not a First Dynamic but a Third Dynamic, we see we are indifficulty with this definition of Self-Determinism and continued use ofSelf-Determinism. It is necessary, then, to investigate further and toassign more precision to this concept of willingness to control.When we say control we do not mean the „control case“ wherecontrol is obsessive or other-determined, or where the individual iscontrolling things out of compulsion or fear. We simply mean willingnessto start, stop and change. The anatomy of control is just that –starting, stopping and changing things. Now it is not necessary for aperson to start, stop and change things just to demonstrate that hecan control them. He must, however, to be healthy and capable, beable to start, stop and change things.Here we come immediately to what we mean by ability. It wouldbe the ability to start, change and stop things, and if we have an ability"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!90L. RON HUBARDto start, stop and change things, we of course must have a willingnessto start, stop and change things. Those people who are unwillinglybehaving in some direction so as to start, stop and change things arevery sick people, and in this last category we discover the bulk of thehuman race at this writing.The basic difference between aberration and sanity, betweeninability and ability, between illness and health, is the knowingness ofcausation by self opposed to unknown causation by others or otherthings. An individual who knows he is doing it far more capable thanone who is doing it but supposes something else is doing it. Psychosisis itself simply an inversion of determinism. A psychotic is entirely other-determined, a sane man is in good measure Self-Determined. Pan-Determinism would mean a willingness to start, change and stop onany and all dynamics. That is its primary definition. A further definition,also a precision definition, is: the willingness to start, change and stoptwo or more forces, whether or not opposed, and this could beinterpreted as two or more individuals, two or more groups, two ormore planets, two or more life-species, two or more universes, two ormore spirits, whether or not opposed. This means that one would notnecessarily fight, he would not necessarily choose sides.This is in total controversy to some of the most cherished beliefsof Man, but may I point out to you quickly that Man is not an entirelysane person, and thus some of his beliefs must be somewhataberrated. There is such a thing as courage, but there is not such athing as sanity totally opposed.People who are afraid of control are liable to be afraid of Pan-Determinism but if they will see this as a willingness to start, changeand stop any Dynamic they will see that a person must be assumingthe responsibility for any of the Dynamics. A conqueror, in his onslaughtagainst society, is fighting other-determinism. He is starting, changingand stopping things because of an unwillingness to associate with orsupport other races or customs than his own. Therefore, what he isdoing can be interpreted as „bad.“In support of this we get all of the earlier religious teachings, butthese have been grossly misinterpreted. These have been interpretedto mean that a person should not fight in any way, or defend anything,or have anything, or own anything. This is not true. A person who iswilling to be other identities besides himself, other individualities"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!91L. RON HUBARDbesides himself, does not necessarily harm these other individualities.Indeed, we cannot make the complete distinction of other than himself,since we are saying in this that he clings to something he calls self andsupports and defends it without being willing to identify himself withothers.One of the most maddening debaters is one who moves at willbetween the viewpoints of himself and those who have elected him asan enemy.There is an important scale down from Pan-Determinism. It doesnot lead along a dwindling Dynamic path, but it could, of course. Onecould simply see as Pan-Determinism dwindling the falling off of oneDynamic after another until one is down to First Dynamic, but that is nota particularly workable picture and an auditor does not use it.The Scale down from Pan-Determinism is: Pan-Determinism,Fighting, Must and Must Not Happen Again, Repair and Association.These are actually processes. At the bottom we find an unwillingness toassociate with anything. Just above this is an unwillingness to repairanything, but a willingness to associate somewhat. Above this is awillingness to associate and to repair somewhat, but no willingness tolet certain things happen again. Above this is a willingness to fightthings, and above this is Pan-Determinism. These are arranged in thisfashion because this is the ladder a preclear climbs if he is run on acertain type of process. This is something like the old Emotional Scale,which went: Apathy, Grief, Fear, Anger, Antagonism, Boredom,Conservatism, and Enthusiasm, only in this case it is a scale of behaviormanifestations. Where an individual who is unwilling to associate withvarious things is certainly a long way from being Pan-Determined anddefinitely is not even Self-Determined, he has to come up a waysbefore he is willing to repair anything, but in this frame of mind he canrepair quite generally but is unwilling or unable to create or destroy. Anoddity here is that a person who is unwilling to associate is only able todestroy, and a person has to be very far up the scale before he cancreate. In fact, he has to be up around Pan-Determinism to adequatelycreate. Above this level of repair we find an individual frozen in manyincidents which he is preventing from occurring once more and isholding the facsimiles or engrams of these incidents so that he willhave a model and so know what mustn’t occur; and above this level wediscover an individual fighting and being willing to fight almost"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!92L. RON HUBARDanything; and above this level we discover an individual willing or ableto be almost anything and so may be at peace with things and doesnot have to fight things. An individual at the Pan-Determinism level cancreate. An individual at Association, as I have said, can only destroy. Anindividual at Repair or Must and Must Not Happen Again is making avery, very heavy effort – and I do mean Effort – to survive.Let us take for our example of Pan-Determinism the SecondDynamic. Here we find such a thorough effort to have other-determinism that Freud picked this out as the only aberrative factor. Itis not the only aberrative factor, but in view of the fact that it is adesired inflow it can be considered with many other things to havesome aberrative value. Let us look at it in terms of Self-Determinismand Pan-Determinism. Here we have an individual believing himself tobe a man, who believes that his only sexual pleasure can be derivedfrom remaining very solidly a man and having sexual relationships witha woman, and being very sure that he is not the woman. On the otherhand, we find a woman determined to be herself and experience asherself, and to experience a sexual inflow from a man. In the case ofthe man, as in the case of the woman, we have an unwillingness to bethe other sex. This is considered natural but do you know that whenthis is entirely true, when we have complete determinism to be self andnot to be to any slightest degree the other person, there is no sexualpleasure interchange of any kind whatsoever? We get the conditionknown as Satyrism and Nymphomania. We get a tremendous anxiety tohave a sexual flow.Probably the only reason you can see the universe at all isbecause you are still willing to be some part of it. Probably the onlyreason you can talk to people is because you can be the other personyou are talking to. Probably the only reason you can really let peopletalk to you is because you are willing to let the other person be you,somewhat, and he is willing to let you be him to some degree. In viewof the fact that space itself is a mock-up, is a state of mind, it can beseen that individuality depends to some degree upon the law that notwo things must occupy the same space. When we get this law inaction we have a universe. Until this law goes into action there is nouniverse, and one would be hard put to differentiate entirely. Twothings can occupy the same space to the degree that you are willing tobelieve they can. It is a very easy thing to talk to an audience if you areperfectly willing to be an audience. It is a very difficult thing to talk to"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!93L. RON HUBARDan audience if you are unwilling to be an audience. Similarly, it is verydifficult to be an audience if you are unwilling to be on the stage. Onecould conceive that a person who had a considerable amount of stage-fright would be incapable of enjoying a performance of actors. And so itis. We discover the person who is in the audience and has, himself,considerable stage-fright, writhing and feeling embarrassed for everyactor who makes the slightest slip on the stage. In other words, wefind this person compulsively being on the stage although he is in theaudience.Things of this nature have led more than one philosopher toassume that we were all from the same mould, or that we were all thesame thing. This is a very moot question. Processing demonstratesrather adequately that we are all really individuals and that we are notthe same individual, and indeed, people who believe we are all thesame individual have a very rough time of it. But evidently we could allbe the same individual, at least if we were entirely sane.The physical universe is a sort of hypnotic trance where theindividual believes himself to be capable of viewing from various points.The illusion is rendered very excellent by the fact that other individualsbelieve that they are viewing the same things from the same points asthey occupy. We are all, as awareness of awareness units, basicallydifferent. We are not the same „pool of Life,“ and we are all evidentlydifferently endowed, no matter what the Communist Party would like tobelieve.One of the most significant differences from man to man is thedegree to which he is willing to be Pan-Determined. The man who hasto forcefully control everything in his vicinity, including his family, is notbeing Self-Determined, usually, much less Pan-Determined. He is notbeing his family. If he were being his family, he would understand whythey are doing what they are doing and he would not feel that therewas any danger or menace in their going on executing the motions oremanating the emotions which they do. But, anchored down as oneperson, rather obsessed with the damage that can be done to him orthose around him, an individual is apt to launch himself upon a courseof heavy, solid, super-control of others. Now let’s take the person whois Self-Determined and Pan-Determined in the same situation, and wediscover that he would have enough understanding in the vicinity of hisfamily and others’ families, and with this understanding would be willing"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!94L. RON HUBARDto be and experience as the remainder of the family, and he would findout that he actually could control the family with considerable ease. Theoddity of it is that force can control down into entheta – toenturbulation – but that a Pan-Determinism controls upward intogreater happiness and understanding since there is more ARC present.You have seen individuals around whom a great deal of peace andquiet obtained. Such individuals quite commonly hold into sanity andcheerfulness many others in their environment who are not basicallystable or Self-Determined at all. The individual who is doing this is notdoing it out of obsession, he is doing it simply by knowing and being.He understands what people are talking about because he is perfectlywilling to be these people. When he falls away from understandingwhat they are talking about he has also fallen away from being willingto be them. The willingness to understand, the willingness to be are,for our purposes, synonymous.Now how does this Pan-Determinism tie into communication?We have seen that difficulties arise on the cycle of communicationand on the two-way cycle of communication where origins ofcommunication, answers and acknowledgements were scarce. It mustbe, then, that the individual becoming aberrated throughcommunication, must have conceived the necessity of anotherdeterminism. In other words, one has to fall away from Pan-Determinism to get into any of the traps of communication at all.It is a very fortunate thing for us that Pan-Determinism exists,otherwise there would be absolutely no way whatsoever out of thismaze of mis-communication that a person gets into. The only way outof it would be to have other people come around and do enoughtalking and go to enough movies, and seek out another Self-Determinism which could communicate and make it communicate untilone were sane. However, it doesn’t have to be worked out in anunlimited sense in this way. The oddity is that it works out in „mock-up.“ Further, it works out best in mock-up, for in mock-up we introducethe idea of Pan- Determinism.When we ask somebody to get the idea that somebody else ispresent, who is not, and then have him make this person give himanswers, we discover after a while that some major aberrations haveblown out of our preclear. In the first part the preclear is actuallyremedying the scarcity of answers – or, if these were being processed,"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!95L. RON HUBARDoriginals or acknowledgements – and is so disentanglingcommunication lines. The sense of what he would mock the person upas saying would have nothing to do with it. The communication could bealmost pure gibberish as long as it was an answer. This wouldstraighten out the bank to a very marked degree. The other factorwhich enters into this is Pan-Determinism. We are making the individualactually mock up somebody else and make somebody else saysomething. In other words, we are making our preclear take over thecontrol, the start, change and stop of another communication medium.And with further test and experiment we discover that we can do thisfor all the Dynamics, and when we have done this for all the Dynamicswe have brought our preclear up to a point where he is willing tomonitor communications on all the Dynamics. And when he is willing todo this, and get origins, answers, and acknowledgements along all theDynamics, we find that we have a very serene person who can do themost remarkable things. Anything you have read concerning thepotential abilities of the Clear, and a lot more, comes true when wefollow this course. So it is a very fortunate thing for us that Pan-Determinism exists. Otherwise there would be no processing anybody.Remember, when you are explaining this to people, that it iswillingness to control on any and all Dynamics, and that it is not anobsessive or compulsive control to own, protect, or hide on anyDynamic. All the ills of Earth come from an obsession to own, control,protect and hide on other Dynamics than Self. The true enlightenmentof this world has come from Willingness to be along any of theDynamics.One of the things which gives truth to Pan-Determinism is thesavageness with which the aberrated attempt to drive an individualaway from anything resembling Pan-Determinism. This is simply anobsessive action on the part of people to climb up to Pan-Determinismby force. Pan-Determinism cannot be climbed by force. The ladder tothat height is not made of pikes and spears, spankings and policeforces. It is made of Understanding, Affinity, Reality and Communication."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!96L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER XIITHE SIX BASIC PROCESSESToday’s auditor must be conversant with six Basic Processes andmust be able to get results with these processes before he can expectto get results with higher levels of auditing.These six processes form a roadway for more than the auditor.We discover that they compose a tone-scale. This tone-scale is asfollows: at its lowest and highest reaches, whether by mimicry, words,or mock-up, we have two-way communication. Next above this,occupying a position from about 1.1 to 1.8 on the Chart of HumanEvaluation as given in „Science of Survival,“ we have ElementaryStraightwire. Above this we have, from 1.8 to 2.5, Opening Procedure.Above this, from 2.6 to 3.0, we have Opening Procedure by Duplication.Above this we have Remedy of Havingness, from 3.1 to 3.5, and abovethis, from 3.6 to 4.0, Spotting Spots in Space.An auditor, in auditing these six basic processes, becomessufficiently capable in observing and communicating that he can handle(or, can bring the preclear up to the point where he can handle) the„subjective process“ which remedies communication, or the other onewhich is the „One-Shot Clear.“The problem of psychosis never rightly belonged in Dianetics but ithas been solved there. Opening Procedure of 8-C and the Mimicrytechniques as given in the PABs resolve psychosis. They resolve itrapidly and care for it adequately, and we have no real worry on thatscore. The only reason we would enter the field of psychosis at allwould be to find out how far South our techniques worked.CHART OF PROCESSESWhere they are on the ARC ScaleExteriorizedSpot Spots in Space 4.0Spot Spots in Space 3.6"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!97L.

Through them we findtwo-way communication everywhere. It can be said with honesty thatthere is no auditing without two-way communication.The process, Two-way Communication itself, could be subdividedinto verbal and non-verbal processes. The verbal processes wouldinclude questions about the present time environment and thepreclear’s life, interests, and so forth, and would get a direct answer toevery question, no matter how long the communication lag was. Inother words, a two-way communication would be entered upon so asto actually bring the preclear to talk to the auditor. In the case ofpeople who have great difficulties in this line, we have non-verbaltechniques such as Mimicry, wherein the auditor mimics the preclearand persuades the preclear to mimic the auditor. Various processes areused, such as passing a ball back and forth between them, nodding,shaking hands, sitting down, standing up, walking across the room andback and sitting down, all of which are effective.Much of this book, „Dianetics 55!“ is on the subject of two-waycommunication, and the totality of auditing is bringing a preclear intoexcellent two-way communication, and it is conceived a little difficult by"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!98L. RON HUBARDinstructors to relay the „process“ called Two-way Communication.However, it is actually simplicity itself, for all that is necessary is to getthe preclear to actually volunteer communication and answer thecommunications volunteered to him. There is always something thepreclear will talk about.Mimicry, particularly when used on psychotics, is a precisionsubject. Mimicry is not a new process, it is almost as old as psycho-therapy, but it is spotty when used without an intimate knowledge ofvalidation. It can be said that that which one validates comes true. Theonly force or strength Life has is that which derives directly from theupper echelon of Understanding. When Life gets down to a point whereit is incomprehensible it cannot relay any understanding. Understandingthis is essential for an auditor. He must realize that he gives power toeverything he validates. We made some thing important out of theengram, and by validating engrams, we actually, where they wereaudited poorly, gave force and power to engrams. Thus it is with thepsychotic. To mimic the strange, peculiar, bizarre and unusual things hedoes is to give force and strength to those things. It cannot be saidwith sufficient emphasis that the auditor must never mimic the strange,bizarre and unusual manifestations of the psychotic. The only way thatthe auditor can make mimicry work consistently and continually andrapidly, is by validating what the environment considers the agreed-upon, the usual, the routine, the ordinary. Perhaps the psychotic istwisting his hands madly, and occasionally nodding slightly. The auditor,to mimic him, would not twist his hands, but would nod slightly, since anod is the agreed-upon manifestation in the environment, not thetwisting of hands. If the auditor does this, the preclear will begin to nodmore and twist his hands less. If the auditor were to begin to mimic thepsychotic by twisting hands, he would discover that the psychoticwould probably stop twisting his hands, but would do something elsemore bizarre. And if the auditor mimics this much more bizarre thing,the psychotic will simply go on to something even wilder or mightbecome entirely motionless, for the one fear the psychotic has isbecoming predictable. The psychotic is under the control of entities,demon-circuits. He does have a grain of sanity present, otherwise hewould not be able to function at all. Therefore, those things which hedoes which are sane must be mimicked and so reinforced. If an auditorknows this thoroughly and practices it smartly he will discover thatpsychotics can be brought into two-way communication and moved"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!99L. RON HUBARDimmediately into Opening Procedure of 8-C, the proper process forpsychotics. 8-C, while not a psychotic process, does work onpsychotics. However, in working Opening Procedure of 8-C on thepsychotic, the auditor must be very careful not to go beyond part „a“for a long, long time.From the process known as „Two-way Communication“ we moveon to the process known as „Elementary Straightwire.“ ElementaryStraightwire has two basic commands. One of these commands is usedcontinually, over, and over, and over, and over, until the communicationlag is entirely flat on it and then the other command is used over, andover, and over until the communication lag is entirely flat, at which timeit will be discovered that the first command will now give communicationlag. And so it is used over, and over, and over, and then the secondone is used over, and over, and over. In other words, what we do hereis to use this process of Elementary Straightwire with just twocommands, continually, one command at a time, flattening eachcommunication lag encountered. While one is doing this, of course, onemaintains two-way communication. He acknowledges the fact that thepreclear has recalled something and is in general alert to receive fromthe preclear an originated communication, answer it, and give furtherorders. The two commands of Elementary Straightwire are: „Give mesomething you wouldn’t mind remembering,“ „Give me something youwouldn’t mind forgetting.“ This can be varied with: „Tell me somethingyou wouldn’t mind remembering,“ „Tell me something you wouldn’tmind forgetting.“ This Elementary Straightwire is a standard form. If it isvaried it should be varied towards simplicity. A simple form ofstraightwire is „Remember something,“ over and over, again, andagain, and again, and again, and again. Do not use, however, „Forgetsomething,“ since this is far too rough for the preclear. Another evensimpler form is to apply „Remember something“ to the Dynamics, suchas „Remember a man,“ „Remember a group.“ The only error that can bemade in Elementary Straightwire is to get too fancy, for one does notbelieve that an auditor who has advanced this far in auditing wouldmake an error in communication. There is an entire gamut which we call„The next to the last list in Self-Analysis“ published in the originaledition of „Self-Analysis“ which has many times been known to break aperson from a neurotic to a sane state. This is: „Can you recall a timethat is really real to you?“ „Can you recall a time when you werecommunicating well to someone?“ „Can you recall a time when"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!100L. RON HUBARDsomeone was communicating well to you?“ „Can you recall a time whenyou felt Affinity for someone?“ „Can you recall a time when someonefelt Affinity for you?“ By keeping this in the Understanding or Affinity linea case advances more rapidly than if mis-emotion and other factors areaddressed.Opening Procedure of 8-C is one of the most effective andpowerful processes ever developed and should be recognized andused as such. The main error which is made in the Opening Procedureof 8-C is not to do it long enough. It takes about 15 hours of OpeningProcedure of 8-C in order to bring a person into a completely relaxedand Self-Determined state of mind regarding orders. OpeningProcedure of 8-C is a precision process. Step „a“ of Opening Procedureof 8-C is „Do you see that object?“ the auditor pointing. When thepreclear signifies that he does, the auditor says, „Walk over to it.“When the preclear has walked over to it, the auditor says, „Touch it.“When the preclear does, the auditor says, „Let go,“ and designatesanother object – a wall, a lamp – calls it by name or not, and goesthrough the same procedure once more. It is important that the auditorspecifically acknowledge each time the preclear has executed thecommand given. When the preclear has seen the object, when he haswalked over to it, when he has touched it, when he has let go – eachtime the auditor signifies that he has perceived and does acknowledgethis action on the part of the preclear. This Step „a“ is used until thepreclear does it easily, smoothly, without the slightest variation orintroduction of any physical communication lag, and has demonstratedcompletely that he has no upset feeling about the auditor or objects inthe room.When „a“ has been run for a length of time necessary to bringthe case up tone, Part „b“ is run. Part „b“ introduces the idea ofdecision. It is notable that the „One-Shot Clear“ must be very strong onthis power of decision. It is also notable that a person in extremely badcondition has no power of decision. The commands of Part „b“ are:„Pick a spot in this room,“ and when the preclear has: „Walk over to it,“and when the preclear does: „Put your finger on it,“ and when thepreclear has: „Let go.“ Each time, the auditor acknowledges thecompletion of the command by the preclear, signifying „All right,“ „O.K.,“or „Fine,“ making it very plain that he has noticed and approves of andis acknowledging the preclear in following each specific command. Heapproves of these one at a time in this fashion. The preclear is run on"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!101L. RON HUBARDthis until he demonstrates no physical communication lag of any kind inmaking up his mind what to touch, how to touch it, and so forth.Part „c“ of Opening Procedure of 8-C introduces further decision.It goes as follows: the auditor says, „Pick a spot in this room,“ andwhen the preclear has, the auditor says „Walk over to it.“ When thepreclear does, the auditor says, „Make up your mind when you aregoing to place your finger on it, and do so.“ When the preclear has, theauditor says, „Make up your mind when you are going to let go, and letgo.“ The auditor each time acknowledges the completion of one ofthese orders to the preclear.In doing Opening Procedure of 8-C the preclear must not bepermitted to execute a command before it is given, and a two-waycommunication must be maintained. As I have said, Opening Procedureof 8-C is a very powerful process. If all auditors knew how to do thisOpening Procedure of 8-C and could do this very well, we would rightthere have psycho-therapy licked. But we are not trying to lick psycho-therapy. It has never been a major problem to us. We are trying tobring people a long way further North than psycho-therapy everdreamed of, and Dianetics and Scientology are not psycho-therapies,they are processes which increase the abilities of people.Opening Procedure by Duplication has as its goal the separatingof time, moment from moment. This is done by getting a preclear toduplicate the same action over and over again with two dissimilarobjects. In England this process is called „Book and Bottle,“ probablybecause these two familiar objects are the most used in doing OpeningProcedure by Duplication.The first step in Opening Procedure by Duplication is to familiarizethe preclear with beth objects, as to their reality and his ability to ownthem. One makes himself handle them, and feel them, and acquainthimself with them, makes him describe them as objects he isexperiencing in present time, not as something related into the past. Alittle time spent on this can be quite beneficial.The auditor then begins what will become to the preclear beforehe is through with this some of the most hated phrases anyone couldconceive, but which, by the time the preclear is finished with this,become just like any other phrases. Many people believe that openingProcedure by Duplication induces hypnosis. This is because in running ithypnotism runs off: the preclear, while the hypnotism is running off,"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!102L. RON HUBARDmay feel quite hypnotized. It is the exact reverse of hypnotism.Hypnotism is an effort to persuade the individual to do nothing, to sitstill, and to accept fully the inflow. Opening Procedure by Duplicationcontains two-way communication, and indeed does not work unlesstwo-way communication is done with it. The main liability in doing two-way communication on Opening Procedure by Duplication is that theauditor, in introducing two-way communication to it, may strayconsiderably from the pattern laid down. He must not do this. Althoughhe is maintaining two-way communication he must adhere very sharplyto the process. He can make the preclear tell more about them, he canmake the preclear describe various things which are manifestingthemselves to the preclear; he can be insistent the preclear reallyknows he has just picked this up, but he must stay with this sequenceof auditing commands, and may not vary from them even vaguely. Hecan interject other conversation, but not other auditing commands, intoOpening Procedure by Duplication.The auditing commands are: „Do you see that book?“ says theauditor, pointing. When the preclear signifies that he has, the auditorsays, „Walk over to it.“ When the preclear does, the auditor says, „Pickit up.“ When the preclear does, the auditor says, „Look at it.“ When thepreclear does (usually he was looking at it but now looks at it moreclosely) the auditor says, „Give me its color.“ When the preclear does,the auditor says, „Give me its weight.“ When the preclear does, theauditor says, „Give me its temperature.“ When the preclear has, theauditor says, „Put it back exactly as you found it.“ This action sequencehaving been completed, the auditor points to the bottle. „Do you seethat bottle?“ When the preclear does, the auditor says, „Walk over toit.“ When the preclear does, the auditor says, „Pick it up.“ When thepreclear has, the auditor says, „Look at it.“ When the preclear does,the auditor says, „Give me its color.“ When the preclear has, theauditor says, „Give me its weight.“ When the preclear has, the auditorsays, „Give me its temperature.“ When the preclear has, the auditorsays, „Put it back exactly as you found it.“ Then the auditor says,pointing out the book, „Do you see that book?“ and so on, back andforth, using this exact sequence of commands. The auditor can interject„Describe it more fully.“ The auditor can sometimes, but not oftenerthan once every 15 minutes, point to the book, have the preclear gothrough the full sequence with the book, and then point to the bookagain, and have the preclear once more go through the full sequence"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!103L. RON HUBARDwith the book. This will break down the automatic machinery a preclearis bound to set up to compensate for this process. We want to keepthe preclear doing it, not his machines. By asking the preclear todescribe the object, or describe its temperature more fully in its propersequence in these commands, machines are also broken down and thealertness and the awareness of the preclear is increased.The auditor must not omit letting the preclear give him thepreclear’s reaction. The preclear will pause, seem to be confused. It isup to the auditor at that moment to say, „What happened?“ and to findout what happened, and then to continue with the process, havingacknowledged the communication of the preclear. An auditor mustnever be afraid to let a preclear emanate a communication, and anauditor must never fail to acknowledge the completion of an auditingaction, no matter how minute.The Remedy of Havingness is an extremely effective process for itremedies the ability of the preclear to have or not have at will.Sometimes auditors interpret this process as inflow, only. That isbecause the physical universe is an inflow universe, and it is all tooeasy for an auditor to assign to auditing and all other actions inflowcharacteristics only.The modus operandi of the Remedy of Havingness is to have thepreclear mock up something, pull it in, or mock up something and throwit away. It does not matter what you have him mock up. The item canhave significance or not as the case may be. Preclears who are low intone, if this is run on them, have a tendency to make everything theymock very significant. It is not the significance, it is the mass thatcounts. However, to keep the preclear interested, or to assist hismocking up, an auditor may designate specific things, and does so.It will be found that the acceptance level and expectance level ofthe preclear very definitely monitor what he mocks up, and what he canpull in and what he can throw away. As covered in the ProfessionalAuditor’s Bulletins, acceptance level processes can be combined withthe Remedy of Havingness.The commands of Remedy of Havingness are as follows: „Mock upa (planet, man, brick).“ „Make a copy of it.“ „Make a copy of it.“ „Make acopy of it.“ And when the preclear has from five to 15 copies, „Pushthem all together.“ „Now pull them in on you.“ When the preclear hasdone this for some time, the last command is varied by saying, „Throw"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!104L. RON HUBARDthem away and have them disappear in the distance.“ In other words,we have the preclear mock up something, and when he has we havehim make a copy of it, make another copy, and another copy, andanother copy, one at a time, push them together and pull them in orthrow them away.We keep up this process for some time until we are very certainthat he can actually throw things away or pull them in on himself at will.This is the Remedy of Havingness. Remedy of Havingness does notmean stuffing the preclear with energy. It means remedying his abilityto have or not have energy. Run with particular significances such asmoney, women, et cetera, one could remedy specific scarcities on thepart of the preclear. But remember that at first they may be so scarcethat at first he may have to waste a large quantity of them before hecan have one.On an awareness of awareness unit exteriorized we run Remedyof Havingness, but a little differently. We say, „Put up eight anchorpoints.“ We describe to him how we want these put up. We want themput up in such a way as to form the corners of a cube. In other words,these eight anchor points are not put in a group in front of or behindthe preclear, they are to be distributed around him. When the preclearhas done this we say, „Pull them into you.“ We keep this up for a longtime. We also have the preclear exteriorized mock up eight anchorpoints and send them away from him. A preclear exteriorized can bevery unhappy about his lack of havingness and this last process is usedto remedy this upset.Remedy of Havingness is an exteriorization technique. If it is runon an individual long enough, say eight or ten hours, he will probablyexteriorize at the end of that time. If you kept on running it as anexteriorized process, given in the second part above, he would thenhave his visio clear up, and he would finally get into very excellentcondition. This is quite a process. However, remember this processdepends upon the preclear following the auditor’s orders. Unless theauditor has guaranteed this by Opening Procedure of 8-C and OpeningProcedure by Duplication, the chances of the preclear’s actuallyfollowing his orders (although pretending to do so) are very slim. Wediscovered in old-time Dianetics that the breakdown was in the preclearfailing to follow the auditor’s orders. Preclears would pretend to followan auditor’s orders but actually would not."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!105L. RON HUBARDThe process known as Spotting Spots in Space is not to beattempted on somebody who is having a difficult time, and when it isattempted it should be accompanied with Remedy of Havingness. Onemakes a person spot spots in space for a short time, then remediesHavingness, makes them spot spots in space, then remediesHavingness, then spot spots in space. These two processes,Remedying Havingness and Spot Spots in Space actually belongtogether, however the preclear eventually emerges up in a higher bandwhere he can spot spots in space without remedying Havingness.The auditing commands are: „Spot a spot in the space of thisroom.“ When the preclear has, the auditor says, „Spot another spot,“etc. When the preclear gets well into the process in this fashion wesay, „Spot a spot in the space of this room.“ „Walk over to it,“ andwhen he has, „Put your finger on it.“ When he does, „Let go.“The auditor should ask the preclear when he starts this process ifthe spot has any mass, color, temperature, or any other characteristics,or „How big is it?“ The auditor asks this to make sure that the preclearis actually spotting a spot, a simple location, not a spot that has amass, temperature, or characteristics. A location is simply a location, itdoes not have mass, it does not have color, it does not have anytemperature. When we ask the preclear to spot a spot at first his spotsare liable to have mass and temperature. We do not object to this, wesimply ask him frequently, once we have discovered that his spots dohave this, how his spots are getting along, and we remember, on sucha preclear, that we must remedy havingness. Eventually he will moveout to a point where he is simply spotting locations.These are the Six Basic Processes that an auditor must know.They are all of them very powerful processes, and each and any one ofthem can accomplish the goals which were envisioned in „Dianetics:The Modern Science of Mental Health.“ The essence of these processesis to do them as given, to do them „purely,“ all the while maintaining atwo-way communication with the preclear. Auditors get into minorvariations on this set of processes, but these processes were evolvedfirst in theory by myself, were developed in practice by myself, andwere then given to many auditors to do, and many auditors weretrained in them, and then these processes were refined and inspecteduntil they represent a very broad agreement, and we have found thatthese commands, as you have them here, are the best commands"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!106L. RON HUBARDwhich can be used in processing a preclear. The failure of an auditor toduplicate, his unwillingness to duplicate, his upset about duplication ingeneral will quite often lead him up the blind alley of varying a processcompulsively or obsessively. When he does he can expect to lessen theresults. Auditing today, by the experience of a very large number ofauditors, is a very severe discipline on the individual. It is not an art,and it never will be an art. It is a precision science. In the old days, allthis talk about art and intuition and instinctiveness cost a lot ofpreclears the benefit of auditing. Auditing in the long ago wastremendously complicated but it was none the less precise. Now that itis very simple it is still very precise.Amongst these processes an understanding of communication lagand Opening Procedure of 8-C were chose as the two processes to betaught to a very large area which contained a large number of auditors.This area had been noteworthy, heretofore, for the strange results„obtained“ by auditors and the strange techniques which were used init. A couple of auditors were sent into this area to teach everybodycommunication lag and Opening Procedure of 8-C. Actually these twoauditors were originally from this area. They did so, and several liveshave been reported saved to date, and a great many cases have beensalvaged, and the entire science is looking up in that particular areasimply because the area was taught nothing but communication lagand the Opening Procedure of 8-C and did nothing thereafter but this.Out in the outskirts of this area a couple of auditors varied OpeningProcedure by Duplication and were reported to be having very goodluck with the variation, but these two auditors were not part of thecrew who were taught Opening Procedure of 8-C and communicationlag, and the results they are obtaining are very junior to the resultsobtained by their own fellows very close by.It could be said that the only real danger in auditing was failure.Auditing is the start, change and stop of aberration, or the creation ofability. Today creation of ability takes prominence to a point whereaberration drops out of sight and is forgotten. But the auditor whodoes not obtain results is demonstrating to himself that he cannotcontrol human aberration and human ability, and a demonstration of hisfailure to himself is sufficient to make him slightly incapable in handlinghis own difficulties. Thus it is a tremendously important thing that wehave processes which, when used exactly as given, and used with skill,produce uniformly good results on preclears. An auditor using these on"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!107L. RON HUBARDpreclears gets better, and better, and better, and better even when hedoesn’t have any auditing himself – a thing which was not the story in1950. When you can control aberration in others, when you canincrease the ability of others, you certainly do not worry about yourown. An auditor who has consistent failures will eventually drop back toself-auditing, but these processes will cure even that. Self-auditing, ofcourse, is the manifestation of going around running concepts orprocesses on one’s self. One is doing this because he has been madeafraid, through his failure on others, of his ability to control his ownengrams, facsimiles, thoughts and concepts, and he seeks to controlthem through auditing. It is not necessary for an individual to audithimself in order to control his own machinery.Before anyone should adventure in the direction of testing the„One-Shot-Clear“ or doing anything about exteriorizing the awarenessof awareness unit and so making a Clear, he should be entirelyconversant with these processes. Actually, any of these processes runlong enough would probably result in an exteriorization. There arefaster ways to achieve an exteriorization than these processes, butthese processes are preliminary to them. The preclear who cannotfollow the auditor’s orders will not sit there and do a subjective – whichis to say, an out-of-sight, in his own mind – process without varying it.The trouble with the preclear is that he cannot duplicate, he cannotfollow the orders of the auditor, and when the auditor tells him to run aconcept or a thought, the preclear probably pays token nod to this andruns entirely something else. A very close E-Meter review of a numberof preclears who were not advancing under „subjective processes“disclosed that each and every one of them had never run what theauditor told them to run. They were afraid of obeying the auditor, theywere afraid of what the auditor was doing, they were afraid of his skill.Opening Procedure of 8-C remedies this fear and brings the inabilityand unwillingness of the preclear out into the open where it belongs.In Opening Procedure by Duplication we very often get a preclear„blowing the session“ where the auditor has run an insufficientquantity of Opening Procedure of 8-C. When a preclear „blows thesession“ on Opening Procedure by Duplication, the auditor has missed.He has not run enough Opening Procedure of 8-C. How much is enoughOpening Procedure of 8-C? Until the person is in very good condition ashomo sapiens."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!108L. RON HUBARDRemember that whether the command is physical or mental, theauditor must observe communication lag. In Opening Procedure of 8-Che simply repeats the process command all the way through, and thenagain, and again and again and in such a way flattens any lag thatshows up. He does not repeat the command on which the preclear gotthe lag. It is easier to do this way, it is a more orderly process when itis done this way. By very close theory, the actual command on whichthe preclear lagged should be repeated again, but this is not done.These are the six basic processes which we must know before wecan constitute ourselves auditors. These are the processes which aregetting results. These are the processes which are making able menand able women.These processes can be varied into specific uses where ability isconcerned. One of the uses of these, for instance, would be to raisethe ability of a pilot to fly a plane, or a person to drive a car, simply byhaving him approach, touch, and let go of various parts of the object tobe controlled. The exact procedure as given above of OpeningProcedure is run, except that the object to be controlled is used.Typists have learned to type better, people have learned to drive carsbetter, and many other abilities have been recovered simply by running8-C. One could envision a pianist who was getting tired, run-down, orupset by his music, coming into full awareness of it once more simply byrunning 8-C on his instrument or instruments.If we wanted to increase the ability of a salesman, it would onlybe necessary to run any of the above processes in their proper positionon the tone scale to increase his ability. Abilities increase, in general,when these are run.When does one run what process? One should have a copy of theChart of Human Evaluation from „Science of Survival“ and know thatchart well in order to understand exactly where one starts. In generalpractice, however, an auditor simply starts with two-waycommunication, and when he is getting answers to his questions and istaking rather freely with his preclear he goes into ElementaryStraightwire, and from Elementary Straightwire he goes into OpeningProcedure of 8-C.There is a variation on two-way communication. If you have adifficulty in getting a preclear started in two-way communication it is avery easy thing to get him talking on problems, and from problems to"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!109L. RON HUBARDrun this one, „What problem could you be to yourself?“ „What problemcould you be to others?“ running one and then the other each timeuntil the preclear understood he could be an infinity of problems. Manypeople are so thoroughly scarce on problems that they will not let anygo until they know that they can create problems for themselves. Whena case is stalling, he is generally finding it very hard to give up a petproblem because he knows he can’t have any more. Of course, all thisis basically situated on answers. He can’t have any answers so he hasto have problems, then from problems he finally gets to a point wherehe can’t even have these.Anyone desiring to be a good auditor should follow this chaptervery closely, should provide himself with a copy of „The Creation ofHuman Ability,“ and should also procure „Science of Survival“ and studythem. The best way to become an auditor is to be trained as anauditor. We have found this so much the case that while we offered anexamination to anyone who wished to take it to the grade of HubbardCertified Auditor, or Hubbard Dianetic Auditor, we never expected themto pass it – for they never had, even though it was on the most simpleelements as you see before you. There is no substitute for goodtraining."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!110L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER XIIITHE PROCESSING OF COMMUNICATIONIf you will examine the Six Basic Processes you will discover thatthey are communication processes. The efficacy of 8-C derives from thefact that it places into the realm of knowingness communication withthe physical universe. The physical universe does not give us backanswers, but the Opening Procedure of 8-C remedies to a markeddegree the liability of this no-answer situation by making the individualaware of the fact that walls are simply walls, that chairs are chairs, andfloors floors, and ceilings ceilings. Opening Procedure by Duplication isprocessing another facet of communication: Terminals, the object(terminal) at Cause interchanging flow with the object (terminal) atEffect. Elementary Straightwire is simply a communication with the past,and securing of answers from the past, in other words, using the pastas a terminal. Havingness, in itself, describes the mass at a terminal, ormasses, and Spotting Spots in Space improves the tolerance of anabsence of a communication terminal.These Six Basic Processes, as designed, bring an individual up agradient scale of tolerance for more and more communication. Once apreclear has been pressed through these he is ready for the directprocessing of communication. He is not ready for the direct processingof communication until he has been put through these Six BasicProcesses.The ability of an individual depends upon his ability tocommunicate. The first and foremost of mechanical abilities is thiscommunication ability. An individual who cannot communicate withsomething will become the victim of that something. That which aperson withdraws from in this universe becomes, to a marked degree,his master. That which one fears becomes one’s master. If an individualwere willing to communicate with anything and everything in the entireuniverse he would then be free in the entire universe. Additionally, hewould have an unlimited supply of distances and terminals. A barrier,perforce, is something which an individual cannot communicate beyond.When we see space as a barrier, its total operation as a barrier is theinability of the individual to be at the other extreme end of that space"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!111L. RON HUBARDor outside that space. When we see energy as a barrier, we simply seeit as something which will not permit the egress or ingress of anindividual. When we see mass, walls or time as a barrier, we mean„imagined impossibility of communication.“ If you do not imagine thatyou cannot communicate, then there cannot be a barrier.At the same time we are placed up against this conundrum: in theabsence of communication, in the absence of interchanges ofcommunication, in the absence of other terminals, flows, and terminalsto which others can communicate, an awareness of awareness unit isnot, by its own consideration, living. Livingness is communication.Communication is livingness. We add to this the variant degrees ofAffinity. We add to it Agreements and attain Reality, but still these areonly significances entered into communication. Any and all types ofsignificances can be entered into communication in order to „give areason for“ communication. These „reasons for“ are simply reasons fora game, reasons to have communication.In the light of the concept of Pan-Determinism we see that anindividual has to assume that he cannot know what another is talkingabout if he wishes to communicate with and depend upon thecommunications of that other. In other words, he has to pretend hecannot communicate. An individual who has some sort of barrier aroundhim must pretend that he cannot communicate beyond that barrier.Actually this is nothing more nor less than a pretence. These barriersare the shadows through which the fish would not move. They couldhave swum through these shadows except for the fact that they didnot believe they could penetrate beyond the shadows. It could be saidthat belief alone is the reason for any entrapment.However, there are the mechanics of entrapment and we discoverthat an entrapment must be a communication barrier. An individualbecomes entrapped in something because he does not believe he cancommunicate outside of it, or he becomes fixated on a terminal as aterminal himself.To be very precise, the reason why an individual is entrapped hasto do with scarcity of communication. An individual is still waiting, is stilllooking towards something, expecting it to communicate to him. It hasnot, and he has eventually turned his attention slightly off of this ontosomething else which he expects to communicate to him. And when thisdoes not, he expects communication and so finds it elsewhere, but"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!112L. RON HUBARDeach time he sets up one of these expectancy lines he is to that tinydegree trapped against the terminal from which he was expecting butdid not get communication. Thus, we have the entire bundle known asthe reactive mind, the entire anatomy of ridges, and any otherenturbulative mechanism, and even problems themselves, being aseemingly endless chain of communication scarcities.What are the specific scarcities in a communication line? There isno scarcity of silence. Anyone has far too much silence. Silence might beconceived to be the native state of a thetan – an awareness ofawareness unit – but it is not, for obviously a thetan is alive only to thedegree that he is communicating, is action – concentrated only to thedegree that he is living. We discover that the tiny cells of the bodyconsider themselves to be the very mirrors of truth when they are themost silent. There is an interesting and peculiar test here where theauditor has the preclear mock up in any area which contains a somatica great many answers or originated communications from these „deadcells“ and we discover this somatic-ridden area coming to life, wakingup, becoming active once more. This in itself is a specific for all types ofsomatics. All one has to do is to have the preclear mock up answers inthese dead cell areas. An ultimate truth, which is studied to a fargreater extent in „The Creation of Human Ability“, is a Nothingness, butthis ultimate truth is not Life. Life is composed of this pretence that onecannot communicate, that one must communicate. It is composed ofthis intricate tangle of communications and self-erected barriers whichgive us games. When we get too deeply immersed in this game, whenanswers get entirely too scarce, we forget that we were the one whointerposed the idea that no answers were to be given.Silences do not process. There is entirely too much silence on thetrack. Remember that: it does not process. You can fill silence, butsilence itself is death. When you process silence you process thepreclear down towards death, not upward towards life. The way toprocess him upward towards life is by supplying abundance ofcommunication. We find the preclears who are in the worst conditionare the preclears who are the most silent, the most out ofcommunication. These are the closest to death, closest to aberration.The way to get them alive again is to remedy some of the scarcity ofcommunication. For a preclear who is in very bad shape, or in commonpractice, any preclear you would encounter, you would use first the SixBasic Steps in order to bring the individual up to something"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!113L. RON HUBARDapproaching a livable communication strata. And then you would goimmediately into the remedy of scarcity of communication by having himmock up himself, even if just as ideas, the various parts of a two-waycycle of communication.The parts of a communication cycle that have to be remedied are:(1) originated communications, (2) people to communicate to, or otherawareness of awareness units to communicate to, (3) answers, (4)acknowledgements, and additionally, but not as important, (5) arrivals,(6) departures.It is not necessary that the preclear have the ability to mock up orput out and hear back sound. In other words, sonic and visio are netnecessary to this process. The entirety necessary is the idea ofcommunication. You might say you have him mock up a „verbalizingidea.“A preclear will sort through, himself, pads (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6)if the preclear is simply told to „mock up some people speaking.“ Hewill, in rotation, get people answering, people acknowledging, peoplegreeting him, and people saying goodby to him. Because the preclear isusually far down the Tone-Scale on origin and ideas, and because„necessity level,“ other determined forces, have been necessary to gethim into communication, it is likely that he will not, himself, spot theorigination of communication, and the auditor will have to call hisattention to this.Remember this is not done on a preclear who has not first beenput through his paces on the Six Basic Processes, for an auditor sittingthere asking the preclear to mock up answers, or acknowledgements,or originated communications could not otherwise be sure that thepreclear is doing this at all. Further, the preclear’s attention is verylikely to stray into various portions of his own bank, for his bank startsto come to pieces under the impact of all these communications.The preclear must be kept at his job. His mocking up ofcommunications must be kept at a simplicity and out of deepsignificances, and if his attention seems to fixate upon flows and hebegins to „wrestle with mass,“ the auditor should get him back intomocking up communication as fast as possible.What degree of originality is required of a preclear in mocking upany of these originative communications, answers, or nowledgements?"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!114L. RON HUBARDThe answer to this is „none.“ No variety is necessary whatsoever.Simply the idea of communication, with some sort of a specific ideabeing communicated, is all that is necessary. Having the preclear, silenthimself, mock up before him something saying „Hello,“ and saying„Hello“ again, and saying „Hello“ again, and having him mock this upbehind him saying „Hello,“ and saying „Hello,“ and saying „Hello,“would be quite adequate for an originated communication. Having thepreclear mock up any banality such as „All right,“ or „O.K.,“ serves verywell for both answers and acknowledgements. We are not at allconcerned with the significance of the communication. We do not wantlong and involved communications. The preclear will try to get off intothem. He will also try to get into his prenatal bank, his early childhood,and eight lives ago. We do not want him to do this, we want him to goon mocking up originated communications, answers,acknowledgements. We are validating ability, we are not trying to getrid of inabilities in his past. We are trying to increase his ability tocommunicate in the present, and originate communications, and take aPan-Determinism out of all communicating terminals. We are not tryingto get him to run out anything in the past. I know that an oldDianeticist is going to have a very hard time restraining himself fromrunning out the prenatal which immediately appears after the preclearhas made something say „Hello“ to him 15 or 20 times. It is theauditor’s job to make the preclear go on having the preclear orsomething say „Hello“ or „Okay,“ or „I did it,“ and to ignore thatengram. The number of engrams which will blow into view and beg tobe run are countless. The auditor is not interested in these. Of course,if the preclear wants to ten the auditor about these, the auditor mustpermit the preclear to originate communication and must answer itsimply to get the preclear to originate communication. He should not letthe preclear go on, and on, and on discussing what has occurred, oncethe preclear has told him the essentials of it. The auditor wants to getthe preclear back onto mocking up originating communications, answersand acknowledgements. The auditor is also making the preclear mockup something to talk to while he is doing this, a point which is cared forautomatically and which is not addressed actually and actively inauditing. Naturally, if there is a spot in the air out there saying „Hello,“or „Okay,“ or „I did it,“ the preclear is assuming that there is somethingalive there that can say „Hello“ to him."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!115L. RON HUBARDAll manner of thinkingness machines, large black masses, whiteand green fire, purple spheres, falling stars, shotting rockets, mayappear in the preclear’s bank while he is undergoing this process. Theauditor is not interested in this phenomenon, he is merely interested ingetting the preclear to mock up further communication.It does not matter if the preclear says these communicationshimself aloud or simply does them quietly to himself. The necessity hereis not sound. Sound is a by-product of communication. It is the carrierwave of communication and is not itself communication.Some interesting variations can be worked on this, but they arenot advised, and indeed they violate the terms of this process, but theydemonstrate how much power this process has. One has the preclearsay aloud, „Okay, Mamma,“ a few hundred times. He will be amazed atthe amount of variation which will occur, the communication lags, theimpatience, the anger, the amount of data which will jump up aboutMamma. But this data that is jumping up is simply the bank which istriggered to agree with what the preclear is doing at this moment. Inother words, that is stimulus response. Restimulation is stimulus-response and is covered in great detail in „Dianetics: The ModernScience of Mental Health.“ We could clear away an ally, we could doalmost anything we wanted to do in Book One with this process ofremedying the scarcity of communications.Another point immediately arises, as to whether or notHavingness has to be remedied on the preclear. It has not been foundnecessary to remedy havingness on the preclear if one is actuallyremedying the scarcity of communication. This is a great oddity, for thepreclear’s bank, being composed of tangled and unfinishedcommunication lines, starts to come apart the moment you begin toremedy the scarcity of originated communications, answers, andacknowledgements. Some of these black masses which the preclearhas fondly held before his face blow into forever, and yet the precleardoes not need his mass remedied. The reason why he had to havemass was to compensate for the lack of communication. Where youhave had a lack of communication you are liable to have a mass. As anexample of this, an individual loses an ally and then keeps close by hima ring which belonged to that ally. The ring is a substitutecommunication terminal for the ally. After a while one begins to believethat he really has to have mass; he doesn’t have to have mass at all."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!116L. RON HUBARDThe remedy of the scarcity of communications cures a person of havingto have mass, having to eat obsessively, or do anything elseobsessively.Along with the remedy of originated communications, thepreclear’s imagination rises quite markedly, and thus he is able toimagine new games and new ways of communication with sufficientrapidity to compensate for the old games which you are taking awayfrom him. Actually the preclear, being a preclear, is a game, perhapseven the last last-ditch game in which the individual could engage.When the auditor has the preclear run acknowledgements, thewording is: „I did it.“ This will remedy responsibility difficulties. Allautomaticity comes about through lack of acknowledgements (absentplayers, secret players).In view of the fact that Pan-Determinism is control on allDynamics, and in view of the fact that control is start, change and stop,one can have the preclear stop making things communicate for amoment, and then change the communication, and then start anew.This gives the preclear practice in starting, changing and stopping.The auditing command which would go with this is simply, „Mockup some answers,“ „Mock up some original communications.“ „Mock upsome acknowledgements,“ with enough guiding talk to give thepreclear the idea that you do not want new, startling, difficult actionbut only the simple placing of communication ideas such as „Hello“ inthe vicinity of the preclear over, and over, and over, and over.The exact auditing commands to process communications are:Originated Communications: Auditor: „Have somebody out there,“(indicating a spot in the air) „start saying ‘Hello’ to you.“ The precleardoes so, is himself silent. When the process is long run: Auditor: „Startsaying ‘Hello’ to a live spot out there.“ The preclear aloud, or as himself,does so.Answers: Auditor: „Have a spot out there start saying ‘Okay’ toyou.“ The preclear does this many times. Auditor: „Start saying ‘Okay’to a spot out there.“Acknowledgements: Auditor: „Have a spot out there start saying‘I did it’.“ When the preclear has, many, many times: Auditor: „Startsaying ‘I did it’ to a spot out there.“"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!117L. RON HUBARDThe command that turns on a somatic, repeated often enough,will turn it off.When in doubt, remedy havingness.This is the processing of communication directly. Remember that itis done after one has already done the Six Basic Processes. Rememberthat a two-way communication is maintained with the preclear while itis being done, and remember that the preclear must be audited in fullunderstanding and practice of the Auditor’s Code, 1954."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!118L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER XIVTHE ONE-SHOT CLEARThe goal of the „One-Shot Clear“ has been with us since theearliest days of Dianetics. By „One-shot Clear“ we meant one phrase orone action given once, or repeated, which would bring into being theClear as described in „Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,“Chapter II.It should be understood by this time that the Clear described in„Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,“ Chapter II, is actuallythe thetan exterior of Scientology. The way to clear somebody is to gethim out of the influence of his reactive bank and his analyticalmachinery. When a person is so cleared, his level of knowingness issufficient to overcome the need of machinery, and the need of stimulus-response mechanisms as contained in his reactive mind.Long since we have had a „One-Shot Clear“ for 50 per cent of thehuman race. All we say to the individual is, „Be three feet back of yourhead.“ If he is, he orients himself, he knows that he is not his body, heknows he does not have to be up against his reactive mind, he hasbeen gotten out of the trap. Of course, there are many other thingswhich you could do to further increase his ability and orient him in thisposition, but this is not immediately in our province in Dianetics. Whenan individual is so exteriorized he also can look over the body andpatch up pinched nerves, black areas, rearrange the anchor pointswhich create and hold the space of the body, and so repair a bodyquite excellently. However, it is not the purpose of exteriorizationsimply to get a person to square away the machine known as the body.“Be three feet back of your head“ is a strange and interestingcombination of words. Evidently this simple combination has not beenknown before by Man. It is notable that one does not say, „Move threefeet back of your head,“ since an awareness of awareness unit doesnot move, it appears and disappears from locations.If one uses this „One-Shot Clear“ technique, he should beadvised that he must not ask or expect of the newly exteriorizedperson a number of strange or impossible things. He must not ask him"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!119L. RON HUBARDto go chasing around finding things. He must not ask him to prove thathe is exteriorized. The individual says so – that’s the end of it. InScientology, of course, on Route 1, as contained in „The Creation ofHuman Ability,“ we go on to improve the ability of this exteriorizedawareness of awareness unit up to a point we call „Operating Thetan.“We do this by running many drills and exercises which improve hisperception. However, the process of Answers, or even the Six BasicProcesses could be run on the individual after he is exteriorized and hisexteriorization will markedly increase, and he will get into even bettercondition as an exteriorized person. If you were to say „Be three feetback of your head“ to somebody, and he was, the next thing to dowould be to go into Elementary Straightwire and then into OpeningProcedure of 8-C, then Opening Procedure by Duplication, then Remedyof Havingness, then Spotting Spots in Space, and then Answers, or, asthe last chapter gives forth, „Remedy of Communication.“ If you didthese things just as given in this book you would have something like astable Clear. You would pay no attention to the fact that he was Clear.As a matter of fact, if you were to run any of these Six Basic processeslong enough, and certainly if you were to run answers for any length oftime after you have run these Six Basic Processes, you would havesomebody exteriorized. It is a peculiar thing that there is no argumentabout exteriorization. Any argument which has been in existence wasborn out of the psychiatrist’s observation of „compulsiveexteriorization“ by an individual who so detested his body that hestayed outside of it. Psychiatrists have been known to give peopleelectric shocks and other „treatments“ to get them to get back insidetheir bodies. This level of punishment, trying to get a person to acceptsomething under duress, does not work. But then, nothing in psychiatryever worked, except bank accounts. This „compulsive exteriorization“ isa manifestation which we call in Scientology „doing a bunk,“ in otherwords, „running away.“ You will occasionally encounter this, but you willnot encounter it if you run the six Basic Processes before you go in forexteriorization.There is, astonishingly enough, a „One-Command Clear“ for theremaining 50 per cent, even if it has to be repeated many times. I havebeen developing and testing this for some time, and have kept it backon the shelf against a time when we had enough competent auditorsto use the process intelligently."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!120L. RON HUBARDThis is a „One-Shot Clear“ technique in that one uses onecommand and so achieves clearing, and after clearing to the stage ofexteriorization has been accomplished, one simply goes on using thesame type of command. It is a highly effective process, a very violentprocess. Theoretically it should work on any level of case. In actualpractice psychotic, neurotic cases, or people badly out of communicationreceive it with considerable difficulty and it is not recommended forthem, but it would work on them if it could be communicated to them.(On such people use Opening Procedure of 8-C, only.)The basis for this process is the observation that the MESTuniverse is a game. One can have a game and know it. He can be in agame and not know it. The difference is his determinism.Games require space and havingness. A game requires otherplayers. Games also require skill and knowingness that they aregames.Havingness is the need to have terminals and things to play forand on.When a game is done the player keeps around tokens. These arehopes the game will start again. When that hope is dead the token,the terminal, is hidden. And it becomes an automaticity – a game goingon below the level of knowingness. Truthfully, one never stops playingany game once started. He plays old games in secret – even fromhimself – while playing or not playing new ones. The only real gameone can have is in present time. All others are in the past. Anxiety for agame takes one into the past.The command is, „Invent a game“ and when the preclear has,again, „Invent a game.“ Then: „Mock up somebody else inventing agame.“Having established the fact that an auditing session is inprogress, and established some slight communication with the preclear,the auditor says, „Invent a game.“ When the communication lag on thisis flat the auditor then uses the command, „Mock up somebody elseinventing a game.“ This is the only phrase he utters, but he of courseengages in two-way communication with the preclear when thepreclear has something to say to him. An auditor has to be a goodauditor in order to use this process. Just because it is a simple „one-command“ process is no reason why it will work for an auditor who is"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!121L. RON HUBARDnot cognizant of the Auditor’s Code, cognizant of a two-waycommunication and has some experience in more basic levels ofprocessing.We use this process as a remedy for the scarcity of games andwe use it in full awareness of the processes involved in two-waycommunication.It is a murderous process and requires five or ten hours in roughcases to bring about an understanding of existence.This is not necessarily a recommended process. It is a workableprocess, it does function, it is fast, but remember that it has the frailtyof the ability of the auditor himself. It has the frailty of failing when atwo-way communication is not maintained with the preclear, it will fail ifthe preclear in volunteering information finds no attention from theauditor, it will fall if the auditor does not acknowledge the fact that thepreclear has done this. But, if these things are considered, it will work.This process can be abused by the preclear. He can wander fromit. He can sit there in the auditing chair doing other things, but wedepend upon the skill of the auditor to see that the preclear is notdoing other things, and that he is actually doing the process.The preclear will „pick his bank clean“ rather than invent, he willhave doubts that he is inventing. But we persevere – and we win."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!122L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER XVARC PROCESSINGIf we examine communication we will discover that allcommunication lag is the introduction of Matter, Energy, Space and Timeinto communication. The more time has been introduced intocommunication, the less communication there is.As an example of this let us say that a star in some other galaxyexplodes, and then let us trace the length of time necessary for a smallamount of that explosion’s particles to reach earth across great space.Almost countless light-years elapse before this communication line hasbeen completed. This is a very, very long communication. Notnecessarily a communication lag since the progress of the particles isnot interrupted. There are no VIAs. Actually, MEST itself does not havea communication lag, it is totally a communication lag.The more of this sort of thing enters into communication, theworse off is the preclear. Thus we can see that the subject of MESTitself is the aberrative factor.As we examine barriers, we find that they are Matter, Energy,Space and Time. We discover that we can overcome the barriers ofMatter, we can climb walls or go through them. We can somehow orother brave or get on the other side of energy barriers. We discoverthat even space has its limitations even when it appears as limitless asthe space of this universe (and the space of this universe appears asbig as a person supposes it is big, whereas actually it is, to a thetanwho can get outside of it, about the size of a matchbox to a child). Theone barrier which we discover difficult to get around is Time.The basic definition and understanding of Matter, Energy, Spaceand Time are not particularly germane in this place. They are taken upon a much higher theoretical level in Scientology, but the essence oftime is that it is measured or marked by the motion of particles inspace. Space and energy particles are necessary to have mechanicaltime, but what is time, basically? Time is actually a consideration. Thereis time because one considers there is time."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!123L. RON HUBARDYou must examine the physical universe very closely to discoverthat the reason it is always here is because it is, each particle of it,each cubic inch of space of it, in forever. The physical universe is notmoving through time, it is stuck in time. Each and every part of it is fixedin a now which lasts forever. The only real changes which take place inthe physical universe are those introduced into it by Life. We can argueabout this if we want to but we are interested there in a concept whichleads towards a workable process.We discover that time exists for the individual to the degree thatthe individual makes time. Time is an other-determined thing to nearlyeveryone alive. He depends on clocks, he depends on the rising andsetting of the sun, he depends on all manner of mechanisms to tell himwhat is the time. Actually the more a person is told what the time is,the more he gets into a dependency upon some other consideration,and so he drops into forever. When he stops considering that he ismaking time, when he stops making time by considerations, he isdropping himself into a foreverness. He has less and less motion, hehas less and less determinism. Time is a very insidious barrier becauseits apparency would tell an individual that time is created by themovement of things. Actually it is not, it is created by a considerationthat things are moving.The remedy of the barrier of time produces an astonishing effectupon a preclear. When the auditor is auditing one of these two „One-Shot Clear“ commands (the one given in the last chapter and the onegiven in this chapter) he will stumble across quite a bit of complicationon the subject of time. An individual told to have some complications bydecisions will eventually move out into the fact that the mostcomplicated thing he can get into is time, and so this is a verysatisfactory game. We can process this factor directly.This process is the essence of simplicity. It has one command. Thecommand is „Make some time.“ This is all the command there is. Onedoes not advise or teach the preclear how to make some time. Oneaccepts whatever the preclear decides makes time as the answer. Onemaintains the two-way communication with the preclear, and answerscomments which the preclear has on it. One carefully does not evaluatefor the preclear and tell him how to make some time. One does not setan example in making time. One simply has the preclear make sometime."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!124L. RON HUBARDThis process on some cases has to be run many hours before thepreclear comes into partial control of the barrier of time. When he doesthis he of course comes into some control of his engram bank and hisconsiderations.The making of time naturally puts into motion all those silent ormotionless masses which are hanging to the preclear and whichactually pin together his reactive bank.This is an enormous joke upon the preclear by himself and theuniverse that he makes all the time he will ever perceive. He cannotpossibly get out of phase with „forever“ if he is in contact with theforeverness of the space and energy mass of which this universe iscomposed. When he starts to protest against the universe at large hestarts to protest against the foreverness which includes all time, and sohe withdraws into earlier times when he was making time in order tohave some time himself.“Make some time,“ is a process of astonishing ramifications.But remember, time is a barrier. One could also say, „Make somespace,“ „Make some energy,“ „Make some objects,“ „Make someterminals,“ and have gains in a preclear. But these are barriers.Although a game requires barriers, the preclear already has too manyin the past, too few in the present.Barriers are not life.We must use three cardinal rules in processing: (1) Processtowards truth; (2) Process towards ability; (3) Process towards life.Auditing commands must emphasize truth, ability, life.Don’t process towards entheta, chronic somatics, difficulties.Ignore them.The only thing wrong with the preclear is that his attention isfixed on barriers – MEST. His freedom depends upon putting hisattention on freedom or present time. Here are two auditingcommands. Which is correct? (1) „Find some things you can’t do.“ (2)„Find some things you can do.“The second is correct. The first will almost spin a preclear. Why?Because it concentrates on a lie. A preclear can do anything!"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!125L. RON HUBARDA preclear has a bad leg. Which is the right process? (1) „Touchthe back of your chair.“ (2) „Recall a time when somebody hurt his leg.“The first is correct. It is faster. Why? Because it processestowards ability.We have a preclear who is apathetic. Which process is the rightone? (1) „Who used to have headaches?“ or (2) „Feel the floor beneathyour feet.“ The second is correct because it processes towards life, notillness.That which the auditor concentrates upon in auditing comes true.Hence, the processing of MEST gives us new barriers. The processing oflife gives new life.Processing barriers gives us limited processes. Processing lifegives us unlimited processes. Life is composed of Affinity, Reality,Communication. These make understanding. Modern ARC processingprocesses communication as given earlier in this volume. ARCprocessing includes the following powerful processes: (1) „Tell mesomething you might communicate with.“ „Tell me something thatwould communicate with you.“ (2) „What might you agree with?“ „Whatmight agree with you?“ (3) „Tell me something you could like.“ „Tell mesomething that might like you.“ These are present time, not past orfuture processes. They produce very strong reactions. They solve veryrough cases. They are summed up in a simple process which does notdispense with them: „Tell me something (someone) you couldunderstand.“ „Tell me something (someone) who could understandyou.“"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!126L. RON HUBARDCHAPTER XVIEXTERIORIZATIONThe auditor will be confronted with a great many problems inexteriorization once he has exteriorized his preclear. The things not todo and to do are as follows:(1) Do not require the awareness of awareness unit to again putits attention on the body.(2) Do not make the person prove that he is exteriorized.(3) Do not make the newly exteriorized person discover, findthings, read the future, or do other nonsensical tricks.(4) Maintain the Auditor’s Code more severely than before.(5) Continue the process on which the preclear exteriorized.If the auditor knows these things he will not get the preclear andhimself into trouble. The auditing command „Be three feet back of yourhead“ sometimes gets the auditor into more trouble than he isequipped to handle. The preclear may do a compulsive exteriorization,„do a bunk,“ and drop his body limp in the chair and give from thatbody no sign that he is hearing any of the auditing commands given bythe auditor. One such case was pleaded with for half an hour by anauditor along the lines that the preclear should remember her husband,should think of her children, should come back and live for the sake ofher friends, and found no response from the preclear. Finally theauditor said, „Think of your poor auditor,“ at which moment the preclearpromptly returned.A limited „compulsive exteriorization“ is the preclear going out ofthe body and getting plastered against the ceiling, or falling in terrorupward into the sky (an inverting of gravity). This manifestation isequally upsetting.If a preclear has been given the command „Be three feet back ofyour head“ and if he „does a bunk,“ or if he „falls out of his bodyupward,“ all the auditor has to do is to get into a two-waycommunication with the preclear. Actually, he should have, as anauditor, an excellent command of the Chart of Human Evaluation and"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!127L. RON HUBARD„Science of Survival.“ He would not then tell a preclear below 2.0 on theTone Scale to „Be three feet back of your head,“ for when they do, atthese lower levels of the Tone Scale, it is on a compulsive or obsessivelevel, and all the preclear can think of is to try and get away.Another remedy, if this untoward and strange occurrencehappens, is to ask the preclear to „Reach from your position to yourbody,“ „Withdraw from the body,“ „Reach for the body,“ „Withdrawfrom the body“ or „Decide to run away and run away,“ several times.Remember, such things as this occur only when the auditor has notplaced his preclear on the Tone Scale before he began to audit him.The way to get away from these entirely is to audit the Six BasicProcesses on the preclear, and then audit either or both of the „One-Shot Clear“ processes of Remedying Communication and TimeProcessing until the preclear exteriorizes and then simply go right onauditing the process which exteriorized the preclear. Remember that apreclear exteriorized is simply an awareness of awareness unit whichhas been taken out of a trap, and the awareness of awareness unithad not changed any from the basic individual, but now recognizesitself to be out of the trap and is quite happy about it.A very funny manifestation occurs on some very low-tonedpreclears when they talk about exteriorization. They say, „I’m overthere.“ This, of course, is impossible. An individual is always here. It ishere where you are. Lord knows what this individual who says „I’mover there“ has exteriorized – a circuit, a mock-up, some such thing. Hehimself definitely is not. Another manifestation we have is „buttered allover the universe.“ A preclear who is buttered all over the universe isone who does not know where he is and if we ask him many, manytimes, over and over and over, each time making him get a spot withcertainty, „Can you find a spot where you are not?“ we will graduallynarrow down his area. What has actually happened in such a case isthat the preclear has used remote viewpoints, and has left remoteviewpoints located all over everywhere to such a degree that thepreclear thinks he is any place rather than where he is.The main thing one has to know about exteriorization is that ittakes place. If one uses the Six Basic Processes, remembers theAuditor’s Code, and the two „One-Shot Clear“ processes, he is thenquite safe on exteriorization, for it will occur when it occurs, and thething to do after it occurs is to do the same process one was doing"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!128L. RON HUBARDwhen it did occur. Of course, one should acknowledge the fact of thepreclear’s mentioning it and one should certainly permit the preclear todiscuss it, but one should continue with the process which exteriorizedhim, unless, of course, one is very well trained in exteriorizationexercises.As exteriorization drilling, as an activity, is most germane to therealm of Scientology, further knowledge of it and about it is written upin „The Creation of Human Ability.“ Here are given the Route 1 stepswhich should be run after an exteriorization takes place.The creation of a Clear undertaken in 1950 actually was thismanifestation of exteriorization happening at some random momentand not being adequately cared for after it occurred. Nobody remarkedupon the fact that he was a distance from the body because most ofthe people who were thus exteriorized had very good visio on theirown banks but very poor visio on the immediate environment. A littlemore exteriorization work and any one of these clears would havesuddenly found himself out in the room looking at the room directlywithout the aid of his eyes.We wanted Clears in 1950. Ww all want Clears. We now have theway to make them, the way to make them stable, and the way to makeanybody you process far more able.The by-word on this is not to address specific errors or difficulties,but to validate abilities and process immediately towards theacquisition of further and higher abilities. We are not in there to payattention to all of the bad things in the world, since these arecomposed only of the imaginings of the individual. Let us increase theability of the individual to create, to be, to perceive, and increase hisability to associate all along the dynamics. If we could do this it wouldbe a far, far better world."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"DIANETICS 55!129L.
