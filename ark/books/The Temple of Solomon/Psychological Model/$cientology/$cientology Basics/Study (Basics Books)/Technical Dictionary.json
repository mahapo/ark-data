It contains and defines almost all of the words and abbreviations used inconnection with auditing technology and with the training of auditors to date inDianetics and Scientology. Many words have several definitions taken from variousperiods of the development of Dianetics and Scientology.A large amount of L. Ron Hubbard’s books, tape lectures, articles and technicalbulletins etc. were researched for many years by a team of researchers. The period from1950 to 1975 was heavily consulted for the terms and their definitions.The student can readily see the progressive development through time of thevocabulary of Dianetics and Scientology by its Source and Founder, L. Ron Hubbardas well as the changes that have come about through his continued research. Moreimportant however, is the fact that all of the materials of the subjects remain valid and inforce today.In compiling this dictionary the researchers and editors have chosen to omit theconventional use of the ellipsis (. . .) which would indicate an intentional omission ofwords in the definition. This is so that each definition imparts a complete uninterruptedthought to the reader and allows him to form a concept of the word without distractionor the inclusion of data not contributory to the definition.The references at the end of each definition allow the reader to consult the Sourceof the definition if further information is desired.In addition to giving an understanding of the vocabulary of the subjects andclearing up misunderstood words and abbreviations in connection with Dianetics andScientology, there is a further major use for this dictionary; The student requiringinformation about any area of Dianetics or Scientology need only look up the wordsconnected with that area and he will be provided with references to appropriate materialfor further study of that area.As the Tone Scale is referred to in many definitions a full Tone Scale appears atthe end of the dictionary before the reference summary.  The Editors"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IntroductionIn the early sixties the research which I did on study and study materials broughtso view the necessity of an accurate and modernized dictionary of Dianetics andScientology.Despite the pressing need of this so many other research projects existed that I didnot have an opportunity to personally engage upon this work of definitions. All of thegrades and OT levels remained to be researched in full and therefore I relegated anydictionary compilations to staff action.Almost all the words used in Dianetics and Scientology are defined in the earlybulletins in which they first appeared. However, a complete dictionary is a vitalnecessity and use of it can mean the difference between understanding and notunderstanding; being able to be an auditor and not being one.Philosophy has always had the liability of gathering to itself a great many newwords and labels. The reason for this is that the philosopher finds phenomena in thephysical universe or in the mind or humanities which have not hitherto been observedor properly identified. Each one of these tends to require a new word for itsdescription. In actual fact this cycle of new observations requiring new labels isprobably the growth of language itself. Language is obviously the product of unsungobservers who then popularized a word to describe what had been observed.The system which has been followed in Dianetics and Scientology in labellingphenomena or observed things was originally to make verbs into nouns or vice versa.The practice of developing new nomenclature was actually held to a minimum.However, it was found that many old words in the field of philosophy, when used,conveyed to people an entirely new idea. The exactness of Dianetics and Scientologyrequired a more precise approach. This approach was achieved by special naming withan eye to minimal confusion with already supposed or known phenomena. TheDianetics and Scientology vocabulary is nevertheless not large.It is interesting that many Dianetics and Scientology terms have movedsideways into society and are in common use today. In the search which brought aboutDianetics and Scientology many new phenomena were encountered which resulted, forthe first time, in a workable, predictable science of the humanities. The introduction ofa few words of new meaning to make this possible seems to be a small price to pay.It is the hallmark of the Dianeticist and Scientologist that he uses these wordseven in his common conversation with ease and facility.The student who is not completely conversant with these exact words ascontained in this dictionary will find himself drowsing over his bulletins and utterlyappalled when he tries to obtain results which are not forthcoming due to his lack ofunderstanding of some small word.The liability of misunderstood words is not a monopoly of Dianetics andScientology. In broader university subjects you will find that not only the vocabulary ofthe subject, but the subject itself is often completely and totally misunderstood, leavingthe student ARC broken, upset and even riotous.Whereas the subject of misunderstood words or understood words is, in itself, abroad one, it does not comprise, in itself, the entire technology of study.I hope this dictionary will be of use. Not only in clarifying some of thephenomena of existence, but also speeding greatly your study of Dianetics andScientology and the results you will be able to attain thereby."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A, affinity.

It means basicallyto err, to make mistakes, or more specifically to have fixed ideas which are nottrue. The word is also used in its scientific sense. It means departure from astraight line. If a line should go from A to B, then if it is “aberrated” it wouldgo from A to some other point, to some other point, to some other point, to someother point, to some other point and finally arrive at B. Taken in its scientificsense, it would also mean the lack of straightness or to see crookedly as, inexample, a man sees a horse but thinks he sees an elephant. Aberrated conductwould be wrong conduct, or conduct not supported by reason. When a personhas engrams, these tend to deflect what would be his normal ability to perceivetruth and bring about an aberrated view of situations which then would cause anaberrated reaction to them. Aberration is opposed to sanity, which would beits opposite. (LRH Def. Notes) 2. an aberrated person wanders from his self-determined course. He no longer goes where he wants to go now, but goes wherehe has wanted to go in the past. His course is, therefore, not rational, and heseems to go wherever the environment pushes him.

(HCOB 23 Aug 65)ADMINISTRATION (ADMIN), a contraction or shortening of the wordadministration, admin is used as a noun to denote the actions involved inadministering an organization. The clerical and executive decisions, actionsand duties necessary to the running of an organization, such as originating andanswering mail, typing, filing, dispatching, applying policy and all those actions,large and small which make up an organization. Admin is also used to denote theaction or fact of keeping auditor’s reports, summary reports, worksheets andother records related to an auditing session. “He kept good admin,” meaningthat his summary report, auditor’s report and worksheets were neat, exactly onpattern, in proper sequence and easily understood as well as complete. “Hisadmin was bad”; from the scribble and disorderly keeping of records of thesession while it was in progress one could not make out what had happened in thesession. You will also see the word admin in connection with the three musts ofa well-run organization. It is said that its ethics, tech and admin must be “in,”which mean they must be properly done, orderly and effective. The word derivesfrom minister, which means to serve. Administer means to manage, govern,to apply or direct the application of laws, or discipline, to conduct or executereligious offices, dispense rights. It comes from the Latin, administrare, tomanage, carry out, accomplish, to attend, wait, serve. In modern English, whenthey use administration they mean management or running a government or thegroup that is in charge of the organization or the state. (LRH Def.

The preclear may outflow, jabber, discuss, pause, hedge,disperse, dither or be silent; no matter what he does or how he does it, betweenthe asking of the question and the giving of the answer, the time is thecommunication lag. The near answer, a guessing answer, an undecidedanswer, are alike imprecise answers, and are not adequate responses to thequestion. On receipt of such questionable answers, the auditor must ask thequestion again. That he asks the question again does not reduce thecommunication lag; he is still operating from the moment he asked thequestion the first time. And if he has to ask the question 20 or 30 times more inthe next hour in order to get a precise and adequate answer from the preclear, thelength of time of the lag would be from the asking of the first question to the finalreceipt of the answer.

These lists are usedrepetitively; that is to say the individual goes over them again and again. There isno finite period to the work. The reason the recall of these questions is importantis that they reveal and discharge locks which have formed above the basicengrams (moments of physical pain and unconsciousness) and secondaries(moments of acute loss as death of a loved one).

The somaticstrip goes to the point of return, but it is not the same as completely returningsince the preclear’s “I” can stay in present time and the somatic strip can besent back to earlier periods of his life. This is a very useful mechanism.
