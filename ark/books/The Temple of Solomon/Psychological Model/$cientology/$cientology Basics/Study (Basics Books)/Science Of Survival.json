Despite this obstacle of ignorance he has made progress, butbecause of this obstacle he has accumulated unto himself not only the penalties of madness anddisease but more important, the threat of destruction for all his works -- modern war.Dianetics is the science of thought. The word is from the Greek “dianoua” (throughmind). The scope of Dianetics includes all valid data pertaining to thought. Far simpler thanMan supposed, the workings of the human mind and knowledge itself became, in Dianetics, abody of knowledge with which any reasonably intelligent individual can work.No civilization can progress to the stability of continuous survival without certain andsure command of knowledge such as that contained in Dianetics. For Dianetics, skillfully used,can do exactly what it claims. It can, in the realm of the Individual, prevent or alleviate insanity,neurosis, compulsions and obsessions and it can bring about physical well being, removing thebasic cause of some seventy percent of Man’s illnesses. It can, in the field of the family, bringabout better accord and harmony. It can, in the field of nations or smaller groups such as thoseof industry, improve management to a point where these pitifully inadequate ideologies forwhich men fight and die with such frightening earnestness, can be laid aside in favor of aworkable technology.Perhaps our present generation is too benighted for a new science. It would be verysad if it were true, for atom bombs are quite destructive to people and to town and might wellobliterate whole cultures. Perhaps the vendors of crack-pot ideologies and destructive therapiesare too rich and too powerful and too selfish to permit a ray of hope upon our generation’sstage. Perhaps it will be tomorrow -- if tomorrow is let come -- before Dianetics is used andwidely applied.Dianetics was asked to vindicate itself in 1950. It did, as you will see in the publisher’sintroduction. This was very tolerant of Dianetics for no existing “ology” pertaining to thehuman mind has ever been validated or has been called upon to validate itself. The entrenchedtherapies, flatly do not work. Their results are much the same as those which would have beenachieved had no work been done. What sort of a society is this in which we live wherepretence is accepted as validity against all opposing facts?Dianetics works. None who have spent any time around the Foundation can doubt that.It even works in relatively unskilled hands. Daily, it does its miracles. And this is not verystrange, for Dianetics is root knowledge of human activity.But Dianetics is not a psychotherapy and it is not psychosomatic medicine. Those whowant and need these things find Dianetics swiftly efficacious in these fields and so think of it asa psychotherapy. Those whose “field” it invades would love to have it outlawed before theirboxes of beautiful “Snake Root Oil” have been discredited.Preventive Dianetics means more for humanity in the long run than Dianetic processing.Group Dianetics means more for these war-torn societies than any number of arthritis cures.Dianetics is the basic science of human thought. It embraces human activity and arranges abody of hitherto uncoordinated knowledge. Dianetics has a basic goal, a good goal, a goalwhich should not be discounted or thrown aside because some quack will lose his income orbecause some revolutionary will lose his crack-pot cause. The goal of Dianetics is a sane world-- a world without insanity, without criminals and without war. If our generations live to writehistory, let them sadly give a page to those who, in this chaotic and dark age, sought, through6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"personal profit and through hate, to bring a truly humanitarian science down.

It would be stopped only by the insane.From Funk and Wagnall’s New Standard Dictionary, Supplement No. 5: di.a.net’icsnoun: A system for the analysis, control and development of human thought evolved from a setof coordinated axioms which also provide techniques for the treatment of a wide range ofmental disorders and organic diseases: term and doctrines introduced by L. Ron Hubbard,American engineer. (Gr. dianoetikos - dia, through plus noos, mind) -- di.a net’.ic adj.Dianetics is the science of survival. Although it is much simpler than the physical sciences ofphysics and chemistry, it compares with them in the preciseness of its results. The source ofpsychosomatic illness and human aberration has been discovered, and in Dianetics skills exist,for the first time, with which to resolve them. An understanding of human behavior is madepossible by Dianetics. The precision of science is brought by Dianetics into the broad fields ofthe humanities. It is actually a family of sciences, and enlarges the humanities beyond previousunderstanding. The present volume deals with human evaluation and with dianetic processing.With it the behavior of human beings can be estimated and predicted with exactness. AlthoughDianetics is a broad subject and should never be limited to the field of mental healing, any truescience which embraced man’s activities could not but touch upon and resolve neurosis,criminality, insanity and psychosomatic illness.Application of the human evaluation chart contained in this volume permits the studentto estimate with some exactness the behavior and reactions he can expect from the humanbeings around him and what can happen to him as a result of association with various persons.Additionally, the use of human evaluation permits the individual to handle and better live withother human beings.Man has known many portions of Dianetics in the past thousands of years, but not untilnow has this data been organised into a body of precision knowledge. Dianetics, as a masterscience, embraces psychology, psychometry, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, and any other fieldof mental healing or evaluation but goes on, more importantly, to predict human behaviorprecisely and to delineate the causes of that behavior, to enhance the field of politics and toenlarge all other activities of man. Despite this scope, Dianetics is simple enough to be easilyunderstood by the intelligent layman, and after a study of this volume many of its lessertechniques can be employed by the layman to better and increase the life potential of individualswith whom he associates.The first law of Dianetics is the dynamic principle of existence: THE DYNAMICPRINCIPLE OF EXISTENCE IS SURVIVE! OR SUCCUMB! No activity of livingorganisms has been found to exist without this principle. It is not meant here that survivalshould be in terms of barest necessity, since one of the best guarantees of survival isabundance.In Dianetics, survival is understood to be the basic single thrust of life through time andspace, energy and matter. Survival is subdivided into eight dynamics. Man does not survivefor self alone, nor yet for sex, nor yet for groups, nor yet only for the species of man. Manapparently survives, as do other living organisms, along eight separate channels. Thesechannels are called the dynamics, and these eight represent the eight fundamental urges ordrives which motivate conduct.Dynamic one is the urge of the individual to survive as himself.Dynamic two is the urge of the individual to survive through his progeny. The seconddynamic has two main subdivisions, the sexual act and the creation of children and theirrearing.Dynamic three is the urge of the individual to survive as a member of a group, whethercivil, political, racial, or just a number of individuals who compose a group.7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Dynamic four is the urge of the individual to reach the highest survival in terms ofmankind and is the urge of mankind to survive as man.Dynamic five is the urge to survive as a life organism and embraces all livingorganisms.Dynamic six is the urge to survive as part of the physical universe and includes thesurvival of the physical universe.Dynamic seven is the urge toward survival in a spiritual sense.Dynamic eight is the urge toward survival as a part of or ward of a Supreme Being.The number eight, laid on its side, gives us the symbol -oo- for infinity.With these various drives, all the behavior and activities of individuals or groups can beintegrated, evaluated and understood. With all of these dynamics in full play in the individual, ahigh level of sanity and optimum conduct is obtainable.Dianetic processing attempts to give the individual the highest possible potential ofsurvival and the happiest possible life. Severely tested and evaluated, dianetic processing hasbeen found to deliver, in the hands of a competent dianetic practitioner, a considerablyheightened productivity and happiness to the individual, as will be shown below.Without using hypnotism, drugs, surgery, shock or other artificial means, Dianeticsunblocks the flow of these dynamics and considerably enhances the ability of the individual toact in life and enjoy it. The source of mental disturbance and psychosomatic illness andirrational conduct is one of the basic discoveries of Dianetics. This source remained unknownand unsuspected for thousands of years, although relentlessly sought by the thinkers andphilosophers of all ages.That this source is the valid source has been rigorously tested and has been provenbeyond doubt by the best authorities. The source of aberration lies in a hitherto unknown sub-mind which, with its recordings, underlies what man understands to be his “conscious” and.The concept of the “unconscious” is re-evaluated in Dianetics by the discovery that the“unconscious” mind is the only mind which is always conscious. This submind is called thereactive mind.A holdover from an earlier step in evolution, the reactive mind is able to command theconscious mind without the individual suspecting he is being so ordered about. Hidden andmysterious impulses, obsessions, delusions and other unwanted ideas are able to manifestthemselves against the conscious mind of the individual without his suspecting what ishappening. These compulsions and obsessions and irrationalities greatly reduce an individual’ssurvival potential as well as his energy and physical health. The reactive mind takes any and allof the data which it contains from moments of physical pain or painful emotion which havebeen experienced by the individual in the course of life. When an individual is unconscious,which is to say when he is drugged or knocked out by shock, injury or illness, the reactivemind is wide open to receive recordings.Previously it was not known that an individual who was unconscious could and didrecord those things which were said and done around him. For instance, during an operationwhile the patient lies on the table under ether, his reactive mind records everything that is saidand done around him and records additionally the physical pain and the drugged feeling of theanaesthesia. All these perceptions combine together to create what is known in Dianetics as anengram. An individual, then, has an engram for every moment during his entire lifetime whenhe has been Knocked out or severely injured. Everything which occurs in these moments liesdormant in the reactive mind.8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Further, every moment of great emotional shock, where loss occasions nearunconsciousness, is fully recorded in the reactive mind. These shocks of loss are known asSecondaries. For instance, the death of a loved one brings about a state of nearunconsciousness, and everything which is said or done around a person in such a state isrecorded and becomes compulsive as part of the reactive mind. The reactive mind is composedsolely of these experiences.Later on, when an individual is tired or only slightly ill, similar circumstances or voicesin his surrounding may restimulate one of the engrams or secondaries and so cause him to reactaccording to its commands upon him. This is called, dianetically, a lock and is a conscious-level irrational reaction. In the reactive mind there exists, thus, an interior world of force whichacts upon the individual. This is aberration, and it is caused by what has been done to not doneby the individual, during moments when he was unconscious. The eradication of the content ofthe reactive mind is made possible by dianetic processing. One would agree that if the entirephysical pain and painful emotion of a lifetime were eradicated from his life he would be sanerand happier. Dianetic processing does just this. Dianetic processing is very simple in itselements.Several new things have been learned in Dianetics about the human mind. One is thetime track. Every moment of consciousness, from an individual’s earliest instant of life topresent time, constitutes what may be called a track of time. During these consecutive momentsin time, everything the individual has heard, seen, felt or smelled is recorded faithfully. Theserecordings may not be available instantly to every human being, but in dianetic processing theybecome available.This time track, then, is a record not only of the life span of the individual but also ofeverything which has happened within that span. When something is forgotten it does notdisappear from this time track but is only denied to the individual by an occlusion occasionedby some physical or emotional pain. This pain makes it difficult for the individual to reach thedata without re-experiencing the pain, and so the data becomes lost to him until he is processed.Processing is done by recovering data on the time track. Wide awake, without hypnotism,drugs or other artificial means any individual can be sent down the time track to earliermoments.The preciseness with which he will go to these moments is astonishing. Many peopleare held in these moments by some past physical pain to such a degree that they are actually notin present time. When an individual is somewhere on the time track other than in present timehe can be said to be out of present time. He will be experiencing some of the pain and will bereacting to the commands of the moment. If you were to ask one of your friends how old he isand request that he give you the first figure that flashed into his mind you would be astonishedhow often that figure would not be his proper age but an earlier age. If you pursued the questyou would find, by enlarging his memory, that he had been injured or had experienced somepainful event at the age which he gave you in lieu of his own. This individual would be out ofpresent time.It is a primary purpose of dianetic processing to bring the individual wholly into presenttime. Processing is simply done. The auditor (as the processor is called) directs the attention of“I” back along the time track. The preclear (the person who is undergoing processing) is wideawake, knows everything which is taking place, is in full control of himself and is able to bringhimself to the present whenever he likes. In a fully returned state, wherein the auditor hasdirected that “I” go back to a certain moment in the preclear’s life, the preclear can be seen toapproximate, involuntarily, the state he was in at some earlier period of his life. There exist,however, many severly occluded cases which cannot easily reach moments on the time trackand there exist people who are stuck on the time track so thoroughly that they cannot reachearlier or later moments easily.Lighter methods of dianetic processing have been devised to free those individuals insuch a way that their recall becomes much more adequate. Psychosomatic illness, as it is called9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"in the field of medicine, is named in Dianetics a chronic somatic, since it is not an illness andcannot be diagnosed as such but is only some former pain which is in restimulation. Forinstance, the individual who has what a physician may have diagnosed as arthritis of the elbowis really suffering from the restimulation of an actual pain or series of pains he has received atsome much earlier time in that very elbow.In other words, a child which breaks its elbow at the age of three may at the age ofthirty experience a rheumatic pain in that elbow. The test of all dianetic processing is whether ornot it works. In the case of the chronic somatic, which accounts for some seventy percent ofman’s illnesses, the pain and discomfort of the “psychosomatic illness” vanishes when dianeticprocessing reaches and eradicates the recording of the original injury or illness. Nopharmaceutical, mental, surgical or other medical treatment has been able to resolve or evenvaguely control psychosomatic illness -- a thing which dianetic processing does easily asroutine.That Dianetics must be vastly successful in eradicating these chronic somatics is attestedby the hysterical violence expressed against it by some members of past healing arts. Dianeticsrelegates psychosomatic surgery into nearly the same category as bloodletting. Occasionally,chronic somatics surrender in a matter of an hour or two. However, for the most part, highlycompetent auditing and many hours of work are necessary to resolve things which have beenclassified as arthritis, sinusitis, rheumatism, conjunctivitis, or any of the thousands of namesassigned to these chronic somatics. The auditor in no case diagnoses the chronic somatic as anillness and does not need to make such diagnosis to resolve the chronic somatic. Beyond theresolution of psychosomatic illness and human aberration, Dianetics, even more importantly,encompasses human behavior.Various specific states of being are occasioned by the amount of pain or painful emotionstored in the reactive mind, as are certain set mechanical reactions in the behavior ofindividuals. Groups as well can be found to react in this way. These mechanical reactions tolife and the environment are represented by the tone scale, a full copy of which is included inthis volume. By finding one or two manifestations of an individual one can go on to predict theremainder of his characteristic reactions toward his associates and his environment. One candiscover what will interest him, what will depress him, how ethical he is, and what he will doin various situations.The reader should not confuse Dianetics with the arts of mental healing or with schoolsof thought on the subject of thought. Dianetics is truly a science. It is new and it is young, butit fulfils the true requirements for a science in that it is “an organized body of knowledge thathas been accumulated on a subject.” According to some of the best known critics in America,Dianetics is considered to be the foremost advance of man, certainly during this century. Itsconclusions are derived from the discovery of natural laws concerning thought, organisms, andthe physical universe, and it is a bold strike toward further knowledge and the enhancement ofman. Its limitations at this time are not even vaguely known. What it can do for the individualand the world cannot be estimated. According to Walter Winchell, the creation of Dianetics is amilestone for man comparable to his discovery of fire and superior to his inventions of thewheel and the arch. Any project or any set of discoveries as vast as Dianetics cannot butchallenge the citadels of conservatism, but these are easily challenged.In the book, Albert Einstein (page 120), L. Infeld states, “In 1921, when I went tostudy in Berlin, I saw with amazement the disgraceful spectacle which attended Einstein’sfame.” Editorials attacked Einstein, and mathematics professors in one of Berlin’s greatest hallstold a large audience that Einstein’s theory was “the greatest hoax in the history of science.”From Albert Einstein we have the direct bequeathment of atomic fission. From Dianetics andthe brilliant mind of its discoverer and originator, L. Ron Hubbard, we may have the sanity andsalvation of our future race. The advent of Dianetics into a lethargic society last May, 1950,created a stir which spread around the world.10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"There were those who believed Dianetics implicitly and to whose searching minds itseemed the final answer both for their personal problems and for the problems of the entireworld. To those who did not share this hearty acceptance of its revolutionary tenets it was afad, a cult, or even a blasphemy. Loudly this faction clamored for “validation,” demanding thatDianetics prove its startling claims. It did not matter to them that never, before Dianetics, hadany claims concerning “cures” or remissions of mental illnesses been validated, or that noformal attempt by any psychotherapy had ever been made toward this end. They sought, forone reason or another, to make Dianetics either prove its claims of what to them were fantasticcures of psychoses, or to withdraw once and for all into the obscurity of admitted defeat.Dianetics accepted the challenge.The ardent enthusiasts and practitioners of the new science provided a fertile field forobtaining the demanded “validation.” Prospective students, flocking to the Foundation and itsbranches from all walks of life and all levels of mental and physical health, were required totake psychometry before attending classes. Those who appeared at the Foundation for clinicalprocessing were likewise given psychometry both before processing began and afterprocessing was completed. The psychometry given one and all was the standard testing ofestablished schools of psychology under the direction of fully qualified psychologists.Dianetics had not yet developed its own batteries of tests; but even had this been accomplishedat that time, it would not have been acceptable to those who sought to discredit the buddingscience. They would have shouted that anyone could pass a test of his own making. Thus, inone more way, did Dianetics meet its critics on their ownThe Minnesota Multiphasic Test is well known among psychometrists, college andindustrial personnel. It has specific advantages and disadvantages, as have all modes of mentaltesting, but it is popular because of its simplicity and ease of scoring, and because of therelative ease of picturing the mental state of the testee which it affords. Therefore, in picking a“scientific” standard psychometric test, the Foundations chose as one of its tests the MinnesotaMultiphasic Personality Inventory. Among professional people the Wechsler-BellevueIntelligence Scale stands in high esteem, since it reveals more about the pattern of anindividual’s mental functioning than do similar tests. Originally, it was designed because itsauthor felt that other tests existing at the time were more fitting for children. Early in the warthe War Department requested that this test be used for channelling recruits into the services,and the particular Wechsler-Bellevue which was used became known as Form B. Its specialcharacteristics include the Point Scale as contrasted to others using an I.Q. scale; each item iscredited with a certain number of points, and the total points determine the score.The Wechsler-Bellevue is divided into eleven sub-tests, and it affords separate scoringof eleven types of behavior. Sub-tests are grouped into two series, one yielding a “Verbal I.Q.”and the other a “Performance I.Q.” This feature alone makes the Wechsler (pronounced “wex-ler”) of outstanding value in the measuring of rises in mental performance and activity. In thefield of testing itself a favorite method of “validating” a mental test is simply by correlation withother tests.Dianetics has undertaken to give a broad picture of the improvement afforded in humanbehavior by using more than one test. Thus, it is impossible to level a finger of criticism at aspecific test in order to belittle the unprecedented improvement which is brought about in anindividual by dianetic processing. It must be remembered however that testing takes up a lot ofvaluable time. Except for this reason hundreds of tests might have been given these 88 testees,to satisfy each and every one of the critics of Dianetics.Those who are not satisfied with the results obtained from the tests which were chosenare cordially invited to set up a testing programme of their own; to send for a Hubbard DianeticAuditor to audit the chosen preclears, and to draw their own conclusions from the results whichaccrue. The results of the “befores” were quite within keeping of the general average resultsany psychometrist would expect from a cross-section of the population. But the results of the“afters” were completely bewildering to those dyed-in-the wool doubters who hesitate tobelieve evidence seen with their own eyes.11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The signatures of the examining psychometrists Gordon Southon, Peggy Southon andDalmyra Ibanez, Ph.D., Ed D., are affixed to each bank of tests, and witnessed. Thesepsychometrists are registered professional personnel whose honesty and standing in the field ofpsychology is above question. In past comparative testing, it has been quite within the keepingof those conducting mental research to choose about five persons for examination, retaining anequal number as a “control” group. Dianetics has built this particular validation programmearound 88 persons. Never before has such an astounding number participated in tests to showimprovement in mental health, specifically in the testing of increase in mental ability andreduction of psychoses and psychosomatic illnesses. A vast backlog of psychometry has sincebeen accumulated, many times outnumbering this original 88. Dianetics is now in a position todo the challenging, and the following charts are submitted as proof of the efficacious results ofprocessing. Dianetics was challenged to prove the claim of increased I.Q. and that dianeticprocessing has as two of its by-products the relief of psychoses and psychosomatic illnesses.Had the challengers any idea that this proof could be presented they might not have been soblatant in their demands, and had they any inkling that the results would be so completely inDianetics’ favor they might have withheld them completely.However, Dianetics has met the challenge.The arbitrary measure of human intelligence popularly known as the individual’s “I.Q.”is not a measure of how well a person remembers. Neither is it a measure of how much he haslearned over a period of a lifetime. I.Q. ratings are a measure of an individual’s capacity forlearning something new; they are scales based upon how old in years a person has becomecompared to how “old” he is mentally. One might be 30 years of age and yet have an equivalentmental capacity of an average 15-year-old school boy. On the other hand, a particularly adeptpupil of grade school, perhaps 8 years of age, might have a mental capacity equivalent tosomeone ten years his senior.It has become a cliche that an individual’s I.Q. rating does not change throughout hislifetime. Indeed, until Dianetics, a gain in I.Q. scoring from one test to another was greetedwith astonishment and an immediate assertion that a mistake had been made by thepsychometrist scoring the tests.When Dianetics made the statement that a person’s Intelligence Quotient (I.Q.)increased remarkably following a few hours of dianetic processing, the clamor for “proof”began. The Foundation has this proof, in abundance. As shown on the bar graph one groupof 88 persons was given standard I.Q. tests, and their scores plotted along the horizontal bar,regardless of whether these particular scores were 50 I.Q. or 150 I.Q. One month passed, amonth in which the preclears received about 60 hours of dianetic processing. Then they weregiven a second I.Q. test. The score on the second test was then plotted on the vertical bar at thepoint which represents the points of gain or loss.Let’s call the vertical bar on the extreme right of the graph by the name John Smith.John appeared at the Foundation for training in Dianetic Auditing, and before being permitted toattend classes, was given a group of tests, among which was an “I.Q.” test. He was found tohave, according to the standards set forth by the originators of the test, an I.Q. of 125. Hewent to class, learned dianetic theory, learned to audit effectively, and during the coursereceived 65 hours of dianetic processing from classmates. On Certification Day, he was givena second block of tests containing a standard follow-up of the I.Q. test he had taken a monthbefore. His rating on the second test was 151. Thus, John Smith gained 26 points in I.Q in aperiod of one month, and these 26 points are plotted on the graph as a vertical bar.Among the tests in the block taken by John Smith was the California Test ofPersonality. Various aspects of his social and individual personality were determined by use ofthis test. One of his most marked improvements was in his occupational relations (he had lostjob after job because he couldn’t get along with his boss and fellow workers). His secondgreatest personality change was in his feeling of personal worth; prior to his processing he had12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"considered himself as incapable of handling a foreman’s position, or of leading a group. Theafter-processing test showed that he had acquired a much deeper feeling of personal worth, andthat he would rate highly with his fellow workers.The Summary of Average Percentile Scores as shown on the Personality Bar Graph is adisplay of the results showing increases in the twelve categories listed. Seventy-six individualswere given before-and-after-psychometry which included the California Test of Personality,and their average is displayed in graphic form. To obtain the “average” score of all 76 persons,it is necessary to total their scores and divide the result by 76. The average scores of the 76individuals on the first test are shown by the height of the shaded bars. The average scores ofthe 76 persons after they had received dianetic processing of about 60 hours each is shown bythe height of the solid bars. In each case, there is an evident increase.Two graphs display the results obtained with use of the Minnesota MultiphasicPersonality Inventory test. As in the preceding graph, these show the averaged scores of anumber of individuals, divided into two displays: 21 cases, all male, and 7 cases, all female.The graphs are marked off in arbitrary scale form, beginning with 40 and ending with100, and the averaged results of the first tests taken by the individual concerned are locatedwhere the dotted line crosses each sub-title line. The averaged results of the second tests takenafter the persons had received about 60 hours of dianetic processing are located where the solidblack line crosses each sub-title line.The first sub-title, “Manic Tendencies,” means that a person is to a measurable degreeinfluenced by compulsions which cause him to feel, for example, that he has to conquer theworld, as Napoleon or Alexander set out to do. The averages of both the before- and the after-processing tests came out practically at the same point on the scale, about 59. Although thisindicates that as a group there was no decrease in maladjustment, a few individuals within thegroup may have adjusted remarkably in this category.The second sub-title, “Schizoid Tendencies,” means roughly that a person might besuffering from what Dianetics defines as a valence shift or the assumption of a second or thirdpersonality which is not inherently the individual’s own. The average for the group in the pre-test was about 76 toward maladjustment. The after-processing test shows that the group as anaverage decreased in maladjustment or, in other words, adjusted toward gaining andrecognizing their own personality.Under the sub-title “Obsessive-Compulsive Tendencies” might be placed those who“just have to wash their hands” after every tiny chore, or those who, before they turn a writtenpage they have just completed, are compelled to dot every “i” or else be completely unable tocontinue writing. Persons in this category are compelled to carry out some routine, idiotic orotherwise, regardless of what might be more important at the moment.The remainder of the sub-titles refer to various conditions evident in individuals, suchas the feeling that “everybody’s against me” and the tendency for a man to feel somewhatfeminine, as well as the extreme anti-socialness of hermits and pyromaniacs. Psychosomaticsymptoms are evidences of bodily discomfort or disease which have no physical origin, whilethe Undue Bodily concern category represents the degree of obsession regarding sickness,referred to by the medical profession as “hypochondria.”Although there are hundreds of individual cases to choose from, the test results of theindividual displayed in the graph entitled Typical Test Results of One Individual are average,hence typical. Case No. 446 from the California files shows that according to the resultsobtained from the California Test of Personality this person became very much better adjustedthan he had been before processing. His social adjustment, or the manner in which he getsalong with groups, became more acceptable. The third bar in the first section of the graphmerely shows the average of the previous two factors and is entitled Total Adjustment.13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"As shown by the Mental Health Analysis test, he adjusted his liabilities towardusefulness, and increased his assets. His total adjustment is shown on the third bar column.In the third test, the Johnson Temperament Analysis Profile, there are nine categories oftest results, graded on a scale of Excellent, Satisfactory, Fair and Poor. The greatestimprovement shown on this test was in the energy he evidenced in the tackling of a problem,and in his congeniality among people. His relaxation and buoyancy categories alreadysatisfactory when he took the first test, increased to a rating of Excellent.When this man first came to the Foundation, he was not particularly liked by hisclassmates and others who came in contact with him. He was often morose, sullen,uncommunicative and, as one classmate put it, “downright unfriendly.” A noticeable change inhis social awareness came about within the first week of his processing, and by the time he hadfinished his training he had reached an overall adjustment to an extent that he was congenial toeveryone, and was well liked in return.Physicians interested in Dianetics generally desire that several months of observationfollow the release of a “psychosomatic illness” during the course of dianetic processing, beforethe results are pronounced permanent. Accordingly, the Foundation has not releasedinformation on any but remarkable recoveries (which seem to make themselves knownautomatically) until after this waiting period has elapsed. The cases which are mentioned in thesecond paragraph which follows are all, except the last case, more than six months completed.Dianetic processing does not set out to cure any physical ailment, but it happens in thecourse of bringing a preclear up the tone scale that all the chronic somatics of engrams fromwhich the preclear has been suffering will disappear -- often with startling suddenness. Sincethese chronic somatics account for at least seventy percent of man’s “illnesses,” many manypeople who have considered themselves ill for years have “gotten well” during dianeticprocessing.Among the chronic somatic conditions from which our present available records showcomplete recovery are some which have been diagnosed by physicians as follows: bursitis,osteoarthritis, migraine headaches, thyroid complications, chronic headaches, chronicbackaches, chronic indigestion, constant fatigue, chronic colitis, and near-sightedness. Almostevery chronic condition commonly known has been relieved or alleviated during the course ofdianetic processing. These are only some of the cases on which we have careful records. Onegentleman had suffered from a chronic somatic which had been diagnosed by no less than 10physicians as “psoriasis” or “psoriatic arthritis”. None of them had offered him any hope ofcure. For three years he was periodically disfigured by lesions which covered nine tenths ofhis skin area. During dianetic processing the lesions healed so rapidly that fellow employeesinquired as to the reason for his sudden change in appearance. Time will tell whether thisrecovery is permanent, but there seems to be no valid reason for thinking that it is not.Alcoholism is considered by some to be a physical condition and by others a mentalone. Dianetics is not prepared to arbitrate the mind-body ratio of alcoholism, but theFoundation can report that alcoholism responds just as favorably to dianetic processing as anyother aberration.Aberrations which are apparently physical are easier to measure, and improvement inthem is easier to judge than in mental aberrations. However, the main goal of dianeticprocessing is not the alleviation of chronic somatics, but the erasure of irrational components inthe thoughts of the preclear. The apparently physical results are a by-product of this.The Foundation presents this report as a brief survey of some of the work done by theFoundation during its first year of operation. Obviously, research in such a broad field asDianetics requires time and careful, thorough planning. Studies which measure clinicalimprovement in individuals and groups are usually extended not over months, but over years.Even though a preclear himself can give a glowing subjective report, and though change in hisabilities and behavior is easily seen by friends and family, it is difficult to measure14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"improvement adequately. Tests which measure all the various improvements in a preclear donot as yet exist, and those which we have used in order to meet the challenge to Dianetics areactually admittedly inadequate even within their own fields.We in the Foundation urge scientists in all fields, particularly those working in biologyand the social sciences, to test dianetic theory and technique in their own laboratories and undertheir own controlled conditions. Dianeticists are eager to co-operate with any worker whowould like to test or explore Dianetics. Dianetic theory and technique can be applied in manyareas. We wish to thank those scientists and institutions who have already participated indianetic research and have applied it in their own fields. They have been of great assistance tothe Foundation and to the science of Dianetics.We who are working with Dianetics have seen so much of what it can do, and havebecome so enthusiastic about its effects and possibilities, that it is difficult to moderate ourstatements about it or our expressions of eagerness to see it develop further. We hope that moreand more people, from all fields, will join us in our exploration and our work.-- Editorial StaffHubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, 195115"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"IntroductionThis book is built around a chart. On the many columns of this chart we find themajority of the components of the human mind and all those necessary to process an individual.In this book we will take up these columns one by one from left to right, and explaineach column. When this has been done, and you have read the book and thoroughly examinedthe chart, you will at least have the rudiments you need to process people. If you desire toprocess individuals on a limited basis, you may specialize in straight memory, lock reductionand lock scanning. This can be done to almost anyone you would ordinarily contact withoutany harm and with a great deal of improvement in his general tone. If you feel a little moreadventurous, you can learn how to audit secondary engrams and so become proficient indischarging grief and fear from a case. Should you desire to go the whole way and feelyourself competent, you can try running engrams on a case, with a very close regard to thekind of case on which you try to run them.For a full education in dianetic processing the elements are here. But just as you wentto high school to learn algebra or physics, you should take a Foundation course in order tobecome a truly proficient auditor. Qualification at the Foundation, coupled with any othertraining you may have, will permit you to become a professional practitioner. Most people,however, take a Foundation course because they want to be better educated and to functionbetter in their own professions, for Dianetics is not just processing. That’s not a thousandth ofit. Dianetics deals with thought and the behavior of men and groups; and those who know thesubject thoroughly survive better.Simply reading this book then, although it contains all the basic information, does notqualify an individual to practise professionally. But once he has thoroughly studied this book,he should be able to handle routine cases without difficulty. He should not try Dianetics oninsane or severely neurotic person unless he feels himself especially gifted in understanding orunless he has taken a qualification course at the Foundation. This particularly applies toanalyzts and psychiatrists and medical doctors who, having concourse with the insane and thechronically ill, could achieve remarkably better and faster results with a knowledge ofDianetics. The science was made available to them in the past, and it is again urged that theytake advantage of its techniques in the best interest of mankind and the advancement of theirprofessions. Many physicians and psychologists have already been trained by the Foundationand they, experience shows, have made good auditors.In the same vein, the layman should be very careful whom he allows to practiseDianetics upon him. Before submitting to dianetic processing, the individual should either lookfor the auditor’s certificate on the wall and see that it is in good order or demand the right togive his auditor a test as to the various definitions contained in this volume. The individualwho desires processing should not submit himself to a psychiatrist or a psychoanalyzt ormedical doctor for dianetic treatment in the belief that they, as practitioners, know Dianetics.Only those psychoanalyzts, medical doctors and psychiatrists trained by the Foundation arefully qualified to handle the whole parade of skills necessary in an auditor. If your auditor isnot qualified by the Foundation, then let him run straight memory, locks and chains of locks onyou until you are entirely satisfied he knows what he is doing.An auditor, by diligent study of this volume and by entering slowly into the use of histools, making sure he understands each one of them progressively before using the next, canachieve great skill in processing. These cautionary remarks are addressed to those who, byhaphazard reading of the volume may attempt to plunge into the whole array of skills at once.This would be like trying to take a plane off the ground before one learns where the throttle islocated and how to bank. Dianetics is not as difficult as flying a plane but it is a technicalsubject.16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"You can’t drive anybody mad with dianetic processing. Cases driven mad by dianeticprocessing do not exist. Cases do exist where reversed techniques have been criminally usedon persons. Pain-drug-hypnosis can deliver anybody into a straightjacket with greater neatnessand despatch than anything hitherto known. Dianetic processing, however, has nothing to dowith restimulating or planting engrams.So read what is written and get to know your chart. You will know more about menand women and their behavior when you have finished. If you feel you could stand someprocessing, come to the Foundation, or team up with somebody on whom you can rely,starting in with straight memory and locks and studying as you work. If possible, getsupervision from a Foundation-trained auditor or take a basic or professional course. Youcan’t know too much about this subject.No attempt is made in this volume to be literary or academic. I would happily take off acouple of years and write you something highly polished, but we’re trying to get where we’regoing before the atom bomb gets there, and navigating the course takes a little time. So I’vejust written here what I know about this chart in a way I think you’ll understand. The book isorganized around the chart, not around the longest words in the dictionary: this is madepossible by a certain difference between Dianetics and some other subjects -- in those, theauthor has to make up in complication what he lacks in understanding of his subject, so thecritics will be impressed.Damn the critics, let’s get down to paragraph one and open up to flank speed.

(Gr. dianoetikos - dia, through plus noos, mind) --di.a.net.ic adj. Assuming the basic idea that the sole fundamental of existence issurvival, the problems of man’s behavior apparently resolve rapidly. His interpersonalrelations, the operation and purposes of his organizations and groups becomeunderstandable.Science is, to many people, a sacred cow. Actually, by definition, science is only theorganization of apparently disrelated facts into a useful whole. Aligned on certain basic axioms(which can be found in the appendix) Dianetics is a useful body of knowledge by which maybe resolved the puzzle of man and his behavior.A search for an energy of life begun in 1930 has been partially resolved by thediscovery of the lowest common denominator of existence: SURVIVE.A gross error has been made by scientists in the past who sought, materialistically, toexplain life on the basis of mud, chemicals and electricity. It was the contention of theseindividuals that matter, electrical energy, operating in space and time, combined in someincredibly lucky moment to form a self-perpetuating unit and that this item fortuitously grewand grew and one day man appeared on the scene. This child-like logic breaks down if only onthe basis of the odds against it. It breaks down again when evolution, as postulated, is seen tobe of only limited usefulness, being actually as full of holes as an ocarina. The main test of any“scientific” hodgepodge, is its usefulness to man. The mud-to-man theory, and it is just acrude theory, has not resolved man’s behavior. These schools of thought gave man unlimitedweapons such as the atomic bomb and yet failed to give man sanity enough to regulate his ownaffairs or use the type of energy released by that bomb for purposes other than destroyingtowns. So we can conclude and lay in a quiet grave any and all scientific theories which havenot led to peace on earth or have failed to give us a predominance of men of good will. Ofcourse there are lots of individuals who would like to go on having man believe he is basicallymud but to those we bequeath the electric shock machine and the prefrontal lobotomy, thehighest level of operation to which the mud-to-man theory led.An examination of existence and the fondest hopes to which man has clung discoversfor us the possibility that the energy of life is a different thing from the current flowing in apower line or the energy radiated by atomic fission. It is not necessary to have a vastknowledge of physics to conclude that life is something more than a mechanical contrivancerigged out of atoms and chemicals. In the first place, it follows only a few of the electro-magnetic-gravitic laws and at best only vaguely parallels these. Life has its own performancerules.A further examination of life demonstrates that it is undoubtedly made up in part ofmatter and that it exists in space and time. This is quite certain because a dead organismdisintegrates into dust. Something has obviously ceased to be a part of this organism,however, the moment it fully died. This “something” has variously been called the humansoul, the spirit, the life force. Bergson called it “elan vital.”19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The scientist who deals constantly with machines and chemical reactions has for somedecades looked on a life organism as an oxygen-carbon motor, a heat energy machine whichoperated not unlike a steam locomotive. He dismissed the wild variables this introduced intoany attempted solution to life and living by the expansive statement that life was simply morecomplicated than machines men built but that it was actually just another machine. A “too-complicated” school of thought, masquerading as science, took up this argument, seeing that itobfuscated any real explanation, or reason for one, and began to say that the human mind,being part of a machine which was too complicated for biology and biochemistry, was ofcourse too complicated to understand. It is felt that this waving aside of the problems of mindoperation, this acting on the defeatist principle that the problem could not be solved, introduced“therapies” which were “too complicated.” It took four to twelve years to get an inkling of thesetherapies and all evidence to hand, carefully compiled, shows that they do not work, that theproblems of criminality, insanity and war still remained, with these systems of “therapy,” farout of control. The too-complicated school of life and mind operation gives us a picture of agroup of demon exorcists rushing around plague-ridden London a couple of centuries ago,telling everyone they had the solution to the plague, while some hundreds of thousands ofEnglishmen died the black death.Let us look for a simpler solution, one which does not require twelve years ofschooling and practice to learn, one which will deliver to us a therapy and, more important, anunderstanding of life, man, and mind operation which can resolve the 19,000,000 insane, ourmillions of criminals, and international madness.We find the first leg of this solution in considering life force, elan vital, or what haveyou, as an energy dissimilar to electrons and molecules and mud. The laws of this “energy,”once they are isolated and stated, are found to be parallel to, but dissimilar to the laws of thephysical universe.Let us call this life energy by a symbol in order to identify it. We will assign to it theGreek letter theta and distinguish it as an energy existing separate and distinct from the physicaluniverse as we know it.The physical universe would be the universe of matter, energy, space and time. Itwould be the universe of the planets, their rocks, rivers, and oceans, the universe of stars andgalaxies, the universe of burning suns and time. In this universe we would not include theta asan integral portion, although theta obviously impinges upon it as life. From the first letters ofthe words matter, energy, space, and time, we can composite a new word: MEST.In Dianetics we are dealing then with theta and MEST. Theta is thought, life force, elanvital, the spirit, the soul, or any other of the numerous definitions it has had for somethousands of years.As soon as we separate the two entities, a host of problems heretofore quite complexresolve into simplicity. Theta, we could say, comes from the universe of theta, which isdifferent from the MEST universe. Theta has its own matter -- ideas; it has its own energy andthe characteristics of that energy; it has its own space of operation, as distinct from MESTspace; and it has its own time.There is an enormous amount of evidence to support theta as a postulate. Thought isinstantaneous in the MEST universe so far as can be discovered. The flow of energy alongnerves in an organism does not travel at light speed. Time and past, of the MEST universe, donot exist for theta.Considering theta one finds that it, alone of observable energies, motivates and activatesMEST matter and energy through space and time. Further, it computes, reasons, learns andretains what it learns. Men, building a computer with electronics which would do only a partof what the human mind can do would have to use enough electrical power to light New YorkCity, enough cooling system to absorb Niagara Falls, and enough vacuum tubes, if they cost a20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"cent apiece, to run up a bill of a million dollars. And the apparatus so rigged, under theexisting life terms of tubes, would run a split second before stopping for tube replacement.The human mind does more than such a clumsy machine, does it better, last a lifetime and, tocap it, is portable.Now all a student of Dianetics needs to know and understand about all this is that thetaplus MEST equals life; that theta and MEST have a natural affinity for each other and combine,linking the two universes, so to speak; that theta and MEST coming together too hard get into aturmoil which we call pain; and that the turbulence of theta and MEST under the duress of toomuch impact gives us a tone scale.Theta crushed too hard into MEST becomes entheta. MEST crushed too hard into thetabecomes enMEST. Entheta is simply a compound word meaning “enturbulated theta.” AndenMEST is another word meaning “enturbulated MEST.”Consider that theta in its native state is pure reason or at least pure potential reason.Consider that MEST in its native state is simply the chaotic physical universe, its chemicals andenergies active in space and time.The cycle of existence for theta consists of a disorganized and painful smash into MESTand then a withdrawal with a knowledge of some of the laws of MEST, to come back andsmash into MEST again.MEST could be considered to be under onslaught by theta. Theta could be consideredto have as one of its missions, and its only mission where MEST is concerned, the conquest ofthe physical universe. MEST is under raid. Theta is doing the raiding.Theta survives by conquering MEST and retaining the conquest. Theta may havenumerous other methods of survival but they do not apply to this particular physical universewhere we are situate.The survival of theta depends, as it applies to this universe, on changing MEST andorganizing MEST.Life is a manifestation of theta-conquered MEST. Theta has conquered and organizedwith high complexity certain MEST chemicals and energies into life forms. These forms arevery diverse. They progress from the lowest orders, such as the lichens and moss, through theentire vegetable kingdom, through the animal kingdom and up to man. Each form evolvedfrom the initial impact of theta against MEST, and each form on a higher level is supported bylower-level forms.Without the lichen and the moss to make soil, no plant life could grow. Without plantlife converting sunlight and chemical into cellular food, no animal could live. Without the arrayof life forms below him, man could not support himself as an intelligent organism. Intelligencewould be more or less wasted in lower forms. Evolution from lesser forms to greater formsexists in present time and wholly in present time. Evolution traced back along the time span isevolution traced through the MEST remaining after the theta had passed over it.Man alone of the animal and vegetable kingdom possesses the potential power ofchanging MEST in wholesale lots into something theta can use. Man can, by steam shovel anddynamite, move mountains and perhaps -- who knows? -- conquer agalaxy. Theta thusevolves toward higher and higher reason and a higher and higher ability to conquer and changethe physical universe -- MEST.If we grant the cycle of re-creation, growth and decay and the postulate that thetaconquers MEST by first impinging solidly into it and learning about it and then withdrawing tocome back with what it has learned, we can see that theta learns by becoming enturbulated andthen straightening itself out as an endless process. People have known this for a long while --21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"one learns, they say, by hard knocks. That would be a simple way of saying that theta getspainfully mingled with MEST and withdraws to come back for an orderly conquest.If this is the cycle -- and this assumption solves problems which were never solvedbefore -- then we can see that theta would have to have a withdrawal mechanism, and so itdoes. Death is that mechanism. Theta and MEST are attached to each other but when theybecome painfully mixed up, they become entheta and enMEST. Entheta rejects MEST.EnMEST rejects theta. Theta combines with theta or MEST. MEST combines with theta orMEST.Here we have something not unlike a chemical reaction. Two chemicals reside placidlywith each other until stirred up.Stirred they blow apart. Or we could liken this to a characteristic of some energieswhich, when they have their wavelengths changed, reject each other. This is death. Theta andMEST get too enturbulated and the organism dies, the remaining theta rejecting the MESTbody, the MEST body rejecting the theta.There is nothing very complicated about this postulate, even though it solves a greatmany problems. One could say that when life becomes too painful, the body sickens andwithers and the soul departs.Man has for many ages inclined to a belief in free theta. Science became veryunpopular when it sought to break down and abolish, by logarithmic decree, the human soul.However, we do not need a human soul to explain the theta-MEST separation calleddeath even though evidence is growing -- good evidence of a highly scientific nature on a muchmore practical level than parapsychology -- that the human soul does exist in fact.Recently at a major university a group of well done experiments demonstrated thatliving organisms had about them a field of energy which had a point source. If the energyradiated from the cells alone, according to past theory, the picture presented would have beenquite different. Free theta, then, could be postulated to exist. The usual genetic line ofgenerations begetting generations of like organisms explains, in accepted biological terms, thetraverse of theta through generations.It seems inevitable that, as theta conquered MEST and made it into higher and morecomplex organisms, the problem of getting enturbulated theta and MEST separated for the nextgeneration would be resolved, at last, on an intellectual level and within one generation; thetamastering the problem of smoothing itself out within the organism itself Actually, at a swiftglance, this is Dianetics.The defeat of death entirely is not wholly desirable. Evolution is set up to providebetter and better organisms, better able to survive. Without death, all existing planetary spacewould soon be glutted with life which could not be supported. Death can take no holiday. Butlife can be much more effective at least for the species called Man.The cycle of conception, growth, decay, and death, according to our postulate of thetaand MEST, would be the cycle of pleasure-and-pain learning by which the organism is refinedso that the new generation it begets is better able to cope with the environment and conquerMEST than was the older generation. In one lifetime, there is much accumulated pain. Thecells are subjected to pain by continual forceful contact with MEST as in accidents, or bycollision with other life forms. The whole organism as an organism is subjected to pain withevery defeat in its efforts to fulfil its purposes of survival by a conquest of MEST. By pain thecells learn new methods of construction for better survival. Out of organism pain, theorganism learns new skills and methods of surviving.22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The hitch has been that once an organism was subjected to pain, it accumulated someknowledge but it also accumulated some entheta and enMEST. When it had accumulatedenough to be highly ineffective it died, leaving the next generation to carry on. For a man, thisis not efficient. There is nothing wrong with his learning by pain and pleasure what is bad andgood about existence, but there is a great deal in error with his having to carry with him anexcess of entheta and enMEST which hide knowledge from him and cut down his ability tofunction in his proper role.Inevitably a high form of life could be expected to resolve this entheta-enMESTproblem without an intervening death cycle.The enMEST-entheta turbulence is called in Dianetics an engram. An engram is an areain time when theta and MEST have come forcefully together and have intermingled“permanently.”A small boy falls and hits his head. He is for an instant unconscious. As soon as hegets up he may think he has a complete memory of what happened to him. But there is aninstant which is occluded from his consciousness. That instant contains a turbulent area ofentheta and enMEST. A tiny bit of his theta and a small portion of MEST have become a partof his unreasoning mind. This moment is an engram.There are two minds, for our purposes. One is the analytical mind, the other is thereactive mind. The analytical mind is where theta coordinates and reasons for the organism.The reactive mind is where theta and MEST have become enturbulated. The analytical mindoperates by reason. The reactive mind operates by reaction.The reactive mind, having a different polarity than the analytical mind, has the capacityof compelling or inhibiting the organism in regard to certain of its actions. Lower forms ofanimals have this as their main method of thought.The reactive mind was once called the “unconscious” mind. It is a tough, rugged mindwhich is alert during any moment of life, regardless of the presence of pain, and which recordseverything with idiotic faithfulness. It stores up the entheta and enMEST of an accident with allthe perceptics (sense messages) present during the “unconsciousness” resulting from theaccident. Thus the small boy who hit his head on the rock knows analytically that he fell and hithis head, perhaps, but he “knows” better with his reactive mind. Suppose the smell of dust waspresent in the accident. The reactive mind has stored the perceptic of the smell of dust. Theboy one day happens to be weary and to smell this identical smell. He becomes a littlenervous. This is the reactive mind telling him to react and get out of here because when thissmell is present, one gets a bump on the head. That is not logical, but that is the way thereactive mind operates. If the boy does not leave the area and the smell of dust, the reactivemind turns on the pain, in an effort to force him to leave. Finally, the boy learns to avoid thesmell of dust because when he is tired this smell makes his head ache. He does not like thesmell of dust, because to the reactive mind the smell of dust equals a bump on the head.With an analytical mind, the organism can think complex thought and is aware of beingalive. With the reactive mind, the organism reacts in accordance with data received during thehighest threat to survival -- unconsciousness.So long as the reactive mind functioned in organisms which had not evolved language itwas a very workable mechanism. When an animal was injured, his reactive mind picked up allthe perceptics regarding this injury -- sounds, smells, tactile, sights -- and whenever theseappeared in the environment of the animal his mind would make him run or fight. Thus he wassafeguarded by past moments of pain. It is a sort of shotgun method and has a thoroughworkability which, while it would deny the animal pleasure at times, at least kept him alive in atooth and claw environment. When man evolved his analytical mind into a high enough levelof action to need language, trouble set in, for the reactive mind could also contain words.Words heard during moments of unconsciousness, such as those spoken during operations or23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"around a very ill or severely injured person, are faithfully recorded along with their pain. Likehypnotic suggestions, these recordings can be brought into play by asimilar word orenvironment and cause the individual to act as though in the presence of danger. Restimulatedby the environment, these past moments of physical pain and unconsciousness force theindividual into obedience.Engrams, these moments of pain and unconsciousness stored in the reactive mind, actlike hidden command posts in the mind, forcing the individual into patterns of thinking andbehavior which are not called for by a reasonable appraisal of the situation. For the engram isnot reasonable. It is simply a recording which has the sole purpose of steering the individualthrough supposed but usually non-existent dangers.Until Dianetics, the engram was not suspected for it was well hidden as an entity. Theword, engram, is an old one, borrowed from biology. It means simply, “a lasting memorytrace on a cell.” It may be engraved on more than the cell. But, up against dianetic processing,it is not very lasting.Here, then, is a piece of entheta-enMEST -- the engram. MEST and theta, comingtogether too forcefully, as in an impact or injury, or getting enturbulated through illness, arestored in the reactive mind and from three mechanically enturbulate the theta of the analyticalmind into compulsive or obsessive action or enturbulate the MEST of the body into pain,deformity or psychosomatic illness (chronic somatics, as they are called in Dianetics).Accumulate enough entheta in the reactive mind, and the analytical mind becomesaberrated enough to commit suicide or to undertake non-survival activities in order to removethe organism from the world of organisms and let another generation take up the work. Letenough enMEST accumulate in the reactive mind and the MEST of the body will enturbulateinto pains and illnesses which will kill the organism and serve the same purpose.This, then, is the basic assumption on which we are operating in Dianetics. Theassumption is a workable postulate in that its application produces very advantageous results.The relatively sane person becomes more sane. The psychosomatically ill become well. Theunhappy become able to obtain pleasure and lead happy lives, and we have a chance to bringabout enough sanity amongst men to stop the mass murder of war. We can resolve the usualproblems of behavior and set up a better organization.The person undertaking to process another individual dianetically is seeking only toraise the “tone” of that individual -- in other words to increase his survival potential. In orderto do this, the processor simply regains for the other the theta involved in the reactive mind asentheta. Theta is restored to the analytical and, the reactive mind is left without its destructivestore of turbulence and the individual being processed becomes a dianetic release or clear.Column A on the chart is graduated as a tone scale. Actually this scale has many moreheights and levels than those we can now measure and use. How high it actually goes we haveno way of knowing at this time. For our purposes, it is put to use here between the levels of -3and 4.0.It is different from other MEST only in that it has been organized by theta into newchemicals and compounds, for MEST is evolved into new complexities by theta just asorganisms are evolved by theta.At -1, for a short time after death, we have body cells alive. Some of these cells live foras much as a year after organism death, according to some investigators. This is, in any event,the band of cellular life, as different from organism life.At 0.0 we have death at the moment the theta withdraws from the organism.24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"From 0.0 to 2.0 we have the band of operation of the reactive mind. Between thesepoints on the tone scale, the reactive mind is in command of the organism. The reactive mind,in this band, directs the organism according to stored engrams and the analytical equivalent ofthe engram, the lock.From 2.0 to 4.0 we have the band of operation of the analytical mind.Above 4.0 we could postulate other mind levels such as the aesthetic mind, throughother minds, to the free theta mind, if such things exist.This tone scale shows the current level of survival of the organism. It shows also thepotential of survival in terms of longevity of the organism (unless processing intervenes, ofcourse).The higher the individual is upon the tone scale, the better chance he has of obtainingthe wherewithal of living, the happier he is, the healthier his body will be.Actually a person fluctuates on this scale from hour to hour and day to day. Hereceives good news, he goes momentarily to tone 3.0. He receives bad news, he may sink fora moment to tone 1.0. He falls in love and for a month he is at level 3.5. His girl leaves himand for a week he is at tone 0.5. When he is very young he rides around tone 3.5. As hegrows older his tone drifts down to 2.5. As an old man he may drift down to 0.0 and deatheither slowly or swiftly.We are interested in the average level for the individual for the period of life we areaddressing. The average is fairly constant. An individual’s average place on the chart can begauged by inspecting the other columns. Thus he may be an average 2.7 on the tone scale andyet reach 3.5 on occasion, and yet sink to 0.5 on other occasions but only for a short time.The constant position on the tone scale is determined by three factors. The first is theaccumulated entheta in the person -- how much of his theta is enturbulated in engrams andanalytical locks and so strikes back against him, forcing him into non-survival activities orcompelling him or inhibiting him in environments containing imagined dangers.The second factor is the amount of theta the person has as life force. This would be hisvolume of theta. It is another dimension on the chart. Terror is fear with lots of volume. Oneperson has more volume of theta than another and can thus stand to have more enturbulence,more engrams. One may have so little native theta that half a dozen engrams will convert it allinto entheta, leaving the person insane. Another may have so much theta that thousands ofengrams still leave him with enough actual theta to go on living aproductive life in the 2.0-pluszone.The third factor is a ratio between the analytical mind and the reactive mind. Anindividual may have a reactive level of 1.0 and an analytical level of 3.5. The result is thatwhen he is in a restimulative environment he may be covertly hostile but in a more favorableenvironment he may be analytically very productive. These two minds average out to aconstant. All the person doing processing -- an auditor, he is called in Dianetics -- needs toknow about this tone scale is that it gives the percentage of theta of the case which by engramsand locks has become chronically entheta.To raise a person on this tone scale it is only necessary to recover or convert theta fromentheta. Remove, in other words, the stores of turbulence from a person’s life or render themunrestimulated.An auditor is not trying to cure anything. He is simply raising tone. Incidental to araised tone, psychosomatic ills commonly vanish and aberrations disappear. But this isincidental. The task is to make a human being happier, more effective, better able to acceptresponsibility and aid his fellow man. That the person being processed gets “well” in theperiod and stays “well’ is a bonus. Anything which raises a person’s tone can be considered25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"legitimate processing. This includes, of course, nutrition, environment, and education, as wellas processing. Simply taking the person to see a movie he wants to see may raise his tone.Processing achieves permanent rises in tone. If it is illegal anywhere to process people, then itmust also, sequitur, be illegal to make people happy.26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO;COLUMN BDianetic EvaluationThe goals of dianetic processing form a graduated scale. Actually this scale is also thescale of sanity, for there is a parallel between the amount of life force (theta) in the individualavailable for his survival and the amount of sanity he displays. Turbulence of this life forcedecreases not only his sanity but his level of survival. The life expectancy of the individual isalso proportional to his physical well being (absence of factors which predispose him to illness)and his mental well being. In other words, dianetic processing is directly concerned withincreasing the ability of the individual to survive, with increasing his sanity or ability to reason,his physical ability, and his general enjoyment of life.As we look at this scale, we are also looking at the emotional tones of the individual ashe reduces an engram. There is a very direct relation between this scale and naturalperformance. As the individual reduces an engram under processing, he may begin in anapathy tone; as he recounts it the second or third time, he is found to be hostile to the personnelin the engram but will not express that hostility. Then he begins to get angry with thepersonnel who have done this to him. The anger fades to antagonism. Then he becomes boredwith the whole thing. Further recounting brings him into a cheerful frame of mind about it andfinally he simply laughs over it. It was this sequence of behavior, of an engram being reducedwith processing, which gave the clue to the existence of these points on the tone scale. At thetop of the chart we have levels of possible well being which we have not yet explored andwhich, while we have hopes, cannot at this time be reached. Our technology does not extend asfar as derivation and observation say the individual may be able to go. In this range from 4.0to 40.0 on the tone scale lie many possible states of being. What is the theta being? Howmuch can man attain toward spirituality? How can full theta perceptics be best uncovered ifthey actually exist? These are some of the questions. The technology may possibly bedeveloped which will permit man to reach a higher state than he can now attain by our currenttechniques of dianetic processing.The highest point we can at this time reach with dianetic processing is what is calledhere the MEST clear. There are probably several kinds of clears and several conditions ofbeing clear. A MEST clear would be an individual who no longer retained engrams or locks,these having been erased by dianetic processing. The erasure of all engrams and locks in anindividual restores to him a full play of his endowment of theta. His store of theta may or maynot be increased by other means. That would be a matter for solution above this level on thetone scale.A clear in Dianetics, then, is simply one whose engrams and locks are erased and whodoes not become confused, obsessed or impelled by past moments of physical pain. This goalis far, far beyond anything envisioned by such investigators as Freud. There may be goals farbeyond the state of MEST clear.Currently a clear will do. Psychometry and all tests for aberration demonstrate the clearto be unaberrated. His recalls are excellent. His mental stability is very good sinceenvironmental circumstances cannot cause him to act irrationally by reason of aberrations. Hisemotion and ability to enjoy life is free. By becoming clear the individual attains an intelligencequotient far in excess of what he enjoyed before processing. A clear does not instantly growwings or sprout a ten-kilowatt aura. He is not superman. But he has his advantages. He hasfewer accidents, and none because of his own doing. He is healthy. His education andexperience are available for his use as he needs them. He acts on reason and he reasons swiftly.His reaction time is about half the normal. What his longevity is we have no way of knowingat this time but we can only suppose that it is higher than if he had remained aberrated.27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"A general tendency is to regard a clear as a sideshow piece. True, he is better than menhave ever been before. But too much emphasis has been laid upon mental tricks a clear may beable to do, his ability to recall accurately, his ability to see again anything at which he hasgazed. In the business of living these things are not important.Happiness is important. The ability to arrange life and the environment so that livingcan be better enjoyed, the ability to tolerate the foibles of one’s fellow humans, the ability to seethe true factors in a situation and resolve problems of living with accuracy, the ability to acceptand execute responsibility, these things are important. Life is not much worth living if it cannotbe enjoyed. The clear enjoys living to a very full extent. He can stand up to situations whichbefore he was cleared, would have reduced him to a shambles. The ability to live well andfully and to enjoy that living is the gift of the clear. Anyone looking for tricks can best findthem in vaudeville.The clear has the advantage of not retaining, hidden from himself, pain and painfulsituations in his past which, being restimulated by the environment, enturbulate his reason andsicken his body. The clear is produced by simply erasing all the engrams and locks -- the painand painful moments of the past. He is the current technical goal of dianetic processing.He is called a “clear” because his basic personality, his self determinism, his educationand experience have been cleared of aberrative shadows.Actual experience demonstrates that man, once socially imposed controls anddomination by others have been cleared away, is basically good. He is evil only when he isaberrated. Reduction of his aberrations discovers man to be well intended toward his fellows.The highest reason, in this world of complex interdependencies, depends upon the highestcooperation of the individual with his fellows and his environment and a constructive attitudetoward life. The more aberration (engrams and locks) cleared from an individual, the moreindependent and the more cooperative he is. There are four valid therapies, if we wish to usethe term loosely. First there is dianetic processing. This rids the individual of the pain andpainful emotion which aberrates his reason. Second there is education. This indoctrinates theindividual with the culture in which he lives and gives him the skills of survival, better enablinghim to survive. The third is changing his environment into one which is less restimulative, ishappier for him and in which he can better survive. This would include nutrition, medical care,and recreation. The fourth is regulating the amount of MEST which the individual shouldcontrol. He can be given less if he has too much, he can be given more MEST if he has notenough for his ratio of theta, or the MEST which he is trying to control may be changed forhim into another kind of MEST (sublimation).All four of these therapies do the same thing: they enhance the survival of the individualby giving him better tools of survival, better conditions in which to survive, better reasons forsurviving. Any of these do one basic thing: they raise the individual on the tone scale. Thereward of survival being pleasure, for instance, giving the individual pleasure raises hissurvival level. However, the last three of these are relatively ineffective if the individual hasaberrations against pleasure or changing his environment or learning from life, and so we cometo the conclusion that the first step toward a higher survival level would be ridding theindividual of his aberrations. Within reasonable limits the rest should follow.The auditor who is doing processing regularly and has been trained for it will use anymethod to raise the tone of his preclear*, for when the tone is raised, processing is easier.About all one can do with a thoroughly apathetic person is raise his tone by one of the last threemethods; that done, he can be processed.Thus we have the current final goal of processing: the clear. This is the long rangegoal. It is not swiftly reached. It is reached, evidently, only by very good auditing and in thehands of an auditor who is somewhat higher on the tone scale than the preclear.28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"A considerably nearer goal is the dianetic release. The release has reached a pointwhere he no longer has psychosomatic illnesses, where he has good stability and where he canenjoy life. If one simply took all the secondary engrams off a case, one would have a dianeticrelease. The dianetic release is very highabove normal and, itself, has not been attained before by any past known methods of therapy.The psychometric testing of the usual dianetic release shows him to be in very superior mentalcondition. An even nearer goal to the start of processing is the very high normal. By this ismeant a person who is well above the current level of average intellect and behavior. Oneattains, in processing, levels one is capable of reaching by reason of genetic endowment,education, and current physical potentials. One becomes the best that can be made of what oneis natively. Thus, a moron by genetic endowment would reach the level of moron whenprocessed -- but he would have been, by reason of aberration, around the level of idiot when hestarted. An average intellect, by processing, reaches a level of stability and capability very highabove the average. Hence, to reach a very high normal, one would have had to be not toomuch below average to begin. The use of the term “average” or “normal” is susceptible toconsiderable misunderstanding. It simply means the average of the population’s intelligenceand ability. It is remarkably low in the United States compared to what it could be. But theUnited States’ average is considerably higher than that, for instance, of Panama.The next level is boredom. This is borderline between what is called neurotic and whatis called normal. Moderate but unused ambition, a state of mind toward life which is notdiscontented nor yet contented, a purposelessness in living, these mark this stratum. It is arather sorry stratum, actually, but is so superior to what lies below it that the auditor who canget an anger case up to boredom considers he has done very well indeed, and so he has.Below this we have the level of overt hostility. Here is the occasional grouch, thecomplaining individual who yet makes no mistake about what he finds wrong. The “blunt,honest” type who tactlessly tears up the tenderer feelings of his companions is found in thisband.At 2.0 we cross the borderline between the reactive mind and the analytical mindcontrol. And just below this we get the anger band. Here is the person of rather continuoushatred. Here we have impulsive and destructive action.Below anger we go into a slightly sorrier level, covert hostility. Here is the person whohates but is afraid to say he hates, who deals in treachery and who yet expects to be forgiven.At the lower end of covert or hidden hostility we have the continually frightened person, theindividual ridden by fears, the person who is afraid to be or to own anything. A far moreserious level is the apathy level. Here is the suicide. Here is the person who has lost so muchin life that he cannot rise to any situation but simply gives up about everything. If the auditorcan bring the apathy to covert hostility he has accomplished a rise in tone. But overt acts by theauditor are likely to drive the apathy case down toward complete paralysis or death itself. Thisis a very dangerous state of mind, bordering next door to death.Finally we have the lowest band of organic life, pretended death. Some animals havedeveloped pretended death into a survival mechanism. Pretended death says, “I am notdangerous. I am dead. Go away and leave me alone.” The soldier on the battlefield whosuddenly becomes paralyzed is using this mechanism. Some races, the Chinese in particular,descend into this stratum and actually die as a form of suicide self-willed. The auditor who canget a pretended death case to open and close its eyes is achieving remarkable results. Finally wehave the band below death and the MEST body and on these we can do nothing, of course. Therightest right a man can have is to survive to infinity. The 0.0 level is death. How wrong can aperson be? Dead!The higher a person can rise on this scale, the righter he is in terms of reason, in termsof survival, and in terms of general well being. The higher he is, the happier. The lower he is,the sadder. The whole intent of processing is to raise the individual from lower to higher strataon this scale.29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREECOLUMN CPhysiology and BehaviorUnder this column we have data which is considerably more complex than any othersection of this book but which is of considerable interest to biologists and other scientists.

Psychotic, 2. Neurotic, and 3. Psychosomatic.Psychotic is really not a noun but an adjective. However, psychiatry uses it as a nounto mean an individual afflicted with psychosis. A psychosis is any major form of mentalaffliction or disease. In other words, a psychotic, so far as we are concerned, is an individualwho cannot handle himself or his environment well enough to survive and who must be caredfor to protect others from him or to protect him from himself.The psychotic state which receives the most interest is that one which threatens thesurvival of the individual himself or of those around him. Such a psychotic is placed in aninstitution -- when there is room for him. Otherwise, he roams the town or country. However,many other persons are psychotics but are not sufficiently alarming as a menace to themselvesor others to be placed in an institution.The next classification is simply a matter of degree. The neurotic individual is one whois afflicted mentally but can perform some reasonable function or other.The term, psychosomatic, has meant an illness caused by or notably influenced by --the emotional state of the patient.” Actually, more practically, one could say that it is an illnesscaused by the mind. About seventy percent of man’s ills are psychosomatic.In Dianetics we use these terms as follows: Psychotic: A person who is physically ormentally harmful to those about him out of proportion to the amount of use he is to them.Neurotic: A person who is mainly harmful to himself by reason of his aberrations, but not tothe point of suicide.Chronic somatic: A psychosomatic illness, since it is discovered that psychosomaticillness is only the restimulated somatic of some engram and goes away when the engram iscontacted and reduced or erased.This current chart gives a scale by which psychosis and neurosis can be accuratelyclassified and described for the first time. Dianetics does not need a more complex terminologythan it has. Definition of individual tone level by numbers, plus the citing of obviouslymanifested engrams, give adequate clue to what should be done for the preclear.The individualities of psychosis and neurosis are occasioned by the engrams of aparticular psychotic or neurotic. These peculiarities of behavior have as their root certainengramic commands -- words contained in past moments of pain and unconsciousness. Anengram can bring about a manic state wherein the individual declares hysterically andcontinually that he is happy or strong and yet is very low on the scale. Such a condition isbrought into view by the auditor’s inspecting the chart for various other manifestations of thepreclear. Any one column or characteristic of the chart can be altered by a pattern of engramsor severe education, but the other portions of the chart will remain constant for that level. Forinstance, as in the case of a manic engram, the individual appears to be happy at first glance,even says so repeatedly. But further inspection demonstrates that this person is very shy, thathe gives presents to buy people off, that he is given to suspicion and hurtful lies about people.The manic engram demands a tone 3.5 be manifested, but this does not alter the position of thepreclear on the chart.32"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"This is not very complicated and it is very important. To establish the level of sanity onthe chart, the auditor must only locate the level which contains a majority of the manifestationsof the preclear. Almost every case will have a place on the chart which does not hold true onthe chart for the majority of characteristics named. In other words, look for the majority ofcharacteristics, the level where the preclear is found in most of the columns. Do not be upset ifthe preclear fails to hold true in one or two columns. A chain of engrams may command amanic or a depressive aspect in the preclear for a particular subject or column. Engrams whichcommand, for one subject on the chart or one characteristic in life, a tone lower than the actualtone of the preclear may be hard cn the preclear but they have a certain safety factor for theauditor. It is the manic, which commands by engrams a higher tone in one or two columnsthan the actual tone, that is dangerous; for then the auditor may try to use a level of processingtoo high on the chart for his case. If in doubt, work the preclear a tone or two lower than youestimate him by the chart. The potential manic-depressive psychotic can be hammered into apsychotic break by being worked too forcefully too high on the chart. A saving grace indiagnosis is that a manic-depressive is not always a manic or above tone but is often depressiveand well below tone. None but a qualified auditor has any business working with a psychotic.The danger in handling psychotics is very great. This danger did not originate with Dianetics.From the beginning of man’s efforts to solve the riddle of insanity, the psychotic has been agreat liability to the practitioner. The percentage of psychotics who commit suicide duringordinary treatment is vastly larger than the percentage of suicides of psychotics during dianeticprocessing. The conclusion one reaches is that psychotics commit suicide easily. They commitsuicide oftener when in the hands of other practitioners than in the hands of those who knowDianetics.When a person drops below the 2.0 level he has so much entheta compared to his thetathat a sudden shock may simply enturbulate the remaining theta and send him into a psychoticbreak. When all the theta is enturbulated, its reaction is to kick apart theta and MEST, in otherwords, cause death and remove the organism from the path of other organisms. Suicides areassisted normally by engrams which specifically demand suicide. But suicide is a naturalmanifestation, apparently, a fast means of separating theta and MEST and gaining deathquickly. Suicide is always psychotic.People below the 2.0 level, no matter their avowed intention, will bring death or injuryto persons, things and organizations around them, if in the anger bracket, or death tothemselves, if in the apathy bracket. Anyone below the 2.0 level is a potential suicide. Thefascist, for instance, is almost always, in the face of any severe reverse, a sure suicide, fascismbeing below the 2.0 line.A psychotic is a threat of death for somebody or something, if not for himself. Amanic-depressive, sometimes cheerful and apparently only neurotic, is actually very low on thescale and may suddenly commit suicide without any real warning.The psychotic is a definite liability to the auditor, not so much because of processing orwhat unskilled processing may do, but because some factor may come suddenly into theenvironment of the psychotic which causes him to commit murder or suicide. This can then belaid to the processing. Every such action on the part of psychiatric patients is forgivenpsychiatry as a natural consequence of handling psychotics. Handle one gently and keep himout of a non-survival environment and the psychotic may be very successfully treated byDianetics. But do not be amazed if your preclear seems cheerful today and goes into a psychoticbreak tonight and commits suicide tomorrow, after murdering the family. Below 2.0 on thetone scale we have theta and MEST trying to kick apart and bring about death.* * One of ourmost brilliant instructors, David Cary, in the Los Angeles Foundation, had married, longbefore Dianetics, a psychotic girl. He went into Dianetics first trying to help her. He persuadedher to take a course with him at the Foundation. He tried in every way he could to give herprocessing but as she was actually there under protest she would not accept processing fromhim. Cary went on to become an instructor, having an excellent background for teaching and askill in it, while she separated herself from him. She was not obviously psychotic, although thetraining department at Los Angeles had refused her as far below student calibre on the grounds33"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"of her psychometry and a former suicide attempt and was only persuaded to take her as a favorto Cary. Some time later, in an effort to bring her some relief, Cary took a leave of absence andwent home. There he was murdered by his wife, who then committed suicide. His devotionand his efforts to assist her had been mistakable. She had been intensely inaccessible. He hadbeen told many times by his friends in Dianetics that she was dangerous. But that danger washidden. Cary’s devotion cost him his life and cost Dianetics a brilliant instructor and a manwell-loved by all who had a chance to know him. This footnote is included here not simply as amemorial to David Cary, but as information which will give pause to husbands or wives whoare seeking to assist a psychotic spouse. Husband and wife is difficult at best, the partnersbeing usually very restimulative to each other. As husband and wife they will do better to makean arrangement for auditing with another couple. If one of them is psychotic, they should seekthe best professional auditor Dianetics can give them.In treating psychotics, always remember that one is working with minimal theta presentand maximal entheta. Thus, a sudden shock may so restimulate an engram that the remainingtheta enturbulates and vanishes, leaving a lock composed of entheta. There goes sanity.Approach the lock gently and turn it back into theta with great care and caution.No mixture of Dianetics with old treatments or practices of any kind are recommendedto the auditor. Electric shock has been found to lay a severe engram into an alreadyovercrowded reactive mind and is not successful in any way, other than making a few patientsso apathetic that they are barely acceptable to society. Psycho-surgery, removing pieces of thebrain, has long been acknowledged an entire failure so far as any actual “cure” is concerned.Free association is a long drawn-out procedure which is, at best, of very questionable value.Restraints and cold packs only succeed in shocking the patient into a deeper state of lethargy.Do not condone such methods nor permit them to be used on your preclears, for the simplereason that they do not work.Handle the psychotic gently. Respect his rights to a whole brain and a future. Do notconsider that he is your toy or your experimental animal. Above all, when you are auditing, bea civilized human being. Don’t try to punish your patient because he “refuses to get well.” Hisengrams and general turbulence make your preclear very hard to reach. His basic personality isin there trying to help you. Smooth out entheta and make theta out of it and do it as gently asyou can. Don’t lose your temper or resort to drastic methods. Be civilized. Man can behandled only with reason, not by Hitlerianistic force. You can’t beat a man into sanity. If youfeel so exasperated by a preclear that you would like to scold him or hit him, stop the sessionand go cool down. Don’t fill him full of sedatives or put him in restraints. By being asgracious and serene as you possibly can be, you will greatly increase your success in treatingyour fellow man. And you have to be first cousin to a saint to get the best results withpsychotics. Any effort made to hammer a patient or scold a patient into sanity will meet withfailure. The proof of that is the 19,000,000 insane, institutionalized or at liberty, in the UnitedStates alone. Don’t be convinced that you have rights of ownership or life-and-death powersover your fellow man. Leave that to the accomplished authoritarians, of whom we,unfortunately, have so many.Be a human being and you’ll get good results.34"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE;COLUMN EMedical RangeThe medical doctor a short time ago seldom thought of his patients in terms of mentaldisorder. Recently he realized that some seventy percent of man’s ills are of mental origin --which is to say, psychosomatic illnesses account for a high majority of sicknesses.In addition to those commonly listed as psychosomatic illnesses many others must besuspected, because of another factor. Bacterial infection itself is assisted by the presence ofengrams. Thus the percentage is possibly higher.The engram assists bacteria and viruses in this fashion. The physical injury (theenMEST of the engram) resides in a certain portion of the body, that portion which wasinjured. Let us say an engram is received by reason of a severe chest injury. This engram maynot become active for many years. But keyed-in then, it brings about a chest weakness in thatthe blood and endocrine fluids tend to avoid the area as though it were just now injured. Intothis weakened area may come bacteria of one kind or another such as those of pneumonia ortuberculosis. This is a temporary infection. But now the area is restimulated by the pain of theinfection and so the engram is further keyed-in and reinforced and the area of the chest cannotbecome resistant enough to throw aside the infection. Thus we get the chronic infections, thelasting illnesses.Technically one can say there are three phases in a disease: 1. predisposition, 2.precipitation, and 3. perpetuation. The engram accounts for these in that it renders an area ofthe body, or an organ such as the heart, weak, then by the key-in of the engram brings aboutthe illness and finally, because the keyed-in pain keeps on being restimulated, makes the illnesscontinue.As far as injuries are concerned, engrams apparently cause the accident prone. Theengram may command the person to injure himself or others. One such engram restimulated ina preclear caused him to “unwittingly” injure his hand severely three times in one week. Theengram was found and reduced and the preclear has not since injured that hand. Thus accidentsof major and minor character may be chalked up to engrams. A command in an engram such as“I always have to hurt myself” will cause the individual to do just that.The endocrine system is very sensitive to thought and is under the control of thought.A doctor who attended a series of lectures on Dianetics at length came forward and, ratherdisturbed, said, “For forty years of study and practice I have been using the standard conceptthat structure controls function. I finally see what you are saying. It is the other way around.Function controls structure. Now maybe we can solve a few more problems.”Endocrine imbalances such as reduced thyroid, over-weight, reduced sexual capability,sterility, and numerous others are monitored by engrams. The proof of this is simply thatwhen engrams are reduced the glandular imbalances tend to correct themselves. Also, engramsreduce the acceptance by the body of artificial hormones, for when engrams are reducedartificial hormones can be administered with benefit.There is a direct index between the amount of entheta in an individual and his physicalhealth. This is manifest when one examines the state of health of the psychotic. A pretendeddeath case is almost impossible to keep alive. Apathy cases starve and develop illnesses andcannot resist the smallest infections, just as grief shocks are so often followed by illness. Thecovertly hostile individual is usually a hypochondriac, is continually developing illnesses whicheven he knows to be false. The anger case suffers from all manner of ills, particularly arthritisand other illnesses which settle as chronic somatics and develop deposits, which enlarge35"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"glands, which alter the condition of the heart, and so forth. From there on up the scale, the lessentheta and the more theta, the greater the physical health of the individual.As an example, a young girl was in a hospital recovering from appendicitis. She wasrunning a fever, a very serious thing in such a case. An auditor was called in and by a fewquestions found out she was stuck on the time track in an earlier mumps engram. He broughther up to present time and the temperature dropped to normal within the next ten minutes andrecovery then proceeded uneventfully.A usually well but temporarily ill person slides down the tone scale because oftemporarily restimulated engrams. Getting him into present time will often materially shortenany course of illness.Another part of Medical Dianetics is the dianetic assist. Any very recent engram can berun with impunity. Picking up engrams of injuries which have just happened demonstrablyshortens the term of recovery and increases life potential threatened because of the accident.Shock occasioned by operations and accidents is rendered less dangerous, according toobservation, by the dianetic assist.In preventative Dianetics, the first rule is to maintain silence around an injured or illperson. This prevents the engram from having words in it and reduces its dangerousnessmarkedly. Several hospitals now practice this. Doctors in other hospitals would find theirwork much easier and more successful if they would simply make standard the practice ofcomplete silence around operating tables.It should not be overlooked by the auditor, regardless of his ability to do near miraclesin the face of physical malady, that virus, bacteria and broken legs still exist. The auditorwould do well to recognize the function of the medical doctor as a primary necessity in asociety. When an artery is pumping the life of the patient out upon the ground, the engrambeing received is the least important part of the circumstance. The important thing is to inhibitthe artery. Picking up an engram will not heal but will only assist the healing of broken bones.While most surgery, by the admission of surgeons themselves, is unnecessary, only surgerycan effect emergency repairs. The field of the medical doctor is evidently the field of theacutely ill, and it is a wise auditor who works smoothly and harmoniously with medical doctorsin the full recognition that medicine is often the only means of preserving or extending life.The auditor’s job is to shorten the course of any illness, to assist the healing of any injury, andparticularly, to bring people up the tone scale to a level where they will seldom fall victim toaccident or illness.36"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX;The Basic Laws of ThetaAffinity - Reality - CommunicationThere is in Dianetics a triangle of great importance. Theta, the energy of thought andlife, has as primary manifestations affinity, reality, and communication.This is the peculiarity of theta: in lieu of the cohesion, matter, and force laws of thephysical universe (MEST), thought (theta) has to have affinity, reality, and communication tosurvive. MEST requires certain laws to survive -- or obeys those laws in the business ofsurviving. Energy and matter in space and time hang together in a certain fashion, governed bycertain laws. The discovery and use of those MEST laws make up the science of physics. Thetaalso hangs together in a certain fashion, and the discovery and use of those laws make up thescience of Dianetics.We do not know nearly as much about theta as we know about atoms and electrons, theprobable parallel entity in the physical universe. Electrons, protons, neutrons and various otherparts of physical-universe energy flow at certain speeds and, in various combinations, exist andfunction in the physical universe. There is, for instance, the speed of light; there is thecomposition of atoms and molecules. Theta probably has various similar laws, and at this timewe do not know much about them; but we know enough to know that there is a differencebetween theta’s laws of function and those of the energies in the physical universe.Primary amongst the laws of theta is that it has a fundamental Goal, the changing ofMEST. It changes MEST by constructing it into mobile units we know as life organisms and,through those, making MEST into various forms and objects or destroying those forms andobjects.Theta uses an evolutionary scale in present time. Lower forms of life support higherforms of life. We have thought of evolution in the past as something stretched back along theeons, as a graduated scale of various species which changed as the ages progressed down toour present life forms. This concept of evolution has many limitations and gaps and is not veryworkable. In Dianetics, using the theta theory, we see that all theta is actually in present timeand that no action is possible except in present time and that present time is a continuing seriesof instants in which, moment to moment, theta goes on changing MEST. It is not verycomplicated to see that right here in present time we have evolution operating. The lichen andmoss convert crude MEST ash and rock into soil. On this soil higher forms of plant life cangrow.Vegetable life, however, is not very mobile. Theta animates organisms which arecomposed of theta and MEST. But trees change very little MEST. Thus, following up thescale, we find theta involved with making animals and insects. And the larger animals, unableto live on soil and sunlight, live on vegetable forms which are themselves the converters of soiland sunlight into comestibles for higher forms.As soon as we get up to the very complex forms of life such as the mammal, we find avery large amount of MEST being converted. When we arrive at the level of man we begin tosee that theta can create or destroy vast forms of MEST.A man damming a river and installing a hydroelectric plant is, for his own survival,changing MEST. Another man turning a switch and lighting an electric bulb, is shifting andaltering MEST.Theta, on this chain of evolution right in present time, exists in a state which can changea very great deal of MEST. As we learn more and more about MEST we can change more37"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"MEST. And as we learn more about theta we can control and Change more MEST. The atombomb is a case of changing a great deal of MEST in a direction which defeats a great deal oftheta -- thus we consider the bomb wrong. It fails to enhance survival.Man can reasonably change large amounts of MEST. Therefore he can be considered asort of intermediate goal. Lower life forms cannot change MEST on any grand scale. Man,potentially, can build or blow up planets. Man will evolve into more than man, probably.Educationally, he evolves a long distance when he begins to understand something about hisown purpose of being.The cycle by which theta understands MEST is a very simple one. Theta impingesheavily against MEST. This causes a turbulence. But from that confusion theta extracts sometiny law of MEST and withdraws to apply to MEST this newly learned law for the conquest ofMEST. No knowledge exists without aprimary enturbulation. MEST is conquered by theta’s taking successive laws of MESTand turning MEST against MEST to change it.Theta, with this mechanism of turbulence, can learn much about MEST. But if theta isgoing to be embroiled with MEST in a disorderly fashion, then theta must have some means ofbecoming unenturbulated so as to profit by what it has learned through the confusion. Thetahas to be able to withdraw in order to come back for an orderly conquest of MEST, using thelaws of the physical universe to conquer the physical universe.The basic mechanism theta had in the past was death. The cycle of creation, growth,decay, and death was one and is one which applies to a species as a species, to an organism asan organism, or to a group of organisms. The only way theta could get free, evidently, wasthrough death.With the advent of a science of thought, whereby some of the natural laws of theta areunderstood, man can in one lifetime disenturbulate his theta and MEST and benefit from theexperience gained by the enturbulence. What Dianetics does to longevity has not even beensurveyed, but it certainly upsets the evident purpose of the death cycle.In Dianetics we have much to do with affinity, reality, and communication. Whateverthe accuracy of the basic postulates, it becomes evident to the auditor as he uses these threepoints of the triangle that he has a highly useful tool.The triangle of affinity, reality, and communication could be called an interactivetriangle in that no point of it can be raised without affecting the other two points and raisingthem, and no point of it can be lowered without affecting the other two points. The postulatedreason for this is that affinity, reality, and communication are component parts of theta, andthus affinity, reality, and communication are three manifestations of the same thing.This has a very high usefulness to the auditor. For instance, when his preclear has avery thorough sonic shutoff the auditor knows that he can regain some sonic either byincreasing the present-time affinity of the preclear or by raising the level of reality of thepreclear. Likewise, if the affinity of the preclear is markedly low, the auditor can raise thataffinity by bettering the communication and reality concepts of the preclear. And finally, whenthe reality of the preclear is low, it can be raised by increasing affinity and communication.This is highly useful because often the auditor cannot directly discover the suppressoron one point of the triangle. By blowing locks on the other two points he can make thissuppressor accessible.Whether or not one either understands or agrees with the theta-MEST theory ofDianetics, the affinity, reality and communication postulate which derives directly from it is ofinfinite use.38"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"It is very difficult to suppress the affinity of an individual, his capacity, that is, toreceive or give love, without also suppressing his communication and reality factors.Likewise, one cannot suppress the communication factor without also suppressing the affinityand reality factor. And finally, one cannot suppress reality without suppressing affinity andcommunication. For instance, a mother telling a child that she does not love it is alsoforbidding the child to speak and is blunting the child’s reality, since the child normally expectsto be loved. To tell the child to keep quiet is also to reject the child and is to offend the child’sconcept of what the real world should contain. Contradicting one of the child’s statements orbeliefs, which is to say his reality, is also to break affinity with him and suppress hiscommunication. One cannot touch this triangle at any point without affecting the other twopoints; and yet each point is highly specific and has its own characteristics.One must also consider in a discussion of theta that theta is measured on a gradient tonescale from 0.0 upwards to 40.0. At the highest range, theta could be considered to be in a purestate. It would be a clear, even-flowing river. It would be reason at its highest. It would becomplete rationality. It would be complete reality. It could accomplish completecommunication in its own level. And it would be pure affinity.Descending down the tone scale, greater and greater dissonance could be considered tobe introduced into theta. The stream, so to speak, becomes more and more tumultuous, moreand more fixed within narrow banks, flowing over heavier rocks and then shoals. As amusical analogy, one could say that the note was becoming less and less a pure andharmonious vibration and was becoming more and more off-key from itself.Descending down the tone scale, affinity, reality, and communication form inthemselves a dissonance one with the other. Also, theta is in more and more tumultuousconfusion with MEST. Instead of an orderly and harmonious conquest of MEST by theta, onesees, as the tone scale is descended toward death, greater and greater turbulence.The sudden impact of theta and MEST together could be considered a turbulence whichcreates dissonance in theta. This is registered and recorded as pain. Theta and MEST soimpacted together, the characteristics of the theta are changed, according to theory andobservation, and theta below 2.0 on the tone scale can be considered enturbulated theta -- thetawhich has been confused and chaotically mixed with the material universe and which will lie inthis confusion until death or some other process disenturbulates it. Theta below 2.0 we callentheta.The mechanism here is a simple one. MEST, in a life form, is an orderly array above2.0 on the tone scale; below 2.0 MEST is considered to be confused and enturbulated and isreferred to as enMEST.We could draw a diagram which would show theta and MEST appearing above 2.0 andentheta and enMEST appearing below 2.0. From 2.0 upwards, theta and MEST are more andmore orderly mingled until MEST is left behind entirely and theta exists in its pure stage.Below 2.0, entheta and enMEST are more and more enturbulated in the life form until the pointof death and below is reached.We could consider that theta gradually reverses polarity as it descends the tone scaletoward 0.0. We could consider that MEST reverses its polarity when it rises up the tone scalefrom -3. Entheta has a very repelling effect upon theta and MEST. EnMEST has a repellingeffect upon theta and MEST. Below 2.0, MEST and theta are at best turbulently united.Above, they are united more and more smoothly as they rise up the scale, the MEST more andmore under the influence of theta, the theta more and more able to do things with the MEST.Below 2.0, the theta is less and less able to do anything with the MEST. Entheta becomes aschaotic as MEST in its pure state.39"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Here is the mechanism of death, then: entheta and enMEST driving out from theorganism the remaining theta and MEST. This is an important postulate in Dianetics, since fromthis can be derived the entire tone scale and all the manifestations.It may occur to someone to ask “What is the difference between MEST and enMEST, ifboth are without order or plan?” The answer is both simple and important. Pure MEST may besaid to be virgin chaos, entirely innocent of plan. An organism at tone 4.0 may be said tocontain MEST harmoniously planned and organized by theta. But enMEST is neither of these:it is neither organized nor virginal it is confused and embroiled with entheta in a twisteddisorganized plan of human behavior and aberrations. These postulates are what an engineercalls a highly workable truth -- for to all engineer, truth is not the absolute of the metaphysician;it is simply something which has a relatively high workability.From the theta-MEST theory also may be derived an explanation of faith healing --which is more than an explanation, being a very workable tenet for the auditor. It has beenmany times noted in the course of man’s adventures in the realm of mental and physical healingthat one individual or another, merely by his presence, or an area, by its sanctity or the belief ofpeople in it, could accomplish the nearly entire de-aberration of mentally or physically ill humanbeings. In South America there is a church outside of which stands a small mountain ofcrutches cast away by cripples who became well merely by approaching the altar; and inBethany, some years ago a man named Lazarus came forth from his tomb.It is an axiom in Dianetics that a sufficient quantity of theta brought into proximity withentheta will disenturbulate the entheta and convert it into theta. This is important enough toform the basic axiom of processing. It explains to the auditor why he cannot take a psychoticwho has practically no remaining theta and successfully send that psychotic into the entheta ofan engram. The remaining theta of the psychotic would itself merely become enturbulated, notbeing sufficient in quantity, and the psychotic could theoretically become worse. Thus thesecond axiom: Entheta in sufficient quantity brought into proximity with theta will enturbulatethat theta.Here we have a matter of quantity. When there is a great deal of theta present a lesseramount of entheta will disenturbulate and become theta. But when we have more entheta thantheta, the theta is likely to become entheta. This is the contagion factor of aberration. Thetaitself could be called reason; entheta could be called unreason. Reason in sufficient quantitybrought into the presence of a lesser quantity of unreason will cause reason to prevail.Unreason in sufficient quantity brought into the presence of a lesser quantity of reason willcause that reason to become unreason. Hence the restimulative character of processing to theauditor. Hence also the various kinds of processing which must be used on various cases.The purer the theta, the more MEST will be attracted under it. Theta attempting aconquest of enMEST will become in itself enturbulated. Entheta applied to MEST will make itinto enMEST.Entheta will tend and act in the direction of death. EnMEST tends and acts in thedirection of death. Theta tends and acts in the direction of survival; and MEST tends and actsin the direction of survival when it has been conquered in an orderly fashion, in an organism orby a theta organism.As an example of entheta consider the thief. A thief is chiefly entheta and prefersenMEST to MEST. A thief will make enMEST out of the MEST he steals, which is to saycloud its title and possibly injure its form or substance. EnMEST, possessed by theta, has atendency to enturbulate the theta. Thus, an honest man attempting to own a confused anddishonest property will himself become enturbulated. A whole series of axioms and optimumconduct codes can be derived from these principles.It is also observable that a high-theta-volume individual can conquer and handle moreMEST than a low-theta-volume individual or an entheta individual. The psychotic, for instance,40"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"will ruin any MEST he contacts; whereas the highly reasonable man will enhance the MEST hecontacts.Here also we apparently have some small clue as to what “luck” is. MEST moves inautomatically under good theta. MEST moves out from under entheta.When we speak of affinity, reality, and communication we are talking about the threecomponent parts of theta. These three quantities in combination playing upon MEST give us themanifestation we might call computation, or understanding. One has to have some affinity foran object, some communication with it, and some concept of its reality, before he canunderstand it. His ability to understand any thought or object depends upon his affinity, hiscommunication, and his reality. All mathematics can be derived from affinity, communication,and reality playing upon MEST.Because affinity, reality, and communication are three component parts of the samething, namely theta, it would be difficult to increase one component without increasing theother two.The physical universe and what we have called the theta universe are each based uponthe principle of survive and succumb. So far as life is concerned, everything above the 2.0level is survive, and everything below the 2.0 level is succumb. Above the 2.0 level, theorganism tends toward life; below the 2.0 level, the organism tends only toward death. Thedynamics could actually be considered as theta applied to various subjects and in differentmanifestations. Any individual, even an aberree, has occasional moments of functioning as aclear. When he is not restimulated -- when his engrams, locks, and secondaries are notforcefully restimulated by his environment -- the theta gradually disenturbulates, and hebecomes possessed of a higher level of reason. Most people reach 3.0 part of the time, as anormal course of events. Some rare people behave and reason like MEST clears. Hardlyanyone has failed to have moments when he approximated the condition of clear. Being clear isa state of being possessed of all available theta, which in an aberree would be partially trappedin engrams and locks. The ordinary person, with his engrams and locks, is rarely in the happyand reasonable state of a release or a clear. The release or clear is in that desirable state ratherconstantly; but this does not mean that the release or clear are not, in the presence of anoverwhelming amount of entheta in the environment, susceptible to enturbulation, for they are.They, however, do not greatly retain the enturbulence, and as soon as they are free from suchan entheta environment they restore immediately to a cleared state. Further, they do not sinkvery far down the tone scale. This case is very different from that of an individual who hasrelatively little theta left to enturbulate and who in even a mild entheta environment sinks rapidlydown the tone scale. It is a question of resilience and recovery ability, as well as the ability toreason constantly and clearly in most situations.The chart should be read with the understanding that nearly everyone who does nothave to be put away in a sanatorium, wholly bereft of his senses, has some available theta.There are many persons possessed of a high volume of theta but whose aberrations bring themdown chronically below the level of 2.0, who can yet function, having some theta available.These people enturbulate rapidly. There are many people who are not classified as psychoticordinarily, who demonstrate considerable quantities of theta, and who yet, on some slight set-back, enturbulate rapidly down to 1.1 or 0.5 on the tone scale and remain there for some timeafter the enturbulence. These people, rested, and not in immediate contact with therestimulative situation, regain some of the theta from the turbulent area.The strength of the dynamics of an individual could be considered to be determined,first, by the native volume of theta possessed by the individual and, second, by the impedingeffect of his engrams, as restimulated in the environment. One could, then, have a very highdynamic individual who yet has been so thoroughly aberrated that on the least set-back hewould fall rapidly down the tone scale below 2.0. People like this, having high dynamics,attempt naturally to conquer a great deal of MEST, but in the process of conquering it areenturbulated by the MEST, the society, and the environment, so that they accumulate enormous41"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"quantities of locks. And if such a person has hidden within him many engrams these willrapidly become charged, and the person will become highly concluded and intensely aberrated,but will yet be able to function sometimes on a creative and constructive level. The system ofdynamics is a method of subdividing the theta of an individual to show how much theta he hasavailable in any one sphere of activity. These divisions could be made as follows: First: thedynamic of self, the urge for individual survival, reason toward individual survival for one’sself;Second: the dynamic of survival through sex and children; Third: the urge to survivethrough groups, as a member of the group, or for the survival of the group itself; Fourth: theurge of the individual to survive for mankind, or the urge of all mankind to survive; Fifth: theurge of the individual to survive for life, or of life to survive for itself,;Sixth: the urge of the individual to promote the survival of MEST, either for his ownbenefit or for the benefit of MEST itself (manifested in the preservation of property, as such,no matter to whom it belongs); Seventh: the urge of theta to survive, the urge of the individualto promote the survival of theta and to survive through the survival of theta. Any of thesedynamics can be broken down into the three component parts of affinity, communication, andreality. On the first dynamic, one has the affinity for self the concept of the reality of self andthe ability to communicate with memory of self.The second dynamic would concern itself with the affinity for a mate or children for thefuture of a race, the communication with a mate or children, and a concept of the reality ofthese.In the third dynamic lies the affinity of the individual for the group, or the affinity of thegroup for itself; the ability of the individual and the group to communicate; the general reality oragreement existing in the group and between the individual and the group.The fourth dynamic, as ARC, would mean the affinity of the individual for all man, andof mankind for the individual; it would include the communication of man with man, and thereality concepts or agreements of men with mankind.The fifth dynamic would include the affinity of the individual for life, or the affinity oflife for other life; the ability of life to communicate with life, or with the individual; and theconcept of agreement and reality of life.The sixth dynamic would include the affinity, communication, and reality of MEST asitself within its own laws as expressed in the physical sciences; but more important for ourpurposes, the feeling of the individual for MEST, to know it, to use it, and to preserve it. Theseventh dynamic would be that of theta itself which is composed in its component parts,according to our postulates, of affinity, reality, and communication.42"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVEN;COLUMN FEmotionEmotion could be called the energy manifestation of affinity. They are listed in twocolumns because emotion may be treated as a subdivision of the more general subject ofaffinity.Emotion is not synonymous with life energy but is evidently only a part of one of thepoints of the triangle of affinity, communication, and reality. Emotion, however, furnishes anobvious index to the psychic state, and is the quantity most easily observed by the auditor. Asused in Dianetics, emotion could be called the index of the state of being.The development of a new science naturally means the development of many newterms; and as new data is discovered, old definitions are often found to be inadequate. Thus itis with emotion. In the English language “emotional” is often considered synonymous with“irrational.” One often hears the statement, “Don’t be so emotional, be reasonable.” This wouldseem to assume that if one is emotional one cannot be reasonable. No more unreasonableassumption could possibly be made.Engrams have, each one of them, their own emotional tones, just as each engram has asomatic. This is false emotional tone which is foisted upon the aberree in lieu of natural andreasonable emotion. Because emotion has a strong manifestation and because the less desirablekinds of emotion are displayed by people in highly tense states, emotion has been clouded as adesirable quantity.A fully reasonable human displays the emotion called for, rationally, by thecircumstances with which he is confronted in present time. Thus if the present timecircumstance requires grief a rational and reasonable person is apt to display grief. If thepresent-time situation demands anger, the rational human being will display anger. Irrationalemotion could manifest itself irrationally for any given situation. If the present-timecircumstances required grief yet the individual displayed no grief this would be irrational. Ifthe present-time situation seemed to indicate, because of happy circumstances, happiness, andyet the individual remained apathetic, this would be irrational.Emotion, then, is neither rational nor irrational except as it is displayed. An aberratedperson seldom displays the type of emotion rationally called for by any given circumstance. Todescribe this we would actually need a new word, perhaps “misemotional.” Such a wordwould indicate that a person did not display the emotion called for by the actual circumstancesof the situation. This would indicate that his aberrated condition caused him to display anemotional reaction inappropriate to the present-time situation. Being misemotional would thenbe synonymous with being irrational. Being emotional, however, would indicate, if theemotionality agreed with current circumstances, a rational state of being.One can fairly judge the rationality of any individual by the correctness of the emotionhe displays in a given set of circumstances. To be joyful and happy when circumstances callfor joy and happiness would be rational. To display grief without sufficient present-time causewould be irrational.Engrams, and the generally aberrated state of a being, generally deny emotion.Happiness and cheerfulness being the very trademark of survival, one could expect withconsiderable justification that as an individual became more and more aberrated he would beless and less able to be happy. Such is the case. From happiness, at the top, down thedwindling spiral through anger, grief and apathy to no reaction whatever would run not only43"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"emotion but the life potential of the individual. And thus live have a direct index ofmeasurement of the aberrated state of the person.One must remember that even a very aberrated person, in relatively unenturbulatedpresent-time moments, has considerable free theta. The fact that a person enturbulates readily,for instance, to the 1.1. level and thus reacts along that level does not mean that every wakingmoment finds him reacting on such a level. Until he is entirely psychotic in the face of present-time enturbulation, he quite ordinarily demonstrates a great deal of free theta. The danger of hiscondition does not lie in the fact that he is always psychotic; it lies in the fact that when hebecomes enturbulated, his existing free theta, which itself is capable of happiness and reason,will enturbulate down the tone scale to 1.1. As this individual lives longer and becomes moreaberrated, when a trying situation confronts him, a situation which enturbulates his free theta,he will drop not only to the 1.1 level but below that, to the 0.5 level. Once the dwindling spiralhas set in, from year to year the environment of the aberree remaining more or less unchanged,he can be expected, when enturbulated, to drop lower and lower on the tone scale. Dianeticscan interrupt this dwindling spiral; it can restore free theta to the mind, it can erase the trapswhich wait for the individual when his free theta is enturbulated. Thus, a person who is adianetic release or a MEST clear is extremely resilient. Trying present-time circumstances donot form heavy locks. He has no irrational reasons to experience grief or fear, but whenpresent-time circumstances strongly call for these emotions, he will display them, and yet soonafterwards be fully recovered. The only thing which can enturbulate his theta and cause him todrop any distance down the tone scale momentarily is some circumstance in the immediateenvironment strong enough to influence and affect him. A person who has been freed ofengrams, secondaries, and locks should not be expected to remain in a state of idioticcheerfulness in the face of any and all circumstances. This in itself would be a very aberratedtype of conduct. There are certain manic individuals who do this, and they, unfortunately, arequite insane.One of the primary things which dianetic processing does is free the emotions of theindividual so that he can experience emotion ranging from happiness, eagerness, andexhilaration, down to anger, fear, and grief when these emotions are called for by present-timecircumstances.Emotion is a primary index of the tone scale. This does not mean that emotion is allthere is to theta. Emotion is used as a primary clue to the auditor of the preclear’s position onthe tone scale because it is so easily recognized. The two gradient systems, however, on themargin of the chart, one from zero to 1000, and the other from -3 to 40.0 are both arbitrarynumber systems. The zero-to-1000 scale exists so that psychometric percentiles can becomputed on the chart. The -3 to 40.0 scale is the original tone scale of Dianetics. This originalscale is preserved because it is handy for the auditor to use and is a basic part of dianeticterminology. One quite commonly hears auditors speaking of a “1.5 case,” meaning a case ofchronic anger or one which enturbulates easily into anger. Or one may hear an auditor speak ofa “2.5 case,” which tells his indoctrinated listener that this case is rather bored with the wholething, but is fairly well advanced and comes up easily to what is known as “false four.”The tone scale is not a derived scale, but one which has been constructed afterobservation of many preclears. An auditor can very easily observe this. Suppose he discovershis preclear to be in an anger tone as he runs an incident. The auditor can expect that the angerwill generally, on one recounting, abate; and on the second recounting, that the preclear willbegin to express resentment; on the third recounting, or fourth, or fifth, the preclear may cometo boredom; then to indifference; and on subsequent recountings, rise up to perfect cheerfulnessabout the incident. If the auditor were to discover an incident where the preclear was in thedeepest apathy, the tone of the preclear would be seen to rise during auditing through the wholespan of the tone scale, step by step.First, the preclear would be in very deep apathy, not knowing or caring whether thisincident would resolve or not. He would then go up the scale to apathy, then to grief. Hewould express some fear and apprehension. He would become sullen. Finally he would44"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"become angry. Then he would express resentment, and through boredom, would graduallyrise up to “false four.”Not all incidents, of course, find the preclear going up the scale step by step. Hefollows exactly the same scale, but he may skip or omit various stages of the emotion. Startingan incident at grief, the preclear may come to boredom, and thus to complete carelessness aboutthe incident. Thus, the tone scale is based upon observation. It is a very valuable index to thestate of an engram. If the preclear enters the engram in anger -- is made angry by it, that is --the auditor knows that the incident will be relatively easy to run on up the line. But if thepreclear is found to be in very deep apathy, the auditor knows that he has a long way to travelwith this incident before he can bring the preclear entirely out of it up the tone scale.Finding the preclear in deep apathy in an incident should alert the auditor to the fact thathe must handle this situation with the greatest care, that he must request subsequent recountingsvery gently, so that the apathy will gradually rise, with repeated recountings of the incident, upto grief; so that the grief can release and so bring the preclear up to the top of the scale,concerning this incident.The emotional tone scale introduces something else as an auditor’s tool. When theauditor discovers he cannot run grief out of a case, he should examine the preclear’s bank; littlemore carefully to discover what emotional tone he can turn on in the preclear, since he can turnon at least one emotional tone. If he cannot turn on grief, he may be able to turn on anger; andonce he has taken some of the anger off the case perhaps he can run some of the lower levelssuch as fear. Having run several incidents which have fear in them, the auditor may discoverthat he can run grief off the case.Sometimes a case will fall so easily into apathy that the auditor has to be very alert inorder to unburden some of the higher-level emotions before he attempts to run the incidents ofdeepest apathy which he finds in the case.As a working rule, an auditor can always find some emotional tone to run on a case.He should make it his business to discover what emotional tone is easiest to run on the case andrun some incidents of that tone. There have been instances when merely running happyincidents on a case recovered theta from the lower strata of tones of the scale that sufficientattention units were made available to turn on sonic and visio. This trick of running pleasuremoments is easily the best way to get a preclear up to present time. One runs the pleasuremoment just as though it were an engram, and the attention of the preclear can be attracted tothis incident so strongly that attention units are recovered from other incidents in the past.Emotion is an integral part of every engram; but it will stand by itself in what is called a“secondary engram.” There are actually three kinds of secondary engrams: affinity break orenforcement engrams; reality break or enforcement engrams; and communication break orenforcement engrams. These are called secondary engrams because they do not containphysical pain but depend, for their permanence, on a physical pain engram earlier in the bank.Thus the words, “secondary engram,” mean a highly charged moment in the analytical mind ofthe preclear which depends for its force on a physical pain engram lower in the bank. Inrunning secondary engrams, or painful emotion, the auditor must develop considerable skill.One cannot, for instance, bluntly demand grief; nor can one bluntly demand fear. Skill and tactare required to reach the necessary incident to resolve the case.It is a working rule of the auditor that a case must always be unburdened of someemotion. Only cases in a very high range of the tone scale can have physical pain engrams runon them without running some secondary engrams. If one could run off a case all painfulemotion -- all unexpressed resentment, anger, fear, grief and apathy -- one would have adianetic release whether he touched physical pain engrams or not. This is theoretically true butpractically almost impossible, since, when he starts to run various secondary engrams, theauditor will often find the case sliding back into the supporting physical pain engram, whichmust then be run.45"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Running the painful emotion off a case produces the most signal improvements that areobtained in dianetic processing.46"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTCOLUMN GAffinityIn view of the fact that the word “love” has at least two outstanding meanings in theEnglish language, a misunderstanding could result if it were employed to represent this factorin theta.“Affinity” is a broad term and means simply a sympathy of feeling, an affection, thefeeling of one person for another, as we use it in Dianetics. Affinity, in the theta sense,dianetically, might be compared to cohesion and adhesion in the physical universe, as appliedto energy. There are degrees of affinity, according to our definition, as represented by the tonescale. These range from a feeling of well being along all the dynamics down the various stagesof emotion to severance of feeling from any and all of the dynamics. Affinity broadly includesemotion.The tone scale of affinity, as represented on the chart, refers to the reaction of theindividual at any particular time to just one or to a small number of people. But as affinity issuppressed repeatedly, the individual will begin to take on an habitual level on the affinityscale, an habitual reaction to almost all people. This is also true of the affinity scale of groups,and one can find on this scale the tone level of any nation or, indeed, of mankind for any givenperiod, which would be the averaging out of the general reaction of mankind to mankind.At the top of the scale around tone four, the individual experiences love, strong andoutgoing; he experiences friendliness, this is an extroversion of affinity. One commonly findsthis in children, who when growing older and receiving rejections and rebuffs, first from oneor two people and then from many, will gradually experience the blunting of their affinity.Around tone three, we have the individual experiencing tolerance, without muchoutgoing action. The individual at this level will accept advances offered but does not readilymake such advances himself.Around 2.5 the individual begins to neglect his own person, or people in general. Hemay even dislike them as a general rule and attempt to get away from them.At the level of tone 2.0, the affinity is expressed as antagonism, a feeling of annoyanceand irritation caused by the advances of other people toward the individual. Love is receivedwith suspicion; it is seriously questioned, and may gain as its return distaste.Around 1.5, affinity has almost reversed itself. Its dissonance has become hate, whichcan be violent and is so expressed. Love offered to such a person may excite him into violentacts of repulsion. Here, actually, we have a factor of entheta repelling theta, since theta itselfcontains, as one of its components, love.Around 1.1, we reach the level of covert hostility. Here the hatred of the individual hasbeen socially and individually censured to a point where it has been suppressed, and theindividual no longer dares demonstrate hate as such. He yet possesses sufficient energy toexpress some feeling on the matter, and so what hatred he feels comes forth covertly. Allmanner of subterfuges may be resorted to. The person may claim to love others and to have thegood of others as his foremost interest; yet, at the same moment, he works, unconsciously orotherwise, to injure or destroy the lives and reputations of people and also to destroy property.Below 1.0 we reach fear, which is expressed on its highest level as acute shyness, stage fright,extreme modesty, being tongue-tied among other people, being easily frightened by profferedaffection. Here also we reach the strange manifestation of the individual attempting to buy offthe imagined danger by propitiation. We have an interesting example of this in processing.47"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Cases which are far down on the tone scale will, when they reach 1.0, quite commonly offerthe auditor presents and attempt to do things for him. A crude description of this was oncecontained in the idea of transference. At this level we have withdrawal from people. At 0.5, wereach the level of grief, wherein we have supplications by the individual, his pleas for pity, hisdesperate efforts to win support by tears. We may even have at this level extremely strangeperversions of truth intended to achieve the pity and support of others. For instance, therejected sweetheart, reaching this level of grief may invent all manner of odd and peculiarincidents of cruelty on the part of the last lover in order to win the sympathy of those aroundher.Sinking below grief, one reaches apathy, wherein affinity is expressed by completewithdrawal from person or people. There is, in apathy, no real attempt to contact one’s selfand no attempt to contact others. Here we have a null point of dissonance which is on thethreshold of death.The auditor has a handy measuring stick with the affinity scale, since he can, byobserving the preclear, establish the position of the preclear on the chart. Further, by watchingpreclear’s attitude toward people or groups he can see the improvement of the relations of thepreclear. With others and, he can see the gradual rise in tone of the case.48"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINECommunication and RealityThe overall subject of communication covers far more than the exchange of intelligence.Basically, communication could be called the science of perceptions. As general semantics isorganized on the subject of words and ideas; so can be organized, and so has been organized inDianetics, the entire subject of perception.Everything which we know of the physical universe and, possibly, anything which wecan know of theta universe, allowing that it exists, could be said to be embraced by perception,computation, and imagination.By perception we mean the perceiving of entities or existences. We achieve what weknow of reality by perceiving entities and existences in the physical universe, and possibly thetheta universe, by combining these perceptions and computing or imagining results not indisagreement with the results obtained by others.The channels of our perception of the physical universe are twenty-six in number. Themost important of these are sonic, vision, tactile, olfactory, kinesthesia, thermal, joint position,body position, moisture, organic perceptions, and, adding one more discovered in Dianetics,perception of movement on the time track. It is with these that the auditor most vitally concernshimself as it is through these that we learn the most of the physical universe.With sonic we perceive, by mental mechanism, the sound waves of the physicaluniverse, and by comparison and experience, both genetic and environmental, interpret them.With visio we perceive light waves, which, as sight, are compared with experience andevaluated. By tactile we perceive the shape and texture of surfaces and compounds. Witholfactory perception we perceive the minute particles of matter which register as smell.By kinesthesia we perceive motion through space and time.By thermal we perceive temperature, hotness and coldness, and so can evaluate furtherour current environment by comparing it to past environments. By perceiving joint position wecan measure space and the size of objects and know more about our physical situation. Byperceiving body position we sense our relationship with our immediate environment. Moistureperception permits us to sense the dampness or dryness of the atmosphere and so judge furtherour environment.Through organic perceptions we perceive the states of our own bodies, internally.These and other sense messages combine to make up a body of experience. Just howmuch of this experience is genetic and how much of it is carried in the theta body, if that exists,we cannot at this time accurately measure. In our environment, however, by the various sensechannels we gain experience and can act in the present-time environment or plan for the future.It might be said that we have potentially a sensory reception mechanism for every type of sensemessage which can be radiated or delivered to us from the physical universe, and from the thetauniverse. Thus, we have hearing because there are sound waves which can be registered andinterpreted; we have sight because light waves exist to be registered; and so forth. A veryinteresting paper could be prepared upon the probable evolution of our senses. Theta,combining with MEST to make life, reaches out in its conquest of MEST, via the senseperceptions, to exist within and control the environment and to some degree regulate the future-- and, particularly in man, to adjust the environment to the organism, the species, or the race.Just what theta-universe perceptics are is a subject at this time so diffuse that one cannoteven be sure there is a theta universe. Such manifestations as extra-sensory perception,intuition, clairvoyance, clairaudience, and others make up a body of quasi-knowledge which is49"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"normally relegated to the field of psychic phenomena. The existence of God and spiritualmanifestations could be classified as theta universe; contact with these would be considered ause of theta perceptics. Oddly enough, in Dianetics considerable evidence, whether we wish itor not, is accumulating in favor of not only a theta universe and a theta body but of thetaperceptics, as well.This has proceeded far enough to contain some evidence that certain techniques ofapplication, already partially formed, exist by which the theta perceptics can be cleared, raisingthe prediction potentiality of the individual, amongst other things. Judging solely on theevidence at hand, one would say that more evidence existed in favor of the theta universe, thetheta body, and theta perceptics than existed to deny them. This evidence has accumulated to asufficient extent to cast extreme doubt on the “scientific” postulate that all man would everknow was the physical universe.Indeed, science was unable to resolve mental problems and forecast behavior and inventbetter human technologies so long as it assumed that life and man rose from compounds andclay of the physical universe, with no other ingredient. This line of reasoning led to noadvances in technology and, indeed, permitted the physical sciences to outstrip all knowledgeof human behavior. This would seem more or less inevitable, however, if one considered thatthe primary mission of theta was to conquer the physical universe, at least insofar as the branchof theta which ourselves is currently concerned. With such a mission, the physical would, ofcourse, become the best-known sphere of reality. Perhaps theta is now in a position where itcan understand more of itself. By this one does not urge upon the reader that Dianeticsconcerns itself vitally at this time with psychic phenomena, but it is mentioned in passing that inthe course of investigation data continues to accumulate against the idea that man is a creature ofthe physical universe alone.The auditor, working case after case, cannot but run upon evidence strongly in favor ofa relatively timeless theta body existing as a personal identity, running parallel to the geneticline of species; and if he ignores this he may bog down some of his cases. Specifically, I referto the continuing and growing volume of reports from auditors on the subject of past deathsand past lives. This subject needs to be warily and thoroughly examined; but it remains that theauditor who runs into a past death and does not reduce it properly by standard procedure willfind his case thoroughly bogged down; and, indeed, some cases cannot be run and will notmove on the time track until these factors are taken into consideration. Some of this data hasbeen known for two years, but a diffidence to comment upon it until the evidence wasoverwhelming has suppressed and continues to suppress the knowledge.As it develops, Dianetics more and more seems potentially able eventually to contact theoften-postulated but never thoroughly sensed, measured, and experienced human soul. Thesubject of past deaths and past lives is so full of tension that as early as last July (1950 -- Ed.)the board of trustees of the Foundation sought to pass a resolution banning the entire subject.And I have been many times requested to omit any reference to these in the present work or inpublic for fear that a general impression would get out that Dianetics had something to do withspiritualism.Further, the view has been many times expressed that in view of the fact that prenatalsare so “controversial” the introduction of past lives and past deaths into Dianetics, even as anexperimental investigation, would permit old schools of therapy to persist in their delusion thatall is delusion. This would hardly be a scientific way of handling a science. A true scientistboldly and fearlessly reports that which he finds. A famous writer told me, a short time ago, astory about Thomas Carlyle, who upon hearing that an American lady writer named MargaretFuller had said, “I accept the universe,” said only, “By God! she’d better!” The auditor whoruns his preclear down the track and suddenly finds the preclear possessed of strong somaticsand a visio of 1210 A.D. scenery had better reduce the incident as an engram. Failing to get aproper reduction, the auditor had better ask for the incident necessary to resolve this weirdmanifestation. If the auditor is dull indeed he will invalidate the incident to the preclear and passup running it, at which point his preclear will bog down.50"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"There are evidently three kinds of these experiences: (1) those which are dub-in andwhich occur only in cases which dub in in the present life; (2) fantasies built upon reading andimagination, but without somatics; and (3) what seem to be valid and real experiences. If thisdata of past lives and past deaths in the theta body continues to stand up and becomessusceptible to exacting proof, it certainly threatens to alter our culture radically. At the presenttime all we can do is gather evidence. The Foundation would be glad to have any and all suchevidence which auditors may discover and care to submit. Never invalidate a past life of a pastdeath, and never fail to run such somatics as actual experiences: failure to observe thisenjoinder may seriously harm the case. I have given you this information because I do notbelieve that helping the auditor to audit and helping cases to run can seriously hurt Dianetics.To unburden a case to the point where the individual is a MEST clear it is only necessary towork with the avenues of perception to the physical universe.What we conceive to be reality is actually agreed upon perception of the physicaluniverse. There is an endless philosophic wrangle as to whether or not our perceptionsperceive anything, or whether or not our perceptions are merely an illusion themselves. Trueenough, the physical universe can be reduced down to zero mathematically. Matter, energy,space and time could be said to be the result of certain motions. The moment we go off into theby-road of wondering whether the physical universe is real or not we come rapidly upon manyphilosophic imponderables. What we know as reality, however, is an agreed-upon conceptionof the physical universe in which we live. You and I agree that a table exists in the center of theroom; we can see it, and feel it, and when we rap it with our knuckles we can hear thatsomething is there. You and I have agreed upon the reality of the table, mainly because each ofus agrees that he perceives it via his senses. Should someone come up and say that not a tablebut a black cat stood there, you and I would consider the man mad. Indeed, by a sort of naturalselection we remove such “madnesses” from our society. When someone is in disagreementwith the majority as to the sense perceptions of the physical universe, the first reaction of themajority is to have this person pronounced mad and locked up. Locked up, he does notprocreate and so breaks the genetic line. This happens often enough to select out of the humanrace those who do not agree on the nature of the physical universe via sense perceptions. Manyamusing and entertaining postulates can be formed on the subject of reality.Certain it is that by communication -- by the group of sense perceptions which make upcommunication -- we know reality. Our affinity with that reality -- our admission that we are apart of that reality, and our acceptance of our participation in it -- is necessary to ourcommunication with it, and thus we have the triangle of Dianetics: affinity, reality, andcommunication. One cannot stand without the other two. There cannot, for instance, becommunication and affinity alone; these two things would result in an agreement of some sort,which agreement would be reality. If communication exists, some agreement can be reached,and as soon as an agreement is reached between two people or by a man with himself, there issome affinity. If affinity and reality exist, then a communication must ensue or must alreadyexist in order to act as a channel of expression and recognition of the agreement. An auditor,knowing the trio -- affinity, reality, and communication -- can use any point of the triangle as apoint of attack in order to enhance the other two corners of the triangle. The overall subject ofcommunication, as we have seen, contains all avenues of sense perception: sonic, visio, tactile,olfactory, and the rest. It includes, as well, the perception of too strong a contact with theMEST universe -- pain, which is itself less directly, a form of communication. The receipt ofperceptions of the real universe and the purpose of theta come about as a computation.Computation creates ideas concerning reality, and this creation of ideas leads to the type ofcommunication which is commonly and ordinarily classified as communication -- conversation,messages, and other methods of exchange of ideas.The auditor must appreciate the value of communication; since if his preclear cannotcommunicate with his own past he cannot make an accurate adjudication of his own present andhe certainly cannot compute his own future. When a man is unable to contact the reality of thepresent or appreciate it, and when he cannot compute his own future and act upon thatcomputation, that man is considered in varying degrees neurotic or psychotic. The auditor,then, does well who knows this subject thoroughly.51"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENCOLUMN HSonicBy the word sonic in Dianetics is usually meant sonic recall, rather than hearing soundsoutside the body. Sonic means hearing the sounds which have been remembered. Those soundwhichs the individual has heard in the past are all recorded, either in the analytical standardmemory bank or in the reactive bank. Those which were recorded in the analytical standardmemory bank are all available to the recall mechanisms of the individual -- to his “I.” Thosewhich have been recorded in the reactive bank have been received by the individual while hewas unconscious -- in a hypnotic state, while drugged, while delirious, while unconsciousfrom a severe injury, or even while unconscious momentarily because of a light injury. Suchperceptics as sonic were not thought, before Dianetics, to be recorded at all during a period ofunconsciousness. One of the basic discoveries of Dianetics was that these perceptics wererecorded during the periods of unconsciousness of an individual, and that this material wasavailable for recovery, and that this material, so recorded, had an aberrative effect on theindividual.Whether the sound has been heard while the person was awake, or asleep, orunconscious, that sound is available to the recall mechanism of I. The fantastic storage capacityof the mind has no structural explanation at this time. But every sound, whether a voice, anauto horn, the click of table ware, footsteps, the wind, every sound which the individual hasheard in his lifetime is recorded. Thus recorded, it is available to the “I” of the individual.Dianetic technique sends the individual back through his life, and by the perceptics of sonic,visio, and so forth, enables him to recover information which has been occluded from him.There are very many gradations of the quality of sonic. A case on which there is muchgrief and other types of charge may or may not have sonic recall. A case which is generallyoccluded from one end of the track to the other may be so occluded by charge, valence trouble,sonic command shut-offs or being stuck out of present time, that it has no sonic at all. Thiscondition may be so bad that it renders the individual unable to remember anything that hasbeen said even shortly after it has been uttered, as well as back along the time track. Thecharge, valence troubles, and command shut-offs of sonic may be relatively light, under whichcircumstances the individual will receive what are known as sonic impressions; he can getimpressions of the voice tones in which the words are being uttered, as he travels along thetrack, but he does not hear the sounds clearly. The case may have, however, so little sonicshut-off, valence trouble, and charge that clear sonic, just as it was heard in the first place, isavailable as the person travels on the time track, as well as near present time.Sonic shut-off may be quite selective: the individual may be able to hear sounds but notvoices; he may be able to hear an entire symphony orchestra and yet be unable to hear againwhat his wife asked him to bring home for dinner. Selective shut-offs are caused both bycharge on the case and by selective sonic shut-off commands, such as “You cannot hear yourwife,” or “You pay no attention to me.”A primary concern of the auditor is the turning on of sonic; therefore he must knowwhat turns it off. According to present theory, which works out relatively well in practice, themost severe source of sonic shut-off is being stuck on the track: in that the individual cannotmove on the track, he cannot, of course, move through incidents and hear them. The next mostsevere interference with sonic comes from valence shifters; the person’s identity is confusedwith that of another person; he is not in his own valence, and he is off his own time track. Thenext most severe source of sonic shut-off is the command phrase which says specifically “Youcan’t hear anything,” “You never listen to a word I say,” “You have to keep still,” “I’m as deafas a post,” etc., etc. Sonic is additionally affected somewhat by grief and charge on the case,52"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"but not as much as might be expected, since cases which have enormous grief and charge onthem in general yet retain sonic recall in the absence of valence shifters.The most severe sonic shut-off would be that caused by a combination of factors,which would include not only being stuck on the track in an engram but also having the trackitself collapsed by groupers. There are cases which have fake sonic -- sonic dub-in. Accordingto theory, this dub-in is caused by demon circuits which is to say, heavily charged portions ofthe analytical mind which have been captured by the reactive mind and do its bidding, walled-off by charge into separate entities. These are very easy to spot, however, since dub-in sonicusually is inane. Furthermore, when the individual with dub-in has gone through an incidentonce, he cannot return through the incident with the same words. One should not regard a dub-in recall case as something hard to detect; it is very simple, even for the beginner to detect dub-in, since it will not repeat or bear repetition but alters markedly, and it is not particularlysensible, and it does not run at all like an engram. The dub-in sonic case, after it has beenworked for a short time, can be expected to lose the dub-in, once the circuit causing it iscontacted or when the tone of the case rises. A non-sonic case results. This should not beconfused with a case which has sonic but which has experienced severe auditor code breaks,has had engrams run partially but not reduced and has had groupers triggered so that the timetrack is collapsed. The way to differentiate these is that the case which had dub-in that hasturned off will still run as easily and ably on the time track as formerly; from a non-soniccondition, as valence shifters and sonic shut-off commands are run out of the case, sonicimpressions will become available, and then sonic itself should return. The subject of sonicrecall is one which requires an enormous amount of study before final adjudication can be madeby anyone as to its total ramifications. Experience in Dianetics has demonstrated that recalls ingeneral are very fully recovered by the clear, and this is true of sonic. As may be seen on thechart, the gradient scale of sonic does not show it to be a phenomenon by which the position ofthe preclear on the chart may be established, save only in the broadest sense. The clear, at thetop of the scale, has, ordinarily full sonic recall. But such may have been his aberratedcondition that over large areas of the track his analytical memory bank has received no adequateor sharp recordings. From the moment a person is clear or nearly clear, on forward in his life,he will have sonic recall; during his period of aberration, however, he may not have registeredsounds here and there on the track.There is much misunderstanding about sonic and vision recalls in the state of clear.These recalls are not eidetic in all cases, as photographic or phonographic recall are a matter oftraining, and a person not trained into them will not necessarily register sights and sounds withsufficient concentration to have all the material available for immediate recall. A very largenumber of tests must be undertaken on the whole subject of recalls and a great number of casesmust be observed before we can clearly and scientifically evaluate recall potentials in everyindividual when cleared. The recalls, however, are good in those cases so far observed but arenot necessarily eidetic. A person may have sonic recall of an accurate nature at any place on thetone scale, providing the person can move freely on the track and is in valence. Ability to recallin sonic is not an index of neurosis or psychosis. Sonic recall is affected by factors which, inthemselves, are not such an index. The amount of free theta available for analytical perceptionand computation is itself actually the only index.However, in the lower portions of the tone scale one ordinarily expects the reasonableperson not to have sonic recall or any other recall and one expects the true psychotic or neuroticindividual to have sonic recall. This has misled practitioners and authorities in the past intobelieving that sonic recall was only to be found in idiots and morons, an entire falsity based onlimited observation.The influencing mechanism on sonic recall is whether or not the mind has sufficientpower (structurally, most likely) to cut off and wall up charge and the general results ofengrams and still reserve a portion of the analyzer for free thought with the remaining freetheta. The psychotic or neurotic individual does not have the power to reserve for clearthinking some portion of the analyzer, and so, when enturbulated by engrams but still invalence, becomes analytically completely and wholly enturbulated, with no reserved portion of53"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"the analyzer not subject to that enturbulation. Where a person has a psychosomatic illness andsonic recall one should expect to find a near-psychotic individual, the psychosomatic illnessestelling of many engrams and the sonic recall stating that the analyzer has not the power to wallup unhappy and painful memories. Where one finds psychosomatic illnesses and a sonic shut-off, one may find a person who is potentially low on the tone scale but who yet has enoughfree theta to respond on a high analytical level -- and yet who may perform in life in a veryaberrated fashion, for all this.The thinking on this subject in the past has been entirely too short. The strange beliefhas been held in the past that a great deal of aberration meant agreat deal of thrust and drive and, therefore, that an individual who was neurotic couldbe expected to perform in the arts and in other directions more ably than a person who wassane. This, by derivation and observation and much experience, is an outright fallacy. Theindividual with a great deal of free theta is apt to be more robust than his fellows. He may ormay not have more engrams; but he tries, from his earliest days, to take in more area than hisfellows and to adjust his environment to him rather than follow the sheep-like course of tryingto adjust himself to the environment. He is, therefore, continually rebuffed, and his engramswill gradually charge up, by the process of affinity, reality, and communication breaks, until heresponds rather neurotically to his environment. Such a person is, normally, rather thoroughlyshut off so far as sonic and visio are concerned. His theta, what is left of it in a free state,operating in what small portion of his analyzer is still available, is still greater than the thetaavailable to the average human being. When we take this individual and dianetically processhim and turn the entheta into theta, he becomes more and more powerful and able to cope withand adjust his environment. He will not have sonic and visio until he reaches a released or acleared state. Such individuals are difficult to process only because the mind has so expertlywalled itself in from the charge on the case. However, such an individual is very worthwhile toprocess, since when the auditor has finished, or even if the auditor never does finish, one hasleft a strong, creative asset to the society. The auditor who, because they seem easy, worksnear-psychotic or psychotic cases which have sonic, may have when he is through anindividual who, no matter if structurally intelligent, is yet possessed of so little theta that hisworth to the society is small. These conclusions are highly generalized, but have been borneout in a large number of cases.Cases exist in which the individual is so unaberrated that, though he is endowed withenough free theta to make him a tremendous asset to the society, he still has sonic and visio,being already at the 3.5 range on the tone scale. It is far from true that a person, to be of worthto the society, must be highly aberrated and must have his recalls cut off; since in such anaberrated state he is likely to be so low on the tone scale that his positive worth to the society,which would be realized were he at 3.0 on the tone scale or above, becomes a liability, and hisaberrations violently affect his environment and bring about his destruction. Such persons arethe dictators who lead their countries to ruin through war; the artists who, through theirgrossness and vulgarity, destroy the more’s of a race, and so destroy the race.What the auditor should know, principally, about sonic recall is that it makes a caseeasier to run, and that a case without it, properly processed, will eventually pick it up. Theauditor should never despair of sonic recall shut-off cases; impressions will get stronger; andsonic recall will eventually turn on. But the individual has to be very high on the tone scalebefore he regains sonic, if he began with complete shutoffs. Further, there is a technique,which sometimes turns on sonic, known as running pleasure moments.Pleasure moments can be run on a case just as the auditor runs engrams, going throughthe moment over and over again. Attention units are attracted to the pleasure moment, since itis one of the missions of the mind to attain happiness and pleasure along the various dynamics.By returning the preclear to a moment of pleasure and running that moment, the auditor will beable to regain a few attention units out of areas of enturbulence; this will make it a little easierfor the preclear to move on the track, and in so moving he may pick up sonic recall. In anyevent, the running of pleasure moments is highly beneficial to a case.54"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The running of future pleasure moments sometimes tunes up the perceptics. These areactually imaginary incidents, so far as can be told. The tone of the individual goes up whenrunning moments of pleasure, and so when moments of pleasure in the future are imagined, thetone of any individual may be expected to rise.Affinity breaks often depress sonic; so that a preclear who has sonic on Monday and aquarrel with his sweetheart on Tuesday, may be found to have much less sonic recall onWednesday. Further, when the sonic recall of an individual is invalidated, his reality isdepressed, so the recall reduces. ARC locks and secondaries markedly influence sonic or anyother type of recall. Heightened affinity, reality, and communication may, by themselves, turnon sonic.55"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVEN;COLUMN IVisioRecalling a scene by seeing it again is called, in Dianetics, visio, by which is meantvisual recall.There are two kinds of visio which the individual may encounter. One is imaginaryvisio, by which is meant the scenery imagination constructs. The other is actual visio, bywhich is meant recall of actual and authentic scenes. In dianetic terminology, visio usuallymeans valid recall of past scenes; the word dub-in is used to characterize visio which isimaginary.Visio may occur in present time, of past scenes, which would be the process of visuallyremembering. Or it may occur as the preclear is returned on the track, seeing again in recallscenes which he has recorded in his past. Dub-in visio may work in much the same way.Possibly the most exact borderline between sanity and insanity would be that betweenknowing that one was imagining what had happened and not knowing that one was imagining.All recalls can become short-circuited through the imagination, so that the “I” is led to believethat it is recalling an actuality when really it is having furnished to it from the memory banks animaginary sequence. When ARC is very low on a case, usually below the 2.0 range, thecondition obtains with the case that many of his recalls, no matter how authentic “I” considersthem, are imaginary. As an example of this, consider the person in an anger state who isrecounting a conversation or a quarrel he has had. People who are angry almost never tell thetruth. People who have sunk to the covert hostility range become so confused between realityand imagination that even their small talk is utterly untrustworthy, and yet these people maybelieve they are telling the truth. This is a case of recall being short-circuited through theimagination and “I” being furnished imaginary data which is yet labelled as authentic data.Possibly the most flagrant breach of truth occurs in the apathy range or slightly above it, wherefear, mingled with grief can cause the wildest perversion of recall.The best example of dub-in visio would be the scenery which the preclear gets when heis returned on the track into the prenatal area. He may get very clear and active, butexteriorized, pictures of the scenery around his mother -- which views and scenes are entirelyfalse and are not to be attributed by the auditor to extra-sensory perception. They denote a 1.3to 1.0 position on the tone scale. Circuitry, about which much will be said later, is the cause ofthis visio. When the case has been unburdened of many secondary engrams this visio willcease, and the actual visio of the pre-natal will take its place. Actual pre-natal visio, of course,is black, except at such times when a light may be entered into the area for surgical purposes, atwhich times the light is sometimes recorded. A person who is found to be on the tone scalebetween 1.5 and 0.5 should not be expected to have accurate visio -- or any visio at all, as inthe occluded case.Visio and all other recalls follow the same pattern as sonic, and in considering any recallthe data which is given on sonic may be used interchangeably.In the 4.0 range the individual, when in present time, sees what he remembers, andwhen returned on the track, gets accurate and clear pictures of the scenery just as he saw itwhen he was looking at it. He is inside himself which is to say, in valence, and does not get aview of himself as a part of the scenery. The condition normally obtains down to the 3.0 band.Here we begin to get occlusions and exteriorizations in areas which contain highly-chargedengrams which themselves contain command phrases that shift the person out of his ownvalence, such as “I can’t be myself around you,” etc. Around 3.0 the person is, in most cases,on the track; he can get visio on pleasure moments, and he is able to be inside himself except56"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"when in secondary engrams. Around 2.5 the occlusion becomes marked. Large areas of thetrack may be missing because of charge and valence-shifter engrams.From 4.0 down to 2.0 it is relatively easy to run out occluded areas and dischargesecondaries so that visio returns easily. Below 2.0 the auditor begins to get into trouble andmust use a great deal of patience with his preclear, because the visio may be either absent orexteriorized. The auditor, when working such a case, should be very careful at all times neverto call any of these oddities to the preclear’s attention, as this would be an invalidation of thepreclear and would do him much damage. The trouble with a preclear from 2.5 down is thatlife has invalidated him too often. When the auditor, who is attempting to maintain high ARCwith the preclear, seems to rank himself with those factors in life which have alreadysuppressed and hurt the preclear, what little visio has survived may very easily fold up, so thatthe auditor causes himself a great deal of work in rehabilitating the ARC and getting the visio orother recalls back.Around the anger band we begin to enter the potentially psychotic area. This does notmean that a person who is at 2.0 is a psychotic. It means that when the free theta of theindividual enturbulates momentarily, he finds himself easily along the 2.0 band, and that heconducts himself generally, in his reactions toward life, along this band. It is possible for acase to be in valence all the way down the track and to get good, moving visios and still be inthe 2.0, 1.5, 1.1 band, and be thoroughly psychotic. Here again we have an individual whosestructural mechanisms are insufficient to bar out existing charge on the case; thus the person’stheta is continually and entirely enturbulated, having no free portion of the analyzer in which tooperate. His theta is always under the influence of the charge on the case because he has madefor it no protecting partitions. By partition, compartmentation, and occlusion are not meantvalence walls; these are something else. The valence wall can actually exist in the individual toa point where he can be either one of two persons, himself and another person. In the veryhighly-charged case, in the case of the obvious psychotic, these valence walls are so welldefined that the auditor can almost watch the person click from one valence to another. Theschizophrenic of psychiatry -- the person who shifts from one identity to another -- is called inDianetics a valence case. And when these valence walls are so well defined that a whole newpersonality emerges with the shift, we have a person, of course, below the 2.0 band. Suchpeople ordinarily “run” (undergo processing) in Dianetics quite noisily and are calledscreamers. The visio of such people is normally present for the valence in which the preclear isat the moment. If he is in father’s valence, he will get the same view of the scenery that fatherwould get. Or he may be in mother’s valence, in which case he would have a view of the scenejust as mother would see it. Or he may be in a synthetic valence, the valence of no actualperson, which might give him a view of the scene looking down from the ceiling. Such casesalmost never have their own point of view.Even valence walls are a sort of protective mechanism by which the charge of the caseis compartmented to permit the individual to work at least some of the time. The truly lowpower individual merely continues to accumulate charge until he is suppressed to the nearbottom of the scale without ever developing a mechanism to overcome the charge. As far as hisrecalls are concerned, he is continually in his own valence.Just as in sonic, visio manifests itself all the way down to the bottom of the case whenthe mental structure is insufficient to compartment off for the use of “I”, any portion of theanalyzer.Dub-in visio actually has two subdivisions: (1) where the actual scenery isapproximated, and (2) where entirely new scenery is substituted. The first is caused by valenceshifts; the visio the person gets of the scene when he is being acted upon by a valence shifter,highly charged up as in any secondary engram, is exteriorized -- which is to say, he seeshimself as part of the scene; he may be in the valence of another person, or he may be merelyout in the blue, looking at the scene. When the charge is run off of this particular scene byrepeating it over several times (providing any release takes place in the first four or fiverecountings) the engram on which this secondary is depending and which, of necessity if itcreates such an illusion, must contain a valence shifter command, loses some of its charge, and57"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"the individual is then able to get inside himself and get a view of the scene as he saw it at thetime. Any engram in which the preclear is exteriorized cannot be fully discharged until the visiois restored to the scene as it was viewed by the preclear. In other words, if the preclearcontinues to be exteriorized, the whole charge is not off the engram. However, if any charge atall can be gotten off a secondary, the auditor should run it to exhaust all possible charge.If visio persists in being exteriorized in spite of many runnings of the incident, there isusually later charge on the case, a later secondary which has to be tapped and discharged first;since physical pain runs from early to late, and secondaries have to be discharged from lateback to early.Imaginary exteriorizations are most chronic around 1.1. In such cases the auditor maysometimes use the mechanism of running the preclear on somebody else’s track, which is tosay, on father’s track or mother’s track or grandfather’s track, in order to contact scenes. Insuch cases it is as if the person’s track had been swallowed up, leaving available only the tracksof other valences around the individual. This mechanism is of very limited use. In any apathysecondary the preclear may commonly be found to be outside himself until the charge is off theincident, at which time he becomes interiorized. There is always a valence shifter somewherein a physical pain engram which creates this illusion. Charge itself will not cause a person tobe exteriorized, as evidenced by people who have highly charged tracks and who yet remain invalence all the way to the bottom of the scale.In the very occluded case, visio is the most notably absent thing. The preclear maythink that visio is necessary for him to scan locks; but this is not true. He can scan throughlocks “in the dark,” with no visio whatever, and yet bring to his consciousness phrases orincidents which can be run. The auditor must not make the mistake of believing that visio isnecessary for the individual to move on his track.Very little is known of the reasons for visio, and no large body of observation exists todetermine the state of visio in all persons that have been cleared of their engrams. This muchhas been observed, however, that visio does return in a clear; and any effort to palm off as aclear an individual who does not have an interiorized visio on his track is a dishonest one.Most children have visio, for the simple reason that their engrams are not yet chargedup to a point where secondaries can be formed and so occlude visio or thrust the child out ofvalence. In a case which has many valence shifters, affinity, reality and communicationsecondaries will bring about a chronic exteriorized visio. In a case which has an analyzersufficiently able to block off charge, visio starts to disappear in the presence of repeatedsecondaries. After a major ARC break, such as the loss of a sweetheart, visio may cut out, insuch a case, entirely. Also, in the case of an individual who is stuck in a prenatal engram, visiois blocked off by the simple fact that the prenatal visio of black is present through all of hismemories. He is not, of course, moving on the track, and so cannot pick up the scenery of anyincidents but those in which he is stuck.Visio is not a good test of the tone level of a case except in the generality that whenvisio is present and accurate, and other columns on the tone scale agree, the person can be saidto be above the 2.0 line. But in view of the fact that visio can exist all the way down the track,such a test must be considered only cursory.Note: Discussion of reactive exteriorization phenomena as found here should not be confusedwith exteriorization as a theta activity, which is covered in Scientology 8-8008 (1953) by L.Ron Hubbard, and later works.58"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVECOLUMN JSomaticsThe word somatic means, actually, bodily or Physical. Because the word pain isrestimulative, and because the word pain has in the past led to a confusion between physicalpain and mental pain, the word somatic is used in Dianetics to denote physical pain ordiscomfort of any kind. It can mean actual pain, such as that caused by a cut or a blow; or itcan mean discomfort, as from heat or cold; it can mean itching -- in short, anything physicallyuncomfortable. It does not include mental discomfort such as grief. Hard breathing would notbe a somatic; it would be a symptom of misemotion suppression. Somatic means a non-survival physical state of being. It is distinguished, on the one hand, from a nonsurvivalmental state of being and, on the other hand, from a physical action or pro-survival perceptic,such as kinesthesia or tactile, or visio.An engram has several component parts: the two main components, of course, areentheta and enMEST. Free theta has come into collision with MEST, with resultantenturbulation. In a living organism, the enMEST component would be the manifested somatic.The chief difference between the analytical and reactive minds, aside from theirfunctions, is that the reactive mind registers pain, and the analytical mind merely records thefact that pain exists. This gives the reactive mind an additional perceptic; this perceptic is calleda somatic.In the presence of any physical pain the analyzer goes off. Even if the pain is very mildand brief there is still a moment of analytical shut-off. In Dianetics this is called anaten, anengineering type of abbreviation for “analytical attenuation.” The anaten buries the somatic,and, unfortunately, buries with it all the perceptics present when the somatic was received. Itmay be difficult to realize that anaten is present with every somatic, until one has mildly injuredhis finger, for example, and has gone back over the incident a few times. He will discover thatthere was an incident during the injury which became occluded because of anaten; and byrunning the incident two or three times, he will find some additional perceptics which he maynot before have noted. Thus the somatic is buried by this mechanism of anaten. This is aworkable mechanism in a life organism which is not analytically capable of recovering pain andrunning it out; but it is not workable in a rational organism possessed of considerable analyticalpower, since the perceptics of the painful moment can then react back against the analyticalpower, and the organism is then victimized by its somatics rather than trained into theavoidance of danger by the avoidance of pain-the evident primary use of somatics. A severephysical pain causes considerable analytical attenuation, shutting off the analyzer thoroughlyfor a period of time. This, technically, is an engram, although any incident, painful or not,contained in the reactive mind and occluded by anaten can be considered an engram.Once an engram exists, analytical experiences can restimulate it by approximating itsperceptics or breaking the dramatization demanded by the engram. These analytical momentsare called locks, and they charge up the engram. There are, technically speaking, two types ofsuch locks: those which merely restimulate the engram, which is then dramatized by theindividual; and those which break the dramatization. The first type are not as severe as thesecond type; since the second type, by making it impossible for the individual to obey the“mandates” of the engrams, cause the physical pain to turn on, and the individual gets what hasbeen known as a psychosomatic illness.A psychosomatic illness, according to dianetic findings, is the somatic side of theengram, turned on by continual suppression of the dramatization. Thus, in Dianetics,psychosomatic illnesses are not regarded as such but are called chronic somatics, since theydisappear once the engram and its locks are discharged from the case.59"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Another manifestation than anaten occurs with regard to a physical pain. The somaticenturbulates theta, and if the analytical incident which forms a lock on this engram containsconsiderable misemotion, as caused by fear or loss, the presence of the physical pain earlier inthe bank makes it possible for a secondary engram to be formed. Misemotion is actually aconversion of physical pain, according to dianetic findings. There is much more that could bediscovered about this mechanism or conversion of physical pain to, for instance, terror or griefor apathy; and the discovery probably lies in the field of further examination and understandingof free theta; but it is certain that secondary engrams, with their misemotion, occlude somatics.When the misemotion is discharged, the engram itself then becomes available.Indeed, so intimate is the relationship between misemotion and physical pain, that thecase is run by “layers.” One may discover, early in the case, many physical pain engramswhich easily discharge when recounted. This brings to light a long series of secondaryengrams, later in the case. One is unable to find any further physical pain engrams until onehas discharged these secondaries of their fear, grief and apathy. Having done this, the auditorwill find that he has a new series of physical pain engrams available for running.A somatic, then, may be said to be buried beneath anaten and beneath misemotion orsecondary engrams. Thus, somatics in a case can be seen to “hide.”Somatics can be turned on by dianetic auditing only when the anaten and themisemotion are not too heavy for the particular somatic the auditor is trying to reach. A veryheavily charged case (by which is meant a case with a very heavy burden of secondaries) maybe found to have no somatics available for auditing. A very occluded case, in which the mindhas compartmented off charge, will also have blocked off the majority of the somatics.The case which is stuck thoroughly on the time track may have in constant restimulationthe somatic which was present at the moment he received the engram in which he is stuck. Thecharacteristic of the psychotic is that the entheta side of the engram is in constant action and thatthe somatic side of the engram is not particularly active.The case which was formerly referred to as the psychosomatically ill case would be saidto be one in which the entheta side of the engram is suppressed and the somatic side of theengram is in restimulation. These chronic somatic cases are usually found to be cases whichhave been subjected throughout life to breaking of each and every dramatization, cases, in otherwords, which have been denied the MEST control irrationally directed by the engrams, as wellas the MEST control rationally directed by theta. The tone scale of somatics could begin, at thetop, with the MEST clear at 4.0, who would have no somatics left to be run. This is thetechnical definition of the MEST clear, that each and every incidence that contained physicalpain, during his entire lifetime from conception forward to the present time, has been erased,thus freeing the theta which has been held as entheta in the bank by freeing the body of pain orpotential pain. This does not mean, by the way, that the clear cannot receive new pain and newengrams. It does mean that new incidents of pain will have much less effect on him than theywould were he not a clear; and he can ordinarily run out such incidents by himself unless hehas been from the start a very low theta-power individual.In the 3.5, 3.0, and 2.5 bands, somatics are sharp and readily available to the auditor.Almost any engram on the case can be run, providing the basic on its chain and other precedingengrams have been erased before it. Slightly over 2.0, engrams begin to be suppressed bycharge and anaten on the case.In a heavily occluded case, who is yet in the 2.0 band, somatics may all but be absent.In a less occluded case in the 2.0 band somatics may be very light. In a case which is invalence, and yet in the 2.0 band, and which can move on the track, somatics are available andcan be run.Around 1.1, the heavily occluded case will have no somatics available. The auditormust here work solely for the discharge of locks and secondaries before he can find somatics60"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"on the case. in the less occluded case, however, some extremely light somatics will be foundavailable. And in the un-occluded case, which is yet at 1.1, somatics will be found to be light,and, again, will not discharge adequately until locks and secondaries are run.At the 0.5 level, somatics in the occluded case, the partially occluded case, or the wideopen case will be found to be so light as to be practically non-existent, according to usualexperience.Below this level somatics do not exist at all.The auditor should very thoroughly recognize somatics for what they are -the physicalpain of past injuries. He should recognize, further, that it is the somatic, in the first place,which makes locks and secondaries possible. And he must further realize that somatics areburied beneath anaten and misemotion, when these are present. He must not believe, however,that just because somatics make locks and secondaries possible, his primary mission is to runsomatics off the case, but where somatics are not easily available he must be very chary oftrying to find them, and should devote himself to locks and secondaries rather than somatics.He will discover that by discharging locks and secondaries he can very often relieve what havebeen called psychosomatic illnesses.Running somatics is the act of putting the case into permanent good shape. Runninglocks and secondaries is a much more rapid way of raising the tone of the case; however, thattone can fall again so long as engrams remain. It is theoretically possible to bring a case up to3.0 or 3.5 without ever running a somatic; but this is not possible in common experience, andone has to run physical pain engrams when they offer themselves, save in those cases where solittle free theta is available that by running a somatic the remaining free theta may becomeenturbulated and involved with the engram, forming a new lock in auditing. Such an act cantake the borderline psychotic down into the psychotic band. This is prevented by addressinglocks and secondaries on the borderline case, rather than somatics. The auditor should not tryfor specific somatics in the case in the hope of relieving chronic illnesses. He can best addressa specific chronic somatic by running locks and secondaries involved with that somatic.Merely by running the preclear through various parts of his life, up and down the track,the auditor may relieve enough anaten and misemotion from the case to permit somatics tooccur. This was once upon a time known as “greasing the track.” However one should not runa preclear into a somatic unless one intends to reduce it or to discover the basic on the chain andreduce that. Once somatics are contacted they must be reduced; if they do not easily reduce ona few recountings, an earlier engram or a chain of locks or a secondary should be found whichinhibits the somatic from reducing.It is the somatic which predisposes a case to illness. An old physical pain in an area ofthe body weakens that area, to the extent that there is a remembered injury in it; body fluidsapproach the area with caution. When that old injury is restimulated, the approach of bodyfluids is inhibited even more, and so the area is denied, more and more, the nourishment,support, repair, and protection which the general flow of fluids in the body is designed to bringabout. Bacteria are then able to enter the area and maintain themselves, and an illness canresult, according to theory and according to what has been observed while working withDianetics on many people. If the somatic in the area is heavy, the presence of bacteria mayfurther restimulate it, and so the illness is perpetuated and becomes a chronic infection. In thecase of a simple pain -- known to doctors as “strange, bizarre pains” -- or of rheumatoidarthritis, it may only be that the somatic itself is restimulated, and the reduction of the somatic isoften attended by the sudden loss of the psychosomatic illness. This is not to make the claimthat removing the somatic cures a psychosomatic illness: such a claim is specifically forbiddenby law, as applied to past healing arts. Clinical experience, however, law or no law,demonstrates this to be a workable theory in practice. Any law which would seek to forcepeople to remain ill when they might be well would be an evil law. Furthermore, the laws ofman have never been able to do much to suppress the laws of God.61"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEEN;COLUMN KSpeech, TalksSpeech, ListensProbably the most accurate index for the auditor of the preclear’s position on the tonescale is speech. Here is a generalized manifestation of perceptic communication.Engrams can induce, by specific command, too much talking, too little talking, toomuch listening to other people, or too little listening. Throughout the chart there is this liabilitythat the individual is operating upon compulsive or obsessive commands regarding one or moreof the columns. The average position on the columns is the most important. A manic, telling aperson to talk continuously, or a suppressive engram, requiring a person to do nothing butlisten, will produce such behavior; but unless a person talks openly and listens receptively hecannot be considered very high on the tone scale. There are double boxes in the speech column:one set referring to talking, the other to listening. It may not have occurred to some people thatcommunication is both outgo and income. An observation of how a person both listens andtalks will make it possible to form an opinion as to whether or not the person is operating on anengramic command either about listening or about talking: because usually one or the other,talking to or listening, will be an accurate indication of his position on the tone scale. A personwho is not operating on engramic commands which deny or enforce either talking or listening,will talk and listen more or less equally. Mind operation being what it is, as a person dropslower and lower on the tone scale his affinity potential, his reality potential, and hiscommunication potential also drop. Thus, by entirely mechanical means, we get reduction ofvisio, sonic, somatic recall, all other perceptics, and talking and listening. The highest level ofthe scale contains the faculty of communicating completely and withholding nothing; also theability to communicate with complete rational selectivity, also the ability to be conversationallycreative and constructive.At this high level of the scale, the individual is able to listen to everything which is saidand evaluate it rationally. He can listen to entheta communications without becoming severelyenturbulated. He can receive ideas without making critical or derogatory comments. And,while receiving another person’s ideas, he can greatly aid that person’s thinking and talking.At the level of 3.5, the individual is capable of communicating deeply-felt beliefs andideas to others and can communicate with others selectively, which is to say, he can cut offentheta lines, and hold back or give forth conversation according to the rational or pleasantcircumstances of the moment. The individual at this level can listen without becoming criticaland can aid and assist others in conversation, but he is apt to become enturbulated slightly ifgiven entheta conversation.Between 3.5 and 3.0, the ability of a person to talk to others decreases to a tentativeexpression of a limited number of beliefs and ideals and borders on the conservative. He mayhave a very conservative reaction toward people who have highly creative and constructiveideas. He is critical of flagrant irrationalities. In other words, from 3.5 down to 3.0 we are ina band where injury from life has created a defensiveness on the part of the individual.At 3.0, the speech of the individual becomes more casual and reserved. Here is thelevel of small talk, about weather and good roads. At this level the individual has a resistancetoward ideas which are too massive. An analytical fear is expressed here of being not quite atease. At 2.5, we have the level of indifference to conversation with others, a “let’s not argueabout it” attitude, a dismissal of communication, a carelessness as to whether one’sconversation is being received or is even understandable. Between 2.5 and 2.0 we have a levelwhere communication from other people is refused, and where one does not like to talk.62"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"At 2.0 we reach a level of antagonistic conversation. The individual is apt to nag or tomake derogatory comments to invalidate other people. On this level the individual can only beroused by nagging, nasty cracks, invalidations, and other antagonistic communication.At the 1.5 tone level, we have a shutting off of other persons’ conversation, a completerefusal to listen, and efforts to destroy incoming conversation. The conversation which isgiven forth by an individual at this level is forthrightly destructive and is given without anythought of the possible retaliation which may result from this destructiveness. Conversation onthis level could hardly be called conversation, as it is a forward motion toward destruction anda refusal to accept anything which might prevent that destruction.Below this level, before we reach 1.1, the individual sinks into stubborn silence, sulks,refuses to talk. He will not listen to any communication of any kind from other people, exceptthat which encourages him in his attitude. At 1.1, we have lying, to avoid real communication.It takes the form of pretended agreement, flattery, or verbal appeasement, or simply a falsepicture of the person’s feelings and ideas, a false facade, an artificial personality. Here is thelevel of covert hostility, the most dangerous and wicked level on the tone scale. Here is theperson who smiles while he inserts a knife blade between your vertebrae. Here is the personwho tells you he has stood up for you, when actually he has practically destroyed yourreputation.Here is the insincere flatterer who yet awaits only a moment of unguardedness todestroy. The conversation of this level is filled with small barbs which are immediatelyafterwards justified as intended compliments. Talking with such a person is the maddeningprocedure of boxing with a shadow: one realizes that something is wrong, but the guardednessof a 1.1 will not admit anything wrong, even as, all the while, he does his best to upset andwreak havoc. This is the level of the pervert, the hypocrite, the turncoat.This is the level of the subversive. From such a person one should never expect anoutright frontal attack; the attack will come when one is absent when one’s back is turned, orwhen one sleeps. Any luckless person married to a 1.1 is, literally speaking, in danger of hislife and sanity; for such a person is incapable of any real affection; such a person is sointroverted that any demonstrated affection is a hectic sham. Such a person willopportunistically take any avenue which leads to his own security and will leave in the lurchanyone he has pretended to call his friend.A 1.1 is the most dangerously insane person in society, and is likely to cause the mostdamage. Because of the covert nature of this insanity, it is completely beside the point whethersuch a person is pronounced insane by any agency. On this level there is no concept of honor,decency or ethics; there is only desperate, death-bent thought of self and of damage to others.Society can handle the angry man; it knows what to expect from him. Society can handle theapathy case; his insanity is obvious.But the 1.1 is a skulking coward who yet contains enough perfidious energy to strikeback, but not enough courage ever to give warning. Such people should be taken from thesociety as rapidly as possible and uniformly institutionalized; for here is the level of thecontagion of immorality, and the destruction of ethics; here is the fodder which secret policeorganizations use for their filthy operations. One of the most effective measures of security thata nation threatened by war could take would be rounding up and placing in a cantonment, awayfrom society, any 1.1 individual who might be connected with government, the military, oressential industry; since here are people who, regardless of any record of their family’s loyalty,are potential traitors, the very mode of operation of their insanity being betrayal. In this level isthe slime of society, the sex criminals, the political subversives, the people whose apparentlyrational activities are yet but the devious writhings of secret hate. A 1.1 can be accuratelyspotted by his conversation; since he seeks only to enturbulate those around him, to upset themby his conversation, to destroy them without their ever being aware of his purpose. He listensonly to data which will serve him in his enturbulations. Here is the gossip, here is theunfaithful wife, here is the card cheat; here is the most undesirable stratum of any social order.63"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"No social order which desires to survive dares overlook its stratum of 1.1’s. No social orderwill survive which does not remove these people from its midst.The 1.1 is so low on the tone scale and yet so active mentally, as a rule, that he is verydifficult to process. The longest and most arduous course of therapy may still leave the auditorbaffled by a mind which is so full of circuits that no real desire for improvement on the part ofthe preclear can make itself felt. The auditor may feel that only an offer of an obvious present-time advantage, like being let out of confinement, would tempt this preclear into genuinecooperation. The auditor may feel that this case is just not salvageable. But if, in the case, theauditor can manage to remove some of the circuits or destimulate them he may be able to makeprogress. It takes a very clever Dianetician to do anything with a chronic, computational 1.1.The 0.5 talks dolefully and hopelessly in terms of bad things which are happening andwill happen and for which there is no remedy. He listens only to such conversation. He cannotbe heartened or cheered up but will slump immediately into his apathy. Here is hopelessness.At 0.1, we have an inability to talk, and an individual who is completely unresponsive toconversation.It is interesting to note that the auditor can, with this column conduct what we call a“two-minute psychometry” on the preclear. The trick is simply to start talking to the preclear atthe highest possible tone level, creatively and constructively, and then gradually drop the toneof one’s conversation down to the point where it achieves response from the preclear. Anindividual best responds to his own tone band; and an individual can be lifted only about half apoint on the tone scale by conversation. In doing this type of “psychometry” one should notcarry any particular band of conversation too long, not more than a sentence or two, becausethis will have a tendency to raise slightly the tone of the preclear and so spoil the accuracy ofthe test.Two-minute psychometry, then, is done, first, by announcing something creative andconstructive and seeing whether the preclear responds in kind, then, giving forth some casualconversation, perhaps about sports, and seeing if the preclear responds to that. Getting noresponse the auditor starts talking antagonistically about things about which the preclear knows-- but not, of course, about the preclear -- to see if he achieves a response at this point. Theauditor may then give forth with a sentence or two of anger against some condition. Then theauditor can indulge in a small amount of discreditable gossip, and see if there is any response tothat. If this does not work, then the auditor dredges up some statements of hopelessness andmisery. Somewhere in this range the preclear will agree with the type of conversation that isbeing offered -- that is, he will respond to it in kind. A conversation can then be carried onalong this band where the preclear has been discovered, and the auditor will rapidly gainenough information to make a good first estimate of the preclear’s position on the chart.This two-minute psychometry by conversation can also be applied to groups. Thatspeaker who desires to command his audience must not talk above or below his audience’s tonemore than half a point. If he wishes to lift the audience’s tone, he should talk about half a pointabove their general tone level. An expert speaker, using this two-minute psychometry andcarefully noting the responses of his audience, can, in two minutes, discover the tone of theaudience -- whereupon, all he has to do is adopt a tone slightly above theirs. In Italy andGermany, where an entire people were at the level of 1.0 or slightly below, two death talkers,Mussolini and Hitler, were received by great crowds with wild enthusiasm. A powerful saintcould have come forth and talked to these people in the most creative and constructive termsand would have had no response from them at all. This phenomenon has led historians tobelieve erroneously that individuals were created by the moment and that the moment was notcreated by the individual. Some instinct prompted these extinct leaders of Europe to seek andfind the point on the tone scale at which they could most rapidly seize the attention of theiraudiences. It so happens that anyone in the 1.5 band will bring about disaster regardless of hisstated intentions. A death talker can bring an entire people up to anger and hold them there longenough to destroy them, as did Mussolini and Hitler during the second phase of World War I.64"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN;COLUMN LSubject’s Handling of Written or SpokenCommunication when Acting as a Relay PointAs in speech, it is a mechanical fact that a person at a certain position on the tone scaletends, unless affected by engrams specifically demanding different action, to follow a definitepattern in handling messages when acting as a relay point.This is mentioned here partly because it is important to organizations, but mostlybecause it is a good diagnostic point for the auditor. What does the subject do with letters he isgiven? Does he answer them, or does he put them away? When you give him a message togive to somebody else, does that other person receive the message which you wanted him toreceive, or is it twisted or altered in some way, or is it not delivered at all?The handling of messages approximates the ability of the individual to contact his ownstandard memory bank -- which is to say, he will handle in the external world variouscommunications from one person to another just as his own circuits handle informationbetween his standard memory bank and himself. At the highest level of the tone scale we havecomplete communication, and at the lowest level we have no communication at all.At 4.0, the individual passes communications freely, contributes to them, normally, andrather tends to cut entheta communications -- which is to say, lines he knows are vicious orslanderous he is not likely to assist.At 3.5, the individual passes communications, but resents and hits back at entheta lines-- by “line,” of course, is meant communication line, which is any sequence through which amessage of any character may go.At 3.0, we begin to get a breakdown of the communication line on which our individualis acting as a relay point, because an individual at this level is likely to be slightly suspicious of4.0 construction and creation and is likely to tone down the message considerably. Here wehave conservatism; and conservative communications are most rapidly relayed at this level.Here the individual does not readily lend himself to either an entheta line or to a heavy thetaline.At 2.5, the individual devaluates emergencies. He is not likely to believe a very highlyconstructive message or a destructive message. He handles communications above or below hislevel poorly, but passes communications which are at the boredom range.An individual at 2.0 deals mostly in hostile or threatening communications. He lets onlya small number of constructive communications go through, tends to select out thetacommunications, and tends to pass entheta communications -- which is to say he will makehimself a party to slander but will not make himself a party to high endeavor unless it happensto fit his own antagonistic purposes. Here we have a very poor relay point but one which,when pressed, will function.At 1.5 we run into a relay point level which is a dangerous one in any organization, ornation, or family, since here all good, constructive, theta communications are stopped orperverted in some way. Suspiciousness and other entheta elements are added to thecommunication before it is sent through. This level favors and most readily passes angrycommunications which will cause destruction. Giving a communication to such a person togive to someone else will most certainly bring about different results than one intended, whenthat communication has been relayed.65"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"At around 1.3, all theta communications are cut, and malicious communications aremost readily relayed. Communications that are passed are twisted and perverted.Around 0.9, we have an individual who tends to cut communication lines and who, onone pretext or another, will not relay communications. At this level we have the individual whospecializes in secret communications and is apt to give the classification of secret or confidentialto the most banal matters.At 0.5, the individual takes very little heed of communications. He cannot see thenecessity of passing anything to anybody -- it’s “hopeless” anyway, and so there is “no pointin doing anything about it.” At 0.1, of course, the individual is unaware of communications ofany kind and so does not relay them.This subject is much more exhaustively covered in the field of Group Dianetics, since itapplies, with enormous importance, to the conduct of business, governments, armies, andother organizations. One might safely say that ninety-five percent of an executive’s trouble iswith communication lines. This index on the tone scale will give him some idea of what toexpect from certain of his subordinates. If any executive is surrounded by individuals who willnot pass communications or who pervert communications, he can be very certain of trouble inthe organization, caused by this point alone.The auditor can establish his preclear’s position on the tone scale by observations andinquiries about his preclear’s handling of written and spoken communications when acting as arelay point. He may best do this by giving the preclear a message to relay to someone else, inorder to see what happens to that message -- the preclear, of course, thinking not that this is atest, but that it is a sincere effort to relay a communication.66"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN;COLUMN MReality(Agreement)As has been said in earlier chapters of this book, the quality known as reality exists, sofar as we know, mainly because we agree that it exists. The entire physical universe, accordingto the tenets of nuclear physics, is reducible to near-zero, if we think in terms of an actualitythat can be sensed, measured, or experienced. Matter and energy exist in space and time; butmatter is composed of energy; and energy seems, at best, to be a motion rather than asubstance. For a motion to take place, one sees that space and time are necessary, but thatspace and time are themselves such strange entities, according to Einstein and others, that theyare also reducible and expandable and are not sharply defined entities. Much could be said onthis subject, all more or less of a confusing and indecisive nature. Philosophers for manycenturies have been debating over the reality of reality, and each one has come to the finaladmission that man agrees that he perceives something with his various senses and that manhas agreed to call this reality.For our purposes, the lowest common denominator of reality could be called, then,agreement. If you and I both agree that we are gazing at an automobile, then that automobilehas reality for us. If another person comes forward and says that it is not an automobile but abarrel of olives, then you and are apt to suppose him crazy. Majority opinion rules, wherereality is concerned. Those who do not agree with the majority are commonly pronouncedinsane, or are exiled, and thus we have a sort of continuous natural selection which gives us asocial order that has agreed upon certain definite realities. Anyone who seeks to alter thoserealities in any way is attacked, unless the strength and force of his reason are such that theycarry into the minds of men a new reality on which those men can agree.There are, actually, two kinds of reality. There is the reality which can be sensed,measured, and experienced in the physical universe. This MEST reality is so thoroughlyconstructed into a human being genetically and is so uncompromisingly consistent in itsbehavior, as in the science of physics, that man finds it unwieldily consistent and so works, asin the science of physics, to discover certain natural regularities of behavior of the physicaluniverse. When new data about the physical universe is discovered to compare favorably withwhat the current age is accustomed to sense, measure, or experience, a high order of agreementis attained. A second type of reality is postulated reality, which is brought into being by creativeor destructive imagination. This reality borders over into the still unexplored field of aesthetics.There are men, usually in the fields of the arts and philosophy, who postulate new realities forthe social order. Social orders progress or decline in ratio to the number of new realities whichare postulated for them. These postulates are made, usually, single-handedly by men ofimagination. Social orders are normally very conservative and seek to hold hard to oldrealities. The reason for this is a simple one. In the absence of wide communication networksby which new realities can be generally offered it takes considerable time for the new reality tobecome known. Indeed, a new reality postulated by some individual becomes known in directratio to the velocity and magnitude of the idea. There undoubtedly exists a formula for thespeed and advance of ideas. For example, a man named Ibsen, by writing a few plays, wildlyaltered single-handedly the entire cultural aspect of Scandinavia within a few years. Ideas, andnot battles mark the forward progress of mankind. Individuals, and not masses, form theculture of the race. On a lesser scale actors and other artists work continually to give tomorrowa new form. Hollywood makes a picture which strikes the public fancy, and tomorrow wehave girls made up like the star walking along the streets of the small towns of America. AHollywood interior decorator dresses a set which takes the eye of the American audience, andtomorrow that set is seen in the apartments of Miami Beach and other resorts. A culture is asrich and as capable of surviving as it has imaginative artists, skilled men of science, a high ethiclevel, workable government, land and natural resources, in about that order of importance.67"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"One might postulate two more realities. The first is that of the Supreme Being. Noculture in the history of the world, save the thoroughly depraved and expiring ones, has failedto affirm the existence of a Supreme Being. It is an empirical observation that men without astrong and lasting faith in a Supreme Being are less capable, less ethical, and less valuable tothemselves and society. A government wishing to deprave its people to the point where theywill accept the most perfidious and rotten acts abolishes first the concept of God; and in thewake of that destroys the family, with free love; the intellectual, with police-enforced idiocies;and so reduces a whole population to an estate somewhat below that of dogs. A man withoutan abiding faith is, by observation alone, more of a thing than a man. Modern science,producing weapons for the annihilation of men, women, and children in wholesale lots, hassolidly run itself aground on the reef of Godlessness. Modern science has gone so far as toadvocate the rise of man from mud and clay alone; has denied to him even a semblance of asoul; and so has not only solved none of the problems of the humanities, but has aided andabetted Godless totalitarian governments which seek nothing less than the engulfment andenslavement of all men and the extinguishment of every spark of decency in the breast of everyhuman being. These two tracks which have led away from the affirmation of the existence of aSupreme Being -- modern science and totalitarianism -- are bringing man into a machine-likestate of being where the ideal has become a lump of muscle, greasy with sweat, or a grimymechanic serving a howling monster of steel. The arts, the humanities, and the decencies arefallen away from, until they are like tiny stars shining across a great, black void. Theabandonment of the admission of a Supreme Being as a reality, intimate to the life of man,makes prostitution the ideal conduct of a woman; perfidy and betrayal the highest ethic levelattainable by a man; and obliteration by treachery, bomb, and gun the highest goal attainable bya culture. Thus, there is no great argument about the reality of a Supreme Being, since onesees, in the failure to countenance that reality, a slimy and loathsome trail, downward into themost vicious depths.The theta universe is a postulated reality for which there exists much evidence. If onewere going to draw a diagram of this, it would be a triangle with the Supreme Being at onecorner, the MEST universe at another, and the theta universe at the third. Too much evidence isforthcoming in research to permit us to overlook this reality. Indeed, the assumption of thisreality is solving some of the major problems of the humanities and fills in many gaps whichexisted formerly in the theory of the engram. It has long been considered beneficial inpsychotherapies for a person to be able to face reality. However, none defined what realitywas, and so the individual found this rather difficult.There would be two realities with which the individual was most intimately concerned.The internal reality, of his own existence and past, and the external reality, of his present-timeenvironment. To this could be added, of course, his future reality.The reality tone scale on extroversion-introversion would be, at a glance, that aroundtone 4.0 the interior world was sufficiently comfortable so that the individual’s thought andperception was mainly directed toward the exterior world and his computation had to do withpresent time and the future. And as one descended the tone scale, one could see the gradualinvolvement of free theta with enMEST, with less and less concern with the exterior world andthe future and more and more involvement in the interior world and the past, until the majorityof the theta was enturbulated and death ensued. There would be, then, an extroversion-introversion scale which would mark very sharply the position of the person on the tone scale.The position of the person would, of course, be determined by the amount of free theta withwhich he was endowed and the percentage of that theta which had become entheta. Yet anotherreality scale could be postulated on the basis of the theta perceptics, but that is beyond the scopeof this work. The general attitude of the individual with regard to reality, as shown on the tonescale, would be as follows:At 4.0, the individual would be creatively and constructively inclined toward reality.He would be more likely to adjust reality to him and to postulate new future realities than hewould be to adjust himself to existing realities. He would search for different viewpoints and68"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"changes in reality in order to broaden his own reality. He would have a complete flexibility andunderstanding in relating and evaluating different realities. At 3.5, the individual would havethe ability to understand, relate, and evaluate realities, regardless of the difference in viewpoint;moderate flexibility about realities brought to view, without eager search for new ones. A littlelower on the tone scale, the individual would be involved with attempts to reconcile his ownreality with conflicting realities, and he would have a limited flexibility. At 3.0, the individualwould possess an awareness of the possible validity of a different reality without relating this tohis own reality.At 2.5 would ensue an indifference to conflicting realities, a “maybe -- who cares?”attitude. Below this would be a refusal to match two realities, rejecting conflicting realities.At 2.0 would be found verbal doubt, defense of one’s own reality, and attempts toundermine the reality of others. Here is the critical level, and criticism intensifies from heredown to 1.0 and then dies out.At 1.5, the individual is mainly concerned with the destruction of opposing realities,wrecking or changing them, knocking apart the realities of other people. The environmentalreality would be attacked, with destruction in view. The only change that would take placewould be a destructive change.Below this would be doubt of the opposing reality, a nonverbal disbelief a refusal toaccept the disbelief of others, a refusal to accept conflicting realities without trying to fightback.At 1.1 on the tone scale would ensue doubt of one’s own reality, insecurity, andattempts to gain reassurance. In the sphere of MEST realities there would be appeasement ofgods or elements.At 0.5 we would have shame, anxiety, strong doubt of one’s own reality with aconsequent inability to act within it. If the person is to act at all he must be told what to do. Heis afraid to act of himself since he has no way to assess the consequences.Below this is a complete withdrawal from conflicting reality and a refusal to recognizethe existence of any reality but one’s own, in which one is rigidly locked.At tone 0.0, the only reality is death.69"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENCOLUMN NCondition of Track and ValencesEveryone has a time track. To some preclears, this may not be immediately apparent.The time track consists of all the consecutive moments of “now,” from the earliestmoment of life of the organism to present time. Actually, the track is a multiple bundle ofperceptics; and it might be said that there is a time track for each perceptic, all tracks runningsimultaneously. The track might also be considered as a system of filing recordings made ofthe environment and the organism, filed according to time received. All the perceptions of theenvironment and the organism during the entire lifetime, up to now, or present time, arerecorded, faintly or deeply, upon the time track.It was not generally known, before Dianetics, that the time track existed for an awakeand conscious person and that the individual could move upon it. In the field of hypnotismsomething was known of the phenomenon, but it had been indifferently studied and wasthought to be available only to a hypnotized person. Experiments conducted by experts inhypnotism have demonstrated that the person, awake, moves more readily on his time trackthan a person in a hypnotized state.There is actual perception of movement on the time track, if the individual is moving.Present time is an ever extending moment; and a person who is free on his time track isgenerally in present time, moving forward through the consecutive moments of time.A primary concern of the auditor is to keep the case of his preclear in such goodcondition that the preclear can continue to move upon the time track and contact locks,secondaries and engrams in order to recount them at the place they occur a sufficient number oftimes to reduce or erase them. It is possible for the auditor, by failing to conduct his preclearproperly through locks, secondaries and engrams, to cause the preclear to stick upon the timetrack in some moment of the past. When this happens the preclear is not able to move upon thetime track, and the auditor should make it his first concern to return mobility to the preclear.Various things can happen to the preclear with relation to the time track. The mostupsetting of these is when a grouper, a phrase such as “pull yourself together,” “it all happensat once,” “everything is against me,” “it all comes down to this,” and other action phraseswhich would tend to bunch all incidents in one place, creates the illusion that the time track iscollapsed and that all incidents are at the same point in time. A case must be heavily chargedand the action phrases in the case must have considerable effectiveness with the preclear beforethis can happen. The auditor can detect its occurrence rather easily, and at the first difficultywith the time track, the auditor should suspect a grouper.The question of how early the time track goes has not been completely resolved. Theauditor, in the absence of such resolution, should take into account the fact that considerableexperimental evidence exists that the time track continues into the past carlier than the life of thepresent organism. There is a possibility that the time track is a portion of what we call the thetabody rather than of the organism itself. There could be a genetic time track which would goback through the generations preceding the organism, but experimental evidence has not borneout this possibility uniformly, as it has the existence of the theta body. Thus, the auditorshould be prepared to discover some astonishingly early incidents; and if and when he doesdiscover them he should be very careful to run them and to erase or reduce them, or if they willnot reduce, to find an earlier incident which can be erased or reduced, in order to relieve them.It is not in the province of the auditor to question the data of the preclear in any way; it is in theprovince of the auditor to reduce any and all engrams which he recovers in the case.70"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"In addition to the grouper, there can be other troubles with the time track. The mostcommon of these is for the preclear to be stuck in an incident of the past. A holder (a phraselike “stay here”) existing in an engram has seized him at some earlier age, and he is not inpresent time but is locked in an earlier period of his life, which also contains pain andunconsciousness or heavy grief of fear charges.Lock scanning or running earlier engrams generally remedies this condition. Thiscondition is checked for very simply, by the use of the flash answer. As will be coveredelsewhere, the auditor uses the file clerk of the preclear. The file clerk uses automatic responsemechanisms which are not “thoughtful” mechanisms but instantaneous replies, the first thingthat flashes into the preclear’s mind at the snap of the auditor’s fingers. The auditor asks thepreclear for a date, and snaps his fingers; the preclear may not give the present-time date; if hedoes not, he is giving the date of the moment where he is stuck on the track. Simply askingvarious people around you their age will give you considerable data on this mechanism. Tellthese people to give you the first number that comes into their heads when you snap yourfingers, and then ask them “How old are you?” (snap !). In a number of instances you will getages much earlier than present time. Asking them to remember what happened at that periodwill very often bring them up to present time, where they may not have been for years. Anauditor could walk through any sanatorium and simply tell patient after patient “come up topresent time,” and he would find that some very small percentage of the “insane” people wouldcome up to present time and would begin to be sane: this has been done several times, withsome astonishing results. This is mentioned to give the auditor some idea of the importance ofhaving the preclear in present time and the importance of being in present time. Flash answerchecks can also be done by the following mechanism: the preclear is asked to give the firstanswer that flashes into his head, yes or no, to each of the following questions; the auditor thensays “Hospital?” to which the preclear answers yes or no; the auditor then says “Nurse?” andthe preclear gives him a yes or no. When the preclear is unable to recall anything havinghappened at the age he gives in lieu of his present-time age, by flash answer, this yes-or-nocheck will serve to tell the auditor the nature and character of the incident in which the preclearis held. The preclear’s memory can then be more ably directed toward discovering whether itwas an accident, an injury or an illness in which he was concerned and who gave him theholder which keeps him in the incident. Sometimes merely remembering the incident will freethe preclear so that he can come to present time. Sometimes in a case which has been non-sonic there is sonic at the exact moment where the preclear is held, and the sonic phrase is theholder by which the preclear is held.Simply directing the preclear’s attention to a pleasure moment and running him throughit many times, over and over, particularly one in which the preclear was victorious as himself,will often snap the preclear out of an engram in which he is held and permit him to come topresent time. It is common procedure to end all sessions by running the preclear through somepleasure moments in order to bring him easily and completely to present time.Another mechanism which gives the auditor trouble in bringing the preclear to presenttime or moving him on the track is the call-back. Such phrases as “come here,” “come back,”and other action phrases which would, in present time, cause the preclear to move back toanother position in space, act, when contained in engrams, to pull the preclear down frompresent lime into the engrams. It often happens that the auditor tries to bring the preclear topresent time and every time the preclear nears present time he is pulled back down the track toan earlier age. This is caused by a call-back.Another mechanism which keeps the preclear early on the track is the down bouncer.This type of phrase is one which tells the person to “get down” or “get back” and keeps thepreclear below the actual incident in which he is held.Another difficulty on the track is the bouncer. The preclear may be in an engram andyet be bounced into present time. This creates a situation in which the preclear seems to be inpresent time but is actually under considerable tension being held in an engram.*71"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Another difficulty with the time track is the misdirector. This would be a phrase which,when the auditor sends the preclear in one direction, makes the preclear go in another direction.Such a phrase as “you do everything backwards” causes this situation. When the auditor tellsthe preclear to come up to present time, if such a phrase is active the preclear may go back tobasic-basic (the first engram in the case). Any case in. which phrases are this active is a highlycharged case, and it will be necessary for the auditor to get rid of many locks and secondariesbefore he can run engrams.Another difficulty which affects the time track, but is not exactly a time-track difficulty,is the matter of valence.A valence is a false or true identity. The preclear has his own valence; then there areavailable to him the valences of all persons who appear in his engrams. A valence-shifter is aphrase which causes the individual to shift into another identity. The phrase “you ought to be inhis shoes” and the phrase “you’re just like your mother” are valence-shifters, which change thepreclear from his own identity into the whole identity of another person. There are, then, manyvalences open to the preclear. The valence is a whole identity.In the handbook issued in 1950 (DIANETICS: The Modern Science of Mental Health,by L. Ron Hubbard), there was an error (pg. 283) in the omission of quotation marks aroundthe phrase “stuck in present time.” It is not possible for an individual to be stuck in presenttime. He is always stuck in an engram. Some people who find it very difficult to move on thetrack seem to be stuck in present time, but they are not. Lock scanning or the running of asecondary or the location of the actual engram in which the preclear is stuck will serve to get thepreclear moving on the track. to have all the troubles grandfather had and most of thepeculiarities and characteristics. These characteristics do not have to be contained in engramsthemselves; they are simply part and parcel of the valence. The preclear may be in severalvalences at once, in a synthetic valence, or in no valence at all. Or he can be in his own valence.If the preclear is not in his own valence, every effort should be made in the course ofprocessing to cause him to find his own valence. Running pleasure moments very often bringsthe preclear into his own valence.Being out of valence is a primary cause, evidently, of sonic, visio and somatic shut-offs. The auditor may be running an engram in which the preclear has sonic, visio andsomatics which suddenly disappear. The first thing he should suspect is a valence-shifter. Heasks for a yes-or-no flash answer as to whether a valence-shifter is present, and if the answer isyes, he asks for the wording of the valence-shifter, and when he gets the words he has thepreclear repeat them, and the preclear will go back into his own valence and visio and sonic willturn back on. Most cases which are occluded are out of valence.Valence is a survival mechanism, one of the means used by the mind to escape toopainful an existence; therefore, in order to get the preclear into his own valence much of thecharge has to be unburdened from the track. Locks can be scanned with the individual out ofvalence. In most secondaries, where terror and apathy are present, the preclear will be found tobe out of valence. It is necessary to run such an incident several times before the preclear canget into his own valence and so get a proper discharge of the grief fear, or apathy.On the tone scale we see that we are, again, involved with two different types of cases.The first is the case which is wide open, in valence, with sonic and visio, although highlycharged; being too weak structurally to cover up charge, this case stays in its own valencethough that valence is too painful to bear. The other type is the one in which the mind has theability to get out of valence and so occlude painful moments in the past. The mind ordinarilychooses winning valences. Valence-shifters, however, can force the individual into the valencehe abhors. Continued repetition by a parent that the preclear is “just like grandfather” but thathe “must not be like grandfather” because “grandfather is detestable” will bring about aconflicting situation in which the preclear is forced, by valence shifters, to occupy a characterhe feels is abhorred. This is the primary mechanism which causes an individual to “detest72"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"himself; he actually does not detest himself at all; he detests the valence in which he has beenforced to live.The chart is self-explanatory for the occluded case. It goes without saying that in awide open case the person is in valence from top to bottom, wherever he is on the tone scale.From this it should not be adjudicated that it is either desirable or undesirable to be a wide opencase; such cases are relatively easy to work. The occluded case, when finally in his ownvalence, with sonic and visio, and with most of his engrams gone, is in excellent condition,with a very high mental potential.The condition of the track is normally regulated by the factors of charge, valence-shifters, and action phrases. In view of the fact that action phrases are not active unless there isheavy charge on the case, it actually comes down to the fact that the condition of the track andof the valence of the preclear is regulated by charge. By charge, of course, is meant anger, fear,grief or apathy contained as misemotion in the case. This form of entheta (there is otherentheta, in the form of communication and reality secondaries, as well as misemotionsecondaries) charges up the track so much that the action phrases act. The charge must be veryheavy on a case before engram action phrases -- action phrases contained in engramsthemselves -- can be active. The charge must be much heavier for action phrases to be active insecondary engrams, which are those containing misemotion and communication and realitybreaks and enforcements. The charge on the case must be extreme indeed for action phrases tobe active in locks.Thus it can be seen that the condition of the track and valences is mainly a matter ofcharge. In the wide-open case, a tremendously heavily charged track brings the individual intoa psychotic level. The inability of the mind to occlude and encyst charge gives us the strangepicture of an individual who can move on the track and who can run through engrams and whohas sonic and visio but who is psychotic. These people are relatively easy to work; but theprimary target should be the removal of charge, regardless of the temptation to run engrams,because such people will lock up on the track if the auditor makes the mistake of runningengrams because they are easy to reach.73"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN;COLUMN OManifestation of Engrams and LocksHuman conduct, in the absence of engrams, can be considered to be good, from theviewpoint of the individual and his group, as modified by the education and environment ofthat individual. The individual without engrams seeks survival along all of the dynamics, inaccordance with his breadth of understanding.This does not mean that a Zulu who has been cleared of all of his engrams would notcontinue to eat missionaries if he were a cannibal by education; but it does mean that he wouldbe as rational as possible about eating missionaries; further, it would be easier to re-educate himabout eating missionaries if he were a clear. Being a clear does not mean being a reeducated ora re-environmented or a re-geneticized individual; but it does mean that all possible free theta inthe case can be brought to bear on the problems of the environment and the future and that allthe data in the analytical memory bank is available for the solution of those problems. Engramsand their secondaries and locks inject unalterable conclusions into the mind, so thatcomputation becomes much on the order of trying to add two and two when an unseen hand isalways adding another two to the column, unknown to the computer. An engram makes itimpossible for a person adding two and two to get four; furthermore, it makes the individual dostrange and irrational things, which is to say, it makes him act along non-survival lines andcauses him to do things although he “should know better.”The engram, with its secondaries and locks, alters behavior by inhibiting action orthought or imagination or by causing the individual to dramatize.So long as an individual can actively dramatize an engram, however, the engram doesnot become particularly charged. When the engram commands such non-survival activity thatthe environment censures or brings further pain to the individual, that engram begins to chargeup. If an engram commands an individual to walk three times around the block every morningfor his health, the engram may be effective but not troublesome so long as the individual ispermitted that walk. Let him, however, move into an environment such as the army, where heis not permitted to take this “constitutional” every morning, but must stand muster instead; thedramatization is broken and, as a consequence, the action potential of the individual is observedby his analytical mind to be cut down, and the individual feels reduced in scope. When anengram in a thief commands that he steal, he may be cheerful and happy so long as he can goon stealing; then the law may step in and jail him because he steals; this breaks thedramatization and reduces him in scope and well being.There are two sides to an engram: entheta and enMEST. So long as the thought can bedramatized, the enMEST remains quiet; but when the dramatization is broken, the enMEST, orphysical pain, turns on in an effort to force the individual to do what the engram commands.Engrams monitor individuals in this unseen way. In lower organisms than man there isa survival value to this type of reactive action. In the environment of a lower organism, thereceipt of pain normally comes about because the organism is not following a survival course;therefore, if the organism attempts to do the same thing again, the pain threatens to turn on andthe organism is forced into another course of action which, presumably, is better survival.Much more could be written about human behavior and about the engram as the causeof aberrated behavior, but what the auditor wishes to know is how to audit his preclear andhow to find his preclear on this chart so that he will know what type of entheta to address in thecase, whether to run engrams, secondaries, or locks, and how to run them.74"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"An engram is a moment of physical pain and unconsciousness. A secondary is amoment of misemotion where loss is threatened or accomplished. A lock is an analyticalmoment in which the perceptics of the engram are approximated, thus restimulating the engramor bringing it into action, the present time perceptics being erroneously interpreted by thereactive mind to mean that the same condition which produced physical pain once before is nowagain at hand. Secondaries contain only misemotion and communication and realityenforcements and breaks. Locks contain mainly perceptics; no physical pain and very littlemisemotion. These are all types of entheta. Secondaries and locks charge up engrams; it isusually not possible to run engrams in a case which is very heavily charged with secondariesand locks.By observing his preclear, the auditor should be able to establish fairly rapidly what thepreclear does with locks. In surveying the case, he may find that the preclear acts veryaberratedly on the subject of religion, and yet all he can find as a cause is a scolding by aminister when the preclear was a child. The human mind is a very tough mechanism, and this isinsufficient cause for aberration in a sane person. If the conduct is remedied merely by runningthis lock, the auditor can see that this preclear will dramatize locks, which is to say, he will actas though locks were engrams. This denotes a very highly charged case.The auditor may discover that the preclear dramatizes secondaries, which is to say thatthe preclear may be a “coffin case,” which lies in the position of a dead man, with arms folded.This is a grief engram having to do with the death of some loved one, and with the preclear inthe valence of the loved one. The auditor will see many examples of the “coffin case.” Thismeans that the preclear will dramatize secondaries and that the track is very heavily charged, butless heavily charged than that of the preclear who will dramatize locks.Finally we have the preclear who will dramatize only engrams. He is fairly high up thescale; is more or less normal.The column on the chart about the manifestations of engrams and locks is self-explanatory if one understands these basic principles.There are three types of locks: broken dramatizations, restimulations, and ARC locks.It is a principle of theta that it desires to carry to completion any cycle of action oncebegun. When such a cycle is interrupted as in the breaking of a dramatization, turbulence isentered into the theta, and entheta is produced.The restimulation lock merely brings to the person perceptions which approximate thoseof an engram. If the individual is tired or weary, these perceptions, sights, sounds, smells, orwhatever they may be, will restimulate the engram which has similar perceptics; and theincident becomes a lock on the engram and charges it to some small degree.The third type of lock results when affinity, communication, or reality is forced uponthe individual by the environment when he does not want it, when it is not rationally necessary,or when one or more of these is inhibited or denied to the individual by others in theenvironment.Some of these ARC locks which occur in a person’s life are so intense and cause somuch charge to enter into the engram that they are considered secondary engrams.75"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEEN;COLUMN PSexual BehaviorAttitude Toward ChildrenThis is the column devoted to the second dynamic. This dynamic would normally becalled sex. In Dianetics, one considers sex to be divided into parts: the sexual act; and theproduce of sex, children.Any dynamic can be considered to be a flowing line of theta. The power of theta alongany dynamic varies from individual to individual. Engrams can be considered to lie across thedynamics in such a way as to cause dispersion. When the engrams are removed the dispersion,which would be theta turning into entheta and the inhibition of the flow of free theta, disappearsand the natural flow of free theta can begin again.One sees this dispersion and entheta effect most markedly on the second dynamic. It isso clear cut that some psychotherapies, in the past, placed the entire emphasis of aberration onthe second dynamic. Naturally, these psychotherapies were not very workable, since they leftout the other seven dynamics, and were, indeed, severely criticized by their contemporaries fornot being sufficiently comprehensive. Sex however, is an excellent index of the position of thepreclear on the tone scale. It is the excellence of this index which probably brought so muchattention to the second dynamic. In this current culture, sexual aberration is very high.Anything which is hidden and highly regulated in a culture will become aberrated. There isconsiderable confusion in the American and European cultures about sex; since there was somuch perversion and promiscuity and maltreatment of children the erroneous conclusion wasreached that the remedy for this lay in further regulation; whereas, in reality, it was theregulation which caused the derangement of the dynamic.It will be noted, in observing the behavior of human beings, and on this chart of thetone scale, that promiscuity, perversion, sadism, and irregular practices fall far down the line.Free Love falls, also, in this very low band; since man is relatively monogamous and since it isnon-survival not to have a well ordered system for the creation and upbringing of children, byfamilies. A society which falls into this 1.1 band of the tone scale can be expected to abuse sex,to be promiscuous, to misuse and maltreat children, and to act, in short, much in the waycurrent cultures are acting. It is of vital importance, if one wishes to stop immorality, and theabuse of children, to de-aberrate this dynamic for the whole group of the society, to saynothing of individuals.At the highest MEST point of the tone scale, 4.0, one finds monogamy, constancy, ahigh enjoyment level, and very moral reactions toward sex; but one also finds the sexual urgeacting to create more than children, and so comes about a sublimation of sex into creativethought. At 3.5 on the tone scale, we have a high interest in the opposite sex, and constancy,but we do not have so great a sublimation. At 3.0 on the tone scale, we have some falling off insexual interest, but we have an interest in procreation and children. At 2.5, we have somedisinterest in procreation, not for any reason beyond a general failure to be interested in muchof anything. The sexual act can be adequately performed, given the physical ability. At the bandof 2.0, we begin to get a disgust for sex, a revulsion toward sex, mostly when irregularlypractised. At the 1.5 band of the tone scale, we find sex appearing as rape; we find the sexualact being performed as a punishment.At 1.1 on the tone scale we enter the area of the most vicious reversal of the seconddynamic. Here we have promiscuity, perversion, sadism, and irregular practices. We have noenjoyment of the sex act but a hectic anxiety about it. The sex act cannot truly be enjoyedwhether performed regularly or irregularly. Here is Free Love, easy marriage and quickdivorce, and general sexual disaster. People at this level on the second dynamic are intensely76"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"dangerous in the society, since aberration is contagious. A society which reaches this level ison its way out of history, as went the Greeks, as went the Romans, as goes modern Europeanand American culture. Here is a flaming danger signal which must be heeded if a race is to goforward.At 0.5, we have impotency and anxiety about sex, with only occasional efforts toprocreate. On the second dynamic we get occasional resurgences, from 0.5 up the scale, whichquickly relapse.It is interesting to note here the application of the principle of the dwindling spiral to thesecond dynamic. On any of the dynamics and on any column of this chart, when the individualsinks below the 2.0 level, the dwindling spiral rapidly carries him down through 1.5, 1.1, 0.5,to death. This is particularly evident on the second dynamic. The 1.1 individual, engaged infrantic pseudo-sexual activity today, will in a very near tomorrow, much nearer than hesuspects, find himself or herself at the 0.5 level of impotency and anxiety.The organs of sex, at the 0.5 level, become relatively useless; indeed, this seconddynamic tone scale is closely applicable to the endocrine activity of the individual and the formand condition of the physical body. The woman who in her teens was at the 1.1 level of thescale will not have a well enough developed pelvic structure or endocrine system to permit herbearing children with ease. Difficult births are a normal result of too long a residence in a lowband of the tone scale during the formative period of the body. Easy births can only beexpected with women who are relatively high on the tone scale.It is noteworthy that the 1.1 to 0.5 area of the tone scale finds the muscles, particularlythe sexual muscles, without tonus. The nymphomaniac and the satyr are extremely slack-muscled, and the tonus around 0.5 is almost non-existent. In the pretended death band there is,of course, no effort to procreate. Along the -1 band, where the organism as an organism isdead but the cells still survive, it is interesting that ejaculation and sexual activity occasionallytake place immediately after the death of the individual, which gives some index of the strengthand force of this dynamic.Life is defined, in cytology, as an unending stream of protoplasm from the beginning oflife itself until now. Down through the ages as a continuous genetic stream, this protoplasm ismodified by natural selection and environmental conditioning, as well as by what seems to beoutright planning, from generation to generation. Because life is so dependent upon thislifeline, it is very easy to place too great an emphasis upon the sexual act, the thing which keepsthis lifeline in a continuous stream.The second part of this dynamic concerns itself with children, the product of sex. Thereis a gradient of reaction toward children, from the top to the bottom of the tone scale, which theauditor can use in order to place his preclear properly on the chart.At 4.0 there is an intense interest in children, which extends to both the mental andphysical well being of the children and the society in which these children will live. Here areefforts to add to the culture so that the children will have a better chance for survival.At 3.5, we have a love of children, a care of them, an understanding of them.At 3.0, we have an interest in children.At 2.5, we have a tolerance of children, but not a great interest in their affairs.At 2.0, we have nagging of, and nervousness about children.At 1.5, we enter the band of brutal treatment of children, heavy corporal punishment,the forcing of the child into a mould with pain, breaking his dramatizations, upsets about hisnoise or clutter.77"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"At 1.1 on the tone scale, there may be two reactions to children. There may be an actualand immediate desire for children, as a manifestation of sex. But we also may have the use ofchildren for sadistic purposes. And we may find both of these in the same individual. We havea long-term general neglect of children, with an occasional sporadic interest in them; we havevery little thought for the child’s future or the culture in which the child will grow up.At 0.5, we have mainly an anxiety about children, fear that they will be hurt, fear of thisand fear of that concerning children, and a hopelessness about their future.At 1.1, a mother will attempt the abortion of her child; and any woman who will abort achild, save only if the child threatens her physical life (rather than her reputation), lies in the 1.1bracket or below. She can be expected to be unreliable, inconstant and promiscuous; and thechild is looked upon as evidence of this promiscuity.At 0.5 we have abortion with the specious reasoning that the world or the future is toohorrible to bring a child into. With the parent at 0.5, all the natural gaiety and happiness of thechild will be suppressed, and we have as unhealthy an atmosphere for childhood as one couldpostulate.At 0.1, there is not even awareness of children.It is notable, as one glances down this column, that an interest in children includes aninterest not only in the bearing of the child but in the child’s well being, happiness, mentalstate, education, and general future. We may have a person on the 1.1 level who seems veryanxious to produce a child; very possibly this person is following an engram command to havechildren. Once the child is born we may have, in this 1.1 bracket, an interest in it as aplaything or a curiosity, but, following this, we get general neglect and thoughtlessness aboutthe child and no feeling whatsoever about the child’s future or any effort to build one for it.We get careless familial actions such as promiscuity, which will tear to pieces the familysecurity upon which the child’s future depends. Along this band, the child is considered athing, a possession.A half tone above this, in the anger band, the child is a target for the dramatizationswhich the individual does not dare execute against grown-ups in the environment -- a last ditcheffort to be in command of something. Here we have domination of the child, with a constantwarping of its character.The whole future of the race depends upon its attitude toward children; and a race whichspecializes in women for “menial purposes,” or which believes that the contest of the sexes inthe spheres of business and politics is a worthier endeavor than the creation of tomorrow’sgeneration, is a race which is dying. We have, in the woman who is an ambitious rival of theman in his own activities, a woman who is neglecting the most important mission she mayhave. A society which looks down upon this mission, and in which women are taughtanything but the management of a family, the care of men, and the creation of the futuregeneration, is a society which is on its way out. The historian can peg the point where asociety begins its sharpest decline at the instant when women begin to take part, on an equalfooting with men, in political and business affairs; since this means that the men are decadentand the women are no longer women. This is not a sermon on the role or position of women: itis a statement of bald and basic fact. When children become unimportant to a society, thatsociety has forfeited its future. Even beyond the fathering and bearing and rearing of children,a human being does not seem to be complete without a relationship with a member of theopposite sex. This relationship is the vessel where in is nurtured the life force of bothindividuals, whereby they create the future of the race in body and thought. If man is to rise togreater heights, then woman must rise with him, or even before him. But she must rise aswoman and not as today she is being misled into rising -- as a man. It is the hideous joke offrustrated, unvirile men to make women over into the travesty of men which men themselveshave become. Men are difficult and troublesome creatures -- but valuable. The creative care78"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"and handling of men is an artful and a beautiful task. Those who would cheat women of theirrightful place by making them into men should at last realize that by this action they aredestroying not only the women but the men and the children as well.

These arts and skills and creation and inspiration are her beauty, just as she is thebeauty of mankind.79"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENCOLUMN QCommand Over EnvironmentIt may be postulated that the mission of theta is the conquest of MEST. The organismcontrols as much MEST as it has theta with which to control the MEST.One could envision command over the environment, for a man, or for a group, as aseries of concentric circles. The widest circle would demonstrate the individual’s or thegroup’s considered belief in its ability to have an effect on the physical universe. The nextcircle, just inside, would be the individual’s or the group’s belief in its ability to affect all ofEarth and life. The next circle inside would be the individual’s or the group’s belief in itsability to affect a section of life, a nation or a smaller group. The next circle would be the beliefof the individual or the group in its ability to affect some other species and the men in itsenviron. The next inside circle would be the belief the individual or the group has in its abilityto affect a few people or a small portion of its environment. The next circle would have to dowith the individual’s and the group’s belief that it could affect the individual and the group.The next inside circle would be the individual’s or the group’s inability to affect self. Onecannot say what would be the normal command area, but certain it is that when the commandarea comes to the point where the individual can barely affect the individual and the group canbarely affect the group we reach a point where the only MEST (and for their purposes, as amatter of viewpoint, the individual and the group often consider life and life forms as MEST,subject to their control) which can be changed by theta is the MEST of the individual or group.Here psychosomatic illnesses set in, theta acting only within the organism, to destroy it. Agroup at this stage will tear itself apart. It is just slightly wider than this circle that we enter the2.0 area of the chart. The wider areas could be said to be those where theta could act freelyenough to be constructive and creative within those spheres of influence; and very close to thecenter of the spheres would be where entheta exists. A much more complex system whichwould possibly tell us a great deal about theta and MEST, could be worked out on this gradientscale, and probably should be.The auditor is primarily interested in spotting his preclear on the chart. In order to do sohe should establish what the preclear thinks he can control in terms of life, MEST, people, andgroups add what the preclear thinks he would do with these if he could control them. If thepreclear has constructive and creative plans in mind for the sphere he outlines, one can see thathe is above the 2.0 band and that one is working with the amount of theta the individual has ashis endowment, since not all men believe they can control the entire universe but should notnecessarily be suspect of being psychotic should they entertain such a notion, even though it isa manifestation of psychosis to have grandiose ideas because of manic engrams. Men haveexisted who could control enormous spheres and be creative and constructive within thosespheres, but these were not men of the sword; they were men of ideas.Should the preclear postulate for himself a rather wide sphere and then appoint for it adestructive end, one can be sure that one is dealing with a preclear below the 2.0 level.The auditor should keep in mind the axiom that all creation carries with it a smallamount of destruction; just as one may not be able to construct an apartment building withoutdestroying the tenement which sits there; just as one may not be able to publish a newspaperwithout destroying forests to obtain newsprint. It is the ratio of creation to destruction whichcounts. In view of the postulates laid down in this chapter, the column on the chart is self-explanatory. Some comment, however, should be made on the political ramifications containedin this column. It will be seen that the democratic area -- where one deals with Jeffersoniandemocracy -- lies in the bands at 3.0 and above. This postulates a belief in the goodness of menand the good sense of men in council. It postulates the belief that men should be free to decide80"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"things for themselves. It outlaws tyranny as undesirable, and relegates government to theservice of the group rather than the group to the service of the government.One has to go well down the tone scale in order to find the next stopping point forpolitics, and here he locates fascism as existing between 2.0 and 1.5. Fascism is an absolutecontrol for destructive purposes, of an environ, with forthright and strong-armed meansemployed in seeking that control. There are intermediate stops between democracy and fascism,such as monarchy; they are not of major interest in the world at this time, and are not within thescope of this work but belong in Group Dianetics, which will be covered completely in anothervolume. In today’s world, the next stop down the tone scale politically is the subversive, whobelongs in the 1.1 to 1.3 bracket. Most theoretical subversion pretends to be very high on thetone scale, and so has had its appeal to the liberally inclined individual; but there is a wide gapbetween theory and practice, and the unthinking person confuses the theory with the practice.He finds himself keeping company with 1.1’s. Communication lines are cut; affinities areflagrantly used and perverted; reality is twisted; the level of truth as seen in subversivepropaganda, compares with lowest gossip; and the treatment of human beings is without anyregard to the respect an individual human being should have.Subversion receives its main support from such individuals as lie in the vicinity of 1.1,and the reason it gains so many volunteer agents in lands which it wishes to overrun lies in thedesire of the 1.1 to have good cause and reason to flout flagrantly and place himself “above”existing morals and the laws of the land in which he operates. He gains through his warpedphilosophy a very fine excuse to believe himself above such things as law and decency, and itis very possibly this appeal alone which brings so many recruits to the ranks of subversiveorganizations.Editorial Note: In this column on the tone scale chart brief reference is made to certainpolitical philosophies and attitudes in the world today. While this subject will be taken up atlength in Group Dianetics, the present chart would be incomplete if it did not show that thesepolitical systems have their own tone positions and that their general methods of operation canbe seen to conform with the methods and operations of individuals at these levels.At 3.5, we have the liberal. The liberal reasons well, accepts wide responsibilities, andis guided by high ethical principles. He is eager to seize upon any new idea which willimprove the society, and he is not suggestible, being swayed this way and that by anypropaganda, but reaches conclusions extremely rationally. He has a high regard for individualfreedom, for property, and for the right of the powerfully productive person to be allowed tocontribute to the society without hindrance, spontaneously and efficiently.At 3.0, we have the person who is democratic, but who is somewhat more conservativein his attitudes and more given to social regulations, being more in need of them. The term“democratic” is a somewhat loose one, but at this level it signifies the individual or systemwhich allows personal freedom and has moderate regard for property and productive ability butis not particularly inventive or enthusiastic about refining and improving and enriching thesocial order along all of the dynamics.The next familiar political level is the 1.5 level of fascism. The activities of Hitler andMussolini and the social orders they produced are, of course, the examples which come tomind. The open declaration of intention to conquer, kill, and control by the most obvious andforceful methods is the mark of fascism. Justification is limited to the bluntest most bald-facedlies. Invalidation of other persons and social orders is straight-forward, angry, and lacking inany subtle pretense of reasonableness or moderation.The next political level is the 1.1. level of Communism. The literature of Communism,particularly in the works of Lenin, sets the tone of secret, flexible, deceptive operation which isobservable in the methods of Communism throughout the world. In its strongholds such as theSoviet Union, in times and sections where it is not threatened, Communism will sometimes risefor brief periods to the level of 1.5, but in its normal action it partakes of all of thecharacteristics of the 1.1 level as they are outlined in this present work. The willingness to81"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"devote an unlimited amount of time to accomplishing secretly a destructive action which thefascist would accomplish immediately by force is implicit in Communism. Communism has anendless patience in tearing down by subtle propaganda a society or an idea which it neveropenly opposes in all that time, and an unwillingness ever to use open methods which wouldbetray interest or activity. Communism, like the individual 1.1, makes an initial pretence ofgiving great assistance and help, and it keeps up this pretence in the face of any and allcontradictory evidence, blandly giving forth soothing justifications and assurances of the mostsincere and deeply-felt interest in the good of all.The reader who will examine these various political manifestations in the light of thetone scale chart will find, undoubtedly, that the sometimes mysterious actions of variouspolitical factions will become predictable and understandable.82"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY;COLUMN RActual Worth To Society ComparedTo Apparent WorthIn Dianetics we have some means of establishing the worth of a human being. In thepast, the worth of individuals or groups was judged by the amount of MEST they owned. If aman had money, he was said to be worth so much money; if a group had control of property, itwas said to be worth so much control of property. However, this is a non-survival definition.Whereas every individual should be entitled, unconditionally, to whatever he can earn in asociety, since this is a blunt measure of his value to the society, and one should never make themistake of believing otherwise; and by means of inheritances and strange effects to whichmoney can lend itself it can become badly perverted as a yardstick. When it becomes perverted,men of money begin to be damned by a society and are sought out as the scapegoats for all itsills; whereas a goodly number of them are the very pivots on which the society is turning.Subversive political movements appeal to the indigence and poverty which is the lot,unfortunately, of a majority of populaces in these days of poorly advanced culture bypromising to murder every man of property once a land is taken. The whole cult of anti-Capitalism is something less than a sound philosophic postulate and rather more than a grossappeal to those who have no property and no hope of attaining any. As this philosophy has noconcept of any individual worth of whatever kind, and rather tends to operate on the maxim that“five morons make a genius,” it can afford to overlook any means of evaluating any humanbeing and would rather not do so, since its practice when entering a country is to corral andmurder every man of worth to that country and leave it pauperized as a race.In the handbook, an equation was written which caused people some puzzlement; it wasto the effect that potential value was equal to intelligence multiplied by the dynamics of theindividual to a certain power. This might be restated as meaning that the potential value of anyman was equal to some numerical factor, denoting his structural intelligence and capability,multiplied by his free theta to a power. This was written in the handbook in an effort toencourage some psychologist to discover what the power of the dynamic might be andconclude some means of establishing potential value by psychometry. Actual worth, then, ofthe individual would be his potential value as modified by the direction that potential value tookwith regard to the survival of his group or of himself. One might have an individual of veryhigh potential value who yet, by education and engrams, was a distinct liability to himself andhis group.In this column on the chart, anyone, regardless of his potential value, below the line of2.0 as evaluated by other columns, has a negative value to the society. Anyone above this linegoes in a positive direction.This whole scale is postulated on the fact that the brain and brawn of an individual servethe other dynamics. The remark has been made that social orders are carried upon the backs ofa few desperate men. If the social order were being carried forward toward higher levels ofculture by these few desperate men, they could be considered and, indeed, upon inspectionwould be found to lie well above the 2.0 level. When the desperation is expressed in terms ofdeath and destruction, the individual lies below this 2.0 level and, regardless of what hisactions are, will bring the society lower on the tone scale. The auditor’s main interest in thiscolumn lies, again, in the estimate of the preclear’s position upon it; and this column makes itpossible to estimate position by examining both the actual worth and the potential value of thepreclear in his environment. If the preclear normally injures -- makes enMEST out of -- thosethings which he seeks to control or which he owns, he can be said to lie below the 2.0 line; andif he is fairly successful in his use of MEST he lies above that line.83"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"This column is otherwise self-explanatory.As a member of his own social order, the auditor should take into account, whendeciding which of the people around him he will take as preclears, the actual worth of thosepeople to their family, group, and society. He will do well to spend his efforts upon those whoshow the highest promise, in terms of current activity while aberrated, even though these maynot be the easiest cases to work. While all men are created with equal rights under the law, anexamination of the individuals in the society rapidly demonstrates that all men are not createdwith equal potential value to their fellows.84"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE;COLUMN SEthic LevelThe whole subject of ethics is one which, with societies at their present low position onthe tone scale, has become almost lost.Ethics actually consist, as we can define them now in Dianetics, of rationality towardthe highest level of survival for the individual, the future race, the group, and mankind, and theother dynamics taken collectively. Ethics are reason. The highest ethic level would be long-term survival concepts with minimal destruction, along any of the dynamics. A reasonableexamination of this subject demonstrates immediately that dishonest conduct may serve, on ashort-term basis, the advantage of an individual or a group, but that a continuous line ofdishonest conduct will bring the individual or the group down the tone scale. Thus, dishonestconduct is non-survival. Anything which is unreasonable in the conduct of interrelationsamong men could be considered unethical, since those things which are unreasonable bringabout the destruction of individuals and groups and inhibit the future of the race. The keepingof one’s word, when it has been sacredly pledged, is an act of survival, since one is thentrusted, but only so long as one keeps one’s pledged word.To the weak, to the cowardly, to the reprehensively irrational, dishonesty andunderhanded dealings, the harming of others and the blighting of their hopes, seem to be theonly way of conducting life.Unethical conduct is actually the conduct of destruction and fear; lies are told becauseone is afraid of the consequences should one tell the truth; thus, the liar is inevitably a coward,the coward is inevitably a liar. The sexually promiscuous woman, the man who breaks faithwith his friend, the covetous pervert are all dealing in such non-survival terms that degradationand death commonly ensue. A “love” clandestinely conducted and based on lies which willbring harm to others denotes a cowardice low enough to bring nausea to any decent man.Thus, one has the ethical or unethical aspect of sex.In the modern dictionary we find that ethics are defined as “morals” and morals aredefined as “ethics.” These two words are not interchangeable. Morals should be defined as acode of good conduct laid down out of the experience of the race to serve as a uniformyardstick for the conduct of individuals and groups. Such a codification has its place; moralsare actually laws. The origin of a point in a moral code comes about when it is discovered,through experience, that some act is more nonsurvival than pro-survival. The prohibition ofthis act enters into the customs of the people and may eventually become a law. This is thenatural process of creation of all law. Morals are, to some degree, arbitraries, in that theycontinue beyond their time. This far from states that laws are bad, as uniformity and regulationare vital to the conduct of all groups, but only that laws become outmoded now and then andneed to be revised. Many things which were moral in the past were moral only because theywere hygienic; and, indeed, as has been said, all morals originate out of the discovery by thegroup that some act contains more pain than pleasure.In the absence of extended reasoning powers, moral codes so long as they providebetter survival for their group are a vital and necessary part of any culture. Morals, however,become onerous and protested against when they become outmoded; and a revolt againstmorals normally has as its target the fact that the code no longer is as applicable as it wasbefore; although revolts against moral codes actually occur because individuals of the group orthe group itself has sunk on the tone scale to a point where it wishes to practice license againstthese moral codes, not because the codes themselves are unreasonable.85"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":" If a moral code were thoroughly reasonable, it could, at the same time, be consideredthoroughly ethical, but only at this highest level could these two be called the same. Theta, inits action against MEST, is reason itself; and the ultimate in reason is the ultimate in survival. Inthe light of the above, the column on the chart is self-explanatory, but the additional commentshould be made that at the level of 2.0 and below, destructive arbitrariness, called for lack of abetter word “authoritarianism,” sets in; and that all laws made at this level, and on down thescale, will have non-survival results.Criminals lie in the band from 2.0 down the scale, as a generality; but most criminalsare found from about 1.3 downward. There is nothing very glamorous about the criminal, thebreaker of his pledge, the betrayer of his friend or group. Such people are simply psychotic.This does not say that individuals who lie potentially along tone bands from 2.0 down areactively criminal, chronically, or that they are actively unethical, chronically; but it does say thatduring periods of enturbulence they are unethical and immoral, and refrain from being so onlyin ratio to the amount of free theta they still have available. They normally enturbulate easilyand often, however, and while for days and weeks together they may appear to be rational,insofar as the current normal is concerned, they are a serious liability to any employer, mate,family, or group. Here again we have the condition of the acute psychotic state as opposed tothe chronic psychotic state; in the acute psychotic state the person becomes temporarily insanefor short periods; in the chronic state, he remains insane. If a person can enturbulate easilydown to a level below 2.0, and has not enough free theta to refrain from aberrated action, heshould not be given more freedom in the society than the chronic psychotic, since he is asthoroughly psychotic in his acute state of enturbulence as any constantly insane individual.Society, recognizing that the greatest danger from an individual lies in the band from angerdown to 1.1, has sought to safeguard itself by suppressing these people permanently into anapathy level; this control mechanism, however, is as unworkable as it is widespread, sinceindividuals in the apathy strata can rebound sporadically up into the active strata and so are stillthoroughly dangerous. The only answers would seem to be the permanent quarantine of suchpersons from society to avoid the contagion of their insanities and the general turbulence whichthey bring into any order, thus forcing it lower on the scale, or processing such person untilthey have attained a level on the tone scale which gives them value.In any event, any person from 2.0 down on the tone scale should not have, in anythinking society, any civil rights of any kind, because by abusing those rights he brings intobeing arduous and strenuous laws which are oppressive to those who need no such restraints.And particularly, none below 2.0, chronically or acutely, should be used as witnesses or jurorsin courts of law, since their position in regard to ethics is such as to nullify the validity of anytestimony they might essay or any verdict they might offer.This does not propose that depriving such persons of their civil rights should obtain anylonger than is necessary to bring them up the tone scale to a point where their ethics renderthem fit company for their fellows. This, however, would be a necessary step for any societyseeking to raise itself on the tone scale as a social order. A fundamental of law alreadyprovides for this step, since sanity, in law, is defined as the ability to tell right from wrong.The rational, and therefore, the ethical state of persons acutely or chronically below the point of2.0 is such that it is impossible for them to judge right from wrong. Thus, by bringingforward a simple definition not only of right and wrong but of ethics, the existing fundamentalcan be put into effect, should it happen, by chance, that anyone care whither our social order isdrifting. It is simpler to do psychometry on one-hundred and fifty million people than to bury aculture for which we and our fathers have striven these past hundred and seventy-five years.86"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO;COLUMN TThe Handling of TruthThe metaphysician was concerned with absolute truth and considered that it transcendedthe limits of human experience. The social orders of his day must have been not much betterthan our own.Truth is actually a relative quantity; it could be said to be the most reasonable existingdata about any body of facts. Truth, as a manifestation of human conduct, would be theholding or voicing of facts as one knows them and refusal to utter or hold statements contraryto what one knows.Creative and constructive imaginings about the future are not untruths but are postulatednew realities. Few mothers there are who do not have untruths and imaginative postulatesthoroughly confused, thus suppressing the necessary imaginative instincts of the child and, infact, burdening the child with a confusion about the truth itself.Truth may also be confused with tactlessness. A 2.0 will give forth numerous factualbut destructive statements. Many 1.1’s blatantly “pride themselves” on their “honesty,” and solicense themselves to make destructive statements “for the good of” somebody else which areactually lies. There is an ethic about the handling of truth. While it may be true that somethingis undesirable or that a person is bad, if it serves no good purpose to make the statement, theissuance of this “truth” is in reality the establishing of an entheta line. The highest concept oftruth, then, has a certain aesthetic about it, in that it is creative and constructive. In commonhuman experience we all know something about the truth and we know that we cannot deal in ablack and white breakdown between the truth and lies. Truth is concerned in the issuance andacceptance of data about facts. Some people favor constructive facts; some favor facts whichare not so constructive; some prefer to twist facts; some prefer to hide facts; and some prefer tolie about facts. Some favor high and powerful facts; and some favor only apathetic facts. Asone examines this whole subject, one then discovers that the tone scale itself from 4.0 down to0.0, postulates the selection of various types of facts; and that the most reasonable facts are themost constructive ones; and that, as one falls away down the tone scale, the facts selected areless and less rational and more and more contra-survival. It could be said that life was made tobe lived, not died out of; and that facts which encourage a high level of living would be, forman, the most truthful facts; and that those which encourage his demise would be the mostuntruthful facts. Those things which are truest for man are, then, those things which mostpowerfully aid his survival, in theta, life, and MEST.This column of the tone scale might also be considered the column of preference offacts. At 4.0 we would have a preference for creative and constructive facts. Around 3.0 wewould have a preference for conservative and less inspiring facts. At 2.5 we would have acarelessness of facts. At 2.0 we would have a preference for facts which were twisted wellaway from truth in order to serve antagonisms. At 1.5 we would have a preference fordestructive facts, twisting all true facts which were constructive so that they would becomedestructive facts. At 1.1 we would have a preference for artfully twisted facts which hid adesire to destroy. At 0.5 we would have a failure to select facts, to evaluate them one way orthe other, but a preference for hopeless facts. Below this level there would be no reaction.The auditor can locate his preclear on the tone scale simply by discovering the type offact which the preclear likes best, or by discovering what the preclear does with facts.The individual accepts or gives forth truth or untruth according to his position on thetone scale. If you know, from other columns, the probable position of the preclear on the tonescale, regardless of his convincingness or even his ability to”prove” what he is saying by rather87"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"artful “evidence,” you can correctly and properly evaluate the facts he gives you or the facts hewill receive. The rather horrible part of this is that it admits of no great variation. A man at 1.5deals in destructive facts and twists them so as to make them more effectively destructive; hisdata cannot be believed; and, indeed, any data from individuals at the 2.0 level or below hasdiscard value only.At 4.0, the individual has a high concept of truth and prefers constructive and creativetruths. He seeks for new truths.At 3.5, the individual is truthful but prefers not to deal in entheta facts.At 3.0 we begin to get an onset of conservatism, a cautiousness about receiving oruttering truths, and in our society a short-sighted programme of social lying in order to “avoidhurting people’s feelings.” One should, by the way, beware of placing in charge of anythingpeople who are “afraid of hurting other people,” for this is not a virtue but a form of cowardiceand propitiation and denotes a fear of people; people are not so easily hurt as such personsbelieve.At 2.5 we have insincerity and carelessness of facts. The modern American newspaperexemplifies this level on the tone scale.At 2.0 we get the first wilful twisting of facts to suit purposes, and here facts will betwisted to suit antagonisms the person holds.At 1.5 we achieve the ultimate reversal in facts; any white fact will be turned into ablack fact; here we have blatant and destructive lying. Did you ever hear an angry man tell thetruth?At 1.1, truth receives her severest drubbing; for here truth is confused, upset, used,twisted and hidden for fear somebody may make retaliation, until one understands that datafrom this level on the tone scale has only two purposes: to wreak the most harm upon others,and secure the greatest safety for self. Here we have lies used to hide lies amid the most franticprotestations of honesty and a noisy advertising campaign about the ethics of the speaker.Beneath the facade of honor, honesty, ethics, and “one’s sacred word” one is apt to find awrithing cesspool of vicious and malicious lies calculated to do the greatest possible damage.Early in the studies of the tone scale which resulted in this chart the lengths to which the 1.1would go in advertising his virtuous character, while performing his knife-in-the-back tricks,were not wholly understood. Because such persons said so often that they were honest andethical, it was, for a while, accepted that a person could be at a low level on the tone scale inother columns and still be able to tell the truth. Experience demonstrated that, whatever theadvertisement of honesty, the 1.1 is completely incapable of truth, but lies out of some horriblemechanical compulsion. Not one of the people for whom this allowance was made succeededin being worthy of it; but each was discovered to be so deeply enmeshed in chicanery, all thewhile appearing honest, that the depths to which aberration can suppress man were for the firsttime clearly understood. Bluntly anyone takes his life and his reputation in his hands when hebelieves a 1.1, no matter the evidence. In this band we have fantastically accomplished actors,who may weep and plead and decry with contempt and disdain, asserting their honesty andtheir sincerity, and demonstrating them with such consummate conviction that even the mostcritical observer may be unable to detect the slightest falsehood; and yet, in the 1.1, a deep andexhaustive inspection of motivations and goals reveals a snake pit of lies and insincerities, ofpretenses and unrealities. Such people can turn on tears and other emotions at will and use thelanguage of highest honor to serve the most despicable ends.At 0.5, we have no less dangerous but certainly more obvious levels of untruth. Just asfear drives the 1.1, grief drives the 0.5; and while the grief itself may be perfectly honest, thefacts and evaluations which it collects to itself certainly are not. Since here we have anindividual who is making a cry for help, supplications, pleas for pity, all facts stand magnified.The dead are found to be suddenly, utterly, without faults; the lover who abandoned the88"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"sweetheart is found to be a blackhearted villain. The 0.5 may be given sympathy, but notbelieved. People who are commonly in this band of the tone scale and are yet able to reasonsomewhat, to carry on some of the routine of life, are perilous to be around, since they demandenormous quantities of affection, and at the slightest rejection, fancied or real, dive in thedirection of death, perhaps only as a demonstration of how badly they need aid, but,nevertheless fatally. Such dives toward death inevitably affect others, since this individual hasno responsibility of any kind toward other human beings and is so thoroughly introverted thathowever pathetic he may appear he only absorbs and never responds. He is an ever-thirstysponge for sympathy, and he is a chronic potential suicide. The tendency toward death willcommunicate itself toward all the aspects of life around this individual; he will make enMESTout of any MEST; he will prefer sordid and squalid quarters; he will drive ancient and ricketycars; he will dress only in the most ragged clothes. All these things are pleas for pity. Whenaudited, this case, like the 1.1, commonly dubs in. The auditor must be particularly careful ofthe 0.5; not to run too much dub-in; not to give too much sympathy; not to give too littlesympathy; and not to make an error in auditing which will depress the preclear’s tone, since the0.5 has but a little distance to go to attempt death, either by sickness or by actual violent self-destruction. The 0.5 is near the end of the road and by contagion he much more markedlyenturbulates the free theta of those around him than does even the 1.1. or the 1.5.The validity of engrams run and the preclear’s concept of truths are in direct ratio. Theauditor can be guided thereby. But the auditor should never be critical of the facts the preclearbrings forth; he must only attempt adroitly to guide the preclear toward running the highestlevel of fact the preclear can attain. Cases which are very low on the tone scale achieve theirbest advance, not by running data, but by running off charge, through boil-offs, yawns, false-fouring, and other mechanical unburdening. The data the individual runs when below 2.0 maybe interesting but it is quite often untrue, and it is less and less true the lower the individualdrops on the scale.The lowest point on this scale for a life organism is, of course, pretended death; andhere is an untruth among untruths; for the organism is obviously alive and it is saying that it isdead. But the untruth is here modified by the fact that the organism requires but the slightestthrust to be dead in actuality.89"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE;COLUMN UCourage LevelCourage might be considered the theta force necessary to overcome obstacles insurviving.One has as a definition of happiness the process of overcoming not unknowableobstacles toward a known goal, or the momentary contemplation of the completed task. It canbe seen that this is a definition for happiness; and indeed this definition works. But courage isnecessary if the individual is to be happy. And so it works out on the tone scale; the more freetheta an individual has, in comparison to the theta he has enturbulated, the happier thatindividual can be, and the more courage he will demonstrate in his forward actions in life and inthe face of adversities.The courage level of an individual is actually a direct index of the free theta-enturbulatedtheta, or the theta-entheta, ratio of that individual. The courage level is also an index of thesafety with which one may associate with a person or a group. A person of high courage is avaluable associate and group member, but a coward is a dangerous liability as a friend.There is a strange mechanism in some men, an aberration of a decadent age, whichcauses them to seek out and help and protect the pitiful and weak amongst women. The reverseis sometimes found amongst women, a woman of strength seeking out and defending a weakand pitiful man. In either case, a failure is postulated at the beginning of such an association.However much the weak member may be raised on the tone scale by this association, theperson on the higher level is inevitably lowered. Indeed, when two people occupy differentpositions on the tone scale and yet are in association with each other, the person at the higherpoint on the scale will become somewhat enturbulated to a greater or lesser degree by theperson at the lower point on the scale; and the person at the lower point will becomeunenturbulated to a greater or lesser degree. People, then, who are low on the tone scaleinstinctively seek out people who are high on the tone scale; and if the people who are high onthe tone scale have any thought for their own survival and efficiency, they will take adequatesteps to understand the liability which they are incurring and to prevent themselves from beinglessened in substance by such an association.The auditor, in processing, is continually encountering entheta in any preclear. Thus itis necessary for the auditor, if he is doing constant processing, to keep himself adequatelyprocessed, elsewhere. Otherwise, the auditor will find himself coming down the tone scale in adwindling spiral, until he is at last unable to handle the entheta he is encountering in cases.Courage level has a great deal to do with auditing. The auditor who has a low couragelevel is apt to let the preclear get into such a thing as a fear or terror engram and, justifying theaction as sympathy, let the preclear out without having run the incident. This will most rapidlyand certainly snarl the case. The auditor of low courage level who encounters for the first timea “screamer” and who fails to persevere in the face of the obvious and shrill agony of thepreclear will make the preclear very sick. So far as courage level is concerned in auditing, anyauditor must have the courage to take anything from the preclear and run a preclear throughanything without quailing. A coward has no business in the auditor’s chair, and if he is soplaced, the preclear can expect to have his case ruined. In a later column on the chart you willsee the tone level required of the auditor in order to handle preclears; the data most pertinent tothis is courage level.There are three ways of handling a problem: one is to attack it, directly or indirectly; oneis to flee from it, directly or indirectly; and one is to neglect it. It is a matter of reason whichmethod the individual selects to handle which problem. Continuous attack, bluntly and90"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"directly, on a problem is not necessarily a courageous address but may only be an angry anddestructive address. A persistent address to the problem, however, requires courage since oneof the components of courage is duration of effort.At 4.0, we have the high courage level of free theta itself.At 3.5, we have courage displayed at reasonable risks.At 3.0, we have a conservative display of courage where the risk is small.At 2.5, we get neither courage nor cowardice but a definite neglect of danger.At 2.0, we have blunt, undisguised, unreasoning thrusts at danger.At 1.5, we get what would normally pass as “bravery,” as distinct from courage. Herewe have the hammering, destructive rush at danger. This often results in damage to self and tothe cause for which the person is fighting.At 1.1, we have reached fear, on the tone scale, and when the individual rises abovefear we have underhanded displays of action. If the individual is suddenly addressed bydanger, however, we have cowardice.At 0.5, we have complete cowardice, no attack upon any problem, no reason, and onlydefeat.In fighting, the best tactic is to strike such a sudden, unexpected and hard blow thatone’s enemy is instantly shot down the tone scale to apathy. Japan, receiving an atom bomb,descended instantly into apathy and surrendered. Hard but long drawn out blows or shocksharden resistance as in the bombing of London or Madrid. Shock and courage level areimmediately connected.91"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR;COLUMN VAbility To Handle ResponsibityThere is no more certain index of the theta-entheta ratio and of the free theta endowmentof an individual than the ability to undertake and execute responsibility. By responsibility ismeant the area or sphere of influence the individual can rationally affect around other people,life, MEST, and the general environment, as represented in column Q, Command overEnvironment. The emphasis should be placed on “rationally,” since engrams are perfectlycapable of placing a person in a manic state which causes him to believe he can handle a largersphere than his capabilities permit, but when this is the case the effect of the individual on thesphere of influence betrays the fact that an engram is acting, because the sphere of influencewill be affected destructively; this might have been called, in older terminology, a superioritycomplex.The word responsibility is seen, then, to have a finer definition. If it is to be used itmust include the shading that a truly responsible person works toward the survival of hisenvironment, which would include action along any and all of the dynamics, himself hischildren, his family, his group, mankind, life, MEST, theta, and the Supreme Being. Wherehe falls short in advancing and aiding the purposes of any of these dynamics he is falling shortof his responsibilities. The operation of free theta would be the complementing of itscomponent parts in others and in the remainder of the dynamics, since each individual has, asthe components parts of his own free theta, all of these dynamics. A high affinity level isnecessary, then, in any individual, by which is meant his partnership with the dynamics asexisting in others. Where the individual has had many affinity breaks with the other dynamics(and an engram is an affinity break between the theta universe and the MEST universe) theconcept of partnership reduces, and the individual is more and more concerned withresponsibilities which are nearer and nearer at hand, until he can barely be responsible forhimself. This narrowing of the sphere of responsibility is analogous to the descent down thetone scale. When the individual cannot be responsible for himself any of the time he is achronic psychotic and is institutionalized. When he cannot be responsible for himself exceptpart of the time he is an acute psychotic and passes in this society for normal.It is not the magnitude of the sphere of responsibility of the individual which shouldtake the auditor’s eye as he attempts to evaluate the individual on the tone scale, but it is thequality of responsibility along each of the dynamics. The fully responsible individual bearscertain definite marks which are unmistakable.On the first dynamic, he takes good care of himself; he gives a well-kept appearance inaccordance with his means and pursuits; his personal effects are tidy and in reasonably goodcondition. On the second dynamic, he attempts to give adequate support and assistance to hismate and to provide the future with a happy and successful new generation. He is loyal to andtakes good care of his family. On the third dynamic, he takes orderly care of his own affairs asrelated to his group and members of his group and seeks to increase the survival potential of hisfriends and group. On the fourth dynamic, he is concerned for the survival of man, within thelimits of his education.On the fifth dynamic, he demonstrates an affinity with other life forms. He will befound to engage himself, given opportunity, in raising plants or animals and will prefer to haveliving things in his vicinity. He will not be given to wanton destruction of life, but will use lifefor his own sustenance. The individual who will not kill for food he needs is actually on thepropitiation level of the tone scale, since it is a natural arrangement that higher forms of lifehave to support themselves by the ability of lower forms to translate sunlight and chemicals intothe food required by the higher forms.92"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"On the sixth dynamic, the individual will encompass MEST in ratio to his endowmentof free theta, his property will not have confused titles, the inanimate objects around him whichare meant to serve him will be in good repair, he will have an accurate idea of how much MESThe encompasses, in terms of matter, energy, space and time. He may or may not have someconsideration in the direction of theta, this depending upon his own advancement. He willordinarily be considered to have a reverence and respect for a Creator.As the individual drops down the tone scale, the orderliness in the various dynamicsdecreases. One by one his concept of affinity between himself and these dynamics decreases;and so decreases his responsibility in the fields of these dynamics. At 4.0, we have an inherentsense of responsibility on all dynamics, and a care for the entities on those dynamics.At tone 3.5, the individual is capable of assuming and carrying on responsibilities alongthe various dynamics but may show some short-sightedness of responsibility along one ormore of them.At tone 3.0, the ability to handle responsibility along the various dynamics hasdecreased markedly, but responsibility is demonstrated, if in a slipshod fashion. Above thislevel the individual will execute orders given to him in as reasonable a fashion as possible, butat this level the individual accepts and executes orders only if they are enforced by blunt threatsof punishment which are unmistakable. However, at this level, one or more of the dynamicsmay remain quite free, and responsibility may be full along this dynamic. At tone 2.5, theindividual is very careless and not trustworthy, although one may find that the individual takesgood care of himself so far as his dress is concerned. He falls markedly short in his concept ofwhat is required of him in order to maintain a high survival level. The manifestation of thislevel is only that of carelessness, however, and not that of revolt, as it is on the lower levels. Attone 2.0, we find the individual not executing responsibility for its own sake but assumingresponsibility only when self or group interest can be served. We have the individual executingresponsibility not reasonably toward creativeness and construction, but exercisingresponsibility on a punishment drive basis. The individual orders things to be done inthreatening tones.At 1.5, we have the individual assuming responsibility much more often and morewidely than he can possibly manage, in order to bring about destruction along the dynamics.He will play one dynamic against another. He may talk as if he is saving something or givevery preservative motives for his actions, but no matter what he does the end result will bedestruction. This is a phenomenon which has been too little understood in the past. Here is thedeath-talker who is going to save something from destruction by creating great havoc. Thisperson will not listen to a creative and constructive plan unless he can see ways and means ofusing it to destroy. Warmongers and dictators are markedly in this band, but one finds 1.5’s inall business organizations. When the amount of theta with which an individual is endowed ishigh, and when more of that theta is enturbulated than remains unenturbulated (according to the0.0 to 4.0 ratio, the midpoint of fifty percent enturbulated theta and fifty percent unenturbulatedtheta being at 2.0) the thought and action of the individual begins to partake of the nature ofMEST force. He will use MEST force for hammer-like actions and blasts of destruction. Hewill oppose reason with MEST force. Such an individual assumes responsibility for thepurpose of destruction by giving out dour and terrible news. Even though he has good news togive forth he will not give it, but prefers to broadcast tidings of alarm and death. His is theassertion that all is about to be destroyed and that destruction alone can prevent destructionfrom taking place. Unfortunately, it is all too often true that suppressors to a creative actionmust be removed before construction and creation takes place. Any person very high on thetone scale may level destruction toward a suppressor. The individual at 1.5, however, does notadd any creation or construction into his computation except as a pretence, to trump up furtherpower to destroy. The rather horrible thing about this particular band is that it is above thecurrent band of civilized societies around the world; and societies will not be led bygovernments more than half a point above the general social tone.93"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"At 1.1, the attitude towards responsibility is capriciousness. The individual isirresponsible and incapable. The responsibilities assumed by a 1.1 are surface manifestationsonly. The individual may seem to be carrying out a programme and may seem to be useful, butthe end results of all these programmes and responsibilities will be disastrous, since underneaththis veneer so many cross-currents and cabals exist that chaos will result. A 1.1 with asuperiority engram which demands that he take responsibility may make an excellent show andbe very convincing, but the show he is making and the conviction he seeks to implant in othersare not the things intended, and a glance below the surface will discover an entirely differentprogramme aimed solely toward malicious destruction.At 0.8 - 0.5, to talk of anything like responsibility is nonsense unless one begins tochange the direction of responsibility. From 2.0 down the individual seems to have a“responsibility” toward death. It is a duty, we might say, for persons from 2.0 down to causedeath, failures or disaster or to die. And it is an additional “responsibility” to mask this “duty”with apparent constructive goals or merely denial of that “duty.” The “minions of the Devil”and the “Devil and his dark angels” are descriptions of persons engaged on 2.0-down activity.The concept of sin as destructive practice containing more pain than pleasure stems fromobservations of the activity of low-tone persons. How real these concepts become to one whois himself enmeshed with another who is responsible to death and not to life. Death is such ablunt, if hidden, taskmaster!94"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE;COLUMN WPersistence On A Given CourseAnother index which the auditor can use to place his preclear on the chart is thepersistence of the preclear along any given course of action toward a goal.It has been advanced that there are two kinds of individuals, so far as persistence isconcerned. The individual who has sufficient theta endowment and sufficient structural abilityto keep his free theta and his enturbulated theta relatively separate may have a good persistencelevel even when the factors and conditions in his environment are such that they continuallyhammer him away from his given course of action. The other type would be the person who isknocked by life from one course to another and who will persist on any given course only solong as no new factor introduces itself. This is characteristic of the potential psychotic. Thepersistent individual keeps going toward his goal; he may go slower and slower, and he maydie en route, but he does not deviate. The potential psychotic, on the other hand, is not veryapt to have a goal in the first place but is apt to follow any course which comes into view, andthen only so long as no environmental factor enters to make him deviate from that course.One must recognize that the exterior world of the environment, in its action on theindividual, and the interior world of the inmost obsessive engrams are working on the same “I”and that if the individual is not deviating very markedly on his course toward his goal evenwhen confronted by heavy environmental factors which seek to move him in other directions,neither is he reacting heavily to his engrams, in proportion to the severe reactions he mightmanifest were he less persistent. An individual may be known by his persistence; but thisindex is not a sharply defined one, since there are, evidently, two types of personalities, ingeneral, or one might even say, two types of mental structure.The persistent individual who normally carries forward toward his goal despiteenvironmental suppressors and deviators, in the absence of processing and during the normalcourse of life because of the dwindling spiral will drop down the tone scale. More of his freetheta will become enturbulated and the balance will gradually shift until, most likely, there is farmore enturbulated theta than free theta. The persistence of this individual may continue, but themethods he uses to gain his goal will match the various points on the tone scale on the waydown. The individual may begin with a highly enthusiastic thrust and may through experiencebecome less active and open about his creative and constructive efforts and may assumeconservatism and caution. He may enter a stratum where he is bored with the goal and maydawdle on his way toward it. Lower than this he becomes antagonistic toward factors whichdo not permit him to reach his goal. Below this he becomes angry and destructive towardsuppressors, and although he is still apparently going toward his goal, the majority of his timeis absorbed in combating suppressors. Losing here and there in his battles, his tone will drop,and he will become more and more covert, even to the point of pretending that he is not anylonger persisting toward his goal, while at the same time continuing to do so. Only when hereaches the level of apathy will he give up. When a man has been defeated too often, and toomany of his dreams have been broken, he sinks into the apathy band and thereafter no longerstruggles toward his goal. Truly enough, he dies with the last of his dreams.The individual who has a low theta endowment and seems structurally incapable ofconcentration when at a low point on the tone scale, may yet increase his persistence to thepoint where he can win the minor goals of life with great ease when he has been released orcleared.It is an observed fact that an individual’s attitude toward Dianetics and an individual’sattitude toward life in general are parallel. When the auditor takes a preclear who is at theapathy level, all too common in this present social order, he can expect the preclear to depend95"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"exclusively on the auditor for any persistence as to the processing of the case. The auditormust take the responsibility of doing the processing. As the preclear comes higher on the tonescale and reaches 1.1, the auditor can expect the preclear to propitiate him by giving himpresents or being very flattering. Ordinarily, however, the preclear is operating on mechanismswhich tell him he is not supposed to go anywhere or get well, and the auditor must be evenmore persistent, since the only persistence toward the goal of getting well or cleared will still befrom the auditor, regardless of what the preclear is saying. Women, by the way, reaching thislevel of the tone scale, may propitiate by offering sex and are very easy to seduce. An auditorwho is a wise auditor will steadfastly refuse sexual relations with a preclear. The auditor whoyields to temptation at this level finds himself in a bad situation because his preclear is on theway up and will shortly pass this propitiative level and achieve more honorable levels of thetone scale. Auditors who, knowing this, permit themselves such actions are themselves at the1.1 level and have no business auditing. None but a despicable cur would seek to benefit fromthis phenomenon; none but a chronic or acute psychotic would find enjoyment in it. Theperson who does this, by the way, usually stops or discourages all processing beyond thispoint, realizing that as the tone of the preclear rises some honesty will come into the preclear’sreasoning. When you spot the sudden cessation of auditing, the barring of a person fromauditing or a refusal to audit, you can be certain that the person responsible for this cessation ofauditing or the refusal to permit or encourage it has a selfish profit to make or is hidingsomething. A person like this is such a menace to himself and to others around him thatauditing is much too good for him; he should be shot.Every case has to get angry before it can get well. The auditor must never discourage acase when it begins to breathe fire and destruction towards its enemies. It is quite common fora preclear to go through a phase of desiring murder or sudden death for both parents for whatthey have done. The auditor who discourages this anger is inhibiting the ability of the case toget well. This phase will pass; and the auditor should take care, during it, to prevent thepreclear from making overt acts against his enemies for which he will have to apologize a fewweeks later when the anger phase has gone away. Nevertheless, the anger phase must beencouraged. The hypnotist who implants suggestions to the effect that one must treat one’sfellow man kindly is actually driving his client down toward apathy.Rising on the scale, at 2.5 the preclear finds it difficult to concentrate on the force andfury of engrams and is liable to be slack in persisting on his case. He is apt to be too busyabout other things. This is a difficult period in any case; but there is so much to be gainedabove it that somehow the preclear must be raised even higher on the tone scale. There is onlyone way to do this: not by suppressing the preclear back into anger, but simply by gettingenough locks and other brica-brac off the case to bring the preclear up to 3.0.At 3.0, for the first time the preclear will begin to demonstrate self-determinism. Self-determinism should never be confused with refusal to cooperate or wilfulness in nonsurvivaldirections. At 3.0 the preclear is willing to proceed in the most orderly possible fashion towarda thorough and complete swamp-up of his case. At 3.5, the persistence of the preclear is such,ordinarily, that he begins to knock out engrams in chains.At 4.0, the persistence of the individual will be the persistence with which he is nativelyendowed; all the theta that he possesses will be free.As a word of caution, authoritarian auditing, rather than affinity auditing, will notproduce any marked rises on the tone scale even though many incidents be run, since thehammering auditing itself keeps the preclear so thoroughly enturbulated that free theta is notable to manifest itself. The preclear must always be coaxed through affinity, communication,and reality into being processed. This is the reason why auditors who are low on the tone scaledo not achieve good results; their very position on the tone scale demands that they use forcefulmethods, apathetic methods, or spurious methods.96"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX ;COLUMN XLiteralness With Which Statements Or Remarks Are ReceivedIt is an aspect of theta that the more it is enturbulated the easier it is to enter enturbulenceinto it.The highest level of reasoning is complete differentiation. The lowest level ofreasoning is complete inability to differentiate; which is to say, identification. On the highestlevels, the individual can understand that the thing is not its name, and that objects are similar toeach other but never equal to each other. In the reactive levels, from 2.0 down, the individualmore and more identifies, until finally all things are the same thing, and this is completeinability to rationalize. Rationalization is, in essence, differentiation; reacting is, in essence,identification. The literalness with which the person receives statements is an index of theamount of enturbulence in the case.At 4.0, we have high differentiation, good understanding of all communications, asmodified by the clear’s education.At 3.5, we have a good grasp of statements made and a good sense of humor -asense of humor depending, to a large degree, upon the individual’s ability todifferentiate and to see and reject situations which do not fit.At 3.0, we still have good differentiation of the meaning of statements made, but hereorders have to be explained a little more carefully, since less reason is going to be applied tothem.At 2.5, the individual accepts very little, literally or other wise. The sense of humor ofthis individual is liable to be very literal, dealing to a large extent in puns rather than insituations.At 2.0, there is no sense of humor that one could call a sense of humor, but there islaughter over the misfortune of others, which is a demonstration of antagonism. Thisindividual will accept remarks which are antagonistic remarks literally; but he will rejectremarks which are lower on the tone scale and be able to differentiate on those remarks. Hedoes not pay much attention to remarks higher on the tone scale, and if remarks are made tohim from persons higher on the tone scale he is apt to interpret them into antagonism, if theycan literally be so construed.At 1.5, the individual accepts alarming remarks literally, and when statements on highertone levels are made he will alter these statements to his own understanding so that they arealarming or destructive. The sense of humor, again if it can be called such, of individuals at1.5 consists of laughter at very painful misfortunes.At 1.1, we have a lack of acceptance of any remark. The individual is likely to seem tohave difficulty in hearing; he corrects remarks made to him; he is very concerned sometimesabout the rightness of words in remarks. The sense of humor at this level is forced, tocounteract the tendency to accept remarks literally.Here is a continual nervous necessity to reject almost any remark for fear that it willregister literally and be a command, hence anxiety or fear of conversation of a serious nature.Rather underhanded efforts are made at this level to knock apart serious statements or plansfrom higher levels on the tone scale. At 0.5, we have an individual who literally accepts anyremark which matches his tone, and ignores remarks of any other tone. Apathy statements97"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"made to this individual have the force of hypnotic suggestions. Anything at all which is said toa person at the 0.1 level is recorded directly in the lowest strata of the reactive mind.98"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN ;COLUMN YMethod Used By Subject To Handle OthersThe means used by the preclear to control or live with the people around him make aneasy and accurate index of the preclear’s position on the tone scale. This is, unfortunatelyenough, a precision column. No matter the guise used on the lower level of the tone scale,observation indicates that individuals at these levels use these methods uniformly, to theconsiderable harm and detriment of their families, friends, associates, and the entire socialorder. If any column on this tone scale chart should carry more emphasis than the others fromthe standpoint of human behavior, this column would be so marked.The auditor can expect to be treated by the preclear according to the preclear’s positionon the chart.The methods of handling others could be assigned to three general categories. Thehighest category would be one of enhancement, where the individual seeks by example andgood reasoning to lift the level of those around him to the point where they will partake of theprojects of living with him. This would extend from 4.0 down to 3.0. The second categorywould be that of punishment drive, or domination. Here the individual uses alarm, threats, andthe general promise of pain unless compliance is given by the others around him. This areaextends from 2.0 to around 1.3. The third category is that of nullification, wherein theindividual seeks to minimize individuals, to be more than they and so to be able to controlthem. This category would rather see a man sick than well, because sick men are lessdangerous than well men according to the “thinking” that takes place in this band.The unfortunate part of the conduct of the lower levels of the tone scale toward others isthat it has as its invariable end the lowering of the tone of the family, associates, friends, andsociety of the subject. Yet the subject by no reason or education below the point of 2.0 coulduse any other means Forcing the subject to use other means only drives him down the tonescale, and as he descends he uses the means of the lower levels to which he sinks.Here we have the dwindling spiral at work upon the environment of the subject andupon the subject’s associates, friends, and social order. It is not danger by violence from thelow-toned individual about which the social order or the family should worry; it is thisinsidious adoption of domination and nullification methods. This enturbulates the theta of theindividuals in the subject’s environment and brings them down the tone scale gradually, hardlynoticeably but nevertheless inevitably.From 2.0 down, the individual uses a great deal of justification. He has to explain hisacts, since the social order normally questions the rationality of many of these acts.A 3.5 operating in good order may be offering nothing but good to a 1.5 in his vicinity.The 3.5 will yet find himself the target of anger which has no cause in the conduct of the 3.5but is simply emanating from the 1.5 position of the other on the tone scale. The 1.5 would actthis way toward the 3.5 regardless of anything the 3.5 might do.The 3.5 in the vicinity of a 1.1 may find himself descending down the tone scale towardanger without any apparent reason. The 1.1’s efforts to nullify are so well veiled and socarefully calculated to annoy that no target is available to the reason of the 3.5. As reason fails,the 3.5, continually subjected to nullification which he cannot locate, will eventually becomeangry. The 1.1’s reply to this anger will not be a return argument or anger, but an apparentcontinuation of the status quo, while at the same time he does everything possible which canstill remain veiled and hidden to reduce and nullify the 3.5. These hidden efforts will becomestronger and stronger until nullification or destruction takes place. Or the 1.1, quailing before99"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"the anger, will drop into apathy and so use every ally available anywhere who can be coaxed ordeceived into supporting the 1.1’s efforts to destroy the 3.5. The reasonable man quiteordinarily overlooks the fact that people from 2.0 down have no traffic with reason and cannotbe reasoned with as one would reason with a 3.0. There are only two answers for the handlingof people from 2.0 down on the tone scale, neither one of which has anything to do withreasoning with them or listening to their justification of their acts. The first is to raise them onthe tone scale by un-enturbulating some of their theta by any one of the three valid processes.The other is to dispose of them quietly and without sorrow. Adders are safe bedmatescompared to people on the lower bands of the tone scale. Not all the beauty nor thehandsomeness nor artificial social value nor property can atone for the vicious damage suchpeople do to sane men and women. The sudden and abrupt deletion of all individualsoccupying the lower bands of the tone scale from the social order would result in an almostinstant rise in the cultural tone and would interrupt the dwindling spiral into which any societymay have entered. It is not necessary to produce a world of clears in order to have a reasonableand worthwhile social order; it is only necessary to delete those individuals who range from 2.0down, either by processing them enough to get their tone level above the 2.0 line -- a taskwhich, indeed, is not very great, since the amount of processing in many cases might be underfifty hours, although it might also in others be in excess of two hundred -- or simplyquarantining them from the society. A Venezuelan dictator once decided to stop leprosy. Hesaw that most lepers in his country were also beggars. By the simple expedient of collectingand destroying all the beggars in Venezuela an end was put to leprosy in that country. Themethods used by individuals on various levels of the tone scale in order to live with theirfellows are as follows:At 4.0, the individual uses enthusiasm, serenity, confidence, and his personal force toinspire those around him to reach up to a constructive level of action. Indeed, the presence of a4.0, or above if the theta endowment of the individual is high, unenturbulates an area.The 3.5 begins to employ communication and reasoning in order to invite theparticipation of others but still believes in bringing people up to a level where they will workwith him.At 3.0 we have the level where conservatism begins to enter the reasoning and wherepersuasion and social graces begin to be employed to invite the participation of others. Safety,security, and somewhat better survival conditions are the arguments used along this level of thetone scale. At 2.5, the individual is relatively careless of the participation of others in hisprojects.At 2.0 we begin to enter the domination band, which extends downwards to about 1.2.Here theta force can be seen to be distinguishable from MEST force. Theta force is reason; andMEST force is simply that -- force. Here we have efforts to hammer and pound and dominateby physical strength, threats, anger and promises of vengeance. Here compliance iscommanded, and lack of compliance is stated to mean death. Here we have emergencies beingmore important than constructive planning. Here we have all manner of undesirable thingswhich, indeed, seem to be the primary business of men and nations today.Nullification actually begins with domination but becomes very pronounced at about1.3. A 2.0 might demand of another that he demonstrate enough “guts” to carry forward aproject, but from 1.3 down, the modus operandi is any and every effort to convince anotherhuman being “for his own good” or “for the good of others” that he has neither the force norstrength to be dangerous. By rendering the individual undangerous, these levels seek todominate him with the pitiful strength which still remains to the 1.3 and down. The 1.2 anddown is most comfortable around sick people, around people who are in apathy, since hemistakenly believes these people not to be dangerous because they are obviously weak. This isso far from good reasoning that the results are catastrophic -- but little if any reasoning is donefrom 2.0 down. In its stead are excuses and justifications.100"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Here in a social culture from 1.2 down is the welfare state at its worst, the creation ofindigence in the populace to make it easier to control, the nullification of strong individuals inthe society, the removal of all constructive persons, and the preservation of the idle, thehopeless, the helpless and the weak. This is actually a social or an individual mechanism toaccelerate death. The 1.1 wife who has a strong and able husband keeps on living so long as hekeeps breathing the force of life into her. At her position on the tone scale, her direction istoward death. Every action she takes, regardless of its surface manifestations, will tend towardnullification of any life source in her vicinity. Every conceivable mechanism is used in this areaof the tone scale to make nullifications of others seem valid, to make them stick. Here we haveraillery against people who refuse to accept criticism “for their own good.” Here we havepainstaking efforts to “better people” by showing them their faults. Here we have attempts to“educate” people into adjusting themselves to their environment -- in other words, to stop beingvital and active and go somewhere and lie down, where they will be no menace. Here we haveconfusions introduced into any situation which are given the most adequate “reasons” andwhich are yet only nullifications.From 2.0 down to 1.2, efforts to change people or dominate them are recognizable assuch. From 1.2 down, all forthrightness vanishes, and the most devious and insidious andcomplex methods are employed to nullify. The individual in this area of the tone scale veryoften has a complete belief in his or her superiority, which is a justification for using themethods he uses. Such people commonly fasten themselves on strong personalities well up thetone scale and then continue to assert their superiority without ever giving, of course, anydemonstration that the superiority exists, until the higher level becomes nullified. Theindividual in this area seeks death not only for himself and his own projects but also for hisentire environment. At this level we have murder, by slow erosion, of individuals and theculture, each harmful action being masked with voluminous “reasoning.” Here is the snake pitof human behavior, and from this area comes the venom which will gradually destroy anyindividual or culture. Heretofore, people in this area have not been seen to be dangerous, andthe word “psychotic” has been used to designate only those who were helpless or overtlydestructive. However, this area never becomes overtly destructive, tending if anything towardsuicide and rarely toward murder, save on a long-term basis of murder of the personality or theprojects of others. Yet this area of the tone scale is far more dangerous than any other.Here we have perversion of anything and everything, so that the surface manifestationwill never match the undercover purposes. In sex we have no facing of the purpose and use ofsex as something to be enjoyed and for the creation of children, but we have all manner ofanxieties and irregular practices which do anything but tend toward the creation of children.And though we may have in such a person a hectic obsession with the performance of the actand an avowed interest and enjoyment in the act, we have actually no enjoyment of it. Sexualefforts tend not towards enjoyment but toward the pollution and derangement of sex itself so asto make it as repulsive as possible to others and so to inhibit procreation. Here is thepromiscuous woman, the inconstant lover, the pervert and the sadist. With a great deal ofadvertisement about sex there is only an effort to destroy sex. In this area of the scale we haveavowal by the individual at times that sex is free and must be enjoyed, and a continuous streamof accusation toward others that they believe sex to be a hideous thing and that their attitudemust be reformed. Sex is stained and soiled under the guise of being protected. Here we mayhave an advertisement as to the proper attitude toward children, and strange practicesconcerning children.In handling people around them, persons in the 1.2-down bracket deal in reversals offact. One can take it as a rule of thumb which is too often workable to be ignored that whateverthis person says he is doing, he is actually doing something else. Whatever this person says istrue, is actually false. Whatever this person says is false is actually true. Making allowance forthe fact that much of such a person’s conversation is without purpose, one can beware of thiscontrariness between manifestations and actual purpose.In keeping with the avoidance of any surface statement of what is actually goingforward, we have here the hypnotist. The hypnotist normally ranges from around 1.8, where101"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"he uses it as straight dominance, to around 0.6, where apathy has become strong enough toprevent active efforts to dominate or nullify others. Hypnotism never has and never will raisean individual on the tone scale. A manic hypnotic suggestion making one feel that he feelsbetter and is better could be implanted. But the act of hypnotism actually enturbulates the freetheta and it can be easily shown by tests that a manic implantation leaves the individual less ablethan he was before, regardless of its content. Hypnotism is the entering of the hypnotist’spersonality and desires below the choice level of the individual. It is non-survival save onlywhen used as a temporary anaesthesia for an operation and picked up and run out in processingimmediately after the individual is well -- not to pick it up would be equivalent to continuing ageneral anaesthetic forever after the operation. Civilized cultures of today are unaware of thewidespread use of hypnotism. It is the favorite tool of the pervert and the sexually deranged.An individual at this level of the tone scale may very well have the permission of a partner forthe sex act but will actually prefer to accomplish the act in an undercover fashion, as providedby hypnotism. Hypnotism is used in some base religions, and is commonly employed inobsolete mental “therapies,” which should make plain the level of those on the tone scale.When a “therapy” on this level of the tone scale (1.3 to 0.6) is employed it is only torender the individual under treatment more tractable, less “liable to be harmful to others,” and towreck self-determinism in the individual. This is the exact reverse of what it takes to makepeople well and sane. Empirical evidence should have demonstrated long since that suchmethods do not work, but this level of the tone scale is not much given to reasoning. Here isthe pre-frontal lobotomy, the trans-orbital leucotomy, electric shock, insulin shock, directivetherapies, and all the rest of the unworkable claptrap with which modern civilization has beenvictimized. True enough, an individual by such methods can be made less dangerous to hisfellow men and easier to handle, since he is made into more MEST and less theta. But it isequally true that this treatment decreases, often permanently, any ability of the patient to be ofservice to his society.The processing methods which raise a person on the tone scale are so very simple toapply that one wonders, or perhaps does not wonder, at the continued insistence on destructive“therapies” in institutions. These institutions often use sedatives, and yet one of the worstthings that an individual who is in a disturbed state can be given is a sedative; it makes himquieter and less dangerous but it also makes him less able. Furthermore, an individual undersedation receives sounds and sights in his environment as positive suggestions and therefore iscontinually receiving new locks and more enturbulence, although it may appear momentarilythat his condition is better. A preclear must never be audited under sedation. This is a stronginjunction, since preclears audited under sedation or under the influence of alcohol becomeworse, and a psychotic treated when he is under such influence (as in narcosynthesis) may verywell have all of his free theta enturbulated and so be sent into a “permanent” break. The auditorshould be very careful when working with anyone to ascertain whether or not that person istaking any drugs, since medical doctors will very often issue sedatives to patients withouttelling the patient that he is taking a sedative.Sedatives have been around for many thousands of years. They have certain uses, inlight doses, but such uses are extremely temporary in duration. Continuous application ofsedatives to an individual, as they make him more suggestible -- make it easier for him toreceive locks -- wreaks considerable harm upon his mind. This, however, can be remediedunless it has gone to a point of no return.Politically, the area of 2.0 to 1.4 is the area of fascism. where dominance of others iscontinually preached, where safety and safeguarding are continually stressed and wheredestruction and threats of punishment are used to force others.From 1.3 down to 0.6 we have the general area of the subversive, who promises apeople freedom and equality and gives them a slaughter of their best minds and culturalinstitutions, to the end of a totalitarian dominance. Because subversion exists in this tone band,the subversive leader can use as his personnel only people in this tone band; if this tone bandwere to be removed from a society he would have no recruits. To such people the perfidious102"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"and twisted practices of subversion have an enormous appeal. It gives them the “right” topractice Free Love and general promiscuity and, by destroying the Church and otherinstitutions or by holding these as nothing, sets them above any necessity to conform to anexisting social order. Thus the recruit is exhilarated by having a new justification for doing ona wide scale what he has been doing on a narrow scale, nullifying by hidden and insidiousmeans all the strong and the orderly in the environment. In any relatively low-toned socialorder the idea of having the right to do hidden and vicious things for a “glorious cause” is soattractive to persons in this area that they automatically support this political idiocy. As reasonis absent in this area of the tone scale it never occurs to these recruits that the most zealousamongst them will be the first to go down under firing squads, since even a totalitarian regime,in attempting to run any kind of a state, must compel severe conformity to its own “codes” nomatter how depraved these “codes” might be; and the recruit in the land which was about to beconquered was selected because of non-conformity. Thus, immediately after a completetotalitarian conquest of a country we invariably witness an extensive slaughter of individuals.One can select with ease the individuals marked for liquidation in the consolidation of theconquest. The selection is not made according to the position the individual occupies but by hisindividualism, his strength, and his reasonableness, or by his continuing revolutionary desirenot to conform to set and regimented patterns. A considerable percentage of the peopleslaughtered in any new conquest consists of the agents and tools used by the conqueror tosoften up the country before the conquest took place. The morbid fear of any totalitarianregime is counter-revolution, because they best of all understand how perfidious revolution canbe. The 1.1 may take a 1.1 as a bedfellow and political mate and may form a 1.1 group, butthis group has to continue to be faced by a strong and dangerous foe to remain consolidated.This is the condition of a subversive cell. These people continue in association with each otheronly so long as they are in the presence of and are busy undermining a worthy opponent.Because a 1.1 will act in handling people only as a 1.1, however, the cell, once the pressure istaken off it, devours itself.If the auditor is processing anyone known to have been in continual association with a1.1, he can readily and rapidly assemble the pattern of aberration of this unlucky preclear, sinceit will consist of the surface display by the 1.1 that all was being done for the preclear’s goodand a continual and insidious underhanded campaign to hit the preclear at his weakest points.The apathy band of the tone scale is only less dangerous to the social order than the 1.1.The apathy band has a definite procedure for handling people and the environment. Apathy isattempting to tend toward death; here is the suicide. And the apathy case will actuallythoroughly enturbulate those around him in an effort to cause death along the other dynamics.There was once a whole political philosophy about apathy, Zeno’s Apatheia, which wasembraced in the last death throes of the Roman Empire. The apathy case will try to discourageanyone from doing anything. Hopes and dreams are destroyed merely by claiming that they arehopeless and impossible. It has been fashionable to “feel sorry” for individuals on this band ofthe tone scale. This is exactly what this band of the tone scale demands of associates in theenvironment. Here we have cries for pity, supplication, and any and every means to gainsympathy. These are actually enturbulative mechanisms rather than real requests for help. Theentheta of the apathy level does not want to be helped but merely wishes to enturbulate furtherand to die, causing at the same time as much death as possible in the environment. Nearly anyhuman being confronted with the loss of a friend or loved one dives momentarily into the grieflevel, and the acute state of apathy is thus seen commonly, if sporadically, in the society. Thisstate can be easily remedied by processing when it is a momentary, environmentalrestimulation. The chronic apathy case is a different matter and is intensely dangerous to theenvironment. It is fashionable to feel sorry for the apathy case, and yet the apathy case neverfeels sorry for anyone. Despite all the tears and moaning, the apathy case, on a substratum isquite cunning and attempts to produce through tears the maximum enturbulation possible. The1.1 will twist past experiences in the telling, reporting cruelty where there was only abruptness.The apathy case will declare all past kindnesses to have been the most sadistic cruelties and thecruelties to have been kindnesses. Facts are not simply distorted by an apathy case; they arereversed. By reversing all visible evidence and declaring everything to be the exact opposite ofthe reality, maximal enturbulation can be produced. The apathy case, by insisting that every103"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"white is black, so tries the reason of others in his vicinity that they, lost in this confusion, alsobecome apathetic, since there seems to be no possible method of reasoning.Apathy is more than hopelessness: it is death in a very forthright form. The apathy casetalks about death, threatens personal death, and will actually attempt suicide. There is notenough courage on this level usually to attempt openly the death of others, but by enturbulationthe apathy case can effect this and will do so if not understood. The apathy case quitecommonly sets an example of death by fake suicide in a vague effort to be mimicked by anotherand so bring about another’s death. The apathy case that is threatening suicide, however,cannot be disregarded, since a sudden enturbulence may actually bring about an attempt. Here,the command over the environment is recognized by the apathy case to be limited to theindividual’s possessions and body alone. We get various types of neglect of possessionswhich quietly and undramatically lead to their destruction. Here we get neglect of the feelingsof other people and their concerns. Here we have neglect of person (self) which may,dramatically or undramatically, tend toward the destruction of person. The apathy case is soreversed on reality that he will declare things, which are normally ugly and horrible, to bebeautiful, and things which are beautiful to be ugly and horrible. An insidiousness is present atabout 0.7 wherein the apathy case seems to support beautiful things and art but in sosupporting them spoils them for others in the environment. There is a gruesome obscenity inthe admiration such people give to beauties in life.Below 0.7 there is not enough activity to lend active support for any purpose save theattainment of death for self and others. Valuable objects, assets, and projects are inconsiderable peril in the vicinity of an apathy case even though the apathy case may not seem tobe very active. It is this inactivity which is deceptive. A slight surge in tone can cause anapathy case to despoil anything in the vicinity which is normally considered survival. Apathycases have destroyed great works of art, organizations and individuals for the most speciousand spurious reasons. The apathy case is so self-centred that it is very difficult for the auditorto gain any cooperation. Indeed, every effort the auditor makes to invite hopefulness will berejected. It will not be so thoroughly rejected that the auditor is rebuffed, but will be met withnew reasons why the auditor should feel sorry for the apathy case. Most of these reasons areoutright lies, and the apathy case commonly runs floods of dub-in as well as spurious tears.Auditors, and indeed a society, not understanding the true motives of apathy are placed inconsiderable peril since a natural desire exists in the higher levels of the tone scale to aid andsupport one s fellows. The apathy case is actually perverting and destroying this desire byinviting it toward unworthy causes. This is a death action intended to destroy the mechanismof cooperation. The self-centredness of the apathy case is appalling to any reasonable beingonce he examines it. A great deal of the conduct of the apathy case is, knowingly unknowingly,pretence or act. At the 0.6 level, one may even occasionally catch an apathy case peeringhawk-like but covertly from under the veil of tears to be sure that the show is still receiving theattention of the audience.Much experience with apathy teaches the auditor that there is nothing very noble aboutgrief or apathy. The actual grief should be run out of a case as soon as possible. But when heis auditing an apathy case the auditor will find himself running a great deal of specious incidentall of which contains grief. The invitation for sympathy knows no bounds. The demands forpity will become, even to the most patient, trying beyond endurance. Although one may at firstfeel an active urge to help an apathy case, when one has penetrated the depth of speciousness ofthe data, an impulse toward contempt and ridicule will result, for no reasonable man finds animpulse toward death a reasonable thing, and the apathy case has no other impulse. The cry forpity, and the supplication for aid seem to require the assistance of others. Actually these aredemanding the enturbulence and death of others. No apathy case wants to be helped but willuse any and every means to keep from being helped. As courage is absent, the apathy case willdodge any incident which contains real force, just as the apathy case will dodge any factor inthe environment which contains real help or aid and will go inevitably toward environmentalfactors which are destructive. The apathy case, thus, avoids any good auditing and willactually seek out and encourage very bad auditing.104"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"It is a certain mawkish sentimentality in our current society, encouraged by generationsof literary men who were attempting only the strongest impact and thus the greatest sale fortheir works, which makes us brook, tolerate and countenance the apathetic. Perhaps becauseeach of us feels his importance demands that someone feel sorry for him when he is hurt ordead we countenance a continuing grief in others. By dianetic processing this grief is veryeasily dispensed with, and anyone who has long experience in the handling of apathy caseswould be more likely to feel sentimental about running sores or venereal disease than to feellong and enduring sympathy for apathy.As an admonition to auditors: never give support to the whims and ideas of an apathycase, and do not give the apathy case sympathy, but give it gentle processing. Do not believethe data obtained from an apathy case, but work mechanically with the case, actively getting asmuch free theta as possible to raise the case on the tone scale at least to covert hostility. Apathycases enturbulate one very easily, because one can so easily feel that grief over lost ones issomething which should be supported and assisted as a worthy mechanism. An apathy casewill say or do anything to gain sympathy. Utter immorality is present. The apathy case willsurrender his or her body as readily as anything else as a price of a little sympathy. The”love”one receives from an apathy case is actually the extreme depths of propitiation, and the “loving”apathy case will deliver one up to the hangman with as little compunction as he or she wouldfeel in drinking a glass of water. No reason, no codes, no ethics, no decency, no truth, no lifeare the hard and fast rules of the apathy case. And because a narrative can be given forth by theapathy case wild and alarming enough to justify his condition, one is often tempted to acceptthis propitiation as actual affinity, when actually it is an invitation to be killed. Because thispropitiation can be mistaken for love, one is often tempted, out of sympathy and a desire toassist, to become closely associated with an apathy case, but one should be apprized that hisname on a marriage certificate coupled with that of an apathy case constitutes a death warrantmore certain than that of a court of law. His home, if he ever manages by strenuous effort toassemble one, will be a shambles. His position will be lost and his dreams will be shattered.His self respect will be slaughtered and his concepts of morals and decency will be destroyed.These statements are made without compromise after long and close observation of apathy atwork in an individual. Apathy is only half a point above death, and apathy will bring death toanything and everything in the environment.A social order in the apathy band will take any unreasonable course which leadstowards death. It will follow any leader who claims that life is not worth living and that thingsand people should be neglected until they cease to live. Here is no outright destruction ofentities. Here is insidious destruction through neglect, over-use, and accelerated decay. TheAmerican Indian, for instance, when pushed by defeat into the tone band of apathy adoptedprogramme after programme which was acclaimed as a salvation programme but which wasalways a death programme. There was the matter of the ghost dancers, who avidly received thefalsity that their cotton shirts could stop bullets. There was the wave of dog killing, whereby itwas asserted that the buffalo would come back if all the dogs were dead.The body itself cooperates in the apathy band by becoming sick from any slightestcause, by involving itself in accidents of devious and various kinds, and by failing in endocrinefunction. One can expect the apathy case to become ill from bacteria even when bacteria are notpresent.One should be extremely chary of using any authoritarian or violent means on casesfrom 2.0 down, since such cases are very easily driven into the apathy level. Apathy isapparently, and only apparently, more tractable and easier to manage, since the apathy case tosome degree is in a permanent hypnotic trance and will listen to and believe anything said nomatter how ridiculous it may be. This is a highly dangerous state and will result not only in thesuicide of the person, on occasion, but also in the death of the concerns and persons of othersin the environ of the apathy case. This is the reason why there are so many suicides pursuantto the practice of hypnotism and other crude techniques. These, by asserting control over theindividual, depress him down the tone scale. The apathy case is capable of such thorough105"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"lying, that the individual may even claim to be better and appear to be better, until one morninghe is found a suicide. The apathy case can be very deceptive.The auditor should be warned not to employ any authoritarian methods in processing.We in Dianetics are only interested in raising people on the tone scale. The auditor should becareful not to enturbulate persons below the 2.0 line any further than they already are, butshould be as non-directive as possible. For, if the auditor permits his preclear to drop intoapathy he has on his hands a much more difficult and much longer case than a 1.1 or aforthrightly howlingly angry 1.5. Remember too that in this social order people from 2.0down the scale are accepted commonly as sane so long as they can perform any seeminglyrational acts in the environment.At 0.1 or 0.3 the individual also has a method of handling others around him. Thismechanism is based upon the reasoning that if one disavows all possible dangerousness thedangerous people in his vicinity will go away and leave him alone. As a matter of fact, huntersand soldiers rationally employ this mechanism as a last resort, and the mechanism occasionallyworks. Certain animals have this built in as a habit pattern. By an abandonment of allappearance of life they hope to arrest the urge of the attacker to produce death.The death of James Forrestal, who had been driven into apathy by overwork, is anillustrative case not only of what happens when authoritarian methods and incarceration areused as “treatment” but of the complete deceptiveness of which the apathy case is capable.Forrestal had not seemed so pleasant and relieved for some months as he did an hour before hethrew himself from the tower of the Bethesda Naval Hospital and fell sixteen flights to hisdeath on the concrete and glass below. Thus perished one of the most brilliant managers andchampions of the United States Navy. And other suicides, great and not so great, stack likecordwood before the back alleys of authoritarian “therapy.”One should realize that all individuals below 2.0 have a tendency to look upon familyfriends and associates as menaces to life or aids to death. Real affection is impossible, butpropitiation and pretence of affection are mechanisms by which one invites pity or disclaimsdangerousness. People from 2.0 down live in an atmosphere, according to their ownviewpoint, of potential death and murder. At 1.5, the mission is to cause the death of the“dangerous” entities by forthright acts of destruction. The 1.1 considers the family, associates,and environ even more potentially deathly and so, seeing greater danger in them, uses morecovert and devious methods to cope with and disarm these “dangerous” entities, and puts fortha smokescreen of helping and doing good for family, associates, and environ. Here also onefinds the mechanism of championing the underdog. The underdog is not dangerous and maybe an ally one can use against one’s very deathly environment. Anyone championing theunderdog is projecting himself into the underdog and is making a covert plea for the rights ofthe underdogs to live, in the usually not realized hope that he as an underdog will be permittedto go on living regardless of his acts against others.Following this ratio of the dangerousness of the environment as viewed by theindividual, the environment to the apathy case is literally crawling with death threats. Everyperson, every object, and every act is considered to have in it a death intent. The kindest word,though apparently accepted by the apathy case, is yet received deviously in the “fullunderstanding” that death lurks but a small distance behind that proffered help. Thisencourages the apathy case to act in a murderous fashion and seems to him to give him licenseto pay no attention to any moral code or feeling of decency. The apathy case lives in a cesspoolof impending slaughter and interprets anything done for him or her as something to be acceptedwarily. The apathy case quite commonly speaks of being killed, either of killing himself or ofbeing killed by others. His attention may be so fixed in its unreality that he chooses but onemurderer who is about to kill him; or his concentration may be so scattered that he choosesmany men, organizations or things as potential murderers.The pretended death case has come to a point where he considers the environment sofraught with menace that nothing in the environment has any intent save to kill him and that106"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"death is immediate. He has insufficient energy or reason remaining even to appeal for helpand, indeed, he considers that there is no person or object to which he can so appeal, and so heattempts to demonstrate to anything in the environment that it has won and that he is alreadydead. By posing as dead he imagines he can survive at least long enough to die a little lesspainfully than he considers he will die if he moves. Old and decadent races are commonlyfound to have the practice of willing death. An individual merely goes and sits on the edge ofhis grave until he dies and falls in. One can find such people any day on for instance, CoalHill, near Peking.The pretended death case has abandoned even trying to find any one menace andconsiders everything a menace. This state has the peculiarity of being unfixed. Possibly themost signal effect to rouse this case can be made by concentrating the attention of the individualupon a single and definite threat of death. Indeed, observing an honest and active source ofdeath raises the necessity level and brings anyone up the tone scale at least for a brief time.Thus in war, cities which are under sporadic bombardment show a lower incidence ofpsychosis than cities which, far behind the lines, only read about the deaths in newspapers.The source of death has been pinpointed as artillery and bombardment planes, and the source isso dramatic that attention can be fixed upon it. The source is also so simple that it requires verylittle effort to comprehend it. Further, such destruction brings with it many dead and disabledover whom the erstwhile psychotic can loom and so cease to occupy the tail end of theprocession as target number one for all dangerous entities in the environment. For in treatingwounded and dead he can observe without having to reason very much that he is moredangerous to them than they are to him. An additional reason for this sudden upsurge of a cityunder threat is the uniting towards a common goal of resisting or overcoming a commonmenace. Nations which engage in war so unify their populaces, and this is an immediaterevelation of the position on the tone scale of those nations which suppose they have to resortto war. For any reasonable and active nation need not engage in MEST destruction to securethe cooperation of another nation: this is an insanity, brought about by a position of 2.0 orbelow on the tone scale.The text corresponding to this column is long because it is actually a coverage ofinterpersonal relations. The rough rule regarding interpersonal relations, from which othermatters may be deduced, is that reason and cooperation exist in an increasing quantity from 2.0up and that the direction of effort is toward Survive. From 2.0 down domination and control,overt or covert, are employed in handling people, and the direction of effort is towardSuccumb. People above 2.0 on the tone scale suffer from any and all association with people at2.0 and down on the tone scale And people from 2.0 down benefit, so far as surviving isconcerned, from any association with people above 2.0. But the purposes are crossed, sinceindividuals from 2.0 up do not wish to be made to succumb and will combat any effort in thatdirection. And the individuals from2.0 down do not wish to made to live or create, and so resist any effort in that direction.Where reason will not swiftly resolve an argument between two human beings, an inspectionof the position each of those two occupies on the tone scale will probably demonstrate that oneis arguing to survive and the other is arguing to succumb, or one is arguing to create andconstruct and the other is arguing to destroy or neglect. Because a person’s position on the tonescale can be acute or momentary due to enturbulence in the environment or can be chronic dueto entheta “permanently” (except for dianetic processing) enturbulated, one can observe inpeople below 2.0, when less enturbulated, efforts to survive, and one can observe in peopleabove 2.0 occasional efforts to succumb.It is worthy of note that the environment of the individual has its own position on thetone scale. His school, the office in which he does business, his family, may occupy as agroup a certain position. This position of the environment on the tone scale comes aboutbecause of the influence of certain persons or the nature of the organisation or the existing stateof culture, and it cannot be neglected in estimating both the personality of the preclear and themethods he will use in handling others.107"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Actually there are three kinds or conditions of theta below the 4.0 line. The first is freetheta. The next is temporarily enturbulated theta which, left alone for a short time, willunenturbulate. And the third is frozen entheta, which is held in place in the case by the natureof engrams, secondaries, and locks. Environmental impacts, of course, charge up the engramsin the case and keep any person, unless a great change in environment takes place bringingmuch better survival factors, continuing on down the tone scale throughout his lifetime. Theenvironment impacting upon the individual thus alters free theta “permanently” into frozenentheta, but this is a gradual process, cumulative and deadly though it may be. As a child hemay have a very large number of engrams, but the environment has not acted upon him withsufficient impact to charge these engrams up with entheta in secondaries and locks. When he isan old man the track is almost completely entheta, in the usual case.There is another kind of enturbulation. The free theta is enturbulated by theenvironment, and although the majority of the free theta may become temporarily enturbulated,only a small portion of it freezes into the locks, secondaries, and engrams. Thus a person,because of the enturbulation of free theta on a temporary basis, can be moved up and down thetone scale by his environment. It is this surface manifestation and volatility of misemotionwhich has masked the nature of free theta. The environment impacting against the individualmay, for instance, inflict 1.5 factors on him to such an extent that he becomes momentarily 1.5.If the quantity of free theta remaining to him is great he will rather rapidly unenturbulate andregain his high position on the tone scale. Free theta can only be enturbulated downward, andthe case can only be enturbulated downward on the tone scale. The 1.1 does not go up to 1.5because of enturbulation, he goes down to apathy. The apathy case, when his free theta isenturbulated, flashes quickly into pretended death, or may even die, his margin of operation isso slight.The environment, then, has a marked effect upon the individual, from hour to hour andday to day. An individual who lives in a family which has a chronic tone of 1.1 may himself bepotentially a 3.0 and outside the family may manifest the qualities of a 3.0, but in the family hisenturbulation is so constant that he is little by little losing free theta into lock, secondary, andengram entheta and will gradually decline down the scale. The only thing which would remedythis would be having at the same time another environment, higher on the tone scale than he,which would tend to unenturbulate the free theta that becomes enturbulated in the vicinity of thefamily.Thus is it important to the auditor that his handling of the preclear has as high a tonelevel as possible, and he should attempt to arrange the preclear’s environment so that it has ashigh a tone as possible. An auditor who is attempting to work a preclear who is beingmishandled by a 1.5 environment will find himself working day after day with nothing buttemporarily enturbulated theta, and he will make very small progress with his case. It isnecessary for him to get this case out of the 1.5 environment so that the free theta canunenturbulate and thus be available to free the frozen entheta in the locks, secondaries, andengrams, in order to add constantly to the preclear’s free theta and not just keep it frombecoming less by daily environmental enturbulation.It is also of interest to the auditor and to people in general that education has its ownpositions on the tone scale. Education designed to inhibit and restrain, to create conformity tothe social order, has the unfortunate effect of reducing the individual on the tone scale. Thiswould be authoritarian education and would be from 2.0 down. Education which invites andstimulates reason and seeks to accelerate the individual toward a successful and happy level ofexistence and has enough faith in individuals to assume the good usage of the education raisesthe individual on the tone scale. One can, by reviewing the education of any individual,discover much supportive evidence for this, since it will be found that those subjects in whichthe individual is able will be those which were taught by methods from 2.0 up, and thosesubjects in which the individual is poor, lacking accuracy or self-determinism, and failing in hisreason with them, were taught by methods which would be found from 2.0 down on the tonescale. As a society declines, it more and more resorts to authoritarian teaching and attemptsincreasingly to impress upon the individual that he must adjust to his environment and that he108"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"cannot adjust his environment to him. The educational process becomes one of semi-hypnotically receiving doughy masses of data and regurgitating them upon examination papers.Reason and self-determinism are all but forbidden.When we speak of people using various methods to handle other people we must alsospeak of the methods which have been used to handle our preclear. We are interested inDianetics in what has been done to an individual, not what the individual has done. This is notan effort to escape or alter moral standards but is simply a statement of fact; the auditor whobecomes interested in his preclear’s motives and makes evaluations of his preclear’s reasoningis not only wasting his time but is trying to perform authoritarian therapy. What has been doneto a person educationally is of very great concern to the auditor, since education can be sothoroughly suppressive that it and it alone, given engrams to charge up on the case, can movethe individual considerably down the tone scale, as witnessed by the many vapid, will-less andidle graduates of our universities.Knowing that education can be such a strong factor in the aberrating and suppressing ofthe human being is helpful, in that by lock scanning the auditor can pick up and de-intensify aneducation wholesale, with a resultant rise of his preclear on the tone scale and without touchinganything which could be dignified as locks, secondaries or engrams. The whole of a person’seducation may be a lock. No words bitter enough or strong enough could be levelled atauthoritarian educational systems, which even though they witness in their parades of graduatesdestroyed artists, hopeless and apathetic women, stupid and dull engineers, yet have made nogreat effort to establish and remedy the cause -- their own authoritarian methods of education.Fortunately, a college education can be picked up out of a preclear who is in fair workingcondition in ten or fifteen hours. Waste-basketing this enormous and onerous effort on the partof mentally constipated straw men and would-be Little Caesars on their lecture platformswould, of course, be an enormous benefit to the whole society, but in the absence of thishighly desirable measure the auditor can at least regain the free theta which has been tied up inthe individual’s education.The college is not the only destructive element in the educational system. High schoolsystems are as bad, but they have as their subjects people who are still well enough up the tonescale to be able to resist, since youth is resilient. Grade school educations, particularly in theirfirst years, are very likely to be authoritarian, and as they form the basis of formal educationthey should also be addressed.Entheta is best freed out of locks and secondaries from late to early, so that one shouldactually address present time and then earlier times and then earlier and earlier in his scanningand running of locks in order to arrive at the earliest possible times. Complete recall ofchildhood is so reached, and efforts to reach childhood without treating the rest of the life byscanning are normally defeated. By treating childhood alone, out of the mistaken reasoning thatit was a highly aberrative period (an aberration which was planted by amateur philosophers andtherapists half a century ago), one sends the preclear against the occluding force of the latelocks and secondaries without giving him a chance to reduce them. One should not expect tobe able to run a case by addressing the early portion of the case first, unless the preclear is insuch condition that he can get to basic-basic and reduce it with most perceptics on. Education,then, must bc run from last to first in order to recover it. Now, one does not ordinarily think ofparental training in terms of education, and yet the whole business of gaining experience couldbe lumped under the heading of education. Common usage of the word denotes formalinstruction, but it is no less education that mother, father, nurses and other people in the homeadminister to a child. It is in the early portion of life that the most checks and the strongestauthoritarian measures are used, since the child, through lack of data, is least capable ofreasoning.These restraints compound continually, and much free theta becomes frozen“permanently” in locks during early childhood. This is along the educational line and is bestcleared up by picking up the instruction closest to present time and lock-scanning it thoroughly,then picking up an earlier period of instruction such as college, then picking up an earlier one109"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"such as high school, then an earlier one such as grammar school, and finally parental training.In such a way one will recover the general restraints imposed upon children and the generalunreasonableness of most adults toward children.You can discover the way your preclear was handled as a child by investigating the wayhe handles children, but this has a limited value since he is normally, if he had a bad childhood,in an ally’s valence and the methods he uses may be those of the ally rather than the overallmethods of the family. But in many cases the preclear is following the advice of doing untoothers as has been done to him and, this is true in other things than childhood.Educational systems which have been used on your preclear had their own positions onthe tone scale and tended to freeze the individual at those same positions on the tone scale. Thuswe could have a child whose home life made him a potential 3.0 but who was educated in a 1.1school. The education would tend to bring the individual down the tone scale to 1.1. Thevalues he has been given for various facts and actions of other people and the methods he hasbeen taught to use in the handling of other people have been educated into him by someeducational system. Thus, if you attempted to clear an individual and bring him up the tonescale without giving a thorough address to his education you would have, even with the bulk ofhis engrams and secondaries gone, an individual who hung very low on the tone scale. Itrequires very little work to correct this, and the work should not be neglected. Otherwise, yourindividual will continue to handle people and to act in his environment along the tone levelwhere he was educated. It is a question whether any preclear exists in the civilized world todaywho has been educated by a system above 2.0 on the tone scale.In keeping with this educational theme, its aspects in processing, and the way itinfluences the preclear in his handling of other people, one should carefully scout every casefor the lowest-toned individual in the environment of the preclear at any time during his life andfind any later individuals who approximated the earlier individual. Scan out the laterindividual, then find and scan out the early individual, and much will have been done toincrease the tone of the preclear. Association with persons low on the tone scale is alwaysdepressing, and a long and continuous association creates many severe locks.You will have as one of your better indexes of how your preclear is progressing thechanges in his handling of those around him.The auditor would do well to examine his own general method of handling people witha highly critical eye and adjudicate for himself where his auditing is likely to lie on the tonescale, and by the educational process of knowing the consequences and knowing how to getresults, simply raise his necessity level up to a point where he achieves a more desirableattitude, if he thinks one is necessary If the auditor should happen to find himself in that bandof the tone scale where one is afraid of hurting people he should be very wary not todemonstrate any lack of courage in running the case.The preclear should examine his auditor for his position on the tone scale, and if hefinds his auditor in the apathy or covert hostility range, he had himself better work the auditoror else he will render himself liable for inevitable “mistakes” in the handling of his case, suddenand unexpected affinity breaks, and a general confusion. The moral of this column is thatauditors should not audit and preclears should not permit themselves to be audited unless theyare certain of an above-2.0 handling of the case and of people in general.Two persons can co-audit each other, step by step up the tone scale, but unless a parityis maintained, one of them will suffer, and a good release or a clear will be impossible to attain-- which is thought to be the difficulty so far experienced in Dianetics, where the making ofclears is concerned.110"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHTCOLUMN ZCommand Value of Action PhrasesThe subject of action phrases has been covered earlier in this book. Action phrases arethose which seem to order the preclear in various directions. If the preclear were standing in aroom obeying orders, and if he had means of raising and lowering himself, action phraseswould act on him as follows. If he were told to go up, he would go up; if he were told to godown, he would go down; if he were told to go in two directions at once, he would becomeconfused; if he were told not to move, he would not move; if he were told to pull himself intohimself, he would try to shrink; these, in essence are action phrases.The action of the individual on his time track, back through his past, is sometimesdirected by action phrases appearing in his engrams. He does not have to obey these phrases inorder to be processed; indeed, the auditor should discourage him from obeying them; it is notnecessary to prove the validity or value of an engram by proving that one can react to an actionphrase.The action phrases are: bouncers, such as “get up,” “get out”; holders such as “stayhere,” “don’t move”; misdirectors such as “don’t know whether I’m coming or going,” or“everything is backwards”; down-bouncers, such as “get under” or “go back”; groupers, suchas “everything happens at once,” “pull yourself together”; call-backs, such as “come back,”“please come”; and one other, the denyer, which states that the engram does not exist, such as“there isn’t anything here,” “I can’t see anything.” There is also the valence shifter which shiftsthe individual from his own identity to the identity of another; the valence-bouncer, whichprohibits an individual from going into some particular valence; the valence-denyer, which mayeven deny that the person’s own valence exists; and the valence-grouper, which makes allvalences into one valence. These are all the types of action phrases. A dictionary of thesephrases could be made up and might be of some use, but with a little experience the auditor willlearn what these phrases are. It is mandatory that he understand what these phrases are, sincewhen he finds his preclear doing strange things on the track while running an engram, he hadbetter remedy the condition rapidly by asking the file clerk for the type of phrase, and thenasking for the phrase, and then getting the preclear to repeat the phrase in order to lessen itseffect, so that the preclear can continue moving on his track in the proper fashion.At 4.0, there are no engrams. Present-time phrases have no reactive value.At 3.5, if a whole chain of incidents remains in a case, the action computation of thechain may be effective. Individual phrases are mildly effective sometimes in very severeengrams.At 3.0, the action phrases in severe engrams are effective on the preclear.At 2.5, phrases in engrams and in secondary engrams cause the preclear to respond.At, 2.0 engrams, secondaries, and chains of locks all contain phrases or computationswhich produce action in the case as the preclear runs on the time track.At 1.5, action phrases in engrams, secondaries, and locks matching the tone of thepreclear are very effective, and control phrases are very effective. The individual is usually stilldramatizing his circuit control phrases, seeking to control others.At 1.1, action phrases in engrams, secondaries, and locks are very effective, andvalence-shifters are very effective. Down to this point valence-shifters are not very effective,111"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"but at this point they become extremely effective, unless one is running a wide open case,which normally has few if any valence-shifters.At 0.5, present-time action phrases -- that is to say, action phrases just heard in theenvironment -- are effective on the preclear to some slight degree; engram, lock, and secondaryaction phrases are all effective, of course.At 0.1, groupers are particularly effective and one can expect the track to be in acollapsed condition. Indeed, groupers are possibly effective anywhere on the scale, being justanother type of action phrase; however, from 1.5 up, the time-track will not collapse because ofa grouper; from 1.5 down, it may do so. The use of this column is apparent. After a short run,the auditor will see how the preclear behaves toward action phrases, and this will help him todetermine the preclear’s position on the tone scale.112"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"BOOK TWODianetic Processing113"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEThe Basic Principles of ProcessingIn practice, in Dianetics, the auditor is doing a very simple thing. He is recovering thetawhich has become confused with MEST by reason of physical pain and emotional shock. Heis by dianetic processing converting entheta to theta. A fundamental axiom of Dianetics is thatlife is formed by theta compounding with MEST to make a living organism. Life is theta plusMEST.Another axiom is that theta conquers MEST by first becoming enturbulated with it andthen withdrawing, possessed of some of the laws of MEST, and returning over the MEST foran orderly conquest.Another axiom is that theta, in its conquest of MEST, has followed the cycle of contact,growth, decay, and death, repeated over and over, theta each time using the data gained duringthe cycle to better adapt the organism for the further conquest of MEST.Theta is thought, an energy of its own universe analogous to energy in the physicaluniverse but only occasionally paralleling electro-magnetic-gravitic laws.The three primary components of theta are affinity, reality and communication.Theta has the strange power of animating and directing MEST and bringing it into anorderly, mobile, and self-perpetuating unit known to us as a life organism.Dianetics is that branch of Scientology that covers mental anatomy.Theta and MEST in a disorderly collision bring about enturbulation in both the theta andthe MEST which actually changes or reverses the polarity of the theta and the MEST. Thisreversed polarity permits the rejection of theta by enMEST and of MEST by entheta, so thatdeath can ensue and a new organism can be begun.Theta acting upon MEST with affinity, communication, and reality takes on an aspectknown as reasoning or understanding. All mathematics can be derived from ARC acting uponMEST.Theta may have considerable residual knowledge of its own, but the knowledge inwhich an organism is interested is information concerning theta and MEST laws as applied tothe organism, and each and every organism develops in the ratio that it utilizes and understandsthese laws. In the cycle of the organism, from conception to death, theta and MEST are manytimes brought together in disorderly collision. This creates the phenomenon known as physicalpain. Perception of threats to survival and dwindling position on the tone scale “charge up”these moments of physical pain as a mechanism to force the organism into, at first, greatersurvival activities and then, these failing, into death activities in order to free the theta from theMEST to begin a new cycle. The break point, where the organism is no longer driven upwardtoward survival but begins to go downward toward death, is 2.0 on the tone scale.Death has been a vital mechanism in theta’s conquest of MEST, since in no other waycould the theta become sufficiently unenturbulated to be able to use the information receivedthrough enturbulence to create and construct new organisms or new species. Inevitably throughthis evolution theta, seeking according to theory wider and wider conquest of MEST, wouldconstruct an organism which by force of reason could actively handle large quantities ofMEST. Man is such an organism. No lesser organism can rationally arrange any large quantityof MEST exterior to the organism, although many lesser organisms have genetic habit patternswhich do permit the handling and altering of small amounts of MEST. All learning springsfrom disorderly enturbulences where theta has impinged too suddenly and sharply upon114"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"MEST. All reasoning is done by freed theta returning over the MEST for an orderly conquest,utilizing the lessons learned in the disorderly conquest. This applies not only to the formationof organisms but to all adventures of man, according to observation.It is possible that Dianetics, if these theories continue to prove correct as they have inthe past, forms an evolutionary bridge which minimizes death as a mechanism for new learningand conquest and maximizes the conversion of entheta to theta, or disorderly experience toreason, within one life span. Should this prove to be the case, the acceleration of conquest ofMEST by man should be very marked. Indeed at this time it can be observed that through a pastlack of knowledge of the humanities his social orders have been for some time on a dwindlingspiral, even though his knowledge of the physical laws increased. Man, according to thesetheories, could be said to have learned a great deal about the physical universe without learningenough about theta.An interesting series of experiments recently done by the Foundation seems to bear outthe theory that heightened reason-ability is contained in theta which has been newly recoveredfrom an enturbulence with MEST. Individuals were given a test for a few minutes in order tomeasure their existing intelligence. They were then sent back down the track into an engram byan auditor and the engram was thoroughly restimulated. Immediately afterwards, the engramnot reduced, these experimental subjects were ordered to do a second test. In this condition ofstress the second test was taken, and it was found that the score on the second test wasuniformly higher than that gained on the first test. Considerable additional experimentationmust be undertaken, and these results are very far from conclusive, but they would seem toindicate validity in some of the theta-MEST postulates. Other explanations can, of course, befound for the results of these experiments. However, the theta-MEST postulates have permittednew dianetic processes to be derived and have markedly increased the ease of processing andhave decreased the length of time necessary to bring about a dianetic release. Further, the theta-MEST postulates shed much light on the third dynamic, and with them it was possible for meto bring into being a new technology of groups which, when tested on pilot projects withgroups, was found to have a uniform workability.To learn anything about MEST, theta must become enturbulated with it, but to utilizethe changes in it caused by the enturbulation, the theta must be freed from MEST in order toaccomplish a reasonable conquest of further MEST. Death has been an answer, of sorts, but isnot satisfactory to the unit organism. Dianetic processing offers a much less drastic thetarecovery.Inspecting a time track at the beginning of a case one ordinarily finds many occludedareas about which no reasoning can be done. It could be said that these areas, as in engramsthemselves, contain entheta. Any of several processes which can free this entheta and convert itinto theta will increase the reasonability of the individual, as witnessed by many long series ofpsychometric tests taken before and after dianetic processing. The restoration of recall of theareas hitherto occluded, in that the data contained in these areas is valuable as experience andinformation, could, of course, be said to increase the health and reason of the individual. Butthe recovery of the theta which could be said to lie in these areas as entheta could also bepostulated to increase the reason of the individual.The tone scale is actually a chart of the ratio of free theta and entheta in the individual.Above the 2.0 line, the individual could be said to have more theta than entheta. Below thepoint 2.0, the individual could be said to have more entheta than theta. Simply by convertingentheta to theta the auditor can cause the individual to rise on the tone scale.It will readily be seen that the ideal condition would be all theta recovered and noentheta remaining in existence in the individual. The attainment of this ideal is called inDianetics a “cleared” state. This would be, at this time, the end goal of processing. Just howoften it can be completely attained by skilled or unskilled auditors is open to question. That itcan be neared and that cases grow markedly better under processing is not open to question,since regardless of any wonder about the cleared state none who have associated with the115"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Foundation or who have practiced Dianetics with any knowledge at all have the smallest doubtof the ability of dianetic processing to improve cases many times more than was ever beforepossible. If clears cannot be created easily and swiftly, dianetic processing is still very far frominvalidated. Actually, clears have been and are being produced, but their total potentialitiesremain relatively unexplored.The dianetic release is more understandable than the clear and has been produced andstudied in sufficient numbers to admit of little doubt about the desirability and stability of thestate. This is a nearer and more easily obtainable goal. The simple alleviation of pain, worry,and general unhappiness is routine to the dianetic auditor. He can accomplish that goals inanything from a few hours to a few weeks on most preclears. These are much more easilyobtained goals, and are quite ordinary in the vicinity of the Foundation, so that these, whichsome say might have been considered miracles two years ago, hardly cause comment.Occasionally some Foundation auditor is startled into advertising a result to his follow auditorsin a processing unit, but these successes are generally taken for granted.Just as we have the ratio of theta to entheta establishing the sanity or insanity of theindividual, so we have the ratio of free theta in the auditor to the free theta-entheta ratio in thepreclear establishing the swiftness with which the entheta can be unenturbulated in the preclear.An examination of this theory will demonstrate that there are three valid processes.The first and the simplest of these processes consists of changing the environment ofthe preclear. His old environment possibly contains many restimulative objects and persons,so that his free theta is in continual enturbulence by reason of the restimulation. Shifting thepreclear to an unrestimulative environment permits him to “settle out,” which is to say, permitsthe temporarily enturbulated theta to disenturbulate and the “frozen” entheta to convert, in someminute quantity, to free theta. Part of the environmental change process would be, of coursethe bettering of affinity, reality, and communication in the environment of the preclear. This byitself could produce a rise in his tone. Falling in love, being an increase of affinity, can make awell man out of a sick man. Being rejected or falling out of love, being a decrease of affinity,can make a sick man out of a well man. Bettering a person’s communication, even if only bygiving him a new pair of glasses, will also raise his tone. Validating his realities which were inquestion can raise his tone. All these things could be considered environmental changes. Aspecial part of environmental change would be changes in health, by reason of nutrition orbetter living conditions. This process must not be overlooked, since it has been our experiencethat some preclears who were not doing as well as could have been desired were deficient intheir nutrition. The preclear who lives on coffee and sandwiches does not do as well duringprocessing as one who has an adequate and balanced ration with proper vitamin supplements.Good physical exercise can by itself markedly increase the individuals position on the tonescale and a whole therapy to aid psychotics could easily be worked out along the lines ofexercise alone.Probably the worst thing that can happen to a Psychotic is to be placed in theatmosphere normally provided for him by the state. Only a sane, healthy environment where hegets proper exercise and where he has unrestimulative individuals around him could do much toimprove his condition. The psychotic will sometimes improve if he is given command overmore MEST and, indeed. a fundamental in the production of psychosis is denying theindividual a command over MEST.No better method of tailor-making psychotics could be devised than the usualinstitution, and it is probable that if the normal person were placed in such an institution, insuch an atmosphere, he would become psychotic. Indeed, the incidence of psychosisovertaking attendants and psychiatrists in attendance in such institutions is alarmingly high.This is second only to psycho-surgery and shock treatment in the worsening of psychotics in apsychotic state. Rather than give psychotics such treatment it would be far kinder to kill themimmediately and completely, and not partially as does psycho-surgery and electric shock.116"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The second process which is valid in producing results is education. Education, ifdefined as the process of making new data available to the individual and causing his mind toattend to and use that data, itself brings reason into the case. Education usually provides newareas of concentration in the environment of the individual and translates many of hisunknowns into knowns. Unreason could be classed in two categories: too wide a zone ofattention, and too fixed a zone of attention. In the first, the mind wanders over large areasunable to select pertinent data. In the second, where the mind is fixed, it cannot wander farenough to find pertinent data. In neither case can the mind resolve the problem about which itis concerned, due to the absence of data. Superstition is an effort, for lack of education, to findpertinent data in too wide a zone or to fix the attention upon irrelevant data. Personal experiencein one’s environment gives one what might be called personal education. A man has becomeembroiled with MEST, has freed himself, solved problems, has become embroiled again, hasdrawn back and solved problems anew, so that he has accumulated a fund of personal dataabout his task of living. Education might be said to be the process by which the individual isgiven the accumulated data of a long span of culture. It can, no less validly than personalexperience, solve many of his problems. Free theta, confronted by too many problems, can,just by this, become enturbulated. Good education can in this way convert some of the enthetaof an individual into theta, with a consequent rise on the tone scale. A very sharp proviso,however, must here be entered. Authoritarian teaching, by which the facts are impressed uponthe individual and his self-determinism in his utilization of those facts is suppressed, can reducethe free theta in the individual by involving it in a fixed state in the memory bank. Theta isreason. Fixed theta is entheta. Many a man with a college education hammered home byauthoritarian professors has been reduced so far down the tone scale that he behaves in lifemore or less like an automaton. His self-determinism, and hence his persistence and ability tohandle responsibility are so reduced as to unfit him for his role in life. Further, concentratingon educational processes past the mid-teens, after which a person should be solving problemsof living, has an inhibitive effect upon the mind. An artist specifically is hindered byauthoritarian education, since his must be the highest self-determinism if his work is to haveany value. Authoritarian education has more or less the same effect upon the individual ashypnotism, depressing him down the tone scale, and indeed, at this time most education islevelled as hypnotic commands rather than an invitation to reason. An education which invitesreason and the comparison of taught data with the real world can raise the individual on the tonescale.The third process which can be considered valid in raising the individual on the tonescale is individual processing, by which is meant any method which will turn his entheta intotheta by addressing him as an individual.It seems to be one of the characteristics of theta that when the theta present exceeds to avery high degree the entheta present, the entheta will tend to dis-enturbulate and become theta.In other words, if we considered these matters in terms of polarity and energy, a positive fieldif sufficiently strong would inhibit and then convert a negative field near it. Avery large magnet placed close to a small magnet will change the poles of the smallmagnet. When a very large amount of entheta is placed in the vicinity of a lesser amount oftheta, the theta may rapidly become entheta. When theta and entheta exist together in more orless equal amounts, or when the disproportion is not large, a relatively stable condition exists,the theta tending to remain theta and the entheta tending to remain entheta. An example of thisin the group is the phenomenon of mass hysteria, where one or two members of the groupbecome enturbulated and very rapidly the remainder of the group becomes enturbulated.This is the basic law of the contagion of aberration. Entheta will enturbulate theta.Misemotion will change emotion into misemotion. Poor communication will change goodcommunication into poor communication. Poor reality will change good reality into poorreality. The engrams in a case enturbulate theta into the entheta of secondaries and locks.Amongst people one sees this exemplified when a person who is relatively insane entersa group which is relatively sane. The relatively sane may attempt to raise the sanity level of the117"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"relatively insane person, and it may occur in this group that the relatively insane personbecomes more sane. At the same time, however, the relatively sane people become less sane,unless they have some means or technology for preventing this phenomenon from occurring.In the case of a husband and wife, it is easy to observe that the mate who is higher onthe scale will during the marriage association drop lower, and usually the mate who is lower onthe tone scale will come slightly higher as a result of that association. As a further example, themate who is lower on the tone scale will demand more affection and give less than the matewho is higher. The mate who is lower will demand more communication and give less, andwill assert more reality but will actually have less. It can thus be seen, as represented in columnAQ on the chart, that the auditor must have a higher ratio of theta to his entheta than has thepreclear. A condition must exist where much more theta is available than entheta. An auditorwhose theta-entheta ratio is around 2.5 could, with skill, handle individuals lower on the tonescale by not more than one point. A 2.5 auditor attempting to handle an apathy case would findhis already badly enturbulated condition worsened so much by the case that the case, havingvery little free theta, would not get much better. A 2.5 auditor attempting to create a clear beginsto work uphill as soon as his preclear reaches 2.5, and the hill very rapidly becomes too steepto climb. The ideal auditor is the one who has a very high endowment of theta and who is at4.0 on the tone scale. Thus, at the beginning of Dianetics, where we have the usual auditoroperating between 2.5 and 3.0, we find it very simple to pull preclears up to 2.0 or 2.5, moredifficult to bring them up to 3.0. Where auditors are being heavily employed in processingpeople they tend to neglect their own processing, and being constantly in the vicinity of andhandling entheta, they begin to encounter difficulties with a preclear as soon as the preclearreaches 2.5. It is incumbent upon the auditor to keep himself continually processed and keephis own tone coming up the scale. Where a co-auditing team exists, one person auditing theother, it is considerably more than a fair exchange for each to give due attention to the state ofthe other’s case, for the moment one begins to appropriate the bulk of processing his own casewill slow down in its progress.Dianetic processing, then, by the theta-MEST theory, attempts only one thing: therecovery and conversion of entheta into theta. Any processing which does not accomplish thisin an orderly fashion is therefore not valid dianetic processing.Theta is many things. For a description of it as it applies to the MEST organism youneed only read the 4.0 band of the tone scale chart. Theta is reason, serenity, stability,happiness, cheerful emotion, persistence and the other factors which man ordinarily considersdesirable. Any practice which enturbulates theta suppresses the case. The auditor’s code isactually a list of the things one must or must not do to preserve the theta-ness of theta and toinhibit the enturbulation of theta by the auditor.Where the preclear has a small amount of theta and a large amount of entheta, theauditor must be particularly careful not to enturbulate the existing theta, since it is in theproximity of so much entheta that it enturbulates rapidly. The auditor mishandling such a case,using invalidations, hypnotism, brute force, sadism or devil worship, can send the free thetastill in existence down the track and lock it up in an old secondary or engram and so findhimself with a temporarily completely enturbulated preclear on his hands. To avoid thisdanger, one should mark the preclear well on the chart and be guided accordingly. This givesthe auditor an estimate of the amount of free theta he has with which to un-enturbulate theexisting entheta in the case. It may happen that so little theta exists in the case that the auditormust use the lightest and most pleasant methods of which he is capable in order to makeenough theta available even to start down the time track.The percentile column (the scale from zero to one thousand) is an index of the amountof organism theta available to work the case. At 4.0, one hundred percent is available. At 2.0,the amount of theta and “permanent” entheta are more or less equally balanced, butenvironmental enturbulation leaves the preclear with very little free theta. Below this point isthe death zone, and here as the tone lowers increasingly, more danger exists that all theremaining theta will suddenly at one fell swoop become entheta, thus changing the occasional118"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"psychotic into a chronic psychotic, at least until rest, good food, and exercise permit the notseriously enturbulated portions of the entheta to become theta again. It takes very poor auditingto accomplish this, and the danger is hardly a danger at all if one follows the chart. The moreclosely processing can approximate the mechanics of mind operation, the better that processingis. The least forceful processing produces the best results. As dianetic processing evolves itbecomes less and less directive, the preclear being allowed more and more latitude in hisactions. This should not go so far as to permit the preclear to free-associate or ramble onendlessly and uselessly, but it does go as far as never driving a preclear hard when he balks,unless he is in the middle of a secondary grief or terror engram and is refusing to go on throughwith it when if the auditor permits him to leave it the possibility exists that much skilledauditing will elapse before the auditor will have this preclear back into the secondary.The auditor might liken his job to removing the rocks and shoals from the hiddendepths of a turbulent river and making of it a smooth-flowing and powerful stream. Theauditor is not changing the preclear’s personality or attempting to improve the preclear byevaluation and suggestions. He is simply making it easier for the mind to do what basicpersonality naturally wants the mind to do. This might be said to be the total end and goal ofprocessing.119"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO;The Auditor’s CodeThe first thing any auditor should know and know well about processing is theauditor’s code. This has been called the code of how to be civilized. Much more important thanknowing mechanical techniques is knowing well the attitude one should have toward a preclear.This is not for courtesy but for efficiency. No preclear will respond to an auditor who does notadhere to the auditor’s code.It must be remembered that the mission of the auditor is not to reduce engrams, not torun out secondaries, not to eradicate psychosomatic illnesses, psychoses or neuroses, but toraise the preclear on the tone scale. It happens that these incidentals of removing neuroses,psychoses and psychosomatic illnesses as well as increasing the persistence and generalresponsibility of the individual follow in due course so long as the auditor attends closely to hisprimary mission of raising his preclear on the tone scale. If he does not give this his firstattention, he is not freeing theta and converting entheta, and if he does not do this he cannotefficiently accomplish the other goals. The index of how well he progresses with the preclear’scase is the tone scale. Mechanical, lackadaisical, and careless auditing can actually removepsychosomatic illnesses and yet not raise the preclear on the tone scale. This may beparadoxical, but what happens is that the entheta in the engram causing the psychosomaticillness is converted into another type of entheta which is not physically painful to the preclear.It is, nevertheless, entheta, and the preclear is not raised on the tone scale. Thus, the auditormust closely attend to every means which will raise the preclear on the tone scale and shoulddisregard the immediate and short-term goals of the eradication of specific “illnesses,” badhabits, neuroses, psychoses, obsessions, and compulsions. The auditor must remember thateven such a degraded practice as hypnotism can, by the implantation of positive suggestions,suppress certain physical and mental disorders. Though these are suppressed in one quarterthey will manifest themselves as something entirely different. A person is saner to have“psychosomatic illnesses” than he is to have mental aberrations. Hypnotism can in a smallpercentage of cases eradicate the “psychosomatic illness” but will produce in its stead a loweredtone in the individual. Electric shock and psychosurgery may alter the behavior pattern of theindividual and may suppress him into some tractable condition, but the result is inevitablyharmful to the ability, efficiency, and general worth of the subject, with the further detractionthat they cause damage to the brain from which the individual never completely recovers.Simply by addressing processing from the viewpoint that one is changing entheta totheta and freeing up all available theta in the case one will make the most rapid progress withthe preclear. Experience in the field has demonstrated that irascible, authoritarian auditing cancontinue for as long as five hundred hours, that actual “psychosomatic illnesses” can beremoved and that some small improvement can be seen in the general tone of the preclear andyet that neglect of emphasis on raising tone might permit such a case to continue on anotherthousand hours without producing a clear, the entheta being transferred from one part of thebank to another, endlessly.The auditor should give attention to the environment of his preclear. Cases have beenobserved in which the preclear was in the vicinity of a marital mate who produced suchconstant tension, so many invalidations, and who had so little thought for or belief in anypossible gain for the other that the processing was only of small benefit and the auditor waswasting ten hours of auditing time for every one which was effective. In such a case theauditor has every right to recomment a change of environment for the duration of theprocessing. The auditor should not draw back from educating his preclear, so long as theeducation is not on a command basis but is done as an invitation to the self-determinism of thepreclear to manifest itself, an invitation to the preclear to reason things out on a basis of hisown adjudication. This is particularly beneficial with children. Indeed, children aresurrounded by such ordering about and restrictions that their self-determinism is often tooslight to cope with anything like their personal situations. In such a case it is definitely the role120"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"of the auditor to invite the child to think things out for himself, occasionally redefining wordsor situations for the child. Actually, an auditor can take two or three preclears and form aneducational group wherein mutual discussion of their own problems will result in a rise of tonein the preclears.The third method of processing, of course the most lasting method, is auditing, orindividual processing, wherein the auditor concentrates on freeing all available theta in the caseand converting as much entheta as possible to theta. The auditor’s first step towardsaccomplishing this, should he consider the environmental situation compatible, is to promoteaffinity, communication, and reality with his preclear and to found a group of two -- himselfand his preclear.The auditor must recognize that he is dealing with a person, in every case, whoseconduct is not as good as it will be. Thus, the auditor must practice much self-restraint andmust form an example for his preclear. To do this the auditor must never under anycircumstances or for any reason break any part of the auditor’s code with the preclear. Breakingthe auditor’s code, at first glance, may not appear to be a very great sin. But an auditor hasundertaken to aid a fellow man, and his dedication to that purpose must be sincere to the pointof sacredness. An auditor, by misusing his position through what he knows about the humanmind, can bring havoc upon an unsuspecting preclear. Carelessness alone, if it is backed withgood intention, can seldom do much harm. But malicious intent, wherein an auditor expects to“gain” heavily by use of deception and misuse of the sacred trust he has taken unto himself inhelping his fellow man, can cast a preclear far back down the tone scale.If one does not feel that he can keep the auditor’s code wholly and completely, heshould not under any circumstances audit anyone, nor should he permit himself to bepersuaded to audit anyone, and any preclear should be very wary of permitting himself to beaudited by anyone who potentially would break the auditor’s code. The preclear who findshimself confronted with an auditor code break should instantly and finally terminate hisprocessing with that auditor and should find another who can keep the code. A man who willbreak this code once will break it many times, and the preclear should never persist in thearrangement out of the argument that he can get only one auditor. Anyone who breaks thiscode is under 2.5 on the chart and should not be auditing but should be in process of beingaudited himself.An open-hearted and sincere effort to practice Dianetics, after a thorough study of theprinciples contained in this book, should the student adhere to these principles, will producemarked and beneficial effects upon human beings never before attained in man’s history. Toproduce these effects the auditor must embrace the auditor’s code and keep these principles assacred as if they were the vows of priesthood. The auditor conducts himself in such a way as tomaintain optimum affinity, communication and agreement with the preclear.The auditor is trustworthy. He understands that the preclear has given into the auditor’strust his hope for higher sanity and happiness, and that trust is sacred and never to be betrayed.The auditor is courteous. He respects the preclear as a human being. He respects theself-determinism of the preclear. He respects his own position as an auditor. He expresses thisrespect in courteous conduct.The auditor is courageous. He never falls back from his duty to a case. He never fails touse the optimum procedure regardless of any alarming conduct on the part of the preclear.The auditor never evaluates the case for the preclear. He abstains from this, knowingthat to compute for the preclear is to inhibit the preclear’s own computation. He knows that torefresh the preclear’s mind as to what went before is to cause the preclear to depend heavilyupon the auditor and so to undermine the self=determinism of the preclear.121"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"The auditor never invalidates any of the data or the personality of the preclear. Heknows that in doing so he would seriously enturbulate the preclear. He refrains from criticismand invalidation no matter how much the auditor’s own sense of reality is twisted or shaken bythe preclear’s incidents or utterances. The auditor uses only techniques designed to restore theself-determinism of the preclear. He refrains from all authoritarian or dominating conduct,leading always rather than driving. He refrains from the use of hypnotism or sedatives on thepreclear no matter how much the preclear may demand them out of aberration. He neverabandons the preclear out of faint-heartedness about the ability of techniques to resolve thecase, but persists and continues to restore the preclear’s self-determinism. The auditor keepshimself informed of any new skills in the science.The auditor cares for himself as an auditor. By working with others he maintains hisown processing at regular intervals in order to maintain or raise his own position on the tonescale despite restimulation of himself through the process of auditing others. He knows thatfailure to give heed to his own processing, until he himself is a release or a clear in the severestmeaning of the terms, is to cost his preclear the benefit of the auditor’s best performance.This is the auditor’s code. It has been discovered that the two most important aspectsof the code are the preservation of the preclear’s sense of reality and the trustworthiness of theauditor. An invalidation of the preclear’s data, no matter how outrageously that data mayassault the auditor’s own sense of reality, can be severe and will go so far as to shut off thepreclear’s sonic and visio, all in a moment. Most preclears are uncertain enough in thepresence of their own past. They quite commonly invalidate themselves, a practice from whichthey should be discouraged. When the auditor invalidates the preclear’s data the shock to thepreclear can be very great. In the matter of trustworthiness, the auditor must never takeadvantage of the preclear, either in using his data or in using a temporary state of apathy,propitiation, or restimulation in order to possess himself casually of the preclear or to gainmaterially.Any two people in constant association who will conduct themselves according to theauditor’s code will soon find not only that they are clear or almost clear as a group of two butalso that their knowledge of, and joy in human relationships have been immeasurablyincreased.122"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREE;The Mechanics of AberrationAccording to the basic theory of Dianetics, theta, by which is meant the life force, lifeenergy, divine energy, elan vital, or by any other name, the energy peculiar to life which actsupon material in the physical universe and animates it, mobilizes it and changes it, issusceptible to alteration in character or vibration, at which time it becomes enturbulated theta orentheta.A description of pure theta acting in a harmonious control of MEST is to be found alongthe 4.0 band of the chart. Here we see theta with an affinity very high in all spheres ofattraction, capable of high communication both perceptically and with ideas, and with a highsense and appreciation of reality. An individual whose theta is unenturbulated in his currentenvironment, whose education is not enturbulated by poor data and bad teachers in anunreasonable culture, and from whose life has been deleted all the physical and mental pain,given an average genetic background, would be a very high order of clear. The things whichreduce the individual down from the state of clear and bring him lower on the tone scale wouldbe a turbulent and unhappy environment, a poor and unreasonable education in a not toorational culture, poor physical endowment, and what is most important to the auditor, thetatrapped as entheta in moments of physical pain and further theta trapped as charge as laterconsequences of that physical pain.So far as the immediate address to the case is concerned, the auditor might conceive of acase as potentially relatively pure theta, though modified by environment, education, andphysical endowment. But this theta has in past moments of pain and sorrow become, at leastsome portion of it, converted to entheta which is held at various moments of a person’s past.By methods of processing, the auditor frees the entheta, which automatically converts to thetaand becomes available to the individuals general action in life and so raises him automaticallyon the tone scale.Physical pain could be said to be the alarm reaction to theta that the organism has beentoo heavily impinged upon MEST. Physical pain is an abrupt and sharp warning of non-survival. Without a mechanism of physical pain no organism could be warned of physicaldangers through experiencing pain, and so no organism could survive, since no organismwould have a perception of destruction. Thus, physical pain is actually a perceptic, just assight and sound are perceptics. Physical pain as a perception mechanism lies immediatelybehind every other perception mechanism, since too much light can cause pain, too muchsound can cause pain, too much motion can cause pain, and so forth. MEST, which is to saythe physical universe of matter, energy, space and time, is perceived by the theta of theorganism through the various perceptions of sight, sound, motion, organic state, and so forth.The moment any of these grows too intense, theta’s orderly and harmonious control of MESTundergoes a shock of interruption. The theta and MEST brought too closely together inturbulence thus form entheta and enMEST.Every individual has a time track. This is simply all of the perceptions of a lifetime fromconception to present time -- the organism time track. Every moment of now -- present time --finds the organism registering by perception some portion of the physical universe. Theseperceptions are stored in what is called the standard memory bank if they are analytical and notphysically painful or in the reactive memory bank if they contain physical pain. Thus, theseperceptions are stored in an unending continuation from the first moment of cellular lifeforward to present time. The time track is a consecutive series of nows, through day and night,week, month, and year for all the lifetime.Each time the perceptions by reason of severe turbulence record as physical pain, thetheta present could be said to be converted and held there static by enMEST. Every physicallypainful recording is missing from the time track so far as standard memory is concerned and is123"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"filed instead in the reactive bank. Each time this occurs less theta is apparently available to theanalyzing and conscious portion of the person’s being and becomes a debit on the entheta sideof the ledger. So long as the individual possesses proportionately more theta than entheta he isfairly well up the tone scale but when the trapped entheta begins to outweigh the theta theindividual is brought down the tone scale to a non-survival level. The position of the person onthe tone scale determines not only his potential for happiness but also his longevity.Immortality can be measured in many ways. The higher a person is on the tone scale the morehe tends towards immortality. The lower a person is on the tone scale the more he tendstoward death. The amount of theta in the case determines the amount of survival potential ofthe individual and the amount of entheta in the case determines the amount of non-survivalpotential.The auditor, by processing, frees the entheta from the case, thus increasing the survivalpotential of the individual. The processes which free entheta and convert it into theta may beformidable in theory but in practice are quite simple and may be done by rote, since it is thenature of theta readily to convert back to its free and un-enturbulated state when given simpleassistance.It should be thoroughly understood by the auditor that according to theory, confirmedby observation in practice, no entheta exists unless it has as its basic cause physical pain.It should be no less well understood that theta contacting smaller quantities of enthetaconverts the entheta into theta. This is a two-way conversion. Entheta, in proximity to theta,makes entheta out of it. From this we have the contagion of aberration. It was once thoughtthat insanity was inherited. It is true that a genetic endowment in terms of structure or anendowment of too small a quantity of theta may predispose one person more than others toinsanity, but only the the vicinity of entheta. Of course, there can be the insanity of malformedbrains, where some of the perception and computation mechanisms are absent, but this type ofinsanity results only in inability to think, not in aberrated thinking. It is not true, then, thatinsanity is hereditary. Insanity, apparently, comes about wholly by contagion. Anenturbulated culture or environment can keep an individual in a continuous state of turbulence,but, lacking engrams, that individual would cease to be enturbulated as soon as he removedhimself from the source of the turbulence. People who are insane bring those around themmarkedly down on the tone scale and could be said to be responsible for all the existing insanityin the race. If one associates with badly aberrated individuals one will himself, inconsequence, become badly aberrated, if only while in the vicinity of the badly aberratedassociates.There is an apparent family line of aberration. It was previously thought to be carriedgenetically, but this is evidently not the case. It is carried on the thought channel of the family.The confusions of domestic life get into the moments of physical injury of the child, and thechild as a consequence becomes liable for the family aberrations and will manifest them.The principle of the contagion of aberration is broad in scope. One can observe in anygroup of men that one or two may be much more aberrated than the others. One can make thesimple experiment of removing the one or two aberrated Persons from the group, and he willthen see that the general tone level of the group will rise, since the source of the group’s mainturbulence has been removed.By examining the life of any preclear, his case history, and without examining any ofthe preclear’s own aberrations, the auditor can make a good estimate of many of the preclear’saberrations simply by discovering what manner of people the parents were. It is an inexorablefact that these aberrations, one way or another, will manifest themselves in the preclear.The auditor should fully understand the principle of contagion. Fortunately, theconversion works in both directions. Sanity is also contagious. Thus, by observing theauditor’s code and providing a sane environ for his preclear, the auditor can bring some of the124"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"entheta in the preclear’s case back into the state of theta without any processing. This isparticularly valuable in the treatment of psychotics.There could be said to be three divisions of entheta. Basically, the only way enthetacomes into being in any life form is through physical injury, but after the physical injury ispresent the entheta in it contagious into the theta involved in circumstances that approach orapproximate those of the physical injury. When this happens we have another kind of entheta:locks formed by restimulation. The shocks of conscious moments, the griefs and sorrows, thefears and angers, the breaks of affinity, communication and reality which one has with lifewould be the third kind of entheta, which would be temporary entheta if it were not for thepresence of physical injury and its entheta in the case. To make this plainer, first there is theengram. This is physical pain, enMEST and entheta held at a specific point on the time track.This might never become serious but for restimulation by the environment. When this engrambecomes restimulated it makes much of the existing free theta in the organism turbulent. Someof this turbulence remains as additional frozen entheta, some of it un-enturbulates and becomestheta again.The engram, a moment of physical pain, forms the basis for entheta, and having formedit, little by little, by contagion steals free theta from the individual and makes it into entheta“permanently” in the form of secondary engrams and locks. At the moment of restimulation,perhaps nearly all of the individual’s theta becomes enturbulated, but this more or less rapidlyun-enturbulates, or settles out, and becomes theta again.One could, then, have a picture of a time track as a straight line from conception topresent time. At some early point on this time track there is a moment of physical injury. Alittle later on the track this moment is approximated by the environment. This would be a key-in. Actually, the individual has to be more or less enturbulated by the general environmentwhen the key-in takes place, which is to say he would have to be worried or tired or perhapsonly annoyed about something.This key-in now gives the engram more power and strength. The next time the engramis restimulated another lock is added and would be marked as a third point on the track. Thenlet us say that some loss takes place which approximates in some way or ways this originalengram. If it were such a thing as the death of a loved one an enormous amount ofenturbulence would take place. The turbulence by its very magnitude approximates the natureof physical pain. A very large amount of theta becomes trapped by the physical pain. Thiswould be called a secondary engram. The difference between a secondary engram and a lock isthe order of magnitude of the trapped theta, that is, entheta. Each time a secondary occurs thewhole of the theta of the individual may be temporarily enturbulated, but only a small portionremains frozen as entheta, and the remaining enturbulated theta converts back into free theta.Thus one can see that as life progresses, more and more theta becomes fixed as entheta in locksand secondary engrams, and less and less theta is available to the organism for purposes ofreason. This is called the dwindling spiral. It is so called because the more entheta there is onthe case, the more theta will be turned into entheta at each new restimulation. It is a three-dimensional vicious circle which carries the individual down the tone scale. In a child, very fewlocks and secondaries have been formed and so the child’s theta is free and the child’s tone ishigh, yet even though this child receives no more engrams for several years, the engrams healready has may gradually be charged up by locks and secondaries until he has less free thetathan entheta, at which time he would be very low on the tone scale.It may also happen that some enormous success in life, an extremely happy marriage,or association with high-theta individuals will work on the reactive bank to convert it withoutprocessing, at least in part, back into free theta. Here is the calmness of the aberrated personwho quits the turbulent world, for instance, and takes the vows of the church. In this newenvironment he has fewer approximations of his old locks and engrams, but more importantly,he is in the vicinity of far more theta, and he will as a consequence dis-enturbulate, andtherefore rise on the tone scale.125"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"Similarly, that person who is idle, without goal or direction, may find his accumulationof secondaries and locks is far greater, since his theta, being idle, is already slightlyenturbulated. This individual may become very busy in the pursuit of some definite andworthwhile goal, and his theta, thus un-enturbulated, will rob his locks and secondaries ofsome of the entheta they contain.An individual who in one environ may have been living under extremely unhealthyconditions may change his mode of existence so as to include exercise, sunshine and fresh air,and this change bringing about a better physical condition will itself un-enturbulate theindividual to some degree.Dianetic processing does simply this: It uses the theta of the preclear, as aided by thetheta of the auditor, to disenturbulate the entheta contained in the preclear’s locks, secondariesand engrams.The goal of the auditor is to dis-enturbulate entheta, not necessarily to run engrams or toconcentrate on locks or secondaries, one more than another. In various cases variousconditions exist which make it necessary to address first one and then another of these threetypes of entheta. The auditor should thoroughly understand the anatomy of the engram, as wellas that of the secondary and of the lock.An engram comes about when the individual organism suffers an intense impact withMEST. This is actual physical pain. It may occur in any portion of the body and may be fromsimply too intense a reception of light or sound, erosion, as in chafing or sunburn, cuts,contusions, fractures, organic derangements, overdoses of poisonous substances, attacks bybacteria and viruses, or any usual or unusual cause of physical pain. Every moment of physicalpains contains with it a partial or major shutdown of the analytical function of the mind.Consciousness may be interrupted for a moment or for days by physical pain, but regardless ofthe duration, physical pain always brings about lowered consciousness. One may not realizethis completely until one has had erased from him an instant in which he burned his finger, orsomething equally inconsequential. He will learn that while he had supposed he kneweverything that happened during that moment of pain, some data yet remained hiddenconcerning the incident. This missing data is the content of the reactive mind.The engram contains all of the perceptions present during the period of its receipt.Before Dianetics, this was not realized. It was thought that an unconscious person was simplyunconscious and that things which were said to him and that other perceptible entities whichimpinged upon him went unrecorded. No matter the depth of unconsciousness in the presenceof physical pain, the reactive mind records fully and completely all the perceptions possible inthe environ, including the physical pain. During an operation involving anesthesia, forinstance, all the physical pain, the doctor’s words, the smell of the ether, the nurse’s footsteps,the feel of the table, and the functions of the internal organs, amongst other things, are recordedin full in the reactive mind of the individual, as an engram.If one is acquainted with hypnotism, one can readily understand the compulsive orobsessive character of data which is out of sight of the conscious mind but which is yet forced28 upon it from below by the drive of physical pain. Hidden data and hidden pain causeidentity thinking, so that the power to differentiate and thus to reason is reduced. An individualobeys engrams literally. When an engram is restimulated the individual may dramatize theengram, or go through the cycle of action demanded by the engram, if it can be dramatized.Dramatized or not, the engram, containing unconsciousness, reduces the analytical awarenessof the individual, and a person who has many engrams in restimulation is ordinarily less thanone-quarter analytically aware, and can still be considered normal.The entheta of the engram makes it possible for locks to form. The engram isrestimulated in the individual when he is less analytically alert than ordinarily, by reason ofweariness or other non-optimum conditions. The engram may contain certain perceptics whichare duplicated in the immediate environ of the individual. This approximation of the environ to126"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"the engram brings about an identification of the exterior world with the interior world ofengrams, and so brings about restimulation of the engram. This restimulation manifests itselfin the enturbulation of the individual. The process of enturbulation fixes into the engram someof the individual’s theta, “permanently” converting it to entheta. The first time an engram isrestimulated (and one may lie dormant for forty years without being restimulated) is called akey-in. A key-in is merely a special kind of lock, the first lock on a particular engram.The secondary engram takes place when the turbulence of the individual is very high.Anger, fear, grief, or apathy may be occasioned by the environment and if a physical painengram underlies this situation and even vaguely approximates it in perceptics, enormousquantities of theta are trapped as entheta in the secondary. The secondary engram is enormouslyimportant. It is run exactly like a physical pain engram. The secondary stores such largequantities of entheta that remarkable results are often obtained by running one simple secondaryengram. The auditor should understand thoroughly, however, that no secondary engram canexist unless a physical pain engram underlies it. In running a secondary engram the auditormay often discover that with it he is running also a physical pain engram.Affinity, communication, and reality enforcements and breaks in a case are notspecialized types of secondaries or locks but are only the component parts of secondaries andlocks. Any physical pain engram is a break of affinity between theta and MEST and is, indeed,the basic affinity break. The break of affinity brings about reduction of communication sincethe theta no longer wishes to approach this type of MEST as avidly as before. And as the thetais not in harmonious agreement with MEST, the reality is reduced. Here we have, in affinity,communication, and reality breaks, the basic cause of trouble in any organism. The intent oftheta is harmoniously to conquer MEST and when MEST reacts suddenly and without warningagainst the theta organism the basic impulse of that theta is thwarted. Thus, the engram couldbe said to be the basis of all aberration, and by observation and experience this postulate seemsto be adequately confirmed.The engram becomes charged up with entheta through the process of the individual’sacquiring locks and secondaries. An engram which is too highly charged not only cannot berun but ordinarily cannot even be contacted, until secondaries and locks are reduced. Thus, inmost cases the first address of the auditor is to locks and then secondaries and then engrams,with the treatment of more locks and secondaries to make available more engrams.The whole purpose of the auditor is to change entheta to theta as rapidly and asefficiently as possible. Where he gets the entheta, whether out of engrams, secondaries, orlocks, is of no basic concern. Theta is theta.127"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR;The Dynamics of ExistenceBehind Dianetics there is considerable technology concerning knowledge itself andgeneral philosophies about thinking without which Dianetics could not have come intoexistence.The major postulate of Dianetics is:THE DYNAMIC PRINCIPLE OF EXISTENCE IS SURVIVE.Theta (where its purpose is the conquest of MEST), life, and organisms have no otherprinciple than survive as their motivation. The opposite to this motivation is succumb.The failure to survive is to succumb.Theta as an energy, insofar as we observe it in organisms which are partially MEST,survives or succumbs. MEST, in accordance with the most fundamental physical laws and theconservation of energy, survives or succumbs. It will be notedTwo basic axioms about knowledge are as follows: Axiom One: A datum is importantas it is evaluated in terms of survive or succumb; Axiom Two; A datum can only be evaluatedby data of comparable magnitude. The basic unit of both the theta and the MEST universes isTwo, not One.Dimaxian geometry, the three-dimensional mathematics of space, has comparableaxioms and values, evidently, in the theta universe. The basic unit of One as a postulate isimpossible, since it has nothing by which it can be evaluated; therefore, the basic unit of Two isnecessary. Attempting to postulate anything on the basis of One as the basic unit brings aboutconsiderable disorder in thought. The Supreme Being, for instance, has as the second datumfor evaluation the Devil. The Supreme Being is Survive. The Devil is Succumb. The basicpostulate of Dianetics contains as an understood portion the fact that survive is matched bysuccumb.In both cases that succumbing is apparently the conversion of the energy into anotherform. Theta converting into entheta travels from survive to succumb, but the energy is not lost,and death is one of the freeing mechanisms by which the theta is able to become momentarilyindependent of MEST and so combine again with MEST, forming another organism to carryalong the generations. In the physical universe, energy survives but the forms the energy takesoften succumb and change into other energy forms.The chart of the tone scale divides at 2.0. Above this point the direction of dynamicaction of the organism is toward survival. The organism will seek higher levels of survival,will try to live as long as possible and as well as possible, both of which are components ofsurvival, since in general the more bountiful the existence, the better the potentials of survival.Below 2.0, the dynamic action of the organism tends toward succumb. The individualmay apparently engage upon survival activities but will do something to bring about anonsurvival end, regardless of what activity the individual engages upon. Below 2.0, theindividual will tend toward the death of himself, sex, the future, groups, or mankind. He isdestructive toward life. He makes enMEST out of any MEST he may have at hand or caninfluence. He repels theta and attracts entheta. This is the band of the immoral, thepromiscuous, the criminal, the Godless, the suicide, and other undesirables. Whatever actionis taken by the individual who is acutely or chronically below 2.0 will tend toward the death ofhimself or anything with which he is association. His avowals may be entirely different, andhe may even himself believe that he seeks higher survival levels, but the end product of his128"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"actions, whether these actions apply to a business, to a marriage, to a friendship, to a group, orto a religion will be death or some undesirable non-survival situation, which of course itselftends toward death. It is not realized generally that the criminal is not only anti-social but is alsoanti-self. Anyone below 2.0 is a potential or active criminal, in that crimes against the pro-survival actions of others are continually perpetrated. Crime might be defined as the reductionof the survival level along any one of the eight dynamics.Good can be considered to be any constructive survival action. It happens that noconstruction can take place without some small destruction, just as the tenement must be torndown to make room for the new apartment building. Good is further modified by the viewpointof the individual. To be good, something must contribute to the individual, to his family, hischildren, his group, mankind, or life. To be good, a thing must contain construction whichoutweighs the destruction it contains. A new cure which saves a hundred and kills one is anacceptable cure. What is good from the viewpoint of one person may be bad for anotherperson. In the case of A who gets a new job, this is good for A, but perhaps bad for B, whowas released so that A could have the job. Good is survival. Good is being right more thanone is wrong. Good The old adages about the forces of good and the forces of evil areamazingly apt when one studies men from the standpoint of the theta-MEST theory. In order tounderstand this further perhaps one should offer the dianetic axioms for good and for evil.Police are continually baffled by the irrationality of the criminal. Since police officersare, ordinarily, rational men and tend themselves toward survival, they sometimes cannotreadily comprehend that the criminal habitually takes the route of non-survival for himself andhis group. No matter the criminal’s I.Q. he will leave obvious clues on the scene. He will fleefrom crimes at a rate of speed calculated to attract the attention of any traffic officer. Trapped ina criminal act which has as its penalty as little as thirty days in jail, the criminal may attempt touse weapons against police, and thus commit suicide at the expense of some worthy officer’slife. The most baffling thing in police work is an attempt to deduce motives using any kind of arational yardstick upon the criminal. The only motive the criminal has is destruction along anyone of the dynamics, including the first. It sometimes happens that if a criminal is promisednon-survival in return for information he will gladly make the trade, where as he refuses to giveinformation in return for liberty and continued good health. Those who aid criminals or dealwith them know, to their sorrow, that the criminal ordinarily repays a helping hand withdestructive actions. Parole boards are rendered particularly dismayed by the numbers of timestheir extension of liberty, on certain conditions, is repaid by destructive action. Police have forsome time looked for a proper definition for a true criminal. Men should be removed fromsociety only when they constitute a continual or occasional threat to that society. An answer tothis problem may be found in the accompanying chart.Good is being more successful than one is unsuccessful, along constructive lines.Things are good which complement the survival of the individual, his family, children, group,mankind, life, and MEST. Acts are good which are more beneficial than destructive alongthese dynamics, as modified by the viewpoint of the individual, the future race, the group,mankind, life, or MEST.Evil is the opposite of good, and is anything which is destructive more than it isconstructive along any of the various dynamics. A thing which does more destruction thanconstruction is evil from the viewpoint of the individual, the future, group, species, life, orMEST that it destroys. When an act is more destructive than constructive, it is evil. When anact assists succumbing more than it assists survival, it is an evil act in the proportion that itdestroys. A thing is evil which threatens more destruction than construction for the individual,future, group, mankind, life or MEST.Good, bluntly, is survival. Evil is non-survival. Construction is good when itpromotes survival. Destruction is bad when it inhibits survival. Construction is evil when itinhibits survival. Destruction is good when it enhances survival.129"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"An act or conclusion is as right as it promotes the survival of the individual, future,group, mankind, or life making the conclusion. To be entirely right would be to survive toinfinity.An act or conclusion is wrong to the degree that it is nonsurvival to the individual,future race, group, species, or life responsible for doing the act or making the conclusion. Themost wrong a person can be on the first dynamic is dead.The individual or group which is, on the average, righter than wrong (since these termsare not absolutes, by far) should survive. An individual who is wronger than right, on theaverage, will succumb. All conclusions are modified by time, since one conclusion madewrong during an emergency can cause the non-survival of the individual or the group.Individuals above 2.0 on the tone scale are more and more right in their actions andconclusions than they are wrong, as they rise up the tone scale. Individuals below 2.0 are, onthe average, increasingly more wrong than they are right, in all fields, as they descend the tonescale.Accepting these postulates and axioms, it can then be observed that one can predict tosome degree what he may expect from individuals above or below 2.0 on the tone scale. Areasonable individual attempts to read into the acts of others some reason. An individual who istending toward survival tends to evaluate the conduct of others in terms of efforts to survive.He may see in an individual below 2.0 what he thinks is merely an aberrated inaccuracy or anoccasional mistake, but closer observation will demonstrate that the individual below 2.0 isaggregating numerous mistakes, even while being occasionally right, and is tending to bringabout the non-survival of himself, of the future, of the group, and by contagion, the mankindof which he would like to be a part. Below 2.0 lies fatality. That fatality may be manifested ona gradient scale. It may only be nagging or forgetfulness or occasional gossip, but it isdestructive and it is evil. In an older time a stern voice could have said that those who lie below2.0 are the servants of evil and the minions of the devil. These few axioms should give theauditor some ability to predict actions and to know the reasons he should expect certain actionson the part of preclears.Very little experimental evidence exists with regard to many aspects of the theta bodyor, as it might otherwise be called, the individual soul. It is distinct from cellular or genetic lineand apparently has its own personality and follows in a continuing line along the variousgenerations, possibly now and then advancing to a point where it separates itself from the raceand joins the theta universe. The data accumulated would also seem to indicate that someentheta is carried forward along the line of the generations, since engrams in the theta bodyexist, if to a much lighter extent, specifically the death engram, where the theta body is verymuch in evidence -- so much so that if the auditor neglects to run the death engram of a past lifewhen it is presented by the preclear, he will without fail bog down his case. There seems to hea distinct possibility that the theta body might begin, through the generations, to carrypreponderance of entheta by being too continually in the lower area of the tone scale. It couldbe postulated that the theta body might become an entheta body entirely, and so drop out of thesurvival concatenations, to what destination one cannot surely say.130"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE;General Description of ProcessingDianetic processing is relatively simple. The auditor usually assists the preclear,provided, with an easy chair and a couch. The preclear at first normally sits up and answersthe questions of the inventory. This actually is the beginning of processing, although it mayappear that the auditor is merely seeking information which he can later use. During theinventory, the interest of the auditor in the preclear builds up affinity between them. Thediscussion of the case increases communication. And the auditor’s acceptance of the preclear’sfirst evaluation of his own case builds up a sense of reality. The auditor can tear down thesedesirable ARC conditions by being bored, uninterested in his preclear, peremptory, demandingthat less time be consumed, criticising the preclear in any way, or in general breaking theauditor’s code.The auditor then makes a test of the case, finding out whether or not the preclear canmove on the track, finding out whether the preclear’s memory is good, and estimating whatlevel of the tone scale his preclear probably occupies.CAUTION: THE AUDITOR UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD TELL THEPRECLEAR WHERE HE THINKS THE PRECLEAR LIES ON THE CHART.He should not be involved in any way into disclosing where he thinks the preclear lieson the chart, since a low value on the chart for the preclear is, in effect, an invalidation of thepreclear himself. (The auditor does not have to disclose this information even by the way hestarts his processing, for any case can expect to be given lock scanning and straight wire. Acase may be actually well up the tone scale but so occluded that lock scanning and straight wiremust be employed.) The auditor furthers his investigation of the case by asking the preclear tolie down on the couch and close his eyes. In the past there was some confusion about thecondition called reverie. The only difference between being in reverie and being awake isactually being in or out of present time. Reverie is not even a cousin to hypnotism. Theauditor, contrary to any early practice, does not count the preclear into a state of reverie orconcentration. The moment he asks the preclear to close his eyes and the preclear complies, theauditor can consider the preclear to be in reverie. If the preclear does not move on the track,this is not caused by failure to be in reverie, but by being stuck in an engram or having aheavily charged case.The auditor tests out the perceptics of the preclear by simply asking the preclear to goback to a recent meal he has eaten or a recent pleasure moment and having him recount thismoment over several times, not as a concept of the moment, but as if he were right on the scenedoing again the things which he did before. This is called testing or tuning the perceptics. Theauditor here is attempting to discover whether or not the preclear can actually taste again a steakhe has eaten, sec again the scene he has viewed exactly as it was, feel again the knife and forkin his hands, hear again the conversation around him, feel again his weight upon the chair, andin general re-experience the incident. Running several such pleasure moments, it occasionallyhappens that some of the occluded perceptics tune up and turn on. In any event, runningpleasure moments is very good for raising the tone of the preclear.Having run a perceptic test, the auditor takes the preclear, merely by asking him to go toa moment when he was very slightly injured, to the point on the track where he has a somatic.The auditor runs the incident. The somatic, if felt at all, will ordinarily reduce. This should bea recent moment of physical pain and should be a very minor one such as a cut finger or astubbed toe. This gives the preclear some idea of what he is expected to do. The auditor shouldpay particular attention to the fact that he is actually educating his preclear into track movement.The preclear may have to be coaxed several times before he gets the idea of being back in anincident and re-experiencing it. He may try to give merely the concept of the incident instead ofperceiving it as though he were right there going through it again. He might try to free-131"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"associate and so wander around all over the track getting odds and ends and bits of informationwhich are relatively valueless.After estimating the perceptics, the auditor should continue according to the chart, onwhich by this time he should have thoroughly located his preclear. (Questions of almostunlimited variety will have been asked by the auditor. Simply by using the data in variouscolumns and levels on the chart, he can avoid a stereotyped approach and be sure of turning upthe information he needs.) The most significant points on the test run are movement on thetrack and the ability of the preclear to feel somatics. The auditor continues processingaccording to the chart, occasionally checking the preclear for any rise on the tone scale, and ifhe finds a rise in tone he may use additional methods, as delineated on the chart. The auditorshould be particularly chary of using on the preclear methods which are above his tone level. Itis better to err by using methods below the preclear’s tone level. Those individuals who arerelatively low on the tone scale have so little free theta available for processing that it must bepreserved and added to by the gentlest and lightest methods possible for some time until thepreclear’s tone rises.Should the auditor discover that the preclear lies high in one column and low in anothercolumn he should take an average and by this discover the approximate position on the tonescale.If the auditor is unable immediately to establish the preclear on the tone scale it is, ingeneral, safe to use lock scanning without much investigation of the case. Even a case which isstuck on the time track can be lock scanned. If the preclear is scanned through his locks andsticks in one of these locks, the auditor can generally free him by running pleasure moments orscanning pleasure moments, if he does not want to run the incident in which the preclear ishung up. Even when stuck in an engram preclears usually can be lock scanned.The auditor should not be beguiled or sent astray by the wide-open case. This case is avery peculiar thing, as discussed elsewhere. Sonic and visio can be on full from the top to thebottom of the tone scale, but trying to run engrams on a wide-open case, as engrams, when thecase is at 0.5 or 1.1, will bring about a long and arduous course of processing in which thepreclear will remain more or less static on the tone scale regardless of how many engrams arerun out of the case. When such a case, or any case, is low on the tone scale, the running ofengrams absorbs free theta. Further, the preclear will consistently combat running engrams,since when any preclear is below 2.0, his tendency is toward death, suicide, or further decline.No plans or hopes for the future, no coaxings, nothing will persuade this preclear to doanything very arduous to help himself. A preclear low on the tone scale may, however, bepersuaded into some of the milder methods of processing, since they do not occasion mucheffort and actually do not seem to threaten his intended decline-since, make no mistake, thepreclear below 2.0 will try one way or another, by knowing or unknowing intent, to bringabout failures and consequent death to himself, his associates, and his group. The wide-opencase must be established on the tone scale by columns other than visio and sonic. It is bestlocated by its sense of reality, sexual behavior, other manifestations, and the condition of thesomatics. The wide-open case which is low on the tone scale must be handled with great care,since here we have, unlike the occluded case, a persistence so low that the individual drifts atthe command of any engram or changes course at the slightest pressure from the environment.The wide-open case low on the tone scale has no feelings of responsibility toward self, future,or group, save aberrated ones. Persistence is so slight that any auditing errors can cause thecase to withdraw from processing. Here is an individual who climbs molehills as though theywere mountains. This case can be the greatest trial to the auditor and will render,unfortunately, the most unsatisfying final results. The wide-open case can, of course, be lowon the tone scale only temporarily, because of some environmental situation. If so, the auditorhad better extend himself if he can to clear up this situation before he begins auditing.This case is also a great liability to the auditor, when low on the tone scale, because ofits vagaries of behavior. If a woman, she may offer herself freely to the auditor, disregardingher position in life, her husband, the future she may blast by doing so, the fate of any childrenshe may have, or any other consideration. Woe betide the luckless male auditing such a case132"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"who involves himself with this bundle of destruction, since as she would betray another so shewill betray him; as she will be dishonest with another so she will be dishonest with the auditor.The dishonesty will extend not only to treachery and betrayal, wherein she may freelysurrender to the auditor and then go directly to the police to have him arrested for seduction,and wherein she may promise the greatest secrecy around any liaison and yet strew all aboutevidence of that liaison, but she will also be dishonest when being run and will, for no otherreason than to confuse the picture, deliver up the most twisted and perverted scenes of her ownlife. Raised amid riches, she will represent herself as having been a pauper. Raised a pauper,she will represent herself as a princess. She will normally have pride in her ability to act, andwill commonly writhe and moan and weep over some incident that she quite consciouslyknows to be imaginary. The male wide-open case is no less difficult and trying. No trust ofany kind can be placed in a wide-open case when it is below 2.0 on the tone-scale, and for thatmatter no trust can be put in an occluded case below 2.0 on the tone scale, but the wide-opencase is far more deceptive and far more prone to wide vagaries in behavior and delusion.The auditor will have his problems with preclears who want attention but notprocessing. These preclears are automatically classified as below 2.0. This is the quickest chartlocation which can be done. The preclear who wants no kind of processing whatsoever, eventhough he understands some of the principles involved and knows they will not be harmful,and the preclear who wants no processing but to be hovered over are both headed towardsuccumb and will do their best to pull the auditor with them. The auditor should employ hisingenuity, if he will continue processing them. He should use very light methods and a catfootapproach, and he may be able to raise his preclear enough above 2.0 to cause a continuingdirection toward survival.It should be borne in mind by the auditor when he is doing his inventory and when heis locating his preclear on the chart that people below 2.0 may not be immediately obvious.Their acceptance of processing may be only a method of securing attention. In some cases, thepreclear’s entire educational background may have to be lock scanned before the preclear canfeel any genuine desire for improvement. Entheta ideas picked up in high school, college, thearmy or a political movement may sit squarely in the way of any rise on the tone scale.The auditor should remember that the contest is between his own theta, hisreasonableness, his serenity, and his persistence, and the entheta of the preclear, the preclear’slocks, secondaries and engrams. The moment the auditor permits his own entheta to attack thepreclear, turbulence is produced and a reduction of the preclear on the tone scale will ensue.Thus, becoming angry or critical toward the preclear reverses processing. The preclear is notresponsible for his engrams.The auditor, poor fellow, must retain his patience even under upbraidings from thepreclear. The auditor must never justify himself when the preclear thinks he has made amistake. For the auditor to explain how it was not a mistake is only further to enturbulate thesituation.The auditor is concerned with what has been done to the preclear, not what has beendone by the preclear. The auditor should exhibit no morbid curiosity about the acts of thepreclear. He should not inquire into the preclear’s own doings unless he needs to find in thedramatizations of the preclear a clue to the engrams which caused the dramatizations.When the preclear is returned to some point prior to present time at the auditor’srequest, the auditor should under no circumstances use more words than are absolutelynecessary, and should at this time in particular be careful to observe the auditor’s code, sincethe incident may contain anaten and the preclear may be receptive to hypnotic suggestions.This is also true of a boil-off. The auditor should not talk to the preclear during a boil-off,should not try to wrestle the preclear into alertness out of the feeling that the preclear is merelytrying to go to sleep.133"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Sessions may be of whatever duration and frequency during the week are agreed uponby the auditor and preclear. Two-hour sessions are usually considered minimum, since itoccasionally takes that long to contact and run out enough engrams or to do enough lockscanning to make the session worthwhile. Six hours of processing a day may be done withoutloss of efficiency, and this can be done seven days a week without harm to the preclear. Itshould be added that medical doctors advise that under such heavy processing a balancedvitamin ration be used by the preclear, who otherwise may suffer nightmares, since it isapparent that the running of engrams reduces the amount of vitamin B1 in the system.Experience at the Foundation demonstrates some additional precautions which shouldbe taken with preclears. The auditor should make sure that the Preclear is not audited when heis tired, that he is not audited late at night when by habit he would be sleeping, that he hasadequate rest, and that he is not audited during periods when his present-time environment isintensely restimulative to him. Those preclears with whom the Foundation has had any troublewere found to have been audited late at night, having inadequate food and B1 intake, duringintensely restimulative environmental circumstances (which might in any case have caused themto drop on the tone scale) and when they were physically weary. All of these people hadpsychotic histories. While such trouble has not been had by the Foundation to a tenth of apercent of that, proportionately, experienced by practitioners of non-dianetic methods, theFoundation has instituted a careful Programme to avoid such conditions and circumstances.The general progress of the case would be to use straight wire, then use some lockscanning, then to run some secondary engrams to relieve some grief or fear, and then begin anerasure of the case by contacting this first moment of pain or discomfort in this lifetime, whichis ordinarily found somewhere in the vicinity of conception. If enough entheta has beenconverted to theta on the case, the first engram will erase. If it will not erase, then too muchcharge still exists in secondaries and locks. When the first engram in the case, known as basic-basic, has been erased, the next consecutive engram should be contacted and erased in its turn,and so on up the bank toward present time. Somewhere up the line it will be found that griefhas presented itself and it will be necessary to run out some more secondary engrams. Whenthis has been done, the preclear is sent back again to the first moment of pain orunconsciousness which can then be found on the case. Basic area engrams will probably havepresented themselves. These are erased consecutively toward present time until further troubledevelops. Then more secondaries are run, more locks are scanned, and the preclear is returnedagain to the basic area, where an erasure is continued. Sooner or later this erasure will continueall the way forward to present time. Then, after running a few isolated missed engrams theauditor will have on his hands a clear, provided the auditor was far enough up the tone scale inthe first place to encourage the de-enturbulation of this case to the point where it could runengrams.The auditor may find an occluded case so heavily charged with engrams that the casecan only boil off: This will appear to be a form of sleep, and the auditor may feel that he isbeing cheated of his opportunity to perform. In such a case, no matter how many hours ofprocessing are consumed by this apparent sleep, the “sleep” must not be disturbed, but whenthe preclear comes out of it, the phrase on which he went into the boil-off should be repeatedagain, thus putting him back into the “sleep.” In such a way, enormous quantities of anaten areunburdened from the case.The auditor may find himself confronted with a preclear who will run only phrases andcannot seem to get a whole incident anywhere. Much lock scanning should be done with thispreclear, but it is also of benefit to permit the preclear to run these fragments of aberrativephrases, since sooner or later one of them will cause the preclear to boil-off or suddenly to hit agrief charge.No case of any kind should dismay the auditor. With these presented techniques oflock scanning, running secondaries, running engrams, boil-offs, straight memory, and evenrunning disjointed phrases, any case which can be persuaded to work at all will resolve.134"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The auditor should be particularly wary of running his preclear into any heavily chargedsecondary unless the auditor intends to run the preclear through it again and again and againuntil the charge is reduced regardless of how much the preclear wants not to continue it andregardless of how much the preclear may use to get out of it. This sometimes requires muchcourage on the part of the auditor, since the terror and agony of the preclear or the extremity ofthe grief may cause the auditor, out of misguided sympathy, to relent in the face of such asecondary engram.The auditor should be careful of running a heavily charged case into more than the casecan handle. Processing should be as non-directive as possible, the auditor saying only enoughto get the case running. Most auditors talk too much.The auditor should never confuse his role with psychotherapy or with medicine. Themedical doctor is important in the society. Bacteria are bacteria. Bruises, contusions, brokenbones, and obstetrics will be with us for a long while. The auditor, because he can sweep asidewith ease most of the manifestations which were formerly called psychosomatic illnesses,should not discount the reality of many kinds of physical disorders. The auditor is trying tobring the individual up the tone scale. Incidentally, this by-passes the individual around themajority of physical troubles and complexes and obsessions, but it does not obviate theoccasional necessity of medical treatment for the preclear, and it unfortunately does not obviatethe institutionalization of the obviously insane, no matter what Dianetics can do for thesepeople. The auditor, then, should work in close union with medical doctors, helping them tounderstand what he is doing and helping them to understand Dianetics, and trying to educatemedical doctors into planting-fewer and lighter engrams. The auditor should ignore thehundreds of conflicting psychotherapies and eschew any of their practices, since the auditorwill learn, in the realm of experience, that giving advice to his preclear about how he shouldthink about his engrams and other aberrative manifestations is highly detrimental to the mentalhealth of the preclear.The auditor should realize he is working in a relatively low-toned and unenlightenedsociety. Dianetics will be invalidated to him continually, as with any constructive or creativeactivity. If the auditor simply goes forward, yanking cases up the tone scale, he will win hisbattle. He has in his hands tools more powerful than those which existed before. He shoulduse them.The auditor should not despair of any case. He can do something for any case whichwill even remotely give him its attention. There will be moments in the progress of any casewhen environmental circumstances hit a case hard or when an engram of unusual force is on itsway to the surface, when the case will apparently go into a decline. The auditor should notdespair because of this, since he only needs to revert to the types of processing marked out forlower levels of the tone scale, and so he may restore his preclear to the proper level. Theauditor should appreciate that a case progresses upwards, not in a steady line, but by swoopsand jerks, and that the average advance alone is steady. In days past, antiquated therapiesoccasionally triggered a manic engram. Not knowing about the cause of human aberration, thetherapists were content to assume that this sudden elation of the patient was indicative of anadvance. The auditor will learn that these sudden surges to new highs of well-being are simplysymptomatic of an engram which has as its content some highly complimentary phrases. Anauditor will often find his preclear claiming in high euphoria that he is now clear, only to havethe case regress within two or three days to a depressed state. The auditor, by lock scanning orrunning out the causative engram, can remedy this. The auditor will behold in the progress ofany case, while it is returned on the time track, some alarming manifestations. Running anengram which contains fever, the preclear’s temperature will rise. Running engrams early inlife, the preclear’s facial structure will change. Running engrams which are very highlycharged may cause the preclear to scream, to the point where the neighbors a block away willbe phoning for the police. None of these manifestations should worry the auditor. The onlyway the auditor can harm the preclear is to refrain from running out what has been contacted.If the auditor becomes alarmed because the preclear’s heart is beating at twice its normal speed,or because the preclear is moaning and weeping, and so tries to bring the preclear up to present135"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"time, the auditor is inviting trouble. The manifestation of an engram while the preclear isreturned may be slight. Brought to present time without the engram being reduced, themanifestation is many times increased. The somatic, at the point on the track where it occurred,may not be very great. In present time, the somatic is greatly intensified. Thus, the safestcourse is to run out whatever one contacts, even if one has to hold one’s ears; even if one’sobservation of the preclear seems to demonstrate clearly that here is a person become verysuddenly ill. The reduction of the engram or incident will bring about a complete revival of thepreclear.Above all else, the auditor should have faith in his tools. When he tells the preclear togo back to the time when he was five years of age, he should not then sit there and wonderwhether the preclear has returned to that time. Certainly some portion of the preclear’s mind hasgone to five years of age. The auditor deals with certainties. The auditor does not wonderabout the actions of the somatic strip and the file clerk. He takes what they give him. He runswhatever is necessary to resolve the case. He has complete confidence in his techniques and inhis own ability. With this complete confidence, which is in itself a manifestation of theta, theauditor can produce marked and remarkable results. If the auditor dilly-dallies with the case,wonders whether or not Dianetics works, wonders what’s happening, wonders whether heshouldn’t read chapter sixteen again, then looks at the preclear and thinks perhaps theseprenatal engrams are illusion or delusion, and begins to question people around the preclear,wondering if that was what happened to the preclear, and is in a high state of doubt abouteverything in general and the case in particular, he will not produce results.Results are what are desired. Well, clear-thinking, strong individuals are highlynecessary in this society at this time. They are so remarkably few.136"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX;COLUMN ABPresent TimeOne of the primary concerns of the auditor is present time. By “present-time” is meantthe current “now” on the time track. Actually the entire time track is only a consecutiveprogress of present times. When a preclear returns to an incident by going down the timetrack, he is returning to a present time which once existed. Because of action phrases such asgroupers, bouncers, denyers, misdirectors, and because of the heavy charge which can be on acase it occasionally occurs that he is continuously in some past present time. Further, when onefails to reduce an incident a case may be difficult to return to current present time. For thesereasons the auditor must understand clearly both the value of being in present time and themethods of returning the preclear to present time at the end of a session.The value of present time has already been illustrated by the fact that if one wentthrough a sanatorium and told patients one after the other “Come up to present time” a certainlow percentage of the inmates would thereupon become sane. The simple fact of being inpresent time is in itself a factor of sanity. At a certain sanatorium, some doctors made this testwith the patients, and one of these, who had been insane for a considerable period, whoordinarily refused to talk, and whose face was a mask of acne, responded to this command,and as a result of no other ministration returned to present time and to sanity. That nightaccording to report, she attended a sanatorium party and gave a speech about how glad she wasto be there. Within three days the acne had disappeared from her face, and while her sanity wasof course far from being a good risk, she manifested and was continuing to manifest sanitymany weeks afterward.There are, according to dianetic classification, two types of insane. The first type is thedramatizing psychotic. The second is the computational psychotic. The dramatizing psychoticgoes through the engram in which he stuck, over and over and over. It is acutely or chronicallyin restimulation, and his reactive mind causes his vocal chords and his body to go through thedramatization demanded by the engram. He is generally imprisoned in two or three engramsand goes from one to another of them ceaselessly. Such a case, of course, is heavily charged,and it does not do much good to try to run out the engrams. It is necessary to take charge offthe case and bring the case to present time. This is not very difficult if one can gain thepsychotic’s attention.The other type of insanity is computational. Here, the engram has walled up a certainportion of the analyzer as captured territory, and a circuit causes this portion of the analyzer tobe the whole of the being. The remainder of the analyzer is shut off, and the “I” of theindividual is not in evidence. The paranoiac is usually computationally insane, which is to sayhe does not dramatize like a phonograph, but actually appears to think up things. Theschizophrenic is an individual who has several portions of the analyzer segmented off bydifferent circuits, which are actually valences, and who goes from one to another of theseportions of the analyzer, only occasionally, if ever, becoming himself: Both the dramatizingpsychotic and the computational psychotic have the bulk of the analyzer completely shut off byanaten and by being out of present time. Present-time perceptics are not rationalized, since theyare entering upon an engram area. Probably the crux of the treatment of all psychotics is gettingthem into present time and stabilizing them there.All psychotics have heavily charged cases, and it is necessary one way or the other toreduce this charge. While this may appear an oversimplification of the problem, it also mightwell be that the problem is simple. The most difficult thing in the treatment of the psychotic isestablishing enough affinity, reality, and communication between the psychotic and the auditorto persuade the psychotic to do something to help himself. This can be done by mimicking the137"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"psychotic, which is a form of establishing affinity, or by bringing the psychotic into somecontact with the present world.This short dissertation on the psychotic is given to illustrate the importance of presenttime. The auditor should not believe, however, that he can easily get his preclear out of presenttime and cause his preclear to go insane. The case would have to be a borderline psychotic inthe first place, and the auditing would have to be in such flagrant violation of the chart that itcould be presupposed that the “auditor” who would accomplish such a psychosis wouldhimself be a moron or a psychotic.Any preclear is less alert out of present time than he is in present time. People gothrough their whole lives far out of present time and never suspect it. If they should be returnedto present time they would be far more able to cope with their problems and would beconsiderably happier, since evaluating the current environment in terms of, let us say, theenvironment of the age of five years is not conducive to good computation. The percentage ofpeople who are chronically out of present time will astonish you if you will test it out. The testis a simple one and is, indeed, a standard mechanism used by the auditor when returning hispreclear to present time. If you were to use this mechanism on a number of your friends youwould find that many of them are stuck somewhere on the time track and are not in presenttime. You should find it relatively easy, if you are dealing with people above 2.0 to returnanyone to present time whom you find out of it. The person need know nothing aboutDianetics, and, indeed, this is an excellent way to introduce the subject to a stranger.Discovering where the individual lies on the time track may be done in two or threeways. The first method is the age flash. To understand this, one should also understandsomething about the file clerk, a subject which will be covered in a later chapter. The first flashresponse, the first impression a person receives in answer to a question is called, in Dianetics, a“flash answer.” This is assisted by the auditor’s snapping of his fingers immediately after heasks the question.The age flash is obtained, then, in the following fashion: The auditor says, “When Isnap my fingers, an age will occur to you. Give me the first number that comes into yourmind.” He then snaps his fingers, and the preclear gives him the first number which comes intohis mind. This may be the preclear’s actual age, but in this current civilization, it usually is not.Sometimes it is a circuit response. The preclear has, through continual answering of thisquestion, set up a circuit which replies instead of the file clerk. Such a person can be detectedas running on such a circuit simply by asking the question whether or not at the beginning ofevery year he has difficulty putting down the date of the new year. If he carries over the pastyear into the new year for some days, or if he carries the past month into the new month, or ifhe simply has trouble in knowing what date it is, he can be considered to be out of present time;and if his flash answer is his current age, he can be considered to be running on a circuit. Thecircuit response can be set aside and another answer gained by another mechanism. Using theflash answer, one will discover at what point on the time track the preclear has most of hisattention units.The second mechanism by which the individual is discovered to be in or out of presenttime is the date flash. The auditor says to the preclear, “When I snap my fingers, a date willflash. Give me the first response which comes into your mind,” (snap !). The preclear thengives the first date which comes into his mind. In all these flash answers a new preclear willordinarily give the second or third answer which comes to him, and therefore the auditor mustask whether this was the first number. The preclear may give the present date, but on furtherquestioning may admit that some earlier date flashed first and that he corrected it. This earlierdate is where the bulk of the preclear’s attention units are located on the time track.Another method of detecting whether or not the individual is in present time is also on aflash answer basis, but this time one asks for a flash scene. The auditor says, “When I snapmy fingers, the current scene will flash before your eyes,” (snap!). A visio may then flash inthe mind of the preclear and is quite often not the visio of present time but of a much earlierperiod.138"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"It also happens occasionally that a preclear not too heavily charged with entheta will bestuck in an engram exactly on the point of the only sonic he will get on the track and the onlyvisio he will get on the track. Merely by telling him to close his eyes and listen the auditor mayget him to come up with a holder which is holding him out of present time. This is not generalbut happens often enough to be remarked.There is yet another method of detecting whether or not the preclear is out of presenttime. This is by auditor observation. The preclear who holds on relentlessly to tokens of acertain period of the past is normally partially in that period, either because of a grief charge orsome other type of entheta which holds him there. The old lady who surrounds herself withthe trappings of 1910 and who wears an outmoded gown will usually be found on the timetrack at the moment of the death of her husband or son or some other loved one. The secondaryengram is run out or enough entheta is converted elsewhere on the case, and the auditor canreturn her to present time, at which moment she will recognize, for the first time perhaps, thather keepsakes and her gown are a trifle out of the mode.There is an additional auditor observation which establishes whether or not the preclearis out of present time. The auditor learns rather rapidly to observe the physiology of hispreclear and judge from this where the preclear is stuck on the time track. At the period of birth,the baby is equipped to put on considerable fat and weight, and a person who is stuck in thebirth engram is usually somewhat overweight and usually has some physiologicalcharacteristics which remind one of an infant. This is only one example of one period on thetime track. The auditor will find preclears who look like twelve-year-old boys and who areactually stuck at twelve years of age in some operation such as a tonsillectomy or in some griefcharge.The auditor will find girls who appear to be four or five years of age although they aregrown up and who retain some mannerisms and physiological characteristics of the earlier age.And then there are those people, not too lovely to look at, who are arrested in the prenatalperiod. They bear some slight hint of the period of life at which they are held. Their mouthsand the condition of their skin seem to remind one of the condition of the embryo or foetus.Such people have a tendency to be formed in the curved position of the prenatal period, areround shouldered and are apt to draw up into a ball when they sleep. This condition becomesvery pronounced in the insane, where a call-back in a prenatal engram has taken all the attentionunits of the individual and placed him exactly at and only at some portion of the prenatal period.There is no argument concerning the existence of prenatals. They have been known for thepast thirty years, have been adequately proven by experiment at Rutgers University. Theauditor who does not recognize prenatals will never have very well preclears, and the auditorwho does not see in his potential preclear the symptoms of being stuck in the prenatal area mayhave a difficult time with his case.There is the postulate of attention units. It could be considered that an attention unit is atheta energy quantity of awareness. Any organism is aware in some degree. A rational, orrelatively rational organism is aware of being aware. Attention units could be said to exist inthe mind in varying quantity from person to person. This would be the theta endowment of theindividual. One person, if we assign merely arbitrary numbers, might have a thousand unitsand another person might have but fifty. If all of a person’s attention units could be free inpresent time for recall, enjoyment, perception and direction of body activities and forcomputation, that person could be said to be most excellently cleared. People below the level ofclear have fewer and fewer attention units in present time as they descend the tone scale. Thepercentile scale on the chart might be interpreted also as the number of attention units which theperson has available in present time. The normal person probably has about twenty-five percentof his attention units in present time. In view of the fact that these attention units are what heenjoys with and thinks with and works with, this can be seen to be not quite optimum. The restof his attention units are caught somewhere back down the time track in one incident or anotherin the form of entheta.139"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"When an individual is out of present time, it can be said that he has more attention unitsexisting at some past moment on the time track than he has existing in present time.The auditor, by failing to reduce engrams or secondaries, can induce a momentarycondition in his preclear of being out of present time. The preclear, after the session, if he isnot in present time will look rather groggy, will not perceive very readily and will be, as amatter of fact, much more suggestible than when he is in present time. It is symptomatic ofbeing out of present time that present time perceptions find no attention units to handle anevaluation of the perceptions, and so make a much deeper or unrationalized impression on theindividual.In every session the auditor, even when he is doing only straight wire, takes hispreclear somewhat out of present time. It is the concern of the auditor to get the preclear backinto present time. This is done best by running pleasure moments as though they wereengrams. These moments of pleasure will assemble the attention units and un-enturbulatethem, so they will easily return to present time and the preclear will stabilize in it. It is a generalrule that the more entheta there is on a case, the more the individual is out of present time. It ispossible for entheta itself to be in present time, but this is where the environment itself isenturbulative, where the individual is upset or angry because of contagion from theenvironment. Thus, all the attention units in present time can be seen to be not necessarilytheta. But entheta on the time track is not itself in present time. In the absence ofenvironmental restimulation, then, it can be seen that these attention units which should be inpresent time in a clear, but in a person lower on the tone scale are not, are actually entheta unitswrapped up in locks, secondaries, and engrams.When the preclear does not return to present time and cannot be persuaded by anycoaxing or cajoling to return to present time easily, the auditor has either tied up too manyattention units in some past moment -- a situation which will remedy itself in the course of afew hours, usually -- or there is so much charge on the case, which is to say so much entheta,that present time is unattainable. In cases below 2.0, the auditor has to be very careful howmany attention units he send out of present time, how much he restimulates his case, as thesecases are so heavily entheta that any existing theta will enturbulate swiftly, thus taking thepreclear far from present time into dramatizations or engramic computations. In working theusual case, not the psychotic, one still must be aware of the methods by which one maystabilize the preclear in present time.This rule can be applied to every case: the conversion of any amount of entheta to thetawill increase the preclear’s ability to come to present time and stabilize there. The auditorshould work to convert entheta into theta until he can get his preclear into present time. He cando this by straight memory, by scanning locks, by running pleasure moments, or even byrunning an engram, on cases which are high on the scale.There is no cause for panic because the individual is out of present time. Most of thesociety is out of present time. Any national army or navy, for instance, is so far out of presenttime that it is always ready to fight the war before the last. Moral codes are ordinarily two orthree centuries out of present time. Governmental systems are usually a couple of thousandyears out of present time. So, for an individual to be ten or fifteen years out is not very serious,unless the case as a whole is extremely serious. The auditor ordinarily finds his preclear out ofpresent time and finds it necessary to leave him out of present time for the first few sessions,being unable to do enough processing during these few sessions to convert sufficient entheta toreturn his preclear to present time.The auditor’s first and primary concern in any case which he finds out of present time isto return that case to present time. He should work with light methods, session after session,concentrating only on one thing: getting the preclear back to present time. He does not attemptto drive the preclear to present time or command the preclear to present time, since driving andcommanding will only turn theta into temporary entheta. Once he has his preclear in presenttime and has his preclear very stable in present time, the auditor can start worrying about140"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"specific incidents and the vaster difficulties of the case. Trying to work somebody who will notcome to present time or who cannot stay in present time once he is there should not be a trial tothe auditor. The auditor should not run engrams on such a case since, obviously, any personwho cannot stay in present time does not have enough free theta to work engrams.Various manifestations take place concerning present time in preclears. The firstmanifestation, of course, is being chronically out of present time. The preclear is usually heldin some operation, accident, or sorrow back on the track somewhere. Or the preclear comes topresent time and then slumps back out of it because of some restimulated engram which oneway or another, by literal command, contains a call-back, a phrase which says “Come backhere” and which the preclear obeys by returning back down the time track right after the auditorhas gotten him to present time. This indicates a rather heavily charged case, and it is the chargeitself which should be addressed, which is to say simply converting entheta to theta rather thanattacking the specific engram which is doing the calling back. Then there is the case which isall the way out of present time all the time. This case is not in contact with the environment inany way whatsoever and is, of course, psychotic. Then there is the case which is apparently“stuck in present time.” One could not actually be stuck in present time but is stuck somewhereon the track in an incident which carries with it the illusion that it is present time. Christmas,for instance, is a time when presents are given, and as the preclear is brought back up the trackhe may hang up at any point on the track which contains the word “present.” The habit ofmedical doctors during operations of saying “That’s all for the present” will create the illusionof putting the preclear up in present time and making it difficult for the preclear to return. Thenthere is the preclear who is a chronic bouncer. Some engram in the case has in it a “get up” or“go up there,” and the preclear is thus bounced to the extremity of his time track and even intothe future of his time track. Obedience to such phrases indicates a heavily-charged case, and theauditor should address himself to the charge on the case rather than to the specific engramwhich is producing the manifestation.There is the flash answer method of discovering the incident in which the preclear islocated. The auditor asks a series of questions which will identify the incident and receivesflash answers on a yes-no basis. The auditor says, “When I snap my fingers you will answeryes or no to the following question: “Hospital?” (snap!), and the preclear answers yes or no.Such a series of questions and answers might run as follows: “Accident?” “Yes.” “Hospital?”“No.” “Mother?” “Yes.” “Outdoors?” “No.” “Fall down?” “No.” “Cut?” “Yes.” “Kitchen?”“Yes.” And suddenly the preclear may remember the incident or get a visio of the scene andremember or get a sonic recall of what his mother said to him, which might be something like,“You stay right here and hold on to it until I come back.” If the case was not too heavilycharged, remembering this might permit him to come to present time. In this way, using thenames of people who might have been around the preclear and things which might havehappened to the preclear, the auditor can, on a flash answer basis, bring enough data about theincident to light to allow the preclear to remember a hidden or forgotten engram or secondary,and simply by recalling it, to return to present time.Getting the preclear to recall by straight memory the incident where he is stuck on thetrack is sometimes sufficient to get him to return to present time. One case was underprocessing many months, for an hour or two a week, by a very poor auditor. This case washung up in a serious operation at the age of thirty-one. The auditor eventually became brightenough to inquire whether or not there was an earlier operation, and an almost duplicateoperation was suddenly located by the preclear, at which moment he returned to present time.In getting people to present time it is a necessity to understand the principle that theearlier the engram is the easier it is to reduce. Later engrams on a case contain their own forceplus the force of all similar previous engrams on the case. Engrams exist in chains, and theremay be anywhere from one to forty, or a hundred engrams on one chain. The preclear is quiteordinarily stuck, not in the first engram on the chain, but in some later engram. Thus, theidentification of the point on the track where he is stuck is ordinarily insufficient to free him.An earlier moment of a similar nature must be discovered before he is able to return to presenttime. The use of straight memory to discover such an earlier moment is a simple operation.141"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"As will be seen by an examination of the tone scale on the subject of present time, themore heavily charged the case, the more likely the preclear is to be out of present time or to stayout of present time. The whole question of returning the individual to present time is thequestion of converting entheta to theta. It would be a very simple thing if all one had to do wasto run the engram in which the preclear was stuck and so get him to present time. This usuallydoesn’t happen. The engram in which the preclear is stuck is quite ordinarily unreducible, inthe existing state of the case. Thus, getting the preclear to present time necessitates runningpleasure moments, scanning locks, running secondaries or simply making present time sothoroughly attractive that the preclear’s attention units return there.The auditor should not neglect the fact, nor should the preclear, that present time itselfmay be desirable or undesirable. The preclear, who is faced with a divorce or whose child hasjust died or whose wife has suddenly been discovered to be a harlot may find present time sothoroughly undesirable that attention units shun it just as, being theta, they would shun anyother entheta area on the track. Engrams, secondaries, and heavy locks become buried andhidden from recall because they are entheta and, by theory, have a repelling effect upon theta.The area at the age of twelve in which the individual was told he was going crazy because hewas discovered to be masturbating (along with the remainder of the human race) will bedifficult to approach. The entheta of the scolding and upset will cause theta to shy away fromthe area. Other non-survival periods of one’s life where one was down on his luck, where onefound that college girls often make poor wives, where one discovered that one’s husband, ofan evening, liked to take off his shoes and read the paper rather than conquer dragons for hislady fair as he promised to do so often before the wedding, and other periods of great travailare quite normally shunned as the preclear goes back down the track. This is very wellevidenced by the number of new incidents which turn up during lock scanning. At first thereappear to be only one or two incidents on a lock chain, but when the preclear has been scannedthrough the chain many times it is discovered that there are several hundred incidents on thechain.Entheta incidents, then, vanish so far as the theta of the conscious or analytical mind isconcerned. One should not overlook the fact that present time can be such an area, and so maybe shunned. The auditor should do what he can to remedy this situation by providing a friendlyatmosphere, or even a refuge, for his preclear and so make present time, at least during thesession, palatable. As a summary, then, the more entheta in ratio to theta there is on the case theless likely the preclear is to move on the track and to be in present time. The more entheta thereis in present time the less likely the preclear is to enter it -- and this includes the fact that a crossor bossy auditor will make present time unpalatable to the preclear. A primary mission of theauditor is to get his preclear into present time.The fundamental principle of getting the preclear to present time lies in improving thetheta-entheta ratio of the case by straight wire, running or scanning locks, and in cases whichare well up the tone scale, running secondaries or engrams. As is shown on the chart, thedianetic clear is highly stable in present time and does not leave it. All his perceptions are clear.This does not mean the clear cannot leave present time. With “I” in control of the entireanalytical mind, instead of some circuit or telephone switchboard of circuits, the clear can runon his track entirely at will, but he almost never needs to do so, since his memory mechanismscan be counted on to furnish him with accurate data without recourse to return mechanisms.Here is the difference between memory and returning, where it is best manifested. Memorywould be, for instance, sending two attention units to the standard memory bank to bring upinformation for the use of the analyzer, and returning would be sending fifty percent of theavailable theta back down the track for a full re-experiencing of the incident.The clear ordinarily does not fully re-experience incidents, simply because he doesn’thave to, and he ordinarily finds present time palatable. Theta units in present time offer aresistance to the entheta coming in from the environ. The impact of the environ is combatted bythe theta unit reasoning and evaluation. If there is a great deal of entheta on the case and thepresent time environ is entheta, the present time perceptics will go toward the entheta and willrestimulate it whether it be in the form of locks, secondaries, or engrams, and so enturbulate142"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"the whole case. This does not happen to the clear. But that does not mean that the clear cannotbe enturbulated. Given a very low-theta-endowment clear and a very heavy enthetaenvironment, such as the slaughter of a thousand Christians, the clear will temporarilyenturbulate. He does not, however, have large areas of frozen entheta on his track which wouldtrap the temporarily enturbulated theta, and so he will completely dis-enturbulate the momentthe entheta environ is no longer present. A clear is very definitely in present time.The 3.5, the dianetic release, is quite stable in present time, and he is very alert to hisenvironment. He gets the full beauty out of any scenery he observes, he is not disturbed byextraneous noise or upsets, but because he still has frozen entheta on his case he is susceptibleto heavy enturbulation if the present-time environment is enturbulative. Nevertheless, he isstable in present time.The 3.0 has no definite difficulty in reaching, returning to, or maintaining himself inpresent time. He snaps back to present time very rapidly when he is being processed and isvery alert when he gets there. However, he can be enturbulated to the point where he will hangup temporarily somewhere on the track and will possibly dramatize the point where he hashung up, if sufficiently hit by enturbulation.The 2.5 when once brought to present time will remain there easily until the nextprocessing. He has perhaps thirty to forty percent of his theta in present time, as an ordinaryrule, and an auditor has to be very careless to hang this preclear up on the track. However, thispreclear can be hung up on the track, and the auditor will have to run pleasure moments at theend of the session and do some straight wire when he has had a very enturbulative session, inorder to stabilize his preclear in present time.The 2.0 requires considerable care on the part of the auditor in order to return him topresent time and stabilize him there. Pleasure moments have to be run, if any can be found.Some lock scanning must be done. Some future pleasure moments may be run. But the 2.0may respond to a call-back, and once brought to present time may slump back down the trackto an earlier period. Dealing with 2.5’s and 2.0’s the auditor should always check at the end ofthe session at least twice to see whether the preclear is in present time, but ten minutes later thepreclear may have slumped back down the track in answer to a call-back in some early periodof entheta. Here we have a case where there is far more entheta on the case than theta, and theindividual tends strongly to go toward the entheta of the past or the entheta of present timerather than toward theta. Theoretically, he would rather come up to present time for a fight thanfor anything else, however, this is not recommended as a processing procedure, and the auditormust use much skill in getting the preclear to present time.The 1.5 is usually in some dominating valence somewhere out of present time. He isvery difficult to get to present time and once in present time will almost always slump back.Here is the chronically angry case, and he goes toward entheta more readily than toward anytheta in present time. The auditor will find efforts to bring this preclear to present time verydifficult until he has raised this preclear’s tone up above the 2.0 level.At 1.1, the preclear stays out of present time most of the time. When he reaches presenttime he nearly always slumps back immediately. A tremendously inviting situation, covertlyhostile, devious or perverted in present time will bring this preclear to present time but little elsewill. The balm and persuasion of an auditor’s personality will not by itself do the trick. Theauditor working a 1.1 should not worry if he cannot get the preclear to present time at the endof the session, since the preclear is usually out of present time anyway. Still, the auditor shouldbe careful not to pull down any of the preclear’s theta into entheta areas, since there is very littleleft to pull down. Very light processing methods should be used.The 0.5 can always be requested to come to present time and sometimes will. But heslumps back immediately into some apathy incident. This case requires considerable skill onthe part of the auditor, who is working with somebody so far out of present time all the time143"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"that it is difficult for him to get the preclear’s attention. If the auditor acts particularly sad,sometimes this preclear will come to present time.At 0.1 the preclear’s perceptics can, at best, be directed to present time concepts. Onecan ask him to observe a cup, a saucer, a bright colored object, some music, or an emergencysituation. But here one is very lucky to be able to get the preclear merely to perceive somethingwhich exists in the present time environment. The auditor’s primary concern with any case iswhether or not the case is in present time.144"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENCOLUMN ACStraight MemoryIn Dianetics, straight memory is a specified technical process. It should not be confusedwith “free-association.”Straight memory is also called straight wire. It is so called because the auditor isdirecting the memory of the preclear and in doing so is stringing wire, much on the order of atelephone line, between “I” and the standard memory bank, plowing through all occlusions andcircuits.There is something about straight memory which is very validating. Once a personreally remembers something it seems real to him, and this sense of reality greatly promotes theARC of the case. Straight memory thus has a certain advantage over lock scanning andrunning engrams. The preclear using straight memory very thoroughly associates the pastevent with the present-time environment, and he evaluates the past event in terms of thepresent-time environment. When the preclear is returned on the track he often evaluates thepast event only in terms of its own environment, and while repeated recountings of the incidentmay bring about reduction of the entheta in it, the validation factor is still much lower than instraight memory.Straight memory was developed in Dianetics on the basis that if one knew thefundamental mechanical cause of insanity one should be able to do better than was done inpsychoanalysis, since it is known that “free-association” produces some minor alleviation oftension and anxiety. The mechanisms of why this came about were thus explored. It wasfound that the heightened reality of straight memory and the knowledge of why locks, the usualtarget of straight memory, were aberrative combined to make an orderly fast type ofprocessing, valid in the ratio of several hundred to one over older methods. All by itself straightmemory is an excellent method of processing. The busy doctor or consultant who has but afew minutes to spend with every patient can employ straight memory to great advantage. Onespecialist in Parkinson’s disease in New York City, although he did not understand very muchabout dianetic processing, used straight memory to achieve the alleviation of Parkinson’sdisease at least temporarily in three cases out of five on which it was employed. The importanceof straight memory should not be underestimated. Preclears low on the tone scale cansometimes support only straight memory. In the Foundation various people have becomestraight memory experts since straight memory has its own peculiar skills.Straight memory can be used by anyone without any danger. It is a slightly directiveprocess. The auditor does not permit his preclear to wander around and free-associate andgenerally waste time and energy. The auditor knows exactly what he wants and he directs thepreclear’s attention to it. Thus, a straight memory expert must be able to sum up more or lesswhat is wrong with the case. After he has summed this up he can do a very good job ofresolving the case by straight memory.Originally, straight memory required considerable perspicacity on the part of an auditor.However, in late 1950, recognizing the great skill necessary to a good straight memory auditor,I postulated what became inelegantly called “the hurdy-gurdy” system. The use of this systemdemands the minimum of the auditor and extracts the maximum of aberration from the preclear.The first thing one should know about straight memory is the phenomenon of thehuman mind that a fact asked for today and not received may be received tomorrow or the nextday. The mind, on facts long laid away, has a one to three day refresher period. If one were togive an examination on history to a number of forty-year-old men on Monday one might expectmany low grades. But by giving another examination to this same group Wednesday one145"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"would find higher grades were attained. The mind, in short, refreshes itself, and the repetitiousrequest by the auditor for certain facts from the preclear’s standard memory bank willeventually elicit those facts. The auditor, if he does not get the information he wants from thepreclear on Monday, should ask the same questions on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, andFriday, and he will find that the preclear will eventually remember.Because so many people in our society seek to profit by the failure of others toremember, memory is a generally reduced quantity in the current culture. The mother who hasmany times attempted abortion upon her child is quite anxious that the child should notremember anything. The mother instinctively knows, although the culture has taught her thechild could not possibly remember such early incidents, that she had better suppress anypossible recall. Thus, mothers, by contagion, have encouraged bad memory.There is something triumphant in having a better memory than the other fellow. This isbased on the formulation that being right is to survive and being wrong is not to survive. Bybeing right in memory one demonstrates the fact that one has a greater survival potential thanthe fellow who is wrong in memory. Memories come into conflict continually, and one willfind unthinking people quarreling as to which one remembers the best and which is correct.This is an additional befuddlement in the society which suppresses memory.There are cases on record, well authenticated, of individuals who have rememberedback into their prenatal period. One eight-year-old girl who was under processing by a bookauditor recently stunned her parents by remembering back to the third month after conception,when “Mama squeezed her tummy and hurt me.” In the presence of non-dianetically orientedindividuals, this memory would have been suppressed immediately, but in view of the fact thatit agreed with memories of the parents, and in view of the fact that both parents had, to theirbenefit, experienced dianetic processing, the little girl was permitted to go on remembering, andstraight wire into the prenatal bank was done with such profit that the child’s school gradeswent up an average of fifty percent. Many instances are on record of straight memory back tobirth, and it is too ordinary for comment for an individual to remember into infancy. Thesociety of course, because of the contagion of aberration of mothers who have practiced extra-curricular sex relations and attempted abortions, holds such early memory in considerablequestion.Memory of infancy does not depend upon memory of how to talk. Befuddledprofessors and practitioners in the past believed that the ability to talk had something to do withability to remember, but this is not the case. There have been objections to prenatal engrams onthe basis that “no one would be able to understand language before he was born,” despite thefact that Sigmund Freud stressed traumatic prenatal incidents. The syllables, meaninglessthough they are, are recorded in a prenatal engram, along with all other perceptics. When theyare keyed-in, in a person past two years of age who has learned to talk, they are evaluated interms of the meanings the person has learned to give those syllables.Forgotten incidents were postulated by Sigmund Freud, to whom through CommanderThompson, one of his students and the friend and mentor of my youth, I am much indebted, tobe a considerable factor in human sanity. The release through recall of any incident which isforgotten or hidden and which contains considerable turbulence will produce a tone rise in theindividual.Many individuals undergoing processing -- in fact most individuals -cannot “remember”any earlier than eight years of age, much less into infancy. The more entheta there is on a case,the less theta is available to the analyzer. The more entheta there is along the time track, theharder it is for the existing theta to dis-enturbulate it enough to get the data out of it. The moreaberrated the individual, the more entheta there is on the case. Entheta does not necessarily liein childhood, but key-ins can ordinarily be expected to lie in childhood. The key-in issometimes difficult to remember, but when remembered will produce the most marked changein the case. After a person has been processed for a while and considerable free theta exists forthe use of the analyzer, straight memory back to very early periods is possible.146"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"One can also get into early periods in a person’s life by the use of repeater technique.This is not straight memory technique, but is an archaic technique of Dianetics independent ofstraight memory. Repeater technique has its uses, but anyone using repeater technique atrandom on a case will quite commonly find his preclear hung up in an engram which cannot becontacted and run out. Repeater technique causes trouble. But by the use of repeatertechnique, barring accidents, the preclear can be pulled back to a return into periods of infancy,if the auditor is lucky enough not to get the preclear into an engram. (Repeater technique onholders, such as “stay there,” will almost certainly wind the preclear’s attention up in engrams,attention which will not be freed until the auditing is scanned out). This should not beconfused with straight memory. Straight memory consists of the preclear’s staying in presenttime with his eyes wide open and being asked to remember certain things which have been saidto him and done to him during his lifetime. He is not asked to return to these incidents. He isasked only to recognize their existence. He is not commanded to accept the fact that suchincidents existed, and minimal aid should be given his memory mechanisms.Some misunderstanding has resulted on the part of some individuals about repeatertechnique, what it is, and how it was used. In the handbook DIANETICS there is a discussionof repeater technique, but simply defined, it is this: The repetition of a word or phrase in orderto produce movement on the time track into an entheta area containing that word or phrase.Repeating or “rolling” a phrase in an engram in order to de-intensify the phrase or reduce theengram is not repeater technique.The auditor may get a preclear who has difficulty remembering yesterday, to saynothing of the time when he was two years of age. The auditor may be assured that when hehas worked with this case long enough to restore a considerable amount of theta, converting itfrom entheta, the preclear will be able to remember things which he has never been able toremember before, since one of the first things to improve in dianetic processing is memory.When an auditor has a preclear who has difficulty remembering, the auditor should be carefulto start with things that are rememberable. If the preclear says bluntly that he cannot rememberthings, it is up to the auditor to encourage and validate this preclear’s memory. If the preclearsays “I can’t remember names,” the auditor says, “Well, what is the name of your businessassociate?” The preclear says, “Oh, his name is Jones!” The auditor has proven to the preclearthat the preclear can remember at least one name. If the preclear is in such bad condition that hecannot even remember this at will, the auditor says “What is my name?” The preclear havingjust heard the auditor’s name may be able to remember it with ease. If he cannot, the auditorsays “What is your own name?” The preclear tells him, and the auditor says “You see, you canremember one name. Now let’s see if you can remember others.” In such fashion, the preclearcan be assisted to remember from the most obvious incidents or facts back to more and moreobscure incidents. This is the common progress of straight memory. To begin by rememberingthe obvious and finally to be able to remember the aberrative.A whole and entire method of processing can be made out of straight memory. Timespent on straight memory is usually time well spent. Straight memory might also be considereda pair of stilts by which the preclear, persuaded to remember incidents later and later in his life,can be brought back up to present time. That straight memory does free theta, or convertentheta to theta is beyond question. It is, however, a rather lengthy process, compared to lockscanning, for instance. Thus, straight memory should be used only as indicated on the chart,or to get the individual back up to present time, or by auditors who are so rushed for time thatthey have only a few minutes to attempt to rid a preclear of some specific somatic or aberration.The primary rule of straight memory is this: Whatever the preclear thinks is wrong withhimself, his family, his group, or mankind, life or MEST, has generally been told to thepreclear by somebody else at an earlier period of the preclear’s life. This is modified by thefact, of course, that things can be wrong along these various dynamics which are perfectlyrational observations. The auditor is looking for irrational beliefs about these things.The second rule about straight memory is that the preclear, at least at this time, issurrounded by very aberrated individuals and has been so surrounded since conception. It is147"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"symptomatic of any aberrated individual that he is acting upon his engrams and is dramatizingthose engrams. Thus, there is a consistency of performance. The rough rule of thumb is that ifan aberrated person says something once he will say it hundreds or thousands of times. Onceyou have isolated the fact that a certain individual in the preclear’s past, for instance,complained about his stomach, you will have discovered a whole chain of such complaints, anda conversion of entheta to theta on this subject will take place.By straight memory one can easily discover the dominant or the nullifying individualsin the preclear’s family. From the dominant individuals, those who attempted to dominate andcontrol the others around them, the preclear will have received the circuit phrases, which are thecontrol phrases in his bank. From the nullifying persons he will have received the nullificationphrases. The auditor, by locating these persons and their habitual statements, finds thepreclear’s circuits.Those things which are found in the locks of a preclear are normally found in hisengrams. Thus if one finds mama at the preclear’s tenth year saying “Men are no good,” onecan expect to find mama shortly after the preclear’s conception making the same remark in anengram. If one discovers the lock by straight memory, one can then find the engram.Difficulties arise in straight memory in cases where the preclear has not been raised byhis own parents. A preclear whose parents have died shortly after his birth does not have in hispost-speech period the same phrases which are in his early engram. A lock must have anengram below it in order to exist, but here the auditor is confronted with a person whose locksdo not, as far as phrases are concerned, match his engrams. This would appear at first glanceto be a fortunate condition for the preclear, single the engrams would never be repeated as tovoice tone or content later in the preclear’s life.But something else has been interrupted here which is very important to the preclear andthat is parental care. There does not seem to be any substitute for the proximity and care of ones own parents. Preclears who have been raised by nurses and maids do not demonstrate thesame alertness as those who have been raised by their own parents.Preclears who have been raised by foster parents, no matter the quality of those fosterparents, do not seem to be as well off as preclears who have been raised by relativelyindifferent and unaffectionate parents of their own. There is more here than the biologicalproduction of new organisms, and the affinity of parent for child even when clouded bymaltreatment of the child is apparently superior to non-parental care of the child even when thisis near optimum. Thus, the severance of the parent-child relationship after birth is amore solid break of affinity, reality, and communication than the summation of lockswhich would occur in the usual case later in life. This is not theory, but observation of manycases, since no case processed to date which had been raised by maids rather than parents wasfound to be as high on the tone scale as cases which had been raised by indifferent parents,much less those who had been raised by parents who loved them dearly. Russian pseudo-scientists to the contrary, there is more to man than biology and environment. Training womenextensively in political economy, symbology, or the care and cleaning of rifles is not conduciveto a forthcoming sane generation.Straight memory, as a technique, strikes toward seven types of incidents: theenforcement of affinity, communication, and reality, by command; the implantation of circuits;and the inhibition of affinity, communication, and reality, by command.Affinity, communication, and reality exist as they exist under the self-determinism ofthe individual. What is wrong with the preclear is what has been done to the preclear, not whathe himself has done. Basically, man is intended to survive as an organism. An individual whohas been subjected to enforced affinity, reality, and communication has an interrupted self-determinism. By enforced affinity, reality, or communication is meant the demand on theindividual that he experience or admit affinity, reality, or communication when he has not felt148"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"it. The child who has been forced to “love” a parent or guardian has been subjected, when hedid not feel that love but was forced to admit it, to an enforced affinity. This is aberrative. Thewife who has been continually subjected to demands from a lower-toned husband that she tellhim she loves him, when she does not, and who yet accedes to this demand has been subjectedto enforced affinity. People lower-toned than the preclear commonly command his affinity,and when affinity is given but not felt locks are formed which are quite enturbulative shouldengrams underlie such an enforement.What child is there who has not had reality forced upon him which he did not feel? Hehas been told that it was very important for him to go to school when he himself did not havesufficient reason to believe this. In the limited sphere of his experience, he sees that it isdesirable to play, to get sunlight, to eat, sleep, have friends and to exist in harmony in thebosom of his family, but he does not see that it is necessary for him to study. Nearly allgrammar school education is an enforced reality. The grown-up can see it is necessary for thechild to have some slight command of the three R’s, but the child has not agreed to this.Agreement has been forced upon him, and thus, aberrative locks are formed upon any existingengrams. School is very far from being the only enforced reality. Any time a person is made toagree by force or threat or deprivation, to another’s reality and yet does not feel that realityhimself an aberrative condition exists. When engrams are present which can be restimulated bythis situation, a certain amount of theta is trapped as entheta. The most insidious of all theseenforced realities is where the individual knows the truth or is told the truth and is then made toconfess that what he knows to be the truth is a lie. He has said that such-and-such is the caseand then he accedes to the demand that he deny this assertion. This very commonly happens tochildren and forms bad locks. Whenever an individual is forced to agree to something to whichhe would not agree it left to his own reason, a lock is formed, where underlying engrams exist.Enforced communication is productive of all manner of aberration and physiologicalchanges in the individual. Of course, any lock has to have an engram underlying it, but it isfairly certain that what the parent says in the lock has already been stated in an engram earlier inthe case. Communication, of course, includes all perceptic as well as conversation andmessages, and when an individual has been forced to look at something which his self-determination says he should not look at, his sight to some degree is impaired. When he isforced to listen to something to which he would not ordinarily listen if left to his own self-determinism, his hearing to that degree is impaired. When he has been forced to touchsomething which he would not ordinarily touch, his tactile is thus impaired. When he has beenforced to talk when his self-determinism says he should remain silent, his speechcommunication is impaired. When he has been forced to write when he would not ordinarilywrite if left to his own devices, his ability to write or to communicate messages is thusimpaired. These are enforced communications, and in the presence of engrams, become veryaberrative locks.Circuits occupy a later column. But any circuit is simply a control or nullification “you”phrase which makes the individual compute differently than he ordinarily would and whichwalls up a certain portion of the analyzer for use against the individual. A circuit, for instance,can be critical, so that thoughts that criticize him occur to the individual whenever he thinks oracts. The circuit “I’ve got to protect you from yourself” can wall up a large portion of the mind.The individual in this society is surrounded by people who would either dominate or nullify,and thus many locks are formed of the circuit variety, where people are by the “you” phraseattempting to dominate or nullify the individual. Locks can only exist, of course, whenengrams exist, and so these are normally received in their most aberrative form from parents,guardians, and other individuals who have been around the early portion of the person’s life,when the bulk of the engrams are received. Circuits are quite peculiarly resolvable by straightwire. When an auditor strikes a circuit during the running of an engram very occasionally thewhole engram blanks out or a strange visio turns on. When the auditor strikes a circuit in anengram he can expect the preclear to go out of the auditor’s control into the control of some pastand even dead individual’s phrases. Individuals who go around auditing themselves andrunning engrams and phrases ad infinitum are running because of circuits. Individuals whosebanks cannot be entered in any way are in that condition because of circuits which bar the149"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"auditor. By straight memory it is possible to discover the dominant or nullifying individuals inthe family and so recover the dominant or nullifying circuits in the form of locks. Once theselocks are “blown” the engrams containing these circuits are to some degree discharged.Further, the auditor is forewarned of what he might find in the engram bank of the individual.Every case is to some degree a control case, which is to say a case which has circuits of onekind or another. One of the best ways to find out what circuits the preclear has is to give himstraight wire on the statements of the people by whom he was surrounded in very early life andchildhood.It is interesting to note, on the subject of circuits, that as one goes down the tone scale,from the top to the bottom, one finds that people on lower and lower levels are moresurrounded by dominant and nullifying individuals. Thus straight wire becomes more andmore indicated the lower one drops on the tone scale for the location and blowing of circuitlocks. The inhibition of affinity, communication, and reality is no less serious than theirenforcement. The inhibition of affinity comes about when a desirable similarity of the preclearto another person is denied or rejected or when the love and affection of the preclear is rejected.In the presence of underlying engrams considerable turbulence is created by these nullificationsof affinity. The wife who is commonly answered with “You don’t love me” every time sheattempts to express her affection, is undergoing an inhibition of affinity. The individual who istold that nobody in the office likes him is undergoing an inhibition of affinity. The person whois rejected from a group because of some fault, or otherwise, experiences a major break ofaffinity. When such breaks of affinity overlie engrams, which they commonly do, theybecome highly aberrative and serve to charge up the engrams considerably. Straight wirereaching such incidents can unburden the case of considerable enturbulence. The individualwho is not permitted to feel that he is loved or that he may love, the person who is denied anycommon ground with the universe, with man, with his group or family, or even with himself isexperiencing an inhibition of affinity.The inhibition of reality requires considerable attention. Left to his own devices andreasoning on his own data, the individual decides what is reality for him and with what he canagree. When he is informed that he cannot agree with those things he thinks he should agreewith, he experiences an inhibition of reality. When engrams underlie this, these locks can bevery serious and can tie up considerable theta on a case as entheta. One might say that this is themost serious influence in reducing the individual on the tone scale -- inhibition of theindividual’s reality. This is invalidation, and invalidation is the most serious break of theauditor’s code. What a person, by his own observations, has come to believe real becomesthen a part of the conclusions and observations which a person uses to guide his future actionsand to evaluate himself with regard to his environment. A sudden challenge or denial of thereality of these conclusions comes as a severe shock to the individual, when it is underlain byengrams, and will shake his reality, in any event. The reality of an individual can be sothoroughly shaken that he will be doubtful of anything he does or says, since he is not sure ofhis conclusions. Reality together with affinity and communication, is a basic in thecomputations which an individual makes with regard to the courses he should take in thepursuit of his own survival. The reality of children is very ordinarily threatened or knocked topieces by parents. The child has very little data with which to evaluate his current environ andto plot his future. In comparison to his conclusions that he should survive, that he needs foodand clothing and shelter, and that he needs affection, the aberrated culture into which he is bornis often a very strange reality to him. Grownups have agreed upon this culture, but thisagreement is not ordinarily the most sensible one which could be made, and the child is oftenfaced with realities which are to him, dealing in the basics in which children deal, quite unreal.Thus, children are being disagreed with continually. The little baby believes it should have itsown control of MEST, that it should be permitted to crawl about at will, which is its commandof space, that it should be able to take its own time about what it is doing, which is its conquestof time, and should be able to expend energy in whichever direction it desires, which is itscontrol of energy, and should be able to pull about and do as it pleases with matter such as mudpies and precious vases on tables. The child does not know that these things are held to beotherwise valuable in the society, and so the child is continually denied its conquest of MEST.Nowhere is this denial as acute as in the denial of reality. None agrees, evidently, with the150"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"child. And thus, very early in life a large number of locks begin to build up upon the basicengrams of the case. But disagreement with one’s reality is not limited to childhood.Throughout life, the individual who has agreed with himself about certain realities iscontinually challenged in his reality by those about him, particularly those lower on the tonescale than himself, who seek to gain importance by reducing that individual’s reality andtherefore reducing the individual on the tone scale to a point where he can be more easilycontrolled. Statements, then, which tend to invalidate a person’s conclusions about realityconcerning his own relationship to the culture and environ are very aberrative.Inhibitions of communication are very common. They most ordinarily manifestthemselves in this society with spectacles, with hearing aids, with tactile anaesthesia, instutterers, and in people who will not write letters or pass along messages. Communicationbreaks, on the inhibition side, stem from the denial of a person’s ability to see, to feel, to hear,denial of a person’s right to talk or listen -- in other words, denials of a person’s right tocommunicate. These manifest themselves, when underlain by engrams, in terms of inhibitedrelations with one’s fellows and a lowered position on the tone scale.The hurdy-gurdy system of straight wire takes into account all of the above data, andputs into existence a method by which the auditor can exploit each person surrounding thepreclear. We have already spoken of the triangle of Dianetics, affinity, reality, andcommunication. The auditor works on the principle that a datum desired from the preclear’smemory today may not be forthcoming but if requested again in a day or two may beforthcoming, and if not then, may be available two or three days after that. The auditor makesa list of all the persons who surrounded the preclear: father, mother, aunts, uncles, guardians,nurses, grandparents, great-grandparents, teachers, brothers, sisters, employers, andsubordinates, as well as mates. Two triangles and two circuit slots exist for each of thesepersons. The preclear does not need to know about this. The auditor can very simply draw upa plan of questioning which then permits him in his requests for memory of certain locks tocover the ground over and over and each time with new people repeating questions asked aboutpeople covered in sessions before. In other words, this is a tally sheet which the auditor coulduse in order to assay the case and blow, if possible, locks of enforced ARC, inhibited ARC,and circuits. For instance, the auditor draws one triangle and a slot, a straight line, for fatherand he labels these “enforced” and “dominating.” Then he draws another triangle and anotherslot and labels these “inhibited” and “nullifying.” Then he makes a similar graph for mother andfor every person intimately related to his preclear’s life.His system of questioning then is to find out when papa enforced affinity, when papaenforced reality, when papa commanded higher communication, and when papa sought todominate. He asks around the triangle and with the slot. He will discover that the preclear mayor may not have certain immediate memories concerning father’s conduct and favorite phrase.The auditor then proceeds to the inhibition triangle and nullification slot. He asks when fatherinhibited or refused affinity, when he inhibited or refused reality or agreement, when heinhibited or refused communication, and when and if father attempted to nullify the preclear. Inthe same session the auditor goes on to mother and to other people, with the same plan.Because the preclear’s memory can be refreshed by this procedure, the auditor does notabandon father after one session but carries father for three or four sessions on straight memoryand asks a similar set of questions in the next session. When did father enforce affinity,demand that he be loved, demand that he have affection shown to him? When did fatherdemand agreement? When did father demand communication? When did father attempt todominate? When did father attempt to cut off or inhibit affinity? When did father attempt to cutoff or inhibit reality? When did father attempt to cut off or inhibit communication? When didfather attempt to nullify? The auditor then goes on to coverage of mother or some other person.Systematized straight wire like this will turn up an enormous amount of material. Thehurdy-gurdy system was created so that the auditor would not have to keep long sheets ofquestions.151"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"This is the general plan of questioning. The questions need not be the same every time,but their general import should include this plan. In such wise, the most aberrative forms ofentheta in locks can be contacted by straight memory, and session after session the preclear’smaterial becomes fuller and his memory steadily improves.The valence problem is also resolvable in terms of straight memory. It often occurs thatthe preclear is suffering some physical disorder which can be freed by straight memory, alongthe following lines. Should the preclear have dermatitis of the hands, one might discover thatsome person in the preclear’s background had dermatitis or some ailment of or injury to thehand. This person may be located, and it may be discovered that some lock command existswhich causes the preclear to be like the previously sick person. This is often found with apreclear who has lost an ally. Such a case is illustrative. When the preclear’s grandmother diedshe had cancer of the hands. The preclear was suffering from dermatitis of the hands. It wasdiscovered that many remarks had been made by relatives concerning how like his grandmotherthe preclear was. This likeness was so closely followed out by the preclear that he attempted todevelop cancer of the hands, which manifested itself as dermatitis.The whole problem of valences is one of allies and antipathies. The preclear very oftenmay be in the valence of someone who is normally hated. He is forced by lock commands,people telling him things like “You’re just like your father. You’re growing more like himevery day, and you’ll grow up to be no good.” Because of such commands the preclear maynot be able to help hating himself since he is forced into the valence of a person who is hatedand whom he hated. Straight memory can often resolve this problem merely by asking whomthe preclear was most supposed to be like and what was the general attitude toward this person.It is vital in straight memory to reach the actual context in the actual incident of everymemory. The first stab of the preclear into his memory bank will be one of vague feeling thatthere was such an incident and that somebody said something like that. This is not goodenough. The auditor must pin the preclear down to a specific incident and the words of thatincident. If this is not possible in the first session, it will be possible in a succeeding session.Until it has been achieved, the lock will not be blown. A good trick to get a preclear toremember a specific incident is to ask the preclear if such an incident exists and then, when hevaguely asserts that it must, to ask him where he was sitting when he heard somebody say thisor where he was standing. The preclear may quickly correct the auditor, saying that he waslying down or walking, and thus will have recovered data. There is a certain amount ofchallenge which the auditor can use in straight memory. He puts the preclear on his mettle. Ifthis is not carried too far it acts as a very stimulating factor to the preclearIt is quite remarkable how many “psychosomatic” disorders and how many aberrationsstraight memory can resolve after the auditor has had a little practice. He can actually get hispreclear out of some chronic valence, rid him of some aberration, bring him up to present time,and generally raise him on the tone scale merely by asking the right questions.The auditor should not confine himself to the hurdy-gurdy system of straight wire.This is only provided to relieve the maximum amount of entheta in the minimum amount ofauditor time. The auditor can use his imagination considerably with regard to what must havebeen said or done to this preclear. The auditor can profitably open any session by asking“Well, what are you worried about today?” When the preclear tells him, the auditor wants toknow who in the preclear’s background might have thought that, and it sometimes results thatthe preclear can spot immediately what has been told in the past which compares to the worrywhich he now has, and if the two are cause and effect, the preclear will immediately rid himselfof the worry. It is quite remarkable how swiftly this can be done. When the preclear recovers alock which has considerable entheta on it he ordinarily chuckles or smiles. The preclear whodoes not react in this fashion may yet be getting a little bit of entheta off of the lock, but thepossibility is that an earlier similar lock exists, when the preclear does not laugh. Thus, whenthe preclear is caused to remember some early incident, and yet does not experience any relief,although he should, from the nature of the incident and its hidden character, the auditor doeswell to try to discover some earlier incident than the one remembered, which is similar to it.152"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The principle here is to discover, if possible, the key-in, the first time the underlying engramwas restimulated.Straight memory is also used in order to discover a certain type of incident which can belock-scanned. The preclear who is directed to a certain type of circuit command in his case maynot experience much relief through straight wire. But now that the auditor knows this type ofcircuit is in existence he can cause the preclear to lock-scan the circuit, returning to the first timehe can discover it and scanning up through all similar incidents to present time. Thus, straightmemory is combined with lock scanning, which is actually a high speed memory rather than areturn through locks. No auditor should feel uncomfortable about using any quantity of straightmemory. It will happen, however, that an auditor will get relief in the preclear by straightmemory, then return the preclear down the track to an incident which is then run, and afterbringing him back up the track will find that the relief which had been achieved before is nowapparently gone. This comes about because a present-time lock has been laid in by returning.Merely having the preclear remember his own act of running the incident, once he is back inpresent time, should restore his aplomb and equilibrium.The benefits of straight memory are many. The duration of these benefits is inquestion. By straight memory of pleasure moments or of the first time one had a certain illnessone can alleviate headaches, stomach aches, worries, and anxieties. This does not mean thatthe effect is permanent, as would be the case when the basic engram is run out. But straightmemory is the parlour trick of the auditor. In any group of people he can always find at leastone that he can make much happier simply by a few adroit questions. The auditor who usesstraight memory for this purpose should also develop the technique of the marksman, whowhen he makes a bulls-eye is clever enough immediately to lay aside the gun. Once the auditorhas achieved a spectacular effect by straight memory he should leave the case alone for thatsession -- unless, of course, he is engaged in a regular progress up the tone scale with hispreclear.Straight memory is a technique which should be studied and practised with considerablealertness as to the good it can do. No auditor should fall into the rut of believing that simplyremembering the past can do very much for the preclear. Remembering specific, causativelocks can, however, produce a marked change and improvement in an individual. Straightmemory is not free-association and is not random maundering; it is a precision technique andshould be studied and used as such.153"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTCOLUMN ADPleasure MomentsThe dianetic definition of pleasure is that the organism tending toward survival obtainspleasure by survival actions and the seeking of survival goals. In the organism below 2.0,tending toward death, a reactive pleasure is taken in the performance of acts which lead tosuccumbing on any of the dynamics. In other words, above 2.0 pleasure is survival, andbelow 2.0 pleasure is obtained only by succumbing or by bringing death to other entities, or bycausing self or other entities to be suppressed on the tone scale.True pleasure leads towards happiness. The “pleasure” which tends toward death is areactive counterfeit, but seems intensely valid to those in the death bracket of the tone scale.Happiness could be said to be the overcoming of not unknowable obstacles toward a knownand desirable goal.This postulates that the greatest happiness is the nearest approach to immortality. Agood job, skilled abilities, bountiful harvests, possessions; these are goals. There are veryfinite goals for the happy man in every day of the week, as well as the big goals toward whichhe directs his efforts. His happiness does not come from the attainment of the goals but fromovercoming obstacles on the way to those goals.Pleasure and immortality are near synonyms for individuals above 2.0 on the tonescale. There is a gradient scale of the types of pleasure enjoyed by those above 2.0. It seemsevident that the person at 2.5 actually takes pleasure in being bored, but surges up towardhigher levels when interest is concentrated on some goal not outside the understanding of the2.5.The 3.0 takes pleasure in reaching toward very clearly observable goals. The 3.0accepts his pleasure cautiously and tentatively, but nevertheless enjoys it. His pleasures are aptto be routine and relatively unimaginative.The 3.5 tends toward higher goals of survival and has confidence in reaching thosegoals. He can embrace more bountiful levels of survival. He can realize that survival as a barenecessity-level process is unsafe and intolerable and that if all computations demonstrate that hewill require two bushels of wheat per month to eat, then he had better provide twenty bushelsof wheat per month. His pleasure is wide and ambitious.The 4.0 achieves considerable exhilaration. His concept of survival is so bountiful andhe is yet so confident of his ability to reach such levels of survival, that he can take in auniverse of goals and, within the limits of his skills and talents, accomplish them. Here wehave a definite manifestation of attitudes toward goals, magnitudes of goals, and the ability toattain and enjoy pleasure. No man is happy without a goal, and no man can be happy withoutfaith in his own ability to reach that goal. The highest form of security is confidence in one’sself in the future, in the group, and in mankind. Without such confidence and without the willto make the various dynamics survive, an individual has no security. That person whomeasures his security in terms of a good job purposely short-sights himself as to the actualinsecurity of his position. A man who works for an organization which may endure long ormay be transient, according to popular indoctrination, is secure. And yet he may work to theperiod of his life when he is no longer adaptable and find himself of a sudden, without any jobbecause of the simple sudden shift of a board of directors or because of the antagonism of aforeman. Security would consist of this man’s being able to adapt himself to his environ, inhis being prepared for any possible shift in the factors which influence his job, and in his beingconfident of his ability to meet and deal with any possible shifts. Security is not a static thing.154"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Security would lie only in a man’s confidence in reaching his goals and, indeed, in his havinggoals to reach.There are automatic goals inherent in the plan of life. The conquest of MEST, thesurvival of the theta body, faith in immortality and the Supreme Being are all high levelautomatic goals. They potentially exist in anyone, but the amount of entheta inherent in thetheta body and accumulated within the generation may cause the individual or the group to fallfar short of any realization of its ability to attain these goals. The more entheta existing in thetheta body and accumulated in the generation, the lower or less reasonable will be the goals ofthe individual or group.Without goals, hopes, ambitions, or dreams, the attainment of pleasure is nearlyimpossible. Many individuals do not realize this and even though capable of assigning tothemselves goals and pursuing those goals, they permit lower-toned people around them notonly to undermine their confidence in their own ability to attain security and survival but also todeny them the right to formulate and strive toward goals of a desirable magnitude.At the lower levels of the tone scale one finds individuals who purposely enturbulate,upset, destroy, and with great ardour inhibit the goals, hopes, and dreams of those about them.Here we have the individuals from 2.0 down. These have goals which are themselves no lessdefinite than the survival goals above 2.0 It is a pitiful and terrible thing that individuals above2.0 expend vast amounts of coaxings and persuasions on mates, associates, and fellow groupmembers below 2.0 in an effort to get them to go toward survival goals. Individuals whoengage in this activity are immediately targets for those who exist from 2.0 down, since thesesee in the higher individuals a method of furthering their own goals -- and the goal of the 2.0down is death.An examination of the anatomy of death demonstrates that death can be a small or agreat thing. Death is actually a gradient scale. Small mishaps and accidents can tend towardgreater and greater accumulation of mishaps and accidents, until death of an ambition, death ofan individual, death of a cause, or death of a group is attained. Here is the story: “For want of anail the shoe was lost, for want of a shoe the horse was lost, for want of a horse the rider waslost, for want of a rider the battle was lost, and all for the want of a horseshoe nail.” Deathstems from small things and proceeds toward great things.Death is a soft-footed thing. Today a man makes a flagrant error in bookkeeping. Hemakes it because his wife has nagged him the night before. Tomorrow his superior finds theerror and marks it down that his bookkeeper is not always accurate. In itself this is nothing.But next month, when a bookkeeper has to be discharged, it is recalled that one made an error,and all other abilities being more or less equal amongst bookkeepers, the one who made theerror is discharged. Out of a job, the bookkeeper finds himself even more enturbulated at homeand spends little time finding new employment. He takes a job beneath his skill in an officewhere everything is hectic, and he makes more mistakes because he is now worried. This is alittle bit of death.There are those who talk about “lucky breaks” and who speak of the “hand of fate” intheir undertakings, but a forthright examination of the field of man’s activities will show thatnearly all success is most adequately deserved. The head of an imposing institute ofpsychology in a major American city told me recently that when he first entered upon hisprofession he was to some degree convinced that the capitalist, the big industrial manager, thedirector of the great corporation had arrived where he was because of avarice and carelessnessof the feelings of others.In the course of the many ensuing years he had, however, either with his own hand orthrough his staff, done industrial psychometric testing of many organizations and with thiswork had an opportunity to test a great many of the capitalists, managers, directors, andindustrial giants of America. He had found in every case that “those who were at the top verywell deserved to be there.” He had discovered that the endowment of these individuals included155"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"a rich appreciation of life, a great feeling for their fellow men, an enormous persistence, anintelligence in planning and execution. He had discovered that the world is carried on the backsof a few desperate, but very big men. And he discovered that luck was not chance.Individuals above 2.0 on the tone scale are uniformly lucky. There is something moreto theta than quite meets the eye. Here are the men on whom God smiles.Below 2.0 we have the unlucky. One could with some surety give to a person high onthe tone scale a few dollars and expect him to come out a winner at Las Vegas. And one couldexpect that the same few dollars given to a person low on the tone scale would see him comingout of the game very much the loser. Above 2.0, the individual plays to win. Below 2.0, theindividual uniformly plays to lose. And not only does the individual below 2.0 play to losehimself; he plays to lose for everyone else around him and for the future.It is part of the mechanism of death that individuals below 2.0 talk as though theyplayed to win, talk of the desperate need of saving and winning, talk of emergencies by whichone is expected to win. This is all part of the trap. Given every opportunity and every facilityand every circumstance by which they can win, people below 2.0 will inject into every plan thegerm of death, and acting ever so reasonably will permit that germ to grow until death isattained for the individual, for his associates, for the future, or for his organization. A Hitlerbrays his anger at the world and hounds all Germany into action with the argument of glory andyet, through not very mysterious mistakes, brings the hopes of Germany to death. He makes acharnel house of Europe, slaughters thirty million human beings, brings suicide to himself, andextinction of the hopes of his nation. Yet many times in the course of Hitler’s 1.5 activities hecould have converted Germany into the glory of the world. As a matter of fact, before hebegan to manufacture nothing but munitions he had revived German science to a point where itwas respected above the science of any other nation. By the simple and direct appeal thatGermany had become vital to the survival of other nations Germany could have risen andbecome glorious. But at no time when Germany could have risen did Hitler take the turningtoward survival. He chose instead the turning toward death.This play is not enacted always upon the stage of nations. It happens in manyhouseholds. It is a pathetic and terrible thing to find a man mated with an individual below 2.0.He does everything he can to succeed, and yet at every turn of his career he finds himselfbalked by some strange non-compliance, or some new enturbulation, and gradually little bylittle his energies decline until he himself is outward bound toward death and a new generation.A woman, mating herself to a man below 2.0, who is herself capable of a high level ofsurvival, will find herself broken by little “misunderstandings,” strange perversions, andquarrels at inopportune times, until at last her ambitions for a family and a future lie in the dustwhere so many dreams go. The man who takes unto himself a business partner below 2.0,who is himself well above that line, will find a strange concatenation of events building aroundhim which brings about the destruction of that business regardless of the hopes with which itwas founded and regardless of his own ability to carry it through. It would be better for anindividual engaging in a marriage, a business, or a group action to inject himself with poison orvirulent bacteria than to ally himself with anyone below 2.0 on the tone scale. If this seemsstrong, look around you at the blasted men, the blasted dreams, the stories never written, thesongs never sung because someone out of some pap of sympathy or “obligation” allied himselfwith an individual below 2.0 on the tone scale. This is death -- death as certain as laying one’sneck below the blade of a guillotine and hitting the trigger.From 2.0 down, the individual takes a reactive but very definite pleasure in attaining the“goal” of death for himself for the future, and for individuals around him. Here is enthetaseeking to separate theta from MEST to bring about death and to accomplish a new generation.In the vicinity of such people death may be silent and waiting, but ready to influence andpervert every action in the direction of succumb.At 2.0, the individual finds a reactive “pleasure” in sending forth antagonisms, incarping, and nagging, and criticizing. Left at liberty he will not sink any further on the tonescale but will continue to “abreact his hostilities.” He is dramatizing engrams. But should these156"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"dramatizations be broken, he will descend on the tone scale, It is an actual fact that whateverpleasure he obtains is obtained through these dramatizations. He can, by processing oreducation or changed environment, be brought up the tone scale, but left where he is he willcertainly drag others down it, since he is a point of turbulence, as are all people below 2.0. At1.5, the individual finds reactive “pleasure” only in the venting of anger. He has no actualconcept of pleasure, but he gains a feeling of dangerousness and therefore of “pleasure” in thedramatization of his dominating or angry engrams. If permitted to go on being angry, he willremain static, to some degree, on the tone scale, but if these dramatizations are balked or foughtagainst, he will descend down the tone scale, since he is not permitted to experience the“pleasure” which he can attain by being angry. His goal is to achieve destruction of things orpeople. He has considerable joy in achieving that destruction. People who are only temporarilyat the 1.5 level, which is to say who are being acutely 1.5, know well the satisfaction obtainedin smashing something. The chronic 1.5 can rise no higher than the smashing of things. Attimes in the past it has been felt that the individual who threw things, who went into a rage, andwho talked in desperately destructive terms was at the lowest possible depth of insanity. This isvery far from true. Anger is the very high bracket of insanity. One should beware of thosewho are lower on the tone scale and who bring about destruction only by convert means, forthere is no forewarning of what they will do. Any preclear whose reactive mind (and allreactive minds are below 2.0 on the tone scale) is coming up to ward a release will passthrough the zone of anger reactively and will be furious with people who have done things tohim and may even be furious at the world at large. This is a symptom of his getting well, not asymptom of his going mad. People are not easier to handle below the zone of anger. Peoplebelow the zone of anger are much more dangerous, since they will take much more devioussteps to bring about death. They do not bring about destruction in clean daylight as does theangry individual, but in the dark alleys and cesspools of humanity. The person who ischronically angry can be processed rather easily by Dianetics up into the higher tones, since hestill retains his vitality. It is only necessary for him to discover those things about which he isreally angry in order for him to centralize his attention, and he still has considerable theta withwhich to convert entheta. But, and never neglect it, this person’s pleasure is in being angry,and in running pleasure moments one had best discover moments in which the individual couldbe unreservedly angry at something.The 1.1 tends even more markedly toward death than the outspokenly angry individual.The 1.1 will make small slips and errors and bring about upset and turmoil in his vicinity withconsiderable aplomb. These are his joys. If the 1.1 is to experience any “pleasure” it will be inan act which is deviously and hiddenly destructive to himself, to the future, to mankind, to lifeitself, to theta, or even, although that is impossible, to the Supreme Being. It should beunderstood that an individual may have a 1.1 reactive mind and yet be quite analytically alertand only drop to 1.1 when he is enturbulated. This would be an acute1.1. But such a person is still dangerous. With the smoothest possible face, the 1.1can deny any and every destructive or death act which he or she has engaged upon. The 1.1hides all destructive acts and quite commonly puts a face of construction upon these activities.The 1.1 finds “pleasure” in sex only if sex is engaged upon with many people and in strangeand peculiar ways. (This does not contradict the fact that a man, like any male, may seek toown and impregnate as many females as possible -- not a 1.1 characteristic.) The 1.1 does notenjoy sex save only when it is hectic and enturbulative. Here is the satyr, the nymphomaniac.The 1.1 will injure or maim, animals or men for “pleasure.” And in running “pleasure”moments on the 1.1 the auditor will find such moments existing around the injury ofsomebody’s dreams or the body of some helpless being. Here “pleasure” is obtained not in thelight of day, but clandestinely and often hideously. The 1.5 takes “pleasure” in bringing aboutthe incapacity of a powerful enemy. The 1.1 takes “pleasure” in breaking his enemy’s backwhile the enemy lies helpless. The 1.1 may appear appealing, he may make a great show of hispowerlessness, but when the lights are dimmed the actions of this individual are directedenergetically toward death, whether the death of a reputation, the death of a cause (even thoughthe cause is apparently supported), or the death of himself (no matter how far he seems to thinkhis actions are from suicide.) In the 1.1 band, by the way, we find the individual mostblatantly insistent upon ethics and morals for others. The 0.5, being that much further toward157"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"succumbing and dying, attempts to bring about the death of his family, associates and self bycontinual forthright enturbulence in terms of death. Truth is, of course, no consideration at anylevel below 2.0. The most flagrantly untruthful is the apathy level of 0.5. The individual at0.5 obtains reactive “pleasure” in lying wildly but dolorously about the hopelessness andhorribleness of life and what has been done to him. To run what any individual at an acceptablelevel of the tone scale would consider a pleasure moment on a person at 0.5 is, of course, allbut impossible. But reactive “pleasure” can be obtained by the 0.5 in being as thoroughly 0.5as possible.The 0.1 can sometimes be coaxed into running a “pleasure” moment on the subject ofhow dead he is and how lacking in any dangerousness. If the auditor can contact him at all, itwill be at this level where the “pleasure” moments can be found.It is a general rule, then, that pleasure moments are run at the level where the individualfinds himself on the tone scale. Do not expect the 2.5 to run moments of high exhilaration,since the entheta on his case prevents him from reaching such a level. Do not expect the 1.1 torun a moment when he was extremely angry, since his position on the tone scale makes overtanger a very dangerous thing to indulge in, and the fear implicit in his position may prevent himfrom showing it. The general rule is that, above 2.0, the auditor discovers constructive andcreative acts of greater and greater triumph and magnitude as the preclear rises up the tonescale. And below 2.0, he finds greater and greater efforts toward death in the “pleasure”moments chosen by his preclear. In any case, it is overcoming obstacles toward the goal whichis important to pleasure. Below 2.0 of course, the individual is overcoming “obstacles” whichtell him to survive as he travels toward his “goal” of death. Death, to individuals below 2.0, isthe only valid and obtainable “goal” -- whether for self, future, group, or mankind. Anythingwhich interrupts this course toward the “goal” of non-survival will be fought by people below2.0. Such avidity for extinction is commendable only for the thoroughness with which theseindividuals will struggle to die. Because one deals here with eight dynamics, one should notbelieve that the individual below 2.0 works only toward his own death. At 2.0 he works rathermildly toward the death of a very wide periphery but does not much desire death for himself.At 1.5, he works toward the death of other beings or life forms or other dynamics. He will, ofcourse bring about death for self but he does not give heed to this. One cannot reduce the otherdynamics without reducing the first dynamic, of self, and bringing about one’s own death. At1.1, we get only an occasional conscious awareness that the individual is himself tendingtoward his own suicide. Death is intended, by devious means, for a lesser periphery. Wherethe 1.5 will seek the death of many, the 1.1 will seek, by covert means, the death of a few.The 0.5 seeks death in obverse ratio to the amount of attention he can give to his environ, andthat attention is normally isolated in the first dynamic and may include only a few intimates inthe environ. The 0.5, then, is the suicide, but before suicide can almost be counted upon toattempt the death of at least his closest associate, whether by murder or by enturbulation viasympathy. Occasionally the 0.5 will include the murder of children as part of personal suicide.The intimate of a 0.5 stands, actually, in the gravest peril in which an individual can possiblystand. The general running of pleasure moments can accomplish a very great deal in a case.There is the case of an elderly woman who had no other kind of processing done on her formany weeks. She was at the beginning of this period, according to report, bedridden. Anauditor with an experimental inclination spent two hours a day running pleasure moments withthis person, petty triumphs, joyous meetings, moments of good health and well being,moments of pride in accomplishment or in loved ones. At the end of this period, the elderlywoman was no longer bedridden and evidenced a considerable rise on the tone scale. Not asingle lock, secondary, or engram was run on the case. This should give the auditor some ideaof the value of pleasure as a target for processing.There is also a case of a person who could run no grief until pleasure moments werescanned intensively on his case. Such contact with the fact that pleasure actually existed in hislife enabled him to support, because of the free theta returned to him through the attraction ofhis attention to pleasure moments, contact with the moments of misemotion necessary to freehis case.158"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"Pleasure moments seem to say, first and foremost, that survival is possible. But below2.0, “pleasure” moments give the encouragement that death is possible. In either case the toneis raised whether the preclear desires it or not.The running of pleasure moments is done exactly as one would run an engram or asecondary engram. One requires the preclear to return to the moment when the pleasure wasactually taking place and to contact all the perceptics of the incident, seeing and hearing andfeeling the experience as fully as possible over and over. The preclear can run the incidentmany times before tiring of it, since at each running he should discover new instants andperceptics that had been hidden before. Running pleasure in this way seems markedly toincrease the amount of free theta in the case. On lower levels of the tone scale, actual pleasurein a person’s life, moments of survival, particularly those of triumph, are not easily obtainable.However, the auditor, by having the preclear run possible pleasure moments as concepts andthen, as they are contacted more closely, as actual incidents, can often demonstrate to thepreclear that pleasure has existed and is available.In view of the fact that obtaining pleasure is one of the primary goals of life, therunning of pleasure moments can do a very great deal for a case. There have been cases whichhave had sonic and visio turn on merely by the running of pleasure moments. The case is mostreadily stabilized by the running of pleasure moments. In trying to bring a case up to presenttime one should run several pleasure moments, if the case is difficult to stabilize in presenttime. After running such moments the preclear often comes easily to present time, havingrecovered attention units from secondaries and engrams somewhat restimulated in processing.Memory itself can be refreshed just by running on the track. One can, as anexperiment, choose some specific date in the preclear’s lifetime. This date may be completelyoccluded. But the auditor insists that the preclear return to this date. The preclear may becompletely in the dark as to what happened on, let us say, January 3, 1943. The auditor has theadvantage over the preclear, since he knows that when he has told the preclear to go to a certaindate, then the preclear has gone there whether the preclear knows it or not. The auditor thenrequires the recounting of the happenstances of, say, 3.30 A.M. on that date. The preclear maybe able foggily to point out certain incidents in the year 1943. If the auditor is very patient andpersistent in his address, he will gradually cause the “I” of the preclear to obtain the specificdetails of the date and moment, and he can then run this moment with its own actual perceptics.This is no less valid a technique than running pleasure moments. The mind has recordedeverything, and the auditor knows that when he sends the preclear back to such-and-such atime, the preclear is there even though the “I” of the preclear may be barred from the percepticsof the incident by entheta on the case. With patience and persistence the auditor can alwaysobtain the data which he requires.Moments of triumph are, of course, pleasure moments. But one often finds preclears,particularly those below 3.0 on the tone scale, who run moments of triumph withoutexperiencing any pleasure from them. The auditor may find the preclear winning a silver cup ata horse show, and the auditor may return the preclear to the incident and run him through itover and over, only to discover that the preclear felt he did not deserve to win the cup. This isthe difference between the preclear’s concept of reality and the auditor’s concept of reality. Byall reason, the preclear should have obtained pleasure in winning this silver cup at the horseshow, but in accordance with the preclear’s tone no pleasure was obtained from the incident,since possibly it brought about too much notice and notoriety or it conflicted badly with somespecific engramic computation of the preclear about winning or about hurting the othercontestants by having won. This should not discourage the auditor; it should only point out tohim that he is attempting to run pleasure moments too high up the tone scale for his preclear. Insuch a case, the auditor should go down the tone scale and find a time, perhaps, when thepreclear was able to destroy the reputation of some dear friend by some lying gossip and runthis as a pleasure moment. He will obtain in such wise, despite the auditor’s feeling that it isimpossible, a rise in tone. The auditor should not neglect the fact that pleasure moments may becreated and that a present-time pleasure moment is itself a point on the track and will tend todisenturbulate the preclear. This does not mean that the auditor should countenance the159"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"“pleasure” that would be sought by some individuals low on the tone scale, pleasure whichmight consist of the destruction of the reputation, future, or health of some young woman orchild. But it does mean that the auditor should encourage the preclear to provide himself withpleasure, as an assist to processing.The auditor if he is advising pleasure should not fall into the old error of believing thatpleasure is idleness and wastefulness. The greatest pleasure, for instance, that a composer canachieve is in composing. A genius in management achieves his greatest pleasure in overcomingobstacles to management. The best pleasure for an individual is in the attainment of happiness;the overcoming of not unknowable obstacles toward a known goal. The auditor may by adroitquestioning discover for the preclear the fact that he has goals toward which he can proceed. Itis a below-2.0 trick to take a creative and constructive individual and set him aside from theroute of his greatest pleasure, which may be the pursuance of highly arduous goals. Theauditor should not tell a mountaineer to go to the seashore for a rest but should encourage themountaineer in the belief that he can conquer a much higher mountain than he has ever attainedbefore, since if his mountaineer is ailing it is because some less-than-2.0 individual in hisvicinity has brought him, by great and detailed discouragements, to the belief that he can climbno more mountains.Pleasure whether for life or death is attainment or the overcoming of obstacles towardthat attainment. When running pleasure moments or when encouraging his preclear to createand construct present-time pleasure moments to raise his level on the tone scale, the auditorshould not overlook the fact that happiness is the overcoming of not unknowable obstaclestoward a goal. He will find the majority of his preclears without any goal. The auditor, byquestioning and without interfering with the self-determinism of his preclears, can help them todiscover and clarify their goals. Or he can assist in the identification of obstacles toward anygoal which the preclear already recognizes. Or the auditor can simply encourage the preclear tokeep on overcoming the known obstacles toward his known goals. The auditor will discoverpreclears who are not particularly low on the tone scale, who have yet had insufficientopportunities to experience pleasure, and so have behind them a barren life. An auditor isjustified in advising the preclear to go out and create and live through a pleasure moment, sothat the auditor afterwards can run it, to the enhancement of the case. The living of it, ofcourse, is more important than the running. The primary consideration is whether or notpleasure moments exist.It is interesting to note that any society declines in exact ratio to the contempt in which itholds pleasure and advances in ratio to the respect it has for pleasure.Above 2.0, pleasure contains more construction than destruction, more good than evil.Below 2.0, “pleasure” contains more destruction than construction, more evil than good.Immorality comes about when a thing contains more pain than it does pleasure. Societies haveexisted which found their pleasure in observing or inflicting more evil than good. The Romancircus is an example of this and marked a point in the decline of the Roman Empire whichforecast an early death for that great political organization.By true pleasure is meant acts which contain more good than evil.Before one condemns pleasure, one should understand the kind of pleasure aboutwhich a person is talking. But there happens to have been, down through the centuries, such arevulsion toward what the Roman Empire called pleasure in the early Christian days thatpleasure itself became inhibited. There are individuals and groups which consider theenjoyment of life a crime. This immediately and automatically spots these individuals andgroups on the tone scale. They are below 2.0 and are headed toward succumbing. Yet theauditor will have to cope with people who have been indoctrinated into an inhibition of pleasureand who by education are unable to experience pleasure. The auditor should have ready hisdefinitions of pleasure and an understanding of what pleasure actually is. From those who tellhim that pleasure is evil he should gain a definition of what they think is enjoyable. This is thetype of incident which can be run on the case as a pleasure moment. For those who tell him160"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"that pleasure is good and then proceed to detail promiscuity and sadism the auditor should haveat least an intellectual understanding.Because of the various situations which exist in the life of any person, pleasure assurvival and pleasure as death sometimes intermingle. It occasionally happens that someindividual has lost, through the chicanery, treachery, or betrayal of others, his woman, hisbusiness, or his reputation, and his idea of pleasure is the painful extinction of those who haveinjured him. This does not immediately denote a low position on the tone scale, for the auditormay find that such an individual delves into death for only one circumstance. If the othercircumstances of the individual are high on the scale, the auditor should recognize an immediateindication of where he should work in order to free considerable theta, which is tied up in plotsof revenge and dreams of painful punishment for the enemy. Such an individual, however, canordinarily run pleasure in other spheres of life. Even a low-toned individual can sometimesfind some sphere of activity, if very isolated, which is constructive, and thus the auditor knowswhere to look for actual pleasure on the case and can use this particular incident or type ofincident in order to free theta.The whole subject of pleasure moments is allied intimately with survival, where truepleasure is concerned. The auditor however, should not overlook the fact that it is “pleasure”for the 0.5 to contemplate the most gruesome possible suicide or the most pathetic death of thenearest “loved one.”The auditor should not be critical of the type of pleasure which his preclear selects butshould work continually to select the highest possible pleasure on the tone scale available to hispreclear. In other words, for the 1.1 he should try to find 1.5 or 2.0 or 2.5 pleasures ratherthan persisting along the line of 1.1. The auditor is attempting to raise the preclear up the tonescale and in the process of doing so he will find that higher and higher levels of pleasure can beobtained not only in present time but in the past. The amount of pleasure of the true varietywhich the preclear can experience or run is symptomatic not only of his chronic position on thescale but of his progressive rise toward more desirable levels.161"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINE;COLUMN AEImaginary IncidentsOne of the social aberrations of America is that imagining things is a misconduct.“Imagining things” has been made equivalent to “insanity.” It is a common derogatorystatement to say that one is “imagining things.” It is a nullifying criticism to say that oneexperiences delusion. The child is particularly subject to a bombardment of criticism for beingimaginative.The condemnation of imagination signifies a fear of departure from reality. But ifimagination is so thoroughly condemned, then those who condemn it must have some basicfear that they themselves cannot hold on to a reality.There is nothing wrong with imagination. There is a great deal wrong with the type ofaberration which makes it impossible or at least difficult for the individual to differentiatebetween the imaginary and the actual. So long as the individual knows he is imagining whenhe is imagining, and knows he is dealing in fact when he is dealing in fact, imagination has ahigh validity.There are three types of imagination. One is creative imagination, whereby in the fieldof aesthetics the urges and impulses of the various dynamics are interwoven into new scenesand ideas. The second type is the more or less practical type of imagination which comes aboutas a result of computation. Without this second type of imagination an individual could. notforecast the future nor could he postulate a goal desirable in the future. This type of imaginationis so vital to computation that the individual who lacks it can be seen to be definitely deficientanalytically. The third type of imagination is delusionary or hallucinatory. If the culture desiresto make itself more sane, it would cease to apply the word “imaginary” to things which aredelusionary of hallucinatory. Delusion connotes a type of imagination which is not known bythe individual to be imaginary. However, in engrams one commonly runs into the phrases “It’sall your imagination,” “It’s all in your head,” “You’re just imagining things” and othercommand phrases which short-circuit the preclear’s ability to differentiate between what weshould now call the imaginary and the hallucinatory. The imagination becomes hooked in to thefact bank, and “I” receives data as fact which is actually the product of imagination. There are,one could say, four distinct sources of aberration. The first is occasioned by phrases inengrams which specifically dictate certain obsessions, compulsions, repressions, delusions,neuroses and psychoses. Such phrases, however, have command value on the analyzer, whichdoes not know they exist below it in the reactive mind, only to the degree that the case ischarged with entheta. Command phrases and action phrases become more and more obeyed bythe analyzer the more the analyzer is shut down through cumulative aberration. Action phrasesare effective more and more as the individual descends on the tone scale.Therefore, there is a second type of aberration source which is simply the amount ofcharge there is on the case. This might be called mechanical aberration. It does not stem fromspecific commands but stems from mental inefficiency by reason of cumulative entheta. As thepreclear descends down the tone scale, certain definite manifestations take place by reason ofcumulative entheta. The whole chart around which this book is written is a result of the studyof the effect of accumulating entheta on aberrated individuals. Entheta by itself can charge up acase to the point where the case will behave in certain definite ways regardless of the commandcontent of the engrams.The third kind of aberration is environmental and is the result of aberrated persons andsituations in the individual’s present-time environment. This a normally temporary, butcumulative environmental entheta has a chronic effect in the case.162"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The fourth type of aberration is educational, being the cumulative entheta of the culturein which the preclear was raised, the irrationalities and bad data he has received as a result ofhis education, by parents, in schools, and by experience.There should be listed a fifth type of aberration and even a sixth and seventh type, butthese are at this time of less concern to the auditor. The fifth type would be the cumulativeaberration of the theta body through its many generations, which he may or may not have toaddress in the clearing of the case. The sixth type would be the pattern behavior inherited on thegenetic line, of which very little is known, but it can be estimated that any organism has somepattern behavior of which some small portion might be considered incorrect for theenvironment and so, by a stretch of definition, could be considered aberration. The seventhtype would be aberration due to missing or malformed portions of the human structure, eitherthrough genetic inheritance or through accident of psycho-surgery.Thus, we see that imagination is valuable and vital both to creating tomorrow’s realitiesin the society -- the invaluable contribution of the artist, writer, and composer -- and in thepractical computations of everyday living, and that it should not be discounted in value in therational human being.Then we see that imagination by engramic command, which confuses the real with theunreal without proper evaluation, can introduce falsity into the thinking and execution of theindividual.Additionally we have imagination, by reason of charge on a case, beginning to supplantreality as the case descends down the tone scale. Imagination thus becomes mechanically moreand more short-circuited into a supplantation of reality, as the position of the individualdescends the scale. In the past it was thought that people imagined things willfully in order to“escape” reality. The old therapies never bothered to evaluate reality, but were very glib indemanding that people face it. “Escape” and “delusion” were epithets used in order to poundthe patient into obedient subjugation. (The practice of telling the patient that his incidents areimaginary rapidly reduces the individual on the tone scale, since it destroys the patient’s senseof reality, and is a practice definitely calculated to further incapacitate the patient. The fact ofthe matter seems to be that as an individual drops down the tone scale the cumulative charge onthe case makes existence in its actual form more and more intolerable. What theta he has left,perhaps because of reversed polarity, cannot perceive into the entheta of the reactive mind andthe mostly shut-down analyzer. It is not that the person is unwilling to face reality; it is that heis incapable of facing reality. Said in another way, the individual is veered away from thethings which have been done to him in life toward imaginary postulates which can serve him inlieu of fact. For example, the individual who cannot feel that he is a threat to the enemies in hisenvironment, at least to some degree, is insane or becomes insane. Thus, as the individualdescends on the tone scale he becomes, by imagination, first a threat to real things and then, byimagination, a threat to imaginary things, and finally no threat at all to anything, at which pointhe has reached pretended death. The individual departs further and further from reality, at firstknowing that he is departing from reality, and then being unaware that he is departing fromreality, at which point he could be considered to some degree insane.A possible explanation for the short-circuiting of imagination by the mechanical meansof cumulative charge on a case may be of interest to the auditor. There is no good descriptionand, indeed, no accurate postulate or theory which accounts for the ability of the human mindto remember in the quantity that it does. The most recent attempt was made by a man who haddabbled in physical structure but who did not know his mathematics. He originated a punched-protein molecule theory, and stated that memory charges were stored in punched proteinmolecules. His theory holds up only so long as it takes one to work out by mathematics that ifan individual recorded only the major perceptions of his environment day after day and storedthem, by this theory of holes in molecules in which are stored memories, he would still have instorage capacity only enough, in the ten-to-the-twenty-first-power binary digits of cells thebrain contains, to serve for three months of memory. Therefore, this theory of punched proteinmolecules is not valid.163"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"A workable analogy on the subject of structure -- and it should remain an analogy only,since it does not do any more than help one to understand what is happening -- tells us that wemay be dealing, in considering memory and the human computer, with a problem not unlikephysical universe electrical charges surrounded by insulation. Certain things tear down thisinsulation, so that memory items begin to short-circuit one to another. This would account forthe identification of one fact with another which occurs more and more as the tone scale isdescended. Low on the tone scale, things are identified with other things which are actuallywidely different; but at the higher levels of the tone scale, where the mind is in good workingcondition and there is no great charge on the case, minute differences can be detected by thecomputer between one memory item and another. At the top of the scale, the mind is capable,for instance, of differentiating between two cigarettes which, though they appear identical andare of an identical brand, are different, if only to the degree that they occupy different units ofspace. At the bottom end of the tone scale, not only would these two cigarettes seem to be thesame cigarette but these two cigarettes would also be tobacco, which would also be tobaccosmoke, which would also be chewing tobacco, which would mean that chewing equaled ahouse on fire. At the top of the tone scale, at the highest levels of reason, one has sharp, high-level differentiation between facts, and at the lower end of the tone scale the most widelydifferent facts and items are associated as equal. One could say that the equation of the reactivemind was “A equals A equals A equals A” regardless of what A stood for. In an engram, allthings and remarks are equal to each other, are equal to the pain, are equal to the perceptics, andhearing equals vision and vision equals tactile, and a complete identification occurs. Theanalyzer when full on thinks in minute differences. The ability to think has to do with theability to differentiate. Unthinkingness has to do with a lack of ability to differentiate and acompulsion to identify unlike things with each other as though they were not only like thingsbut the same thing. In an insane person, the administration of sedation seems to bring about amomentary recurrence of sanity. As an analogy only, then, it could be said that entheta breaksdown the structural insulation separating one memory item or unit from another and so causesidentification. And it could be said that the presence of any euphoric would rebuild orreestablish this insulation to some degree and make rational thinking possible. The auditor whoaudits a preclear who is under sedation will discover that so long as the preclear is undersedation he appears to be responding to treatment, but the moment the sedation wears off all theauditing and most of the entheta which was thought to be turned into theta have now becomeshort-circuited into brand new aberration.Probably the most dangerous thing one can do to any aberrated mind is to place it underheavy sedation and try to treat it, or while it is under sedation place it in an atmosphere which isrestimulative. Sedation of the insane is, shortly and abruptly, criminal, since it permits newperceptics to become entangled with an already confused mind under circumstances ofperception which could not take place if the patient were not under sedation. It should bethoroughly understood that this analogy of insulation between memory units in the mind is,very definitely, an analogy and is used for illustration only, so that the auditor may know betterwhat he is confronting. Entheta definitely seems to tear down and arc across any divisional andinsulatory barriers in the mind. As a further analogy, it could be postulated that as the mindbreaks down in its ability to differentiate and begins more and more to identify, the variousunits of the analyzer begin themselves to become too closely associated and begin to replaceeach other, so that that portion of the mind which is used for imagination becomesundifferentiated from that portion of the mind which is doing computation on fact.This would also be an analogy which took place regarding valences, wherein the “I”which is the real individual, becomes obliterated in favor of other highly-charged sections ofthe analyzer. And here the analogy breaks down, since the valence walls between the differentpersonalities of the individual grow more and more sharply defined as the individual descendson the tone scale, so that at last the heavily charged case goes from one valence to another soabruptly that one can almost hear the click as he crosses the valence wall. Of course, one couldadd to this analogy and say that the theta which has become entheta at last begins to form upinsulation of its own, but this does not seem very likely. Certain it is, however, that theidentification of incidents which are in no way even similar is symptomatic of the insane. Theauditor should understand, then, as he confronts his preclear, that he may have before him an164"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"individual who is incapable of facing any facts in his case. This may be limited to an inability toface facts in certain spheres of his life, such as failing to face facts concerning his wife. Hemay have such a thoroughly charged second dynamic that he can face no facts concerning hismarital existence or his children, but will turn to imaginary “facts” which are, if untrue, stillvery safe. The auditor should not under any circumstances try to force or persuade his poorpreclear to “face reality.” The auditor should be perfectly willing to accept that in certainspheres of the preclear’s life the actual facts of the case are so definitely entheta that what thetaexists in the preclear’s mind is unable, by reason of polarity, to encounter the real facts in thecase. Almost any human being, in some sphere of activity, will deal in imaginary incidents, upto the level of 3.0 One, when he faces the idea of school, will detail imaginary incidents simplybecause his actual school experiences contained so much entheta that the theta veers away fromit and turns to the imagination to be supplied with “facts.” Another individual will deal infactual material throughout his field of activity except where religion is concerned. He mayhave so much entheta on the subject of religion that he veers away from actuality here and talksin terms of atheism, or may go in the other direction and become completely hallucinatory. Butin this case, he is veering away from his MEST universe to the point where he is constructingan imaginary sphere of activity. (The individual who simply turns to the theta universe andperceives there certain visionary things is not necessarily aberrated at all but may be simplyhigh on theta perceptics. The aberration which is cited above is of the variety of the sadisticzealot, who has been, is, and always will be so much trouble to the Church). Or the imaginarysphere which “I” believes to be wholly factual, may bc the existence of lost gold mines. Here,so much entheta exists with regard to practical and workable means of living that he must dealin imaginary means.Somewhere in every case you are going to find the preclear running imaginary incidentsin lieu of real incidents. As an auditor you should not worry unless your case is running amajority of imaginary incidents in lieu of real incidents, for your case then is running delusionrather than fact, by reason of a very low position on the tone scale. Here is a problem for you.You dare not tell this preclear that he is running delusion. This would be a break of theauditor’s code. But somehow you must persuade him to address present time or some lockslong enough to free some theta so that he will have a theta-ability to face reality. On such a caseyou could actually blunder and run physical pain engrams, but you would only enturbulate thecase further by trapping the existing free theta on the case into the existing entheta, and youwould assuredly send the case down the tone scale rather than bring it up. Where the imaginaryincident becomes generally preferred to the actual incident you can be quite sure that you aredealing with a low-tone preclear.Now there are three ways of handling delusion. The first way is to electric-shock, orprefrontal-lobotomize or sedate the preclear into utter apathy and uselessness in the society andwreck him completely. This is not recommended.The second way is to scan free or obtain in present time enough free theta to bring theindividual up the tone scale to a point where he will run actual incidents rather than imaginaryincidents. This is highly valid.The third way is to coax the preclear into running avowedly imaginary incidents, andthis is the crux of this particular technique of processing. By openly inviting the preclear to runimaginary incidents the auditor is breaking down the barrier of pretence which the preclear willunknowingly put up. The running of avowedly imaginary incidents is quite productive.Sometimes the preclear will run them, quite astonishingly, with somatics. But he is not beingrequired to face any reality about them and the auditor is not insisting that any reality existsconcerning them. In an astonishingly high percentage of times, however, he will be runningactual incidents. So long as he does not have to admit that these incidents are actual he can dosomething about them. One might say that the auditor is thus validating the imaginationmechanism of the mind and is strengthening it and is already beginning to put the general andbroad segments of the mind into good working order by differentiating one from another withthe preclear. Of course there is always the danger that the auditor’s use of the word “imagine”will restimulate the preclear, because this preclear may have engrams which tell him that he165"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"does not know true from false and that it is all imagination anyway. But this chance should betaken.It should be understood that no amount of imaginary incidents can supplant the runningof real incidents. The first value that this technique has -- the invitation to the preclear to runavowedly imaginary incidents in his past -is to build up the preclear’s confidence in the auditor.The preclear begins to feel that he will not be censured for indulging in fantasy. In this great,wide, and undoubtedly rational culture, almost any preclear has been cut to ribbons as a childfor indulging in fantasy. The child lacks data and makes up for this lack with a wild and ruggedimagination. The child quite easily sees fairies and strange animals walking about, with hisimagination. If he finds life dull and elders hard to shock into taking an interest in him, he mayrecount these things as valid. He is, of course, inevitably censured by the hard-headed,“practical”, and “rational” elder and so accumulates a series of locks on any engrams he mayhave. Left to himself and his fantasies and imaginings, the child will eventually, of course,find out what is reality -that grim thing in our world of the twentieth century -- and what isfantasy. But the elder is apt to press the child into too early an acknowledgement of this“reality”. Actually, of what absolute reality is neither you nor I have any notion, but we haveagreed upon certain facts, and having agreed, we wish to remain friends, and so we continuethis agreement. As a culture ages, these agreements are harder and harder to disturb, and aremaintained not because they are true but because they are simple and easy and because noenergy is required to maintain them. The child, fresh and new in the world, would like to see alittle excitement in his reality. And the elder, worn and haggard by a combat with an environwhich offers little in terms of security and much in terms of menace, fights back against thesebright bubbles and dreams. Thus, any preclear you have on the couch is fairly certain to haveexperienced a confusion between what he wanted to think was reality and what he was told hewould have to accept as reality. Thus, there was an invalidation of his reality, even though hisreality was actually imagination. When the preclear on the couch discovers that he has anauditor who not only will listen to imagination but who encourages it, the affinity level rises,and the preclear’s ability to differentiate in terms of reality will itself rise.In the running of imaginary incidents, the auditor must never, after the incident hasbeen run, then insist that the incident was real. This would be a break of faith. He and thepreclear have entered into a contract that what is being run is pure imagination, and the auditormust not break his contact.The running of imaginary incidents may consist of running imaginary pleasuremoments, which is heightening in terms of theta, or it may consist of running imaginarymoments of grief or physical pain, which makes available to the auditor more data on the caseand may actually increase the theta on the case.Here is a most interesting fact for the auditor. It may happen with an aberrated childthat he has occasionally pretended injury or illness for the sake of accepting sympathy orinterest from his parents, guardians, or mentors. The auditor would do well to discover thetime in the life of the preclear when he feigned injury or illness knowingly in order to receivesympathy or interest from those about him. In the first place, when an individual will do thishe is in fairly bad shape, for this is a form of pretended death. The environment wherein thepreclear would do this must have been a highly restimulative environment which had thepreclear low on the tone scale. (One should realize that in the course of a lifetime, environ toenviron, an individual varies markedly on the tone scale.)Those knowing pretenses are of interest to the auditor because they are invariably realas to their background. The preclear may have supposed at the time, in all confidence, that hewas lying, but he was actually offering a sympathy engram to those about him, and the auditorcan thus discover a highly aberrative engram on the case. Whether or not this case is in shapeto run this engram is up to the judgement of the auditor, but he knows at least that it exists. Thepreclear who continually pretended an injury to his foot, for instance, may have supposed thathe was lying and may have supposed that he had never had a foot injury, but in actuality166"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"somewhere, earlier, hidden from his analytical mind, a foot injury exists for which the preclearreceived a great deal of sympathy.Sympathy incidents are relatively hard to locate. The preclear will hold on to anincident in which he received sympathy much longer than one where he received onlyantagonism. The location of the allies of the preclear is thus rendered difficult to the auditor, butthe mechanism of discovering the “imaginary” illnesses which the preclear offered to the worldaround him discovers the allies. (There is another method of discovering allies which is ofinterest. One finds an antagonistic personality in the preclear’s life and runs the preclear backthrough incident upon incident where this antagonistic personality was attacking him, until onefinds a point where the preclear was being defended by someone. The person who does thedefending is an ally or a pseudo-ally* of the preclear and incidents with this person should befollowed backwards and forwards and cleaned out of the case, as one of the most aberrativeelements of the case.)The imaginary incident serves four purposes. First and foremost, it gives the auditordata about his preclear, since the imaginary incident which the preclear will recount has somebasis in actuality.The next point is that the recounting of an imaginary incident heightens the affinitybetween the preclear and the auditor. The preclear begins to find that the auditor must besomewhat compatible with him, since the auditor will accept the preclear’s evaluation ofexistence and seems thus to be in agreement with him and to be similar to him.The next value of the imaginary incident is that it increases communication between thepreclear and the auditor. Here, at least, we have the preclear talking about something and theauditor listening, and the preclear discovering that the auditor will listen, without interruption orcriticism, to a recounting which may be quite wild and sensational.The fourth value of the imaginary incident is that it finds the auditor non-insistent upona high level of fact, and so will find the preclear more willing to deliver fact.The imaginary incident could be said to be a testing ground. The auditor asks thepreclear to run an imaginary incident. This is all right with the preclear, since they have agreedthat the incident is to be imaginary, and thus the preclear cannot be censured for sayinganything he pleases.It will happen, in the running of imaginary incidents, that somatics will turn on. Or itwill happen that the preclear is suffering certain somatics and yet is too low on the tone scalewith regard to this particular subject to admit the actual cause of these somatics. By running offimaginary words and phrases, imagining what papa says, imagining what mama says, orimagining the year in which this happened or imagining the circumstances relating to this it maycome about that the somatic disappears. One has actually run off an engram or a heavy lock andthe case is thereby benefited.The auditor does not cavil with the preclear about facts, in any case. Where the auditorhas to use imaginary incidents to get any information of any kind out of the preclear, he isdealing with a preclear who has been invalidated very thoroughly by the people around himmost of his life. The imaginary incident is a mechanism which actually repairs pastinvalidations. The preclear will not admit that an incident is actual, because those around thepreclear have too often challenged his ability to recount actuality or to deliver forth facts. Theauditor gets around these past invalidations by himself refusing to invalidate, by inviting anincident purely on the basis of imagination. The preclear is heartened. The auditor will receivedata. And free theta may be liberated in the case. THE PRECLEAR AND AUDITOR AS AGROUPIt must be noted somewhere in this work, and may be noted here since the running ofimaginary incidents is most productive of the result, that the preclear and the auditor form,167"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"actually, a group. One need not know the high level of technology which is Group Dianetics tounderstand that two human beings make a group. Two is the basic unit not only of theta but ofhuman beings in group terms. The group may number millions at its largest, but in its basicsize it is at least two.Occasionally the preclear will discover in the auditor an antagonistic personality. Thiscomes about when the auditor reminds the preclear of some personality earlier in the preclear’slife who did something non-survival to the preclear. The auditor who permits himself to go onin this imaginary role of a past antagonist will find that his task is greatly increased. It is of verygreat value to the auditor to clear himself and the preclear as a group, before he begins anyserious auditing. In the optimum group, a high level of affinity, reality, and communicationmust exist. Between the auditor and the preclear ARC must be high.There are various ways to clear groups. The auditor should not be as anxious toapprove of the preclear as he should be to have the preclear approve of him. Nevertheless, itwill take considerable strain off the case and the processing if this works both ways. Oneauditor in order to clear himself and the preclear as a group habitually requests the preclear totell him what the preclear does not like about him. The preclear at first, through propitiation orsocial usage, will not admit that there is anything about the auditor he does not like, but onpressing the case, this auditor very shortly discovers for the preclear antipathetic individuals inthe preclear’s past of whom the auditor reminds the preclear. The first act of the auditor then isto clear up these bad associations by straight memory.The establishment of affinity, communication, and reality between the preclear and theauditor is a vital concern if processing is to follow anywhere near an optimum course.Where a co-auditing team is being formed, and the success of Dianetics is built uponco-auditing teams, a mutual clearance is required, whereby each unburdens himself to theother, and by straight memory, undesirable associations are cleared out of the relationship. It isremarkable that between any two human beings bad associations by reason of past existingpersonalities are almost inevitable. Individuals on the normal level of this social cultureassociate hidden past personalities with present personalities they meet. Straight wire caneasily clear up this situation. The auditor mentioned above was having some difficulty with awoman preclear until he discovered that the way he cleared his throat reminded her of the firstof her husbands, of which she had had three. The point here is that the auditor did notimmediately forego his habit of clearing his throat merely because the preclear objected to it.The auditor went to work and caused her, by making her remember, to conceive a differencebetween himself and her first husband. The moment she did this, the auditor’s habit of clearinghis throat was no longer of any importance. The auditor should not change his habits andtraining pattern to match every preclear, but should use the effect of these upon the preclear tolocate past antipathetic personalities. This in itself frees theta in the case.The use of imaginary incidents acts to form a smoother relationship between the auditorand the preclear by establishing for the preclear the auditor’s willingness to accept anything thepreclear has to say. But it does more than this. It gives the auditor a valuable assessment of thepreclear’s position on the tone scale, for he can judge this rather easily by the type of incidentwhich the preclear likes to imagine (see Pleasure Moments), and it tells the auditor what may bein highest restimulation in the present-time environment.The auditor who will scorn imagination or condemn anything the preclear says asdelusion, regardless of the auditor’s inability to compare it with his own concept of reality, willinevitably bring about the destruction of the auditor preclear group. And they will not be able towork together.The husband-wife team has been found in Dianetics to be the least compatible auditinggroup. A few husband-wife teams are successful, but the majority are not, and husbands andwives would do well to look outside the home for coauditors, for trouble in co-auditing caneasily cause a shaky marriage to collapse.168"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TEN;COLUMN AFLocksElsewhere we have the anatomy of entheta. Entheta could be said to be in four forms.There are probably more than that. By entheta we mean, of course, enturbulated theta. Thefirst form is that which is the basic cause of entheta, the engram. Here, theta in its effort toconquer MEST has come into too heavy a collision with MEST. In an organism this causesphysical pain.Theta after it has become enturbulated with MEST can either by the mechanism of deathor by dianetic processing be withdrawn from the MEST and bring with it an intelligence of thelaws of MEST which it can then use in a further conquest of MEST on a more orderly andharmonious level. All things begin with a heavy impact and enturbulence, if anything is to belearned by theta about MEST. The first Foundation, for instance, in its year of existencesmashed heavily into MEST, and if this delighted those who desired to preserve the status quoor those who had no use for an end of aberration, yet much was learned, so that GroupDianetics could come into being, and so that improvements could come about as a result of newdata on the third dynamic which in turn resulted in improvements along the first dynamic and inthe techniques of individual processing. The engram is a moment of physical pain andunconsciousness which is recorded in the reactive mind with all perceptions during the periodof unconsciousness. It can be keyed-in by conscious-level experiences, it can be dramatized,and it can manifest itself either as mental aberration or as physical aberrations, which in the pastwere called psychomatic illness.The engram consists of enMEST, which is the MEST of the organism enturbulated ordisordered by impact, and entheta which is mingled with the enMEST.Entheta can exist as temporary enturbulence in the individual’s life force or reason whenhe is confronted by unreasonable or non-survival circumstances in his environment. Thiscould be called temporarily enturbulated theta. However, in any situation in present time whichis restimulative, a certain amount of entheta becomes fixedly entheta and is stored in the reactivemind and thereafter, save in those extraordinary circumstances wherein enormous quantities offree theta are in the environment of the individual, or but for dianetic processing; this fixedentheta remains fixed. The “permanently” fixed entheta remains in the reactive mind in the formof secondary engrams or in the form of locks.The secondary engram will be described in its own turn, but is a low-tone-levelexperience of loss, or fear of loss, or anger because of threatened loss, or apathy because ofaccomplished loss. The lock has three variations. One of them is where the individual has beenprevented from carrying out the commands of the engram which is restimulated by present-timeenvironmental perceptics (broken dramatization). Another is merely where the perceptics of theengram are approximated by those of the present-time environment (restimulation). The third iscaused by inhibitions and enforcements of ARC.In order for a lock to be formed it is necessary for the analytical portion of the person’smind to be somewhat lowered in activity or alertness. Locks can be received only when anindividual is weary, upset by reverses or is in a generally nonoptimum situation. These lightapproximations of engrams in the analytical present-time environ were believed in the past to beaberrative in themselves. Actually, they were not. The lock is only the surface manifestationof the basic environmental cause of aberration. Underlying any lock must be an engram.Ignorance of this fact was one of the main reasons for the failures of past therapies. A lockoccurs also when the individual is attempting to carry out the irrational commands of theengram and is prevented by the society’s or some individual’s counter “reason” fromaccomplishing the dramatization.169"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Locks are analytical-level encystments of entheta.The average case probably has several thousand engrams. Individuals are oftenquestioned on the subject of how often they have been unconscious. A few of them willanswer that they have never been unconscious in their whole life. As soon as they are sent backdown the track, they begin to discover period after period when they have been injured oroperated upon, and certainly every individual has been born, and birth above all otherexperiences is sufficiently arduous to bring about unconsciousness. Since the reactive mindregisters upon a cellular level, and also upon a theta-body level if evidently to a lesser extent,the earliest moment when an engram can be received is certainly no later than conception.Engrams do not begin to receive locks, ordinarily, until well after birth, and usually well intothe speech period, although babies will react to the uncomprehended sounds in the environmentwhich are also included in their engrams. A lock is, then, a relatively light incident whichbetokens a restimulation of some engram on the case. There are in any case tens of thousandsof locks. If one continued to address locks and only locks in a case, processing would bealmost interminable. This is fortunately unnecessary. Locks have only to be addressed in acase until the preclear is up to a point where he can run engrams. After the preclear has run outengrams, the locks consequent to any engram or chain of engrams which he has run out can bescanned off with great speed.Locks are interesting to the auditor mainly on the low-tone cases. On many cases theauditor will discover that locks have to be run as engrams. He will find a period where somepreclear has as a young girl been forced to eat spinach, and this will seem to be a highlyaberrative incident.The preclear, if very low on the tone scale, may be responding to the action phrases orcommands in the lock, yet this incident contains no physical pain of any kind, and still, oncesent to the incident the preclear is unable to leave it until it is run, complete with action phrases.This would betoken a very low-tone preclear. The auditor should not think that the reason hispreclear is aberrated is because she was made to eat spinach when she was eight years old. Theauditor should understand that underlying this incident is an engram, or many engrams,whereby the preclear is dominated. But if the auditor discovers that the lock is in itselfaberrative, he should understand that this is no time to run engrams, since this preclear must beunburdened of many locks and secondary engrams before she will be in shape to run engrams.Here is a very heavily charged case.As one can read in the column on the tone scale chart, a 4.0 has all locks discharged.This is something overlooked by the ambitious auditor. A 4.0 is, by definition, one who hashad all entheta in his current life converted to theta. This means that his engrams must havebeen erased, that his secondaries must have been discharged, and that his locks must have beenscanned out. The 3.5 will blow locks almost as fast as the engrams underlying chains of locksare reduced. The 3.0 does not have to have locks addressed as individual incidents, but in orderto clear up the case, scanning of locks is necessary.The 2.5 can have locks treated with benefit as individual incidents. It will be found thatmoments when the 2.5 was criticized for stepping out of line at school or for being mean tosister will release some entheta. However, the auditor is to some degree wasting his time bytreating, at this level on the tone scale, non-physical-pain and non-misemotion incidents asindividual occurrences.Around 2.0, locks begin to become important. The auditor can go into a moment in thepreclear’s past life when the preclear was consciously alert and had something happen to himwhich was productive of entheta, and yet discover that the incident will not reduce. This non-reduction of relatively simple incidents, as it proceeds from 2.0 down the tone scale, indicates aconsiderably charged case. Minimal physical discomfort in an incident, if the restimulativeagents in the environment are high, can produce moments when the preclear was alert andawake which then refuse to reduce when addressed by the auditor.170"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The 1.5 is peculiarly susceptible to the type of lock which breaks the dramatization. Letus say that the 1.5 is being angry against something, and someone criticizes him for beingangry or prevents him from carrying out the full cycle of his anger. A lock results which will beremarkably effective in reducing this person on the tone scale. Of course, any 1.5 receives anearly countless number of such incidents, since the society generally frowns upon peoplebeing angry and would rather have them apathetic. On a 1.5 an auditor can run these brokendramatizations with benefit as individual incidents just as though they were engrams.At 1.1, we begin to find locks extremely effective, particularly when they concernbreaks of affinity, breaks of communication, and breaks of reality, or enforcements of ARC.The 1.1 lives in fear most of the time, fear of something, if only a nebulous anxiety. Theremark of a 1.1’s friend which leads the 1.1 to believe that he will not immediately see hisfriend again may produce a lock even though the 1.1 that very evening may dine with hisfriend. Here the entheta is beginning to pile up at a very rapid rate. The auditor can run suchincidents just as though they were engrams with some benefit to the case.At 0.5, we begin to discover that locks must be handled gingerly, for locks in a 0.5 canbe heavy enough to cause the preclear to hang up on the track, except of course in the wide-open case, which runs on the track even when completely insane. In the apathy case the loss ofa glove or the mere receipt of a letter even though it is good news can cause a lock which has tobe run as an engram by the auditor. A heavy lock where something really happens would bemuch too strong in entheta for the preclear to attack, and the auditor should avoid incidentswhich would be productive of aberration at the 1.5 or even the 1.1 level. The 0.5 can beaberrated by a sneeze.The 0.1, if the auditor can contact this individual, is so low in theta that incidents whichwould be pleasure moments to anyone else are the strongest and heaviest encystments whichcan be attacked. The only past moment which can be attacked in a 0.1 is an instance of themildest variety, such as going for a ride in a car, or eating supper. Any incident of mentalstress is to be avoided and any incident of physical stress is, of course, entirely out of thequestion, as it has been from 1.1 down the tone scale.171"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENCOLUMN AGScanning LocksThe advent of lock scanning was the greatest single advance in techniques of applicationin Dianetics in the last six months of 1950.Lock scanning was developed in an effort to convert the maximum amount of enthetainto theta in the least possible time. It is a remarkable technique. It was discovered thatindividuals who were thoroughly stuck on the time track and heavily over-charged could send afew attention units earlier and later than the point where they were stuck and could in such afashion actually emerge from a chronically fixed spot on the time track, and so come to presenttime.The value of lock scanning can hardly be overestimated. The heavily occluded case canbe lock-scanned. Auditing, bad and good, can be removed from a case by lock scanning.Invalidations of Dianetics, which reduce the preclear’s ability to be processed, can be removedfrom the case. ARC locks in enormous quantity can be de-intensified. It is a technique withwhich the preclear can be moved swiftly up the tone scale. Lock scanning can producesufficient change in a case to move the case two points on the scale in a single session. A casewhich has been audited inexpertly can be set to rights and boosted up the tone scale by lockscanning. Some cases on which many engrams have been run may yet not have risen on thetone scale, because the entheta of the processing has enturbulated present time and has creatednew locks. Lock scanning remedies this. With two to four hours of lock scanning these caseswill rebound swiftly and attain a new level of activity.The technique of lock scanning is a very simple one. All aberrative incidents are intypes in series of a similar nature. All affinity breaks by a certain person on a case could beconsidered a chain. All affinity breaks by anyone in any environ at any time could beconsidered a very broad consecutive chain in the preclear’s life. All affinity enforcements by asingle person on the preclear could be considered a brief chain. And all affinity enforcementsby all people could be considered a broad chain. Communication, talking, listening, seeing, notseeing, and all other perceptics, enforced and inhibited, make up their own chains. Realityenforcements and inhibitions make up their own chains of agreements and disagreements. Theauditor can actually draw up a chart on which all possible chains of locks can be shown, interms of affinity, reality, communication, and broken dramatizations.Engrams also exist in chains, as will be covered later. The engram or chain of engramsprovides the basic upon which locks can be accumulated. Hundreds and hundreds of incidentsmay be derived from an engram or chain of engrams. To run each one of these incidents asitself would require far too much time on the part of the auditor. But the preclear can readily bebrought by the auditor to scan, slowly or rapidly, similar types of incidents, from the earliest tothe latest, either with regard to one person or with regard to all persons or with regard to aperiod of time.The commands necessary to permit the preclear to lock-scan are very simple. These canbe made far more complex, since speeds of scanning can be demanded of the preclear. It isdiscovered, however, that the preclear will normally scan at his own speed. The auditor asksthe file clerk if there is a type of incident which can be scanned in the case. The file clerk, at asnap of the auditor’s fingers, answers yes or no. The auditor requests the name of the type ofincident. The file clerk gives the name of the type of incident. The auditor then tells thepreclear to go to the earliest available moment on this chain of locks and again asks the file clerka question, as to whether or not this chain can be scanned without running through anyengrams. Assured that it can be, the auditor tells the preclear to scan from this earliest momentto present time through all incidents of the type named. The auditor makes a drill of this, and172"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"never varies his procedure. He sends the preclear back to his starting line, the earliest availablelock of this type. He makes certain the preclear is there by asking “Are you there?” When thepreclear assents, the auditor then says “Through this chain of incidents, avoiding all physicalpain, begin scanning” (snap !). The final command, telling the preclear to begin scanning, islike the starter’s gun. Slowly or rapidly, the preclear goes up through these various similarincidents. These incidents may consist of all the times when anybody stopped or interruptedhim when he wanted to talk. Or they may consist of the times that a certain person, such as thepreclear’s mother or wife, demanded affection. But whatever the type of incident, the auditormust adopt a routine and not vary this routine. The auditor should always tell the preclearwhen to begin scanning. The preclear should not be encouraged to go to the earliest moment hecan discover and then start forward without any further signal. The preclear should report to theauditor when he has reached the earliest available moment, if he is able to know this. And theauditor should instruct the preclear to report when he arrives at present time, so that no timewill be wasted.Scanning can be done either vocally or non-vocally. The preclear can give the auditor,each time he touches a new incident, the most aberrative phrase of that incident. This would bevocal scanning. Or the preclear can simply go through the incidents recognizing each one as hepasses it, or racing through them so fast that they are merely a blur, without telling the auditorwhat he is contacting.It will be discovered that the preclear ordinarily finds the most recent locks in his casethe first which can be scanned. As he begins to scan chains of locks off his case, he will beginto find earlier and earlier chains of locks and portions of chains which he can scan. He shouldbe encouraged to discover earlier and earlier moments in his life.Any time a preclear starts to scan a chain of locks, he can be expected on the second orthird time through to find earlier incidents of the same type which he previously missed. Thisis symptomatic of more and more theta being available to the case, so that earlier and earliermoments can be reached. The auditor should not bully the preclear, however. If the preclearcannot discover an earlier incident after the auditor has requested one, the auditor should not beinsistent.Any chain is scanned many times. It will be discovered that at first there are only one ortwo incidents on the chain. Further scanning brings forward five or ten incidents on the chain.Then the old incidents begin to drop out as unimportant and new incidents, hitherto unrecalled,begin to appear. The chain is, ordinarily, short during the first scan, then it appears to lengthen,and finally the preclear either becomes interested in his outside environment or in another chainor the chain becomes so short that it takes him only a moment to scan through many years ofhis life. The mechanism of scanning is this. One contacts an incident and recognizes it as aconcept of an incident. Perhaps one has a phrase in the first incident. The auditor may ask thepreclear to repeat that phrase or not, as the auditor desires. The preclear then goes forwardfrom this incident to the next one of a similar type that he can recognize. The mind is intenselyselective of types of incidents it can scan. It seems that there is a filing system in the mindwhich files according to topic. This is what is used in lock scanning.If one wishes to be precise about lock scanning, there is vocal rate, in which thepreclear scans pausing at each new lock up the chain only long enough to give the mostaberrative phrase out of it. There is non-vocal scanning, in which the preclear recognizes thephrases as he goes by them, incident to incident, from early to late, but does not tell the auditorwhat phrases he is contacting. There is accelerated rate, which is merely a rapid glance at theincident, before the preclear goes on to the next, and in which the auditor is not told what theindividual incidents are. And then there is maximum speed. Maximum speed can be so fast thatthe incidents are simply a blur. The preclear has no analytical recognition of what is happeningbeyond differences of position, flashes of faces and flashes of words.Lock scanning frees theta from innumerable incidents and is highly instrumental inraising the tone of the preclear. It should not be confused with the chain scanning of engrams.173"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Chain scanning through moments of physical pain is not desirable in cases below 3.5 on thetone scale, since the engrams, by their physical pain, will snatch more free theta back intoenturbulence than will be freed.Theoretically, a case can be lock-scanned to a point where practically no aberration ismanifested, but this is only theoretical, since only one of four types of entheta is beingconverted. The four types, of course, are entheta received because of the present-timeenvironment, entheta encysted in the form of locks, entheta existing as charge in engrams, andentheta existing as engrams themselves.The type of entheta which exists as charge in locks and in secondaries frees from late toearly. Engrams run from early to late. Thus, one begins lock scanning very late in the case.One may find it necessary to scan out a marriage or a business relationship which exists near topresent time before one can continue with anything else in the case.It does not much matter to the auditor whether or not the preclear is in valence -- insidehimself -- when he scans through these chains of locks. Lock scanning is a broad, sloppytechnique. The preclear can be out of valence; he can scan imaginary incidents; he can scanconcepts; he can scan even his own conclusions about life. He can scan anything from whichentheta can be freed.In order to get rid of the entheta on an education there is nothing that compares withlock scanning. One can also do this trick with lock scanning: he can refresh an education. Anindividual can be given an examination in, let us say, history, eighth grade. He can then belock-scanned through the actual study of history in the eighth grade and given anotherexamination. It will ordinarily be found that he will receive a higher grade after he has beenlock-scanned through that educational period. And yet the lock scanning may not have requiredmore than fifteen or twenty minutes. In this wise, lock-scanning is an excellent trick for thoseabout to take an examination on academic subjects.People can lock-scan themselves with considerable ease, unless they are too low on thetone scale. They merely start at the earliest incident they can remember of a certain kind whichmay be troubling them and come forward through all similar incidents to present time. They dothis over and over until they become interested in their present-time environment. The time tostop lock-scanning of any particular chain of locks is when the preclear is extroverted, which isto say interested in his present-time environment, or when the chain requires only an instant ortwo to scan. It can happen that a preclear is scanned through a chain of locks beyond the pointwhen scanning this particular chain of locks should be stopped. The auditor will then findhimself with a preclear who is running another set of locks. There is nothing particularly bad inthis, but the auditor has lost control of the case for a moment. The auditor should, then, bealert as to how long it takes the preclear to scan each chain, and as to how the preclear feelseach time he finishes scanning the chain, and he should ask questions about these points. Lockscanning is a highly unrestimulative type of technique to the auditor. The preclear, unless he isrunning at vocal rate, is not uttering restimulative phrases, and he can go from early to late andpass through the most amazing array of incidents without the auditor’s being aware of what isgoing on. Therefore, the auditor does not become restimulated. It happens, however, that anauditor running locks in chains on a preclear can become somewhat bored. He should not, nomatter how much he would like to relieve his tedium, interrupt the preclear in any way until thepreclear has finished scanning the chain. Each time, the auditor should let the preclear sweepforward to present time. As in any other case, the auditor should always check the preclear tofind out if he is in present time at the end of each scan, unless the preclear is scanning a periodof time which does not include present time.One can scan locks in terms of time, let us say from the fifth to the tenth year of thepreclear’s life, or from the twentieth to the twenty-fifth year, or from the thirtieth to the forty-first year. Or he can scan between specific dates. Scanning can be done on one person on onesubject. Scanning can be done on one type of activity. Scanning can be done on education orearly training. Scanning can be done on the immediate environment of the preclear.174"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Lock scanning of auditing is a highly valuable procedure. The auditor, in everysession, if his preclear can scan at all, should scan off all of the auditing. This is to say, sendthe preclear back to the moment when the session began and have him scan forward to presenttime. It does not, then, much matter how many engrams the preclear has restimulated or whathas happened during the session; the preclear by scanning can de-stimulate the incidents whichrise. The failure to reduce an engram was much more serious in the past than it is at this time.Lock scanning makes it possible to run the session in which the engram was restimulated. Therestimulation of an engram without reducing it is merely the creation of a new lock. Lockscanning reduces this new lock. The auditor should never be critical of how carelessly thepreclear may be scanning. Lock scanning is broad enough to include such proclivities.Looking over the tone scale one discovers first that any 3.5 when he has had hisengrams run out in their entirety has to be lock-scanned through all activities of life in order toqualify as a clear. This frees up all locks. Locks, of course, at this level of the tone scale arevery easy to free, since they have few engrams underlying them. In the near-clear, they have noengrams underlying them, but locks can still exist on a case which has been cleared ofengrams. Although these locks may work out in the next many months after the last engram isrun, it is far easier to sit down to a systematic scanning of all the persons and circumstances ofthe preclear’s past life.The 3.0 can be lock-scanned with great profit and will scan through locks withouthanging up in any of them. In this way, new series of engrams can be bared to view. The onlyreason engrams cannot be run is because too many locks exist on top of them, and lockscanning is the best method of getting off this entheta in order to make the engram itselfavailable.The 2.5 has to be lock-scanned in order to get engrams to show up clearly. After lockscanning has taken place, an engram can be expected to come into view with all of thenecessary perceptics. Lock scanning tunes up the 2.5 to a point where engrams can be cleanlyrun. In order to discover new engrams in the 2.5, new chains of locks should be scanned.The 2.0 can be lock scanned, but the auditor should work with chains of locks given bythe file clerk. Every chain which is contacted by the auditor on the 2.0 should be reduced, justas one would reduce engrams that were contacted. No chain should be left in restimulation atthis level but should be run completely. If the session is too short for this, scanning of thesession will probably cause the restimulation to fade out.From 2.0 on down, lock scanning begins to develop a brief liability, but not a lessenedworkability. The preclear is apt, after he scans a certain chain of locks a few times, to hang upin one of the locks or to hang up in some minor secondary. It is then necessary to run whateverincident the preclear finds himself hung up in as an engram in itself although it may contain nophysical pain.The 1.5 will, as a common result of lock scanning, hang up in a lock. The auditorstarts scanning locks and after a short time finds that the 1.5 is not moving on the track. Heshould always admonish the 1.5 to inform him when he stops on the track or when he appearsto cease moving on the track. Otherwise, the 1.5 is likely to flounder around, wondering whyhe is not going forward to present time but not saying anything and so many minutes ofauditing are wasted, until the auditor recognizes that something is wrong and does somethingabout it. If the 1.5 hangs up in a lock and the auditor by running this lock as an engram cannotreduce it, then it is only necessary to start the 1.5 scanning another set of locks (gotten from thefile clerk, of course). By scanning the new set, he drops out of the engram or lock in which hewas stuck. This is the peculiar virtue of lock scanning. If one cannot reduce the engram orsecondary or lock in which the preclear may hang up, it is only necessary to cause the preclearto scan a new chain of locks in order to release the preclear on the track. This as a mechanismwhich must be stressed, for it is very important. Whenever a preclear hangs up in a lock, andby running the lock just as though it were an engram the auditor finds that it will not175"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"immediately reduce, all the auditor need do is consult the file clerk to discover another chain oflocks which the preclear can scan or discover an earlier incident of the same type in which thepreclear is locked up. Scanning the new set of incidents or contacting the earlier incident bystraight memory will cause the preclear to become free on the track.Below 1.5, a new mechanism is introduced into lock scanning. Actually, this is acombination mechanism.At 1.1, or for that matter from 2.0 down, lock scanning can be combined with straightmemory. By straight memory, a certain type of incident which is found to be aberrative in thepreclear may be contacted. When this type of incident is contacted the auditor need notnecessarily leave it at that but may direct the preclear to go back to that incident which wasdiscovered and scan through all similar incidents. Very shortly, earlier incidents of the sametype will show up, and so an enormous number of such incidents can be taken off the case.Lock scanning can actually be called a high speed straight wire. Straight memory combinedwith lock scanning can isolate certain circuit commands or domination commands or “controlyourself” command which would remain hidden under ordinary lock scanning procedures.The 1.1 can be expected to hang up in some lock after the auditor has started himscanning. The auditor, then, scans locks on the 1.1 in the full expectation that he will shortlyfind the 1.1 not moving on the track. Indeed, that 1.1, unless a wide-open case, willcommonly or chronically be stuck on the track, as will be also a 1.5. Lock scanning bringsinto view, however, heavier locks. Entheta is converted to theta until the heavier lock will showup. The heavier lock, of course, was no less effective when hidden. Lock scanning bares it toview. The auditor then runs this new incident in which the preclear has stuck in order to freehim, or failing to free him, finds another chain which can be scanned in order to free him. Thescanning of a new chain to free the preclear from a point on the track where he is stuck can beovercomplicated by the auditor. Actually, it is only necessary to direct the preclear’s attentionto a new subject or to ask the file clerk for a new subject. The preclear might get so thoroughlyinvolved with the lock in which he sticks that it would not occur to him that he could scan anyother subject at the moment. It is up to the auditor to realize this and to direct the preclear’sattention to another type of incident. Scanning the new type of incident, the preclear may freeup from the incident in which he was stuck but hang up in a new lock. The auditor tries toreduce this lock as though it were an engram and failing that he goes on to a third type of chain.The 0.5 cannot be lock scanned, with profit, since the 0.5 will inevitably hang up toothoroughly. But if the auditor does make the mistake of scanning a 0.5 through locks, he mustremember that it is only necessary to use straight memory to free the 0.5.The 0.1 should never be scanned through any locks.One of the ways of freeing an individual who is being lock-scanned out of an engram orlock in which he has suddenly hung up is to give him straight memory. Straight memory actsas stilts by which he can be brought up again to present time. The scanning of locks can becombined with the running of single locks and with straight memory, with great facility. Anindividual who is stuck somewhere on the time track can be given straight memory or newchains of locks to scan.The scanning of pleasure moments should not be overlooked as a valid technique forraising the tone of a preclear. When a preclear is particularly low, at the beginning of a session,or at the end of one if the auditor has made some mistake, it is necessary to raise his tone.Scanning of pleasure moments will very often permit enough free theta to come into existenceeither to make new incidents available or to end the session successfully.It should be admonished again that when one scans locks one should work as closely aspossible with the file clerk, consulting the file clerk as to what chain of locks should next bescanned on the case and then following as nearly as possible the file clerk’s directions. In theabsence of file clerk directions the auditor should use his own judgment or talk the subject over176"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"with the preclear. It will very often happen in the process of lock scanning that the precleargoes into a boil-off. It should be remembered that boil-offs are highly beneficial and should notbe interrupted for any cause whatsoever. When the preclear comes out of the boil-off, theauditor should ask him for the phrase which put him into the boil-off and should ask thepreclear to repeat that phrase again. The preclear, repeating this phrase out loud or to himselfseveral times, will ordinarily then go back into the boil-off. Boil-offs should be exhaustedcompletely. They are a condition of somnolence which is sometimes indistinguishable fromsleep, and a preclear should not be disturbed while he is in one. The removal of boil-off from acase is the removal of accumulated anaten, and is highly beneficial. Some cases can do nothingbut boil-off.The individual can lock-scan himself if he keeps in mind the fact that when he hangs upin a lock somewhere out of present time he must nudge himself into scanning another type oflock rather than trying to fuddle through the place where he is stuck.It will also happen that the preclear will run into grief charges as a result of scanninglocks. It may be that he gets grief on a single phrase. He may not know from what incidentthis phrase comes. If he is fairly low on the tone scale, he may have no conception whatsoeverof what he is crying about, but the release of grief in any event is beneficial. It may occur thatthe only way the auditor can get grief off a case is by scanning certain chains of locks and thengetting grief off a single phrase. An individual who has a chronically restimulated somaticwhich is giving him sinus trouble or a headache can be scanned out of it without anyrecognition of what was the source, in engramic terms, of the headache or other malcondition.In such an instance it is mainly beneficial to scan pleasure moments. This will almost alwaysraise the preclear’s tone.The value of lock scanning, it may be repeated, is difficult to over-estimate. Theauditor will do a great deal of it on any case. Any case, except the 0.5 and 0.1, will benefitfrom lock scanning. The auditor may make the serious mistake of believing that because theengram is the basic cause of aberration it is therefore the only thing or the main thing that heshould contact. He should disabuse himself of this idea. With the high speed technique of lockscanning he can bring a case up to the point where running engrams will permit the case toproceed to clear. Without taking this charge off the case, he could run engrams for a thousandyears and not bring his preclear up to clear. The auditor should use straight memory and lockscanning and the running of secondaries until the case has enough theta to run engrams.It is possible to run actual engrams on a low-toned preclear session after sessionwithout raising his tone. This is because the running of engrams on such a case lays inauditing locks. The theta which is freed from the engram is immediately reenturbulated and thepreclear’s tone remains the same or sinks because of the enturbulation of more and more freetheta in numerous auditing locks. Such a case should be lock-scanned.The auditor should develop his technique of lock scanning and should be very patient inhis use of it. He will find himself at times sitting silently for twenty or thirty minutes while thepreclear scans one chain. The auditor should be content to sit there and let the preclear scan,until it becomes apparent to him that the preclear is not moving on the track or is in somedifficulty. He should have a complete understanding with the preclear about what they aredoing. The preclear should understand that the auditor, working with the preclear’s file clerk,is the one who selects the chains of locks to be scanned. The preclear should understand that itis the auditor who starts him scanning, and that the auditor is still in control of the case. Bylock scanning, the auditor will get the maximum amount of entheta on the case converted backto free theta, where it belongs.177"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVE;COLUMN AHSecondary EngramsProbably the majority of entheta which accumulates in an individual becomes tied up insecondary engrams. A secondary engram can be defined as a period of anguish brought aboutby a major loss or a threat of loss to the individual. The secondary engram depends for itsstrength and force upon physical pain engrams which underlie it. Without a physical painengram it is apparently impossible for a secondary engram to be formed.The type of entheta which becomes trapped in a secondary engram is evidently a heavyreverse of polarity of theta. Emotion becomes misemotion. Affinity, reality, andcommunication components of theta, by the loss or threat of loss to the individual, convert toentheta and thereafter repel the affinity, reality, and communication components which yetremain in a state of theta. An engram is a moment of physical pain, such as an anaestheticoperation, an accident, an illness, or any condition producing unconsciousness. An engram canoccur, however, and remain inactive. No engram is active until it is “keyed-in”, which is tosay until a moment when the environment around the awake but fatigued or distressedindividual is itself similar to the dormant engram. At that moment the engram becomes active.It is keyed-in and can thereafter be dramatized. It will effect, by virtue of its commands, theprocesses of thought of the individual, creating obsessions, compulsions, neuroses, andpsychoses below his conscious level. Or the physical pain component can create “psychomaticillnesses,” which are in Dianetics more accurately called the “chronic somatics” of engrams.Physical pain engrams can exist in large numbers on a case without being keyed-in andwithout being active. The key-in may be only a lock. The key-in and additional locks begin togive the engram more and more entheta, and it becomes more and more powerful in its effectupon the individual. It has to be, in short, “charged up” in order to affect the individual.The heaviest and most abrupt charge which an engram can receive is a secondaryengram. The physical pain in the physical pain engram makes it possible for large amounts oftheta to be trapped when that theta is enturbulated by a present-time shock such as the loss orthreatened loss of survival factors in the person’s life. If the physical pain engram were notthere to entrap the temporarily enturbulated theta, the theta, apparently, would simply un-enturbulate and the individual would return to a fully rational state. In the presence of thephysical engram, which contains some approximation of the loss or threatened loss, when asevere shock of loss or threatened loss occurs the turbulence of the individual is to a largedegree trapped and a heavy charge enters the physical pain engram and remains there untildianetic processing removes it or until the theta and MEST of the individual are separated bydeath. The theta body has been discovered to contain amounts of entheta as secondaryengrams, but the charges are not as heavy ass those of the current life, according toobservation.A physical pain engram, once it has been charged up by secondary engrams, becomesinaccessible to the analyzer to such an extent that the individual trying to address this engram orseries of engrams cannot, with the free theta available to him, penetrate the core of the physicalpain. Hallucinatory impressions of the engram may occur. The engram may be run almost as adream sequence. The somatics are light or non-existent. Content is markedly altered. Theposition of the engram on the time track may be seriously occluded. In short, the existence ofsecondary engrams above primary engrams makes it impossible for an individual to runphysical pain off his case. A few minor secondary engrams on a case may only dull thesharpness of the perceptics, but the usual case has many heavy secondary engrams on it. Theseriously occluded case is occluded because of the existence of secondary engrams.178"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"The demarcation line between theta and entheta is 2.0 on the tone scale. The presenttime environment of the individual varies on the tone scale, just as the individual, from periodto period in his life, may vary, although in the absence of processing the individual’s course isa gradual decline. One could take any environment and judge its position on the tone scale. Inother words, the individual can be located on the tone scale for his chronic position, or for amomentary position. A group can be located on the tone scale, for its chronic or temporarystate. And the present-time environment can be located on the tone scale.Today one’s environment might be happy. This environment would assist one’s tone,pulling one slightly up the tone scale. Or when the environment is very happy it has theoccasional result of making the individual’s activities and conduct momentarily those of a 4.0,even if he is ordinarily considerably aberrated. But where a 4.0 would have a resilience andwould respond only partially to a present-time environment, a thoroughly aberrated person isalmost a slave to the environment, and the lower the individual is on the tone scale the moreseriously he is affected by low-tone environments. Thus the 1.1 might act like a 2.0 in a veryhappy and secure environment, but in an even slightly enturbulated environment the 1.1 mightact momentarily like a 0.8.Good news, sudden successes, the envisionment or attainment of new components ofsurvival make for a pleasant and happy environment. This would be an environment above 2.0on the tone scale, the tone of the environment rising in direct ratio to the potentiality of theenvironment for the survival of those in it. When an idea, a datum, a circumstance, a person,or the general environment is conducive to the survival of the person in question, it can be saidto be on a tone scale level above 2.0.Environmental circumstances which lie below 2.0 on the tone scale are enthetacircumstances and are enturbulative to the individual. Ideas, news, associations, persons, orthe general environment, in the band from anger down to pretended death restimulate theindividual’s existing entheta and enturbulate more of the free theta of the individual and sobring about a reduction of the individual on the tone scale. These are non-survival factors,factors which tend toward the death of the individual or the group, even though the tendencymay not be in terms of actual death.It should also be recognized in viewing this and in understanding secondary engramsthat when one looks at the tone scale one is looking at both pitch and volume. In music, a notemay be anywhere on the musical scale and yet not be loud. This would be a note of a certainpitch but small volume. A note can be of a certain pitch with a great deal of volume. Further,the note by harmonics and overtones may have timbre, or quality.It is much the same on the tone scale of human reaction and behavior. The position onthe tone scale of a momentary circumstance or of a chronic state tells us only the “pitch” of theindividual’s or the group’s or the environment’s tone. Volume is the second factor which mustbe studied in considering the tone scale. An individual may be bored but not, as the saying is,“to any degree.” He is bored only a minor amount. He may at another time be bored a majoramount. In the lower tones, he may be afraid, but only slightly afraid. Or he may be so greatlyafraid that the fear is terror. The amount or volume of enturbulence might be read in anotherdimension, extending from the face of the chart out toward its peruser. There might be a littlebit of grief or a great deal of grief but the position on the tone scale would be the same.There is also the matter of quality of enturbulence. The quality of the fear or the angeror the quality of the happiness is important. But this would be a factor which would bedifferent from pitch or volume on the tone scale.The amount of free theta with which an individual is endowed is enormously important.The amount of free theta has a great deal to do with the persistence or reasoning force of theindividual along any course. This would be the volume of a person. The quality of a personwould be more a structural thing. To make this clearer, a person may have an enormousvolume of endowed theta, and yet not have the structure with which to be intelligent. Or he179"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"may have a quality index which is very high and yet not have sufficient endowment of theta toexecute the plans which he can conceive. We have all known the individual who received A’sin every course and yet who was never able to do anything with his education. And we haveknown the individual who received nothing in the way of grades and who, indeed, neverseemed even to comprehend elementary subjects, and yet who, by power of personality, forgedahead to a high position in life. A study of this matter gives a useful evaluation of humanpotentiality and behavior. More importantly, it gives some understanding of what happens tothe individual in the process of becoming aberrated. Aberration, considered as pitch or tone, istheoretically independent of quality (structure, probably) and volume (theta endowment). Thefactors of quality and volume would account in part for the individual differences which may befound in aberrated persons at similar levels of the tone scale.Physical pain engrams are the major ARC break between theta and MEST. By ourdianetic theory, theta and MEST have a certain native affinity for each other, but when thecollision or impact of one against the other is too great or too sudden, a reversal of polaritytakes place, and this affinity is changed to a lower-level manifestation. Theta and MESTcoming together at 4.0 would be in complete harmony with each other. A working organismwould result wherein the chemicals and compounds in space and time, running on MESTenergy, would be motivated and animated by the ideas and experience of theta energy, and ahigh level of survival would be postulated. Given a little physical pain, however, a slight dropon the tone scale occurs, since the theta and MEST have lost some affinity for each other, arenot in such good communication with each other, and thus cannot attain such harmoniousagreement, or reality, as to their purposes. It is a mission of MEST to survive or succumb. Itis a mission of theta to survive or succumb. The purposes have parallels between theta andMEST. When theta and MEST are in union on an harmonious level, one could say that theARC of theta forms a nearly perfect and resonant chord with MEST. When physical painoccurs a slight amount of dissonance results. This dissonance is insufficient to cause aseparation of theta and MEST, until 2.0 on the tone scale is reached. After this, the dissonanceis so great that theta is antagonistic to MEST but still operating. At 1.5, an active and violentdiscord exists to separate the theta from the MEST. Lower, the dissonance grows wider. Bythe time 0.5 is reached a near null of dissonance has been descended to, which makes the thetaalmost inactive with MEST. At 0.1, this null has become so wide that the two are not existingtogether at all. and at 0.0, death is reached for the organism.There is the overall life of the organism, which could be said to be the theta body. Thenthere is somatic life, or the life of cells. The life of cells persists below organism death, but asthe basic organism life and the MEST have mutually rejected each other, somatic life, unlessassisted by other organisms, as in the experiments of Alexis Carrel, dies away within the nextfew minutes or months, thus producing complete organism death and leaving in its place theMEST compounds which have been organized by the theta and which are themselves a sort ofevolution of MEST.It is at 2.0 (and the tone scale is somewhat arbitrary, though based on observation andworkable) that loss of life has set in. Separation of theta from MEST is necessary, in theabsence of processing, for the chronically enturbulated individual or group, from 2.0 down.Momentary enturbulation because of environmental circumstances brings about the sameintention. This intention, when manifested as anger, is not immediately observable. But angeris destruction and death. From there on down, loss becomes more and more likely.There is a direct parallel on the tone scale between the position of the individual, thecondition of the theta, and the way MEST is handled by theta. At 4.0, theta is handling MESTwith great adequacy. At 3.5, there is a little less certainty on theta’s part in handling MEST. At3.0, theta has, through learning it can lose MEST, become conservative in its handling ofMEST. At 2.5, theta is handling MEST in a relatively lackadaisical fashion, since it is not wellconvinced that it can continue to do so. At 2.0, theta is unable to handle MEST adequatelyenough and so begins to reject MEST and to attempt to eject itself from MEST. At 1.5, theta isdetermined to reject MEST and to eject itself from MEST, but its determination is still directedat all the MEST surrounding it, and not so much at the organism in which it is contained. It is180"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"attempting at this level to eject the organism from the environment by destroying theenvironment. At 1.1, the stratum of fear has been entered. The theta in the organism has to bevery careful how it destroys the area around it, but the ejection of itself from the organism andthe rejection of the environment is none the less certain. Here the organism has accepted the factthat the theta and MEST will separate and that the environment contains no survival factors butonly non-survival factors. At 0.1, death has been accepted by the organism as a condition of adeath environment.A study of this demonstrates an evident third factor in the theta - MEST theory. Theorganism itself has an intention of survival, possibly, even when the theta and MESTcomposing the organism have determined to separate. Much theory can be postulatedconcerning this. What is interesting to us in processing is that below 2.0 the theta intention istoward separation from MEST, either the separation of the organism from MEST by thedestruction of the environment, or the destruction of the organism itself. Theta has manychoices in the way this can be accomplished.Survival is often obtained by an organism through the agency of another organism. Asthe mistletoe lives upon the life of an oak, so may an individual exist by virtue of a powerfulally. Any child has, in his parents, allies which assist his survival. The child, if these parentsmaterially assist his survival and yet deny him his self-determinism, begins to live almost asthough he were the parents. The theta of the child becomes invested, one might say, in the thetaof the parents.It might be said that the theta of an individual, when it is suppressed from the control ofits own organism, can commingle with the theta of other organisms. This is an unexploredobservation. But this much is certain, that the theta of any individual may identify itself withthe theta of the individuals around to such a degree that the death or even the illness of thesurrounding individuals, one or more, may cause the same reduction on the tone scale of thedependent individual. This could be worked out on the basis of restimulation in theenvironment, but it seems to have deeper significance than that. The auditor will often find hispreclear so thoroughly associated with another individual who is dead that his preclear upongoing into a session may cross his hands upon his chest as though he were a corpse.Investigation of the situation demonstrates that this preclear has lost a powerful ally, such as hismother, grandmother, father, grandfather, or guardian, and that the preclear is stopped on thetime track at the moment of death of this ally. This preclear’s theta has become so thoroughlyassociated with the theta of another that when the other person died the preclear to all intentsand purposes died himself but continued to live as an organism, though thoroughly interruptedas an identity.This confusion of identities between one person and another is severely aberrative. Bystraight memory technique an auditor can begin to separate identities out of his preclear,discovering in the preclear habits and patterns of thought and action, and finding who in thepast had these patterns of thought and action. The preclear may identify the person to whomthese habits and actions really belonged and thus to that degree regain his own personalidentity.Personal identity is very important. It is a parallel to self-determinism. When theindividual’s identity has been absorbed to a great degree in the personality of another person,another way of saying the commingling of theta, a loss of personality ensues with a consequentreduction of analytical dynamic and ability to reason. It is very important for the auditor tocause the separation of these identities.The secondary engram may consist of any misemotion from 2.0 down the scale. First,there is antagonism because of a threat of loss of survival components to the individual. Thenthere is anger toward the sources that threaten loss. Then there is fear that loss will occur,either loss of one’s own life or loss of one’s allies. Then there is the level of the accomplishedfact of loss, whether of position, of persons, or of things. This is the level of grief. Next,there is the level where loss in not only accomplished but the individual thinks because of this181"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"loss that he himself and all around him are lost. This is apathy. Finally, the loss is sothoroughly accepted that the environment and everything in it are renounced and life itself isrenounced as lost. This is pretended death, only a decimal above actual death.Here we have the dwindling spiral. All locks actually lie below 2.0 on the tone scale ifthey are themselves aberrative. These are the minor threats to survival, the introduction into thelife of the individual of minor components which threaten his existence. There are many ofthese. They are of small volume, such as momentary incidents of fear and losses of smallpossessions. Other person’s losses may form locks.The secondary engram is a large volume affair. In the secondary engram one has, at2.0, antagonisms felt because of major losses which are threatened. At 1.5, one has the angerbecause of a threatened major loss. At 1.1, one has the fear that a major loss will occur. At0.5, one has the grief because a major loss has occurred, and an apathy resulting because of theapparent inability to recover what has been lost. At 0.1, we have such a magnitude of lossesthat life is unsupportable and the entire environment seems to the individual to have collapsedand become dead itself.The secondary engram can, then, consist of a major antagonism, a major anger, a majorfear amounting to terror, a major grief or a major apathy, or a major concept of nothing butdeath. Here we have a gradient scale of major threats of losses, losses, and results of losses. Achild has many momentary or fleeting moments of fear or grief because of lack of data. Verylittle of this enturbulence is of lasting consequence, which is to say that it does not becometrapped because the child has few engrams in restimulation, ordinarily. However, in theprocessing of children, one can run off many fear and grief incidents, since there is someresidual lag in the enturbulence. The very major secondaries in an adult are normally quite few,but these consist of such violent impacts from the environment in terms of loss or threats ofloss that, engrams being already restimulated, great quantities of theta are enturbulated andencysted in the form of secondary engrams.The running of a secondary and its complete exhaustion from the case is of enormousimportance. There are those who knowing that every secondary engram exists only by virtueof the physical pain engram which underlies it and who themselves are afraid of grief hopefullyattempt to audit individuals by avoiding secondary engrams and attempting to run the physicalpain engrams instead. The physical pain engrams, bluntly, will not exhaust unless the grief isrun first.The secondary engram is reduced by the physiological discharge of tears or possiblysome other bodily fluids. Grief seems to be reducible only in terms of tears. Fear or terror,inelegantly seems to be reducible in terms of urine, sweat, and other bodily excretion. Angerseems to be reducible by certain physical excretion. Apathy is reducible simply by running thefeeling of apathy, and this is accomplished by certain physiological symptoms.A secondary engram is run exactly as one would run an engram. One starts at theearliest moment of the secondary that one can discover and proceeds, picking up all perceptics,to the end of the incident. One then goes back to the beginning and re-experiences it again.The auditor continues to have the preclear re-experience the incident until the preclear, withregard to this secondary engram, is at a high position on the tone scale. If the secondaryengram is one of anger, the preclear will readily come up through boredom and commonly tofalse four. If it is fear, the preclear will come up through anger, boredom, and again to falsefour. If it is an apathy secondary it will proceed first through apathy, which is very hardgoing, then through grief then through fear, then through anger, then through boredom and tofalse four.A pretended death engram is a much deeper apathy and much more difficult to run.Much theta must be accumulated from other portions of the case before a pretended deathengram can be run. The auditor should never make the error of thinking that the concept is theengram. He should do his best to coax the preclear into every single perceptic as a secondary182"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"or any other engram is run off. However, at the beginning of running a secondary only thevaguest concept of it or only someIt is worthy of notice that another column could have been added to this chart, whichalready contains so many columns. This would be the column of body odor. The body isnormally sweet-smelling down to 2.0 but begins to exude chronically certain unpleasanteffluvia from 2.0 down. Individuals from 2.0 down commonly have bad breath. Their feet mayhave a considerable odor. The musk glands are very active. The sweat has a peculiar smell.Sexual organs emit a repelling odor. And various body exhaust functions are not under verygood control. The person may have to urinate or defecate under slight stresses or may weepeasily for no apparent cause. This column has not been added to this chart because it has notbeen thoroughly explored but is only known in a general way. Any slightly or greatly repulsivephysical odor from an individual does, however, indicate a tone scale position below 2.0. It isamusing to note that in the Orient wives are commonly selected by the sweetness of theirperspiration. This is apparently a very reliable test for position on the tone scale. People whohave bad breath as they are processed lose it when they are above 2.0 on the tone scale. Peoplewho are even temporarily suppressed below 2.0 commonly have bad breath.small phrase out ofit may be available. The auditor by causing the preclear to repeat this many times may be ableto get more of the engram and so work it out until it lies there in its entirety and can be re-experienced, at which time the preclear will come up the tone scale.Getting any misemotion off a case is beneficial to the case. It may be possible only towork out a secondary engram partly. But the auditor should never make the mistake ofpermitting a preclear to leave a secondary engram before it is exhausted of all possiblemisemotion. Every secondary should be brought as high up the tone scale as possible. Theauditor, further, should not make the mistake of abandoning the engram at the point ofantagonism. Occasionally the preclear, on recounting this experience all the way through withall possible perceptics, will get to the point where he is flippant about the circumstance. Thisflippancy is nearly always rendered in phrases which still remain in the secondary or theengram. The auditor may find a bit of resistance from the preclear at the antagonism level, buthe will do well to continue running the engram. It will then come up to boredom. The preclearhas to be persuaded to go through it again. He will ordinarily state that he is bored with it.This is not good enough. Further recounting is necessary to bring it up to the desirable tonelevel.It must be remembered as it will not be remarked again, that misemotion is part of everyphysical pain engram. The misemotion will rise up the scale out of an engram just as it will riseup the scale out of a secondary.Do not neglect the secondary engram’s importance to the case. For example the newly-made widow of a very successful man one week after his burial had become physically ill,wore weeds, looked some ten years older, and could not face any portion of existence. Anauditor worked with her for nine hours and ran out her husband’s death completely. At the endof this time she looked younger than she had looked for some years, was able to dress and tomeet life with considerable aplomb. The change was so remarkable after this nine hours ofprocessing that one would not have been able to recognize her as the same woman who hadentered the session under the duress of this secondary. A Minnesota Multiphasic test given tosome individuals before and after the running only of secondary engrams showed theseindividuals, before the secondaries were run and discharged, to lie above the severely aberratedline, and after the secondaries had been run and discharged, to be well within the normal range.There is nothing more spectacular in the rise of a case on the tone scale than that which takesplace after the discharging of one or more secondary engrams. This is particularly true of griefengrams, but others also produce beneficial effects. The reason for this seems to be thatthough it is the physical pain engram which makes possible secondary engrams and locks, it isthe secondaries which entrap the majority of the theta on the case and keep it as entheta in anencysted condition.183"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The auditor should pay very particular attention to his own attitude when he isattempting to run a secondary engram on the preclear. The present social order has aconsiderable compunction against crying or showing fear and a general inhibition of displays ofmisemotion and emotion. When these inhibitions lie in the form of circuits, as will be coveredlater, it is difficult to get the secondary engram to exhaust. However, if the auditor isdemonstrating a high level of ARC, if he seems sympathetic, his work will be made mucheasier. The preclear cannot run secondary engrams in the presence of an auditor for whom hehas antagonisms. The auditor, thus, must be compatible with the preclear and must have beencleared with the preclear as a group of two, if he expects to run any secondary engrams on thispreclear.The file clerk and somatic strip, as will be covered in the running of engrams, are notparticularly reliable in the presence of secondary engrams. Here we have enormous quantitiesof entheta, and so theta entities such as the somatic strip and file clerk have difficultyapproaching such areas. However, the recovery and conversion of considerable entheta fromlocks will bring the case up the tone scale to a point where the analytical mind will have enoughfree theta to attack the secondaries.The primary reason why an individual is severely aberrated is, of course, secondaryengrams. If the individual is well down the tone scale, one can assume as a matter of coursethat he has a large number of heavy secondary engrams, whether the individual is able to runthese secondaries or not, for here we have the main deposits of entheta on a case.Certain auditors, because of their sympathy and their ability to develop a high ARCwith the preclear, become experts in the running of secondary engrams. Anyone to whompeople will tell their troubles will be able to run secondary engrams. The process of running asecondary engram does not differ from running a physical pain engram. This is very important.The secondary engram is called secondary because it depends upon an earlier physical painengram to exist, being itself occasioned by a conscious moment of loss. It is called an engramin order to focus the attention of the auditor on the fact that it must be run as an engram and thatall perceptics possible must be exhausted from it. It occasionally will occur that after lock-scanning a preclear over a certain chain of locks, the auditor will suddenly find that the preclearis in a secondary engram. Perhaps some phrase will suggest itself, and the individual will cryor show fear. The auditor should cause this phrase to be repeated over and over. Perhapsneither the auditor nor the preclear knows the source of this phrase, but the exhaustion of it byitself may, in a heavily occluded case, bring about a considerable rise, if momentary, on thetone scale. It may occur that after lock scanning a whole secondary will lie ready to be run.The auditor should then run it.The existence of circuits on a case, which is to say the existence of suppressors tosecondary engrams or to any other entheta should not be exaggerated in importance. Scanningof locks and straight memory can either locate the locks of the circuit, or the circuit to someextent may be ignored. The circuit is a favorite alibi of the auditor Nearly everyone who is lowon the tone scale has been suppressed by the dominations or nullifications of persons or theenvironment. It must be remembered that the circuit derives from the engram and is charged upby entheta. The entheta can be to some degree converted into theta thus nullifying the circuitwithout discovering the engram in which this particular circuit is contained.Secondary engrams or at least phrases from them can be discharged from any case, nomatter how occluded. It is simply a matter of recovering enough free theta so that theindividual has a sufficient quality of free theta to make the exhaustion of secondaries possible.It should be remembered that when a case is overburdened with entheta, light and catfootedmethods can still bring to the preclear enough theta so that the entheta can be attacked. Asecondary engram, being a very heavy deposit of entheta, will repel theta.The auditor will occasionally discover a preclear who will run imaginary secondaries,with enormous affect in terms of terror, grief or apathy. He is dealing here with circuits (whichwill be covered later) which will furnish physical manifestations but will not exhaust engrams.184"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"An individual can have a portion of the analyzer segmented off by charge and under thecommand of an engram statement to the effect that he must run grief. As a result the individualwill manufacture grief incidents. An engramic command such as “You are always afraid andyou imagine things to be afraid of” or any of a multitude of approximations, may cause theindividual to manufacture and run fear incidents. The reality of such incidents is very low, butthe individual will run them and manifest fear.Unfortunately, these incidents do not produce any alleviation of aberration in the case.This is a manifestation of dub-in. It is very easily distinguished from real incidents, since thepreclear hardly ever is able to repeat the same incident in the same way a second time, and sincethe preclear is anxious to sell the auditor on the idea that the incident is very real, although theauditor has made no 150 suggestion that it might be unreal. The auditor uses as his yardstickthe probability of the incident, but he is not particularly worried about one incident. A circuithas the habit of manufacturing the same type of incident over and over and over again butlocating it at various points on the time track. The preclear, if he is very low on the tone scale,may himself be unaware of the unreality of this incident. But the auditor, knowing the preclearto be low on the tone scale, suspects the possibility of dub-in when the preclear runs five or tenincidents in which he is tied to a railroad track by his mother and is rescued at the last momentby his aunt. Here is delusion rampant. The preclear will manifest considerable relief afterrunning the incident, but here is a circuit at work, and no matter how many times this incidentis run, the condition of the preclear will not be bettered. The auditor, by giving credence to thisincident and by continuing to run it, is actually validating the incident and strengthening thecircuit. Such incidents are usually bizarre and sensational. Very often, however the auditoractually has on his hands incidents which are quite true and are bizarre and sensational, sincethe things done to human beings in this twentieth century are not always tame and routine.The test of any secondary is whether or not exhausting it raises the individual up thetone scale. When the auditor discovers that he is running fear or apathy incidents because ofsome circuit, he should immediately be aware of the fact that he is trying to address much tooheavy a form of entheta. He should not be running secondaries but should be running locks.A preclear who will run such dub-in misemotion is very very low on the tone scale. Anestimate of this preclear on the chart would have told the auditor in the first place that thepreclear was low on the scale. The auditor should, thus, be alert for dub-in. Dub-inmisemotion is best handled not by running thirty consecutive incidents in which the preclear isplaced in the washing machine by his father, or hoisted up a flagpole by his elder brother butby addressing the locks in the case, the nearer present time, the better. Very shortly the auditorwill discover that the environment of this preclear is normally very restimulative and thatindividuals exist in the environment of this preclear who habitually lay in heavy locks. Further,the auditor will discover in lock scanning that this preclear will commonly hang up in locksafter the chain has been scanned and that the locks themselves have to be run as incidents.Such a preclear should not be subjected to the mishandling of being run through heavysecondary engrams. Of course, in a wide-open case, on which few occlusions exist, actualsecondaries might be run fairly early in the case, with an enormous rebound up the tone scale.It is in the occluded case that the auditor should expect to find circuits which producemisemotion at will. The auditor who is handling a preclear above 1.5 should not much worryabout dubbed-in misemotion.On the subject of secondary engrams the auditor, regardless of his own personalfeelings about fear, grief or apathy, should keep firmly in mind the relief which is obtainablefor the preclear and the rise which is possible on the tone scale by running secondary engrams.It is a theoretical truth that a case would become a release if the auditor could run off the caseonly the secondary engrams in their entirety. This is impossible in practice, since after asecondary has been run the auditor quite commonly finds that he is running a physical painengram which underlies it. The auditor should not be surprised when he is running asecondary engram to find, after the exhaustion of a few tears, physical pain turning on as aconsequence. Clears are produced by running all the physical pain engrams, secondaries, andlocks off a case. But engrams quite ordinarily cannot be contacted until locks have beenscanned and secondaries have been run off the case.185"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"It is an adroit auditor who can elicit from some “hard-boiled and emotionless” denizenof our culture the tears or fear necessary to resolve his case. But the scanning of lock chains orthe reduction of available physical pain engrams will place in the auditor’s hands, willy-nilly,discharge of secondary engrams. The auditor can convert the entheta of locks into theta to sucha degree that secondary engrams will begin to discharge almost automatically. At such time asthis happens the auditor must be careful to minimize his own conversation or comment, tominimize his auditing, simply sympathetically persuading the preclear to run the incident again,and then again, and then again, until it is exhausted. The auditor, by attacking secondaryengrams as though they were game on which the state pays a bounty, such as jackals or crows,and using an approach too exhilarated or enthusiastic toward the preclear’s secondaries, canactually cut off the discharge of misemotion. Some experiments have been made with the use ofsad music or other dolorous perceptics in the environ of the preclear to encourage the dischargeof secondary engrams. Much work can be done on this. The work which has been donedemonstrates, however, that individuals who are chronically very low on the tone scalerespond to sad and mournful perceptics by simply running dub-in incidents, which does themno good, and that individuals above this level can commonly discharge secondaries wheneverthe proper amount of theta has been recovered for the case.This does not discount the possible use of aesthetic perceptics in the encouragement ofsecondaries. In inventorying a preclear one should be careful to establish all the major lossesand major threats of loss that have happened to the preclear in his lifetime. On each one of thelosses or threats of loss, either of position or possessions or people, by departure or death, onewill find an encystment of entheta. Where the child has been raised by nurses in the vicinity ofrelatively antagonistic parents, one may expect to find a secondary engram every time a nurse isdischarged. In the “coffin case” who lies with arms folded, never assuming the foetal positionwhen running prenatal engrams but always lying as though laid out for burial, one willcertainly find the death of a major ally somewhere back on the track. Where the enthetasurrounding such an accident is strong enough to paralyze the individual at this point of his life,the secondary engram responsible for the coffin case is ordinarily not contactable early in thecase. The auditor should merely continue, alert to the fact that sooner or later he is going toencounter a very heavy charge on the death of an ally. In such a case, the amount of entheta inrelation to the existing theta on the case is very heavy. Lock scanning, straight memory, andthe running of locks, and even merely perception of present time may be the only processingwhich can be delivered to the case in its early stages. Sooner or later some secondaries will bedischarged. No physical pain engram should ever be run on such a case. Imaginary incidentsare peculiarly useful to the processing of such a case, as limited by the chart. The best skill anauditor can develop is the running of secondaries. Their discharge produces the most effectiverise up the tone scale.186"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THIRTEENCOLUMN AIEngramsThe basic cause of all human aberration is apparently the engram. There may be othercauses more fundamental than the engram, but certainly to date they have not been discovered.Psychotherapy found out about locks, but did not know they were locks, and did not know towhat the lock owed its power. Psychotherapists did know that when an individual was able toremember certain mentally painful incidents in his life, he became to some minute degree better.Sigmund Freud discovered the lightest type of entheta, and although he placed hisprobes no deeper, an entrance was made into the field of human behavior. The secondary wasdiscovered, but not identified in any way. By sheer observation of numberless cases it wasfound that once in a while, when apatient could be made to cry, the patient got better. The therapist did not know what thepatient was crying about and neither did the patient, but the title of “release of affect” wasassigned to this crying and much extraneous technology was developed around it.Psychodrama and other techniques were developed in order to make the individual “releaseaffect.” This was the second slight incursion into the field of human thought. It produced littlebeneficial result because secondaries were restimulated more often than they were relieved.Secondaries have to be run as engrams, with the preclear returning on the time track.The leap which was made between psychotherapy and Dianetics did not gather force inpsychotherapy but in an independent study of epistemology and thought as an energy.However, the basic teachings of Sigmund Freud, as relayed to me in the twenties byCommander Thompson, Medical Corps, U.S. Navy, who had studied with Sigmund Freud,considerably enhanced my desire for re-examination of thought in human behavior.The existence of the engram was predicted, by derived computation, from otherobservations of thought. Investigation showed this existence to be actual. Anyone can discoveran engram with great ease once he knows that it exists. Take an individual, tell him to close hiseyes and go back to the last time he received some minor injury (do not ask for a major injury)and request that he re-experience the moment of injury. Cause him to recount and re-experience this moment of minor injury several times. If he cannot do so, he is fairly low onthe tone scale and his somatics are shut off. Most normal people can re-experience thesemoments of injury. In causing an individual to do this, the experimenter will find that theinjury is again felt and that the sights, sounds, smells, and other perceptics at the moment theinjury was received recur to the experimental subject. Another phenomenon will be discoveredby the alert investigator. It will be found that the individual on the first return to and recountingof this moment of minor injury, will conceive it to be shorter than it actually was. Onrecounting, he will discover during the instant of impact of the injury new perceptics showingup, things he did not notice at the time he was injured. Here is a moment when the analyticalmind, even though the injury was slight, went out of circuit, and here is a moment of“unconsciousness” wherein the reactive mind was recording all the perceptics which wereavailable in the environment. As these hidden perceptics are recovered, the additional percepticof physical injury, which is called in Dianetics a somatic, will reduce in force and, unless theexperimental subject is extremely aberrated, he will finally no longer be able to feel it, but allother perceptics which were recorded during that moment of physical pain and“unconsciousness” will be restored to the analytical mind as standard memory data.In effect, this is a dianetic “assist.” The auditor may take an individual who has beeninjured and run the injury as an engram even though it contains extensive unconsciousness.The last engram on the case has had relatively little chance to become charged up by locks andsecondaries, and so is available for auditing regardless of the pre-existing engrams on the case.187"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"The auditor can walk into a maternity ward and take over the case of some youngmother who through an arduous birth has developed a post-partum psychosis and can audit outthe birth in its entirety. Unless this young mother was extremely low on the tone scale in thefirst place, so that she cannot re-experience somatics, the discharge of the actual delivery,perceptic by perceptic, including the “unconsciousness” induced by anaesthesia, everything thesurgeon (and let it be hoped that the surgeons of tomorrow will have learned to work in silence)said to the nurse and remarked in general. In the analytical mind’s interpretation of the remarksmade during this delivery the source of the post-partum psychosis will be discovered. Any lateor recent injury can be run in such a fashion. The individual who is receiving this auditingwill, according to observation, recover much more rapidly from the illness or accident, thehealing will be cleaner, the incidence of infection will be less, and the seriousness of the injuryand the shock contained in it will be greatly reduced by the reduction of the moment of injuryitself. It is hoped that sooner or later an auditor will stand at the emergency entrance of somehospital simply to audit all accident victims who come in, and that the statistics of infection rateand mortality rate of this hospital’s patients will be compared with those of other hospitals.Evidence indicates that the mortality rate will be much lower on those who have had the lastinjury audited out, that the incidence of infection will be less, and that the time of recovery ofthe patient will be greatly shortened by this dianetic assist.The making of this experiment, on a slight scale, regardless of the dianetic assist,should demonstrate to the experimenter that physical pain at once inhibits consciousness, andthat in the presence of physical pain all the perceptics of the environ, sight, smell, hearing,tactile, etc. are recorded elsewhere than in the analytical mind but that the running of theincident removes from the case the mental loginess caused by the unconsciousness itself that allaberrative effects of remarks made during the incident are removed, and that the physical pain isno longer stored, being a highly perishable quantity.This is the anatomy of an engram. It contains physical pain. It contains all theperceptics of the environment in which the physical pain was received. It contains thephysiological condition of the body, including endocrine balance at the time. It includes the ageof the individual. It includes the misemotion or emotion contained in the incident, asmanifested by persons around the injured person. It contains unconsciousness, in the form ofanaten (analytical attenuation). And it contains the interruption of the computations the personwas making at the time, which is the interruption of the theta creative cycle and is slightlyaberrative. And it contains, additionally, all the locks and secondaries which, by contagionduring the restimulation of the engram, it caused the person to receive while analytically awake,or conscious, at later times. These are the things which an engram contains. And these are thethings which exhaust from an engram which is thoroughly erased.When the engram is approximated in the environment, during a time when theindividual, by reason of weariness or illness or stress of other kinds, is less analytically aware,various manifestations may occur by reason of the abovementioned contents of the engram.The individual who is under the stress of a restimulated engram will attempt to dramatize theengram. That is to say, he will say the things contained in the engram, and he will do thethings dictated by the engram, or he will make the analytical computations demanded by theengram, and he will, generally, try to comply with the dictates of this moment of physical pain.If his environment makes it impossible for him to carry out this dramatization as dictated by thecharged-up engram, then he is subjected to further charge by reason of not being able to dowhat the entheta of the engram commands him to do. An individual who has had hisdramatizations broken time after time gradually descends the tone scale. Engrams are based onthe non-survival circumstances of theta and MEST colliding too sharply together, with theattendant reversal of polarity.All engrams, even those which are highly complimentary to the ability of the individual(such as hypnotic suggestions, which are a light form of engram and depend on early physicalpain engrams) are non-survival. There is no such thing as an engram which assists anindividual in his business of living. The engram merely uses some natural ability of theindividual and may feverishly but inefficiently enforce it. This would be a manic engram.188"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Engrams dictate unalterable courses of action, without any regard to reason. Such acircumstance is, to a greater or lesser degree in every case, non-survival, since the survival ofthe individual depends upon his ability to adjust his action to the environment or to adjust theenvironment to him according to the circumstances. The engram is as stet as a phonographrecord. It dictates that a person do certain things in the presence of certain perceptions. In anunthinking organism, such as the lower forms of life, the engram does provide a certainmethod of thinking and acting, but in man, who depends upon reason as his chief weapon, theengram is non-survival in the extreme. The accumulation of engrams and their secondaries andlocks brings the individual eventually to the point of death. Although his theta may, bycontinual enturbulation with MEST, be highly informed at the period of death with regard toMEST and may, according to some observations, be able in the next generation to accomplish amuch better course of survival, in the existing generation the entheta never frees itself except bydianetic processing.Yet, the auditor will continually discover preclears low on the tone scale who, byeducation or by the content of the engrams themselves, will seek to hold on to the engrams inthe belief that they are an aid in the business of living. The auditor should thoroughly ignorethis situation. In a very short time he will by his own experience see very clearly that the reliefof engrams vastly increases the preclear’s ability to meet life and to advance in the business ofliving. There are cases which contain engrams such as attempted abortions and which seek toretain the engram because it says, “If I lose it I’ll die!” Many engrams contain phrases whichseem to make the engram valuable. The engram is never valuable. Here is nonsurvival in themost basic known package.The engram is the basic source of human aberration. There are usually hundreds, oreven two or three thousand, engrams in the lifetime of any individual. Each and every one ofthese may have its own locks. The whole language of the individual may be contained in hisengrams. Compulsive and obsessive phrases, circuit phrases which set up computive sectionsin the analyzer, “psychosomatic illnesses” (which are now known as chronic somatics) andaberrative forms of thought, to say nothing of reduced physical state and disabilities asrepresented on the tone scale chart, result basically from engrams.It should be understood by the auditor, however, that although the basic source ofhuman aberration is the engram, according to accumulated evidences, he should not thereforeconsider that the only thing he should touch in a case is an engram. Locks and secondaries, inlow-tone cases, must be addressed long before he touches engrams. The moment of physicalpain and unconsciousness is basic, but it is not the principal point of address in very aberratedcases.Cases fairly well up the tone scale, however, have engrams available for running, andwhen these engrams are run, remarkable improvements in the habits, welfare, behavior, andphysical health of the individual ensue.Before the auditor runs engrams off a case there are certain definite things he shouldknow. He need not be nearly so skilled to run locks as to run engrams. A very inexperiencedauditor can successfully scan locks or even run minor secondaries, but an auditor shoulddefinitely know his tools and have confidence in them before he attacks engrams. In the firstplace, it is possible to enter a deceptively open but really heavily charged case and attempt torun engrams when the preclear is completely unable to perceive enough of the perceptics in theengram to bring about a reduction. Thus, the auditor leaves an engram in restimulation anddoes not much assist the preclear but on the contrary may turn some of the preclear’s theta backinto entheta by causing the engram to have a new lock by reason of auditing. While all auditingcan be scanned off and this theta can be recovered, this is not improving the case.Further, engrams in the hands of an inexperienced auditor are sometimes improperlyevaluated, which is to say the auditor may attack one which is very late in life or very late on achain of engrams, and work and worry on the thing until it merely goes into recession. Two orthree days later this engram will reappear. This is because it has not been really reduced or189"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"erased, because the auditor did not know enough to go earlier in the case in order to find thebasic engram on the chain. Thus certain cautions must be observed in running engrams, butengrams can be run successfully if these cautions are observed.To run engrams, the auditor must be aware of and have confidence in the tools of histrade. These consist of the somatic strip, the file clerk, the time track, and the perceptics. Thefile clerk is an extremely useful mechanism, not only for the running of engrams, but for thescanning of locks, the discovery of locks, and for obtaining data from the standard memorybanks which would otherwise be excluded. The file clerk is a response mechanism which isinstantaneous. One could postulate that the file clerk is a group of attention units with readyaccess to the reactive mind and to the standard memory banks and which in common mentaloperation forwards data through to “I” as memory. However, the charge on a case -- theamount of entheta -- may be so very heavy that the file clerk is unable to force through the datadesired by “I” and so “I,” working all alone with the file clerk, sometimes finds it difficult toreceive answers to his questions.The auditor adds, with his demands and signals, what might be considered theadditional power necessary to bring the file clerk answers through to “I.” This process isextremely simple. The auditor asks questions, normally, which can be answered in terms ofyes or no or numbers or dates. Then, at a sharp snap of the auditor’s fingers, a suddenthought, a yes or no, occurs to the preclear, who tells the auditor what response he hasreceived.For example, the auditor may desire to know the place where the preclear is stuck onthe time track, or whether or not the preclear is in present time. The auditor says, “Give me thefirst number that flashes into your mind. How old are you?” (snap!). An age flashes and thepreclear tells the auditor. It may be that the preclear has developed a circuit which gives hischronological age in answer to the question, “How old are you?” A double check for theauditor, then, is to ask the question, “What is your age?” (snap !). He may or may not get thesame answer as before, since the circuit may not be educated to the second question. Anothermethod of establishing where the preclear is on the time track is to ask for the year, the month,and date. In addition to the location of the preclear on the time track or discovering the point inthe preclear’s life where a certain incident occurred, the flash answer mechanism will tell theauditor at the end of the session whether or not the preclear is in present time. The preclearshould always be brought to present time, if possible, either by simply being told to “Come topresent time,” or by being scanned up to present time through pleasure moments, or “walkedup” by straight memory questions. The auditor works with the file clerk. The auditor does notorder the file clerk around. The auditor consults the file clerk. The file clerk will tell the auditorthe name of the chain of locks which is to be scanned. The file clerk, questioned by flashanswers, will identify types of incidents which are interrupting the case. In short, the file clerkis a consultant who answers with specific data any question asked with the flash answermechanism. It is interesting that material completely unknown to the analyzer of the preclearcan be discovered by questioning the file clerk.The somatic strip is so called because it seems to be a physical indicator mechanismwhich has to do with time. The auditor orders the somatic strip. There is this differencebetween the file clerk and the somatic strip: he works with the file clerk but commands thesomatic strip. On command, the somatic strip will go to any point of the preclear’s life, unlessthe entheta on the case is so heavy that the somatic strip is frozen in one place. The somaticstrip goes to the point of return, but it is not the same as completely returning since thepreclear’s “I” can stay in present time and the somatic strip can be sent back to earlier periods ofhis life. This is a very useful mechanism. The somatic strip can be sent back to the beginningof an engram and will go there. The somatic strip will advance through an engram in terms ofminutes counted off by the auditor, so that the auditor can say that the somatic strip will go tothe beginning of the engram, then to the point five minutes after the engram began, and soforth. In such a way, observing the behavior of the preclear (who may be oblivious of what istaking place except by observing his own physical symptoms change), the auditor can send the190"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"preclear through an operation minute by minute, or in larger increments, and the auditor can tellwith certainty exactly how long that operation required.The somatic strip can be sent to a certain date, hour, and minute in the preclear’s life,and will go there. “I” in the preclear does not necessarily follow the somatic strip. Unless acase is very heavy with entheta, the somatic strip, for instance, can be sent by the auditor’scommand back to the moment when the preclear, as a baby, was being burped. Much to hisown astonishment, the preclear might then burp. The auditor can send the somatic strip to amoment when the preclear was sunburned, and the sunburn somatic will turn on. The somaticstrip, in short, can be sent all up and down the time track, both to pleasant moments andunpleasant ones, by the auditor, even though the preclear may be relatively unwilling tocooperate. This is definitely not power of suggestion, since the preclear is wide awake andalert. Further, the auditor in commanding the somatic strip can discover data, such as howlong an operation took, which is evidently completely unknown to the preclear, although thisuse of the somatic strip is neither usual nor general, but is more of a stunt.The main thing the auditor should do in using the somatic strip is to credit the somaticstrip with obedience to the auditor’s commands. The auditor does not send the somatic strip tothe beginning of the engram and then wonder whether or not the somatic strip went there andask questions as to whether or not it did. The auditor, with considerable confidence, shouldassume that the somatic strip has gone exactly where he said. If the preclear is unable to detectany difference, this is not the fault of the somatic strip, but is occasioned by the amount ofentheta on the case. The somatic strip moves about the track at the auditor’s commandregardless of the quantity of entheta on the case, unless the somatic strip is itself thoroughlystuck in some engram.The somatic strip and the file clerk are two of many mechanisms and entities discoveredby Dianetics. There are many other phenomena in the mind, which are not at this time used bythe auditor but which, nevertheless, exist. There are, possibly, such things as theta perceptics,which respond to auditor consultation. Very little is known about them, and it is felt thatincorrect use of them or invalidation of them after they have been used is harmful to a case; soexperimentation with them should be very carefully done. A book could be written whichcovered additional entities and phenomena of the human mind, but until these can be intimatelyassociated with processing in such a way as to aid the auditor, a discussion of them in a bookof processing is extraneous. Exactly to what extent these additional perceptics and entitiesinfluence human behavior has been far from thoroughly established. The time track, as coveredelsewhere, is simply the consecutive moments of now which proceed in one lifetime, fromconception or a few days before conception in the sperm and ovum sequence, up to presenttime. The time track is actually a cable, or bundle of perceptics, since all twenty-six percepticchannels register, when there is anything for them to perceive, and are in phase in a case whichdoes not have an extremely heavy burden of entheta.The individual can be sent by the auditor back from present time simply by being told toclose his eyes and go to a certain moment in the past. He can be sent to a very precise momenton the track, since every instant of the preclear’s past life is recorded on this track. Some of therecording, of course, is done in the reactive mind, when unconsciousness and physical pain arepresent. It is interesting that a preclear can be sent to January 3rd, 1936, a very random andobscure date, to the hour of eight-fifteen in the morning, and although the preclear may notrealize he is there, requesting him to contact even hazy data about it will shortly place him at theinstant, which if run several times just as though it were an engram, will begin to show up inconsiderable detail in most cases. For instance, if at eight-fifteen in the morning of January 3rdthe preclear entered his office and began to open mail, he may not know at the beginning evenif he had an office at that date, but after he has run the incident several times he will be able toread you the names and addresses off the envelopes as he opens them and sorts his morningmail. Because sense of time and ability to return are thoroughly discounted by socialaberrations in this culture, these skills have remained hidden. When the preclear’s sense ofreality is very low, when he himself is very low on the tone scale, the preclear may have noconfidence at all in any data which he brings up about his past. Knowing that the somatic strip,191"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"the file clerk, and the ability of “I” to return are accurate, the auditor has the responsibility toencourage the preclear to credit his own senses.Thus, we see that we have three things at work in the operation of going back frompresent time to an earlier incident. First, we have the file clerk. Next We have the somatic strip.And third, we have “I” or a large percentage of the attention units of the mind. And these threetogether are used by the auditor to work the preclear on his time track and discover and reduceor erase past moments of physical pain and unconsciousness or encysted areas of entheta.The auditor consults with the file clerk as to the “incident necessary to resolve this case”or the “chain of locks necessary to be run at this time” or “Yes or no, should we run engrams atthis time?” or “Is there a grief charge available at this time?” and after this consultation, asking“Can we scan this chain of locks at this time?” or “Is this engram susceptible to being run?”One might say that the auditor and the file clerk are consultants over the case of thepreclear as to the best method of raising the preclear on the tone scale. The file clerk’s interestand participation in this is very large. The file clerk’s ability to answer questions sometimesextends to suggestions as to how to run the case when these are required by the auditor. Nowit is a strange thing that the file clerk always knows the type of entheta which can be run on thecase. The file clerk also knows the next engram which can be reduced or erased. All theauditor has to do is request the file clerk to present the engram necessary to resolve the case,and the file clerk will do so, no matter where that engram lies on the track.Engrams follow the general law that they must be reduced or erased from early to late,which is to say that the earliest engram on the chain must be the one first contacted. Engramsin the basic area are surprisingly early. The auditor will have to get used to the idea thatphysical pain and perceptics are recorded, if not understood, long before there is anything likean analytical mind in the organism. The file clerk is slightly sketchy on how carly he must lookfor the engrain to resolve the case, and unless the auditor is occasionally insistent on the fileclerk’s presenting very, very, very early engrams, the file clerk may not look earlier than twoor three or five years of age (late life, in Dianetics). With this single limitation, the choice ofthe file clerk as to the engram to be run should be considered primary above the auditor’s orpreclear’s idea of what engram it is now necessary to address and reduce. The auditor cannotknow this too thoroughly: that the file clerk’s choice of engrams takes precedence over thedesires of the preclear or the wishes of the auditor, and the file clerk will present the engramnecessary to be run next in order to resolve the case.Although engrams normally run from early to late, it sometimes happens that arelatively late life engram is so tenuously connected to the remainder of the bank that it can berun off and erased, almost as an independent entity. Although birth should always beapproached by the auditor with caution, the file clerk may present birth, and if the file clerkdoes so, then birth should be run.The auditor should be very careful of forcing his preclear into any engram which is notpresented by the file clerk. Running late life engrams early in the case will as a general rulemerely enturbulate the case, since these engrams will not reduce until earlier physical painmoments have been reduced or until a great deal of entheta is taken off the case by other means.Once the file clerk has presented an engram -- and the auditor simply assumes that hisrequest for the file clerk to do so has been complied with -the auditor then directs the somaticstrip to go to the beginning of the engram. The somatic strip does this immediately and needsno further coaxing, and indeed, a failure to take this for granted has a tendency to invalidate thesomatic strip and to render its response uncertain and the preclear confused as to what is takingplace.With the somatic strip at the beginning of the engram which the file clerk has presentedthere may still be no awareness of somatic or change so far as the preclear’s “I” is concerned.It is now necessary for the auditor to get “I” in contact with the stage which has been set by the192"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"file clerk and the somatic strip. The auditor does this with an additional request for a flashanswer. Although it does not always happen that engrams contain conversation, it is a fairlysafe assumption that any given engram contains conversation. In order to get “I” in contactwith the engram and to turn the somatic on full so that the engram can be run, the auditor nowasks for the first phrase in the engram, and snaps his fingers. A phrase occurs to the preclear,which at the first moment that it occurs may seem completely irrelevant. The preclear repeatsthis phrase two or three times and “I” is in contact with the beginning of the engram. Thepreclear becomes aware of the somatic and of other perceptics and, phrase by phrase, runs offthe engram, re-experiencing it, feeling the generally modified version of the pain he onceexperienced, recounting all the conversation which he perceives to have taken place in theincident, getting rid of the “boil-off” which smothered the incident or yawning away theremaining anaten in the incident or experiencing the misemotion of the incident and, in short,reducing or erasing the engram. The auditor must be aware of the existence and importance ofaction phrases in engrams.These phrases are actually commands in the engrams which take over as a sort of innerauditor, and before the auditor knows it these phrases are sending the somatic strip elsewhereup or down the track or mixing up the file clerk as to the next phrases. The auditor, if henotices any peculiarity in the running of this engram-that the somatic turned on once but willnot turn on again, that sonic was nearly on but now doesn’t exist -- and yet knows the engramis not yet reduced, suspects an action phrase and asks the file clerk whether or not a bouncer,denyer, grouper, valence shifter, or holder is acting. He does this by saying, “Is there anaction phrase present?” (snap!). The file clerk then says (through “I”) that it is a bouncer,holder, grouper, misdirector denyer or whatever. The auditor then says, “The phrase will nowflash!” (snap!). The phrase flashes, the preclear repeats it and gets back into the engram fromwhich he has been bounced, if it was a bouncer. Actually, a case is in very bad shape whichhas positive responses to action phrases and probably should not have engrams run on it at all.Cases further up the tone scale do not respond at all to action phrases, which is to say the fileclerk and somatic strip have sufficient theta behind them to override even strong and energeticcommands to do something other than work with the auditor in reducing or erasing the engram.The response value of the action phrases is, indeed, an index of where the preclear is located onthe tone scale. Very noticeable response to action phrases indicates that some other type ofentheta than engrams should be run off the case before engrams are reduced. If the auditorfinds his preclear bouncing badly every time the phrase “get out” occurs in an engram, heshould reduce if possible the engram on which he is working and then address his attention toother types of entheta, such as chains of locks and secondaries, rather than continuing to runengrams.The auditor should understand that an engram does not always begin with a phrase andthat the phrase he gets first may not begin the engram. He should further understand that theheaviest entheta in the engram, if the engram were occasioned by a blow, occurs at thebeginning of the engram. Thus, the file clerk may present this beginning, and the somatic stripmay try to go all the way to the beginning, but the entheta is heaviest right at the start. Thus theauditor should always check to find out whether there is an earlier phrase or an earlier somaticon the engram, before he works very hard to reduce the whole engram, since it is the earliestpart of the engram which suppresses the remainder of the engram. Once you get the entheta outof the very beginning of an engram of the blow variety the rest may reduce as easily as a lock.Always get the earliest part.There is another type of engram, in which unconsciousness sets in slowly and perhapsphysical pain does not develop until after unconsciousness has begun to set in. This wouldhappen in the case of loss of blood, or during an anaesthetic operation, where the anaesthesia isadministered before the physical pain of the operation itself begins.Then there is the combination of these types of engrams, where a blow or shock beginsthe engram, unconsciousness sets in and deepens, and then further blows and shocks occurduring the course of the unconsciousness, again deepening it. The lightest phrases ofunconsciousness will lift off an engram first. The deepest part of the unconsciousness or the193"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"deepest point of physical pain will lift last. Thus, an auditor can run through an engram severaltimes and consider that he has almost reduced it only to discover that several new phrases haveappeared in the engram. This happens because some portions of the engram contain deeperunconsciousness and more severe pain than other portions, and these lift last. The engram cando three things: it can erase, it can reduce, or it can recess. The erasure of an engram takesplace when it is either one of the first few engrams existing on the time track or when theengram is relatively independent of the remainder of the reactive mind. The phrases and otherperceptics appear. The engram is recounted from the first moment of physical pain andunconsciousness to the last. And after a few recountings, the engram vanishes in yawns. Theauditor can be fooled at times, by having the preclear bounce out of an engram, into believingthat the engram has been erased or reduced, but in this case yawns do not come off. Yawnsalways mark the end of an erasure, since this is the last of the anaten (the physiological by-product of unconsciousness) which has pinned down the rest of the engram. The entire case,which is to say all the content of the reactive mind, will eventually erase. An erasure thoroughlydone, simply by recounting all perceptics of the engram over and over with the preclearreturned to that instant on the track, is final and complete. The engram is gone and will notreturn. The physical pain will not re-occur. The phrases are no longer aberrative in any wayand are quite often gone so thoroughly that the preclear cannot even remember what the engramcontained.In view of the fact that the engram is the basic source of human aberration, thesephrases which are enforced as hidden commands upon the analytical mind are the mostproductive of aberration, if the engram is charged up by later entheta on the case. If thesecommands cannot be obeyed or dramatized by the analyzer, then the engram attempts to forcecompliance by turning on physical pain which it contains. That portion of the body which wasinjured when this engram was received will become painful again, or will manifest somediscomfort. This has been called psychosomatic illness. It is actually the somatic of some pastmoment of physical pain turning on again because of the overcharge of the engram by laterentheta and the inability of the person to dramatize the verbal content of the engram. All thesethings are gone, the anaten which shuts down the analytical mechanism and power of the mind,the aberrative force of the commands of the engram which are accepted literally by the analyzer,and the physical pain of the engram which can become a chronic somatic, disappear and do notreturn when the engram is erased.To be erased, an engram has to be early on its own chain of engrams, there must not betoo many secondaries or other types of entheta charging up this engram, and the bulk of theperceptics must have been present while the engram was being run. The unobservant auditorwho knows little of his subject may occasionally think he has erased an engram, only todiscover a few days later that the engram, in some part, has returned. In order for this tohappen, the engram must have been fairly late on a chain or there must have been considerableentheta above it. An earlier engram must be discovered, or entheta must be removed from thecase in some other way.A reduction is done exactly as an erasure, but the engram will not completely erase,remaining, after a few recountings, in a more or less static condition of low aberrative powerand with no physical pain remaining in it. Early in the case the auditor obtains more reductionsthan he does erasures. When an erasure of the case begins the auditor feels very confident, foran erasure carries the preclear up the track to present time, and although another pass may bemade to discover missed engrams, the auditor knows he is bringing the preclear through toclear. In the matter of a reduction, entheta is recovered from the incident, the preclear is madeconsiderably more comfortable, but the engram remains there in a quiet state. Ordinarily,erasures and reductions require only seven to ten recountings or re-experiencings of theengram. The reduction is recognizable because the somatic in the engram, recounting byrecounting, reduces a little further, and continues to reduce until the somatic is gone. Areduced engram does not build up again but remains in this quiet state and permits the auditor togo on to other engrams.194"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The recession is the third thing that will happen to an engram which is being processed.The recession is not desirable. A recession occurs only in engrams which are not early enoughin the chain of engrams to be reduced or which are too charged. The file clerk will neverpresent an engram which can only be recessed. A recession takes place when the auditor“knowing better” than the file clerk forces the preclear back down the track, uses repeatertechnique on some phrase the auditor has selected as being aberrative, and generally mishandlesthe case. A recession is evidenced by the failure of the somatic to reduce beyond a certain point.The engram will drop down to a certain volume of intensity, but no matter if it is recountedthirty, fifty or a hundred times, a somatic will still remain. During a recession the somatic ofthe engram first reduces slightly and then continues constant. In the reduction, the somatic,little by little each recounting, reduces. In a recession, the somatic remains steady. If arecession takes place, it means simply that an engram similar to the one which is being re-experienced is earlier on the case, or that a tremendous quantity of entheta in secondaries andlocks exists above the engram that is being recessed. Recessions occur only where the auditorhas not taken off enough entheta from the case in the form of locks and secondaries to permitengrams to be run. It is a premature address to engrams. Or it is caused by auditing inviolation of the file clerk’s data.One would ordinarily suppose, for instance, that conception would be the earliestengram on the case. It sometimes happens that the auditor contacts conception and finds it willnot reduce. Obviously, conception is very early. There may be some engrams beforeconception, on either the sperm or the ovum side. But unless one understands that a great dealof charge can exist which suppresses any engram, one may recount, for instance, a conceptionengram only into a recession. It should not surprise an auditor, if he demands that conceptionbe run before conception is ready to be run, to have a recession take place. Perhaps no engramexists in current life before conception, but enough entheta in secondaries and locks aboveconception will cause its charge to be highly resistive.There is a trick of reaching conception in a case. This trick should be used with caution,because of the entheta which may have charged up this early engram. The auditor asks thepreclear to run a moment of sexual pleasure, and then when his preclear, who does not have torecount this moment aloud, appears to be settled into that moment, the auditor demands that thepreclear go immediately to conception. The preclear will normally do so and conception canthus be found and run. But, as has been said, it may have too much charge to reduce or erase.This trick can be applied to any engram in the basic area. The auditor can require the preclear torun a moment when the preclear was angry, and when the preclear seems to be well settled intorecounting his own near present time dramatization of being angry, the auditor merely tells himto go to the earliest engram in the bank which contains anger. The preclear, ordinarily will gothere. This applies as well to fear, and to grief but it is far better to discharge the case well andhave the file clerk in good working condition before one uses such a trick.Conception is definitely an engram, in the majority of cases. Now and then, conceptionwill be found to contain only a moment of unconsciousness in the sperm line and another in theovum line and be otherwise unaberrative. But the usual conception contains considerableperceptics and physical pain. Great care should be used not to try to contact and run conceptionprematurely on a case. An individual who is fairly low on the tone scale, below 2.5, willusually have enough charge on conception so that it cannot be reduced. Running conception onan individual below 2.5 intensifies his aberrative manifestations. A borderline psychotic canactually be placed in a psychotic break if an auditor authoritarianly slams him into conceptionand insists that he run it, on the theory that conception, being an early engram, should erase.Because Dianetics has not at this time much explored structure, no slightest effort ismade here to justify the existence of pre-conception sperm engrams or pre-conception ovumengrams or conception engrams or birth engrams. Actually, these have been found time andagain in psychotherapy and abandoned only because they did not agree with the reality of thepractitioner.195"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Recent experiments at Rutgers University validate the ability of the embryo to react tosounds and other stimuli. Books written as early as 1912 and 1914 mention these earlyrecordings, labelling them, “cellular experiences,” which in Dianetics we do not now know tobe a correct label. The work of biologists in the field of embryology adequately validates thereaction capabilities of the embyro to stimuli. In Dianetics, engrams from the earliest periodshave been checked with reality and have been found to have taken place.Many a parent watching his child or teenager being processed has been startled to hearfrom engrams the names of maids fired long before the child was born, or circumstancessurrounding the marriage which were not particularly complimentary to the devotion of theparents to the letter of morality, and other matters which would not be otherwise known to thepreclear. Some mothers who may not have been as careful in their fidelity as their husbandsexpected may even sacrifice the health of the child, who could otherwise be processed intobetter mental and physical condition, rather than have their husbands learn of these infidelitieswhich are unfortunately recorded word for word in the engrams of the child.Knowledge that these recordings exist and are valid and actual will discourage a below-2.0 individual from permitting her children to be processed. The auditor should always bewary of a mother who is actively trying to invalidate Dianetics to the husband and children.Case after case has been accumulated in which this invalidation process took place for no otherreason than to hide data which the parent did not wish to be known.The only other reason an invalidation of Dianetics takes place, after an individual sees itoperate and understands it, is that the aberrated condition of the mate or employee permits theinvalidator to continue in control of that individual. This is highly discreditable, but will befound many more times than the auditor will like and will be a considerable problem to him.Those who oppose processing either have something to hide or suppose they gain in some wayby continuing authoritarian control of the preclear in question. Because he is running momentswhen the preclear was sick, distressed, injured, or otherwise disturbed, the auditor can expectto find himself viewing almost any state of health, neurosis or psychosis at one or another stageof the preclear’s advance to clear. These states will be very transitory, taking place only whenthe preclear is returned to an engram and during the period, usually a few minutes or an hour,required to run the engram. Unless one understands that re-experiencing engrams is re-experiencing the very stuff of which insanity is made, one can become alarmed about this. Theonly really dangerous thing about the running of engrams is simply becoming alarmed.The preclear, sent back into the basic area, will roll into a foetal ball. The girl sent backto birth may get into mama’s valence and scream loud enough time after time to disturb theneighbors a block away. The individual returned to when he had the mumps may be seen tohave a very puffy face. The boy sent back to a severe sunburn may manifest redness andconsiderable discomfort, until the engram is reduced. The temperature of the preclear will risemarkedly when he is sent back down the track to a moment when he had a high fever.Reduction of the engram reduces the fever and reduces the aberrative effects which the preclearfelt for years after that illness. A medical doctor, observing dianetic processing for the firsttime, watches the preclear cheerfully lie down on the couch, listen to the auditor utter certainphrases, then sees the preclear become flushed and red, or otherwise apparently ill for a brieftime. A medical doctor observing this is alerted by his impulse to heal by his own methods to apoint where he will sometimes request that the session be stopped because this preclear may berunning a temperature, or seems to have severe cramps, or is generally uncomfortable. Thepreclear will be the first one to try to reassure the doctor, for the somatic that the preclear isexperiencing is highly transitory, and the preclear learning why, and getting rid of the reasonwhy he has had, for instance, migraine headaches most of his life, will not mind thesemanifestations but indeed will rather welcome them, since they will shortly reduce. If thepreclear is brought to present time before such an engram is reduced, the somatic and othermanifestations, which were mild at the place on the track where they first occurred, will usuallyintensify. And if brought to present time by a poorly informed or cowardly auditor before theengram is reduced or erased, the preclear may experience some after-effects which are far less196"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"pleasant than running the engram. There is a motto governing this: “The only way out of anengram is through it many times.”If the file clerk presented an engram, it will reduce or erase, or the basic on its chainwill reduce or erase. Thus, it is up to the auditor to have confidence in his tools and to addresshis skill to the case, as detailed in this chapter. There is nothing very dangerous in runningengrams except in failing to reduce them or to reduce the earliest engram on the chain -- or ininvalidating them to the preclear, branding them delusion or some such thing. Anything whichin a few moments can take a human being who is healthy and cheerful, run his temperature upthree points, roll him up into a ball, or cause him to turn red all over is not something caused bydelusion. You could even hypnotize a preclear (but don’t ever let me catch you doing it) andtell him that he is going to manifest the very same things, and he will not manifest them. Thus,these are not by power of suggestion and there is no delusion mixed up in it. If you run apreclear back down the track into an engram, reduce the engram. Or if it starts to recess,demand the earliest engram on that chain and reduce that. If this earlier engram begins torecess, get an even earlier engram. Sooner or later you should get to the bottom of the chain,even when you have foolishly driven the preclear hard into a part of the bank the file clerk didnot present.Don’t go in for the processing of engrams half-heartedly. You can be careless aboutrunning locks, without any casualty. You can even be somewhat careless about runningsecondaries without producing any serious condition in the preclear. But don’t run the basicsource, the engram, unless you mean to reduce it, or to reduce the basic on its chain, byrecounting it, perceptic for perceptic, until it no longer bothers the preclear. Any new thingcollects about it experimenters. But one should not experiment with the running of an engram;one should continue on until the engram is reduced. It is actually very easy to process anengram if you really mean to process it, and are not just trying to find out whether or notengrams exist. One gentleman was curious about engrams, and without any study of thesubject of processing them, much less a course at the Foundation, told his wife to shut her eyesand go back to the time when she had the measles. Unthinkingly, because this sort of thingsimply did not happen before 1950, the wife closed her eyes and very shortly felt the warmthof measles. She was quite surprised. So was her husband. But they were even moresurprised one day later when she broke out with a rash. Her husband promptly took her to thedoctor, who said, “I would swear she had measles, except that she hasn’t any respiratorysymptoms and she hasn’t any temperature.” Two days later her rash disappeared of its ownaccord, as engrams, placed into restimulation in such wise normally will settle out. What thishusband should have done in the first place was inquire from the file clerk if there was anengram ready to be run, and then ask for the identification of the engram, and then run it byrote until it was reduced.There is nothing that validates Dianetics to the preclear like being sent into a mass ofsomatics he did not suspect he had ever experienced. It is the person who is so heavily chargedwith entheta that he cannot experience somatics who most seriously questions the validity ofDianetics. But even these individuals, seeing the effect of Dianetics on people who are higherup the tone scale and able to experience somatics, will eventually concede. The person whodoes get somatics is most forcefully struck by the fact that this new thing, Dianetics, can do athing which was never done before, namely, to change radically and at will the physical beingof an individual. Not even in the days when witchcraft was rampant was one able to utter achant and have immediate results follow. In Dianetics words which are simply the words ofone ordinary human being addressed to another can roll the other individual up into a ball andturn on a fever or turn on a sunburn or blur his vision and create many other manifestations inthe case which is fairly well up the tone scale. This is so marked, and the validity of Dianetics,if only in the terms of manifestation, is so strong that a physics professor at Columbia oncecame to the Foundation just to remark on the “diabolical accuracy of Hubbard’s predictions ofhuman behavior.”197"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"“Be surprised at nothing,” “Always ask the file clerk,” and “Always reduce everyengram you contact, or the basic on the chain” are the three rules of processing engrams.Follow these, and you can’t get your preclear into very serious trouble.Further, there now exists lock scanning, a technique developed in the Fall of 1950,which takes off the auditing that has thus been done. Theoretically, this permits the auditor tomake almost any kind of blunder he wishes. After he has made some mistake, placed someengram into serious restimulation, wound his preclear up in a ball, found no way out of thesituation, the auditor, theoretically, can lock-scan off the auditing and relieve the restimulationwhich he has occasioned. The word “theoretically” is used here advisedly since in cases whichare below 2.0 on the tone scale, the auditor could place a preclear so thoroughly into an engramthat no free theta would exist with which to scan off this auditing. This would be a veryextreme case and would apply only when the preclear under treatment was a borderline oractual psychotic rather than a person with a great deal of free theta who is yet below 2.0 on thetone scale. Always finish any session by scanning off the auditing anyway, but don’tencourage yourself to make mistakes just because you can remedy them with lock scanning.In order to lock-scan off auditing, one merely says “Can we now scan off theauditing?” (Snap!). If the preclear’s file clerk says no, the auditor should discover if someother chain has to be scanned before the auditing can be scanned off, and if this is the case heproceeds to have it scanned.Ordinarily, the file clerk will say yes, and the auditor then directs the preclear to go backto the first moment of the session and to scan through the session to present time. He does thisby requiring the preclear to tell him when he is at the beginning of the session and notpermitting the preclear to start scanning until the auditor has said, “Begin scanning” (snap !).The preclear scans through the session at any speed he desires, contacting the consecutiveevents of the auditing, moment by moment, with his attention mainly directed to the exteriorstimuli of the auditing session rather than to the engrams through which he has been run. Thisextroverts the preclear. Lock scanning of the session should be continued time after time, butonly provided the auditor asks the file clerk after each sweep, “Should we scan the auditingagain?” (snap !). The file clerk will usually reply yes to this two or three times, and will finallyreply “No!” Then the auditor should ask the file clerk, Can we end the session?” (snap!).Usually, the file clerk will reply yes. If the file clerk replies “No!” some earlier chain may havebeen accidentally thrown into restimulation which will have to be lock-scanned before thesession can be ended in order for the preclear to comfortable after the session, but this is rare.This ritual, when followed, undoes any errors in the session unless as has been saidabove the auditor is dealing with a borderline or actual psychotic, in which case he should haveidentified the preclear as such on the tone scale chart in the first place and should have auditedthe preclear as directed by the chart. On such an individual, engrams must never be run, untilthe preclear is advanced up the tone scale by establishment of affinity, communication, andreality with the auditor, by establishment of contact with the environment, and by straightmemory, light lock scanning, and the occasional running of a secondary. It should beremembered by the auditor that phrases in engrams are always literal. A phrase in an engrammeans exactly what it says, just as Simple Simon would have interpreted it the day he was socareful to step in every pie. For instance the phrase contained in an engram, “I can’t make itout,” does not mean to the preclear on his first contacts that he cannot understand it or see it -- itmeans simply that the preclear is unable to get out of the engram. The phrase “beat it” is notinterpreted by the analytical mind at first glimpse as “get out” and is not a bouncer but merelyan aberrative phrase which might cause the preclear to repeat several times. The auditor,particularly when he is running engrams, should make a considerable study of the literalness oflanguage. This is the main trouble with an engram, that it has command value which is literallyinterpreted. “I see what you mean” will cause the preclear to get a picture rather than to feel thathe understands. This is true of both ordinary aberrative phrases and action phrases.The difference between an action phrase and an aberrative phrase is that the actionphrase causes the preclear to go somewhere or stay somewhere, or not get in touch with198"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"something, in terms of space and time. The aberrative phrase merely dictates conduct and isnot nearly as serious to the auditor as the action phrase. The aberrative phrase has beeninhibitive to the abilities of the preclear, but the action phrase is inhibitive to the auditor’s abilityto keep the preclear in this engram and run it. When action phrases are very active in engrams,causing the preclear to bounce or to come back to an engram, or to go later in the engram, or tobecome mixed up, or to find that the time track has collapsed around the engram, as wouldhappen in the case of any grouper on a heavily charged case, the auditor should not be runningengrams in the first place and is doing so only because he has failed to evaluate his preclearproperly on the tone scale and to follow its directions about the case.Theoretically, one could strip a case of locks and secondaries without touching anyengrams; however, there are such things as circuits, as will be covered later, and sometimes itmight be necessary to run engrams on a heavily charged case in order to attack a circuit, but thiswould be an extraordinary proceeding, and should only be done by a skilled auditor, as trainedat the Foundation.The engram is suppressed and out of sight of the analyzer. This is a primarycharacteristic. At the shock of physical pain or at the beginning of unconsciousness, theanalyzer goes out of circuit and ceases to regulate bodily functions or record or think, to agreater or lesser degree. The analyzer can be partly on or nearly off or entirely off during anengram. In any case, the perceptions are recorded in the reactive mind. The reactive mind wasonce known as the “unconscious mind,” but this terminology is highly misleading, because thereactive mind is the mind which is always conscious, and the “conscious mind” is the mindwhich shuts off or goes unconscious. The total content of the reactive mind, then, is enthetaheld down by physical pain engrams which form the basis that causes later enturbulated theta tobe “permanently” trapped. Into the reactive mind, in the course of a lifetime, because ofphysical pain engrams, the bulk of a person’s free theta disappears from conscious view and isno longer available for computation but reacts against the analyzer and “I” to disturb and enterhidden and arbitrary data and values into thinking. The physical pain in the reactive mind actsagainst the physical body of the preclear, and when the analyzer does not obey the engramcommands, this pain turns on and aberrates the physical body.The task of the auditor, it is repeated here, is to exhaust from the reactive mind theaccumulated entheta by whatever means are indicated or possible and to convert that enthetainto theta, by the simple expedient of bringing the entheta into memory or separating it from thephysical pain which traps it. The task of the auditor is not simply to run engrams off a case.An auditor can make this mistake very easily because of his ambitiousness to create a clear. Aclear, technically, is simply an individual from whom all physical pain engrams, allsecondaries, and all aberrative locks have been erased. The clear can receive new engrams, butthese must be of a very severe nature to be highly aberrative, because it is the early engrams ona case which produce the greatest aberration and effect on the individual. However, do notmistake the fact that heavy intentional engrams hammered by ferocious physical pain into aclear, should that clear have been basically low on endowment of free theta, may produce apsychotic break. But do not expect that engrams once erased and the entheta exhausted fromthe reactive mind will then return in some strange fashion. They will not, once they areproperly addressed and converted. It takes new physical pain to produce more engrams in aclear. A clear will, however, become enturbulated by the environment, but will enturbulatetemporarily only and will suffer no after-effect from the enturbulence, since there is nothing totrap the entheta. Taking the locks and secondaries off a case, and a few engrams in the courseof accomplishing this, produces a dianetic release.Thus, the auditor can understand his point of concentration on the case. The progress ofany preclear is measured by the preclear’s rise on the tone scale, not by the number of engramswhich are reduced or erased in the preclear. Authoritarian auditing on a low-tone case canreduce engrams, and erase them, hour after hour for scores and scores of hours, but can leavethe case in such turbulence that the rise on the tone scale is relatively slight. The physical painbrings about the “permanence” of entrapment, but the auditor will find his greatest store ofentheta, which he can convert into theta, in secondaries and locks.199"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"An engram which has many locks and secondaries above it is completely buried and outof sight and unavailable to auditing. An engram which has almost no secondaries and lockshas in it all its perceptics, which is to say that the preclear, in recounting it, returned to thatpoint on the time track, can see, hear, feel and experience motion, moisture and temperature,much as he did when he lived through the moment at the time it occurred. After the engram iskeyed-in thoroughly and accumulates secondaries and locks, the sharpness of the percepticsbegins to disappear out of it, so far as the returned preclear is concerned, in direct ratio to theamount of entheta which has charged this engram up. A very heavily charged engram, then, isnot seen, heard, or felt by the preclear. An extremely heavily charged engram doesn’t evenexist as far as the preclear is concerned but its presence is indicated by the fact that heavysecondaries and locks occur along a certain line.After these have been run and their entheta converted to theta by the standard processingtechniques delineated herein, the engram itself will emerge and it or its chain, since engramsexist in chains, may only then be available for the auditor’s address. But it should beunderstood that once this engram is thus available the bulk of the entheta which it contained hasalready been turned into free theta by lock scanning or the exhaustion of secondaries, and sothe engram is relatively harmless save that it will accumulate new secondaries and new locks.Further, it still retains the physical pain, and its commands are still aberrative, and so it must berun. But the auditor should expect more change in the case from running locks and secondariesthan from physical pain engrams, even though engrams are the basic source of humanaberration. The engram is pinned down and hidden from view, of course, by entheta. Enthetahas many forms. It could be said to exist on the case by virtue of enMEST, which is to say thatfor the entheta released on the case there will be a physiological reaction, whereby the physicalside of the organism undergoes some chemical alteration or gives off some chemical product.Oxygenation apparently has a great deal to do with the release of entheta. Tears and urine,sweat, body odors, glandular products come off a case as the enMEST accompaniment to theentheta released, and physical energy as well. The auditor must not expect these enMESTmanifestations only in engrams. They are most marked in the discharge of secondaries andlocks. This subject will be further covered under another column.Case accessibility is measured by the tone scale and is very important to the auditor. Acase may be very low on the tone scale apparently and still may be accessible, which is to say,the preclear wants to get better. This denotes the existence of considerable endowment of freetheta in the first place and of enough free theta, regardless of its low percentage in ratio to theamount of entheta on the case, for the preclear to desire a return in the direction of survival. Ofcourse, the entheta on this case is descending in the direction of succumbing. This case couldbe considered an accessible case even though it lies below 2.0 on the tone scale. In processingit, the auditor should particularly respect the survival ambition of the remaining free theta andshould be gentle with the case, removing entheta and converting it to free theta as lightly aspossible. Such a case should never be run into engrams, since the restimulated engram willform a new lock and absorb some of the existing free theta. Above 2.0, cases are normallyaccessible, but occasionally due to education or environmental stigmata with regard to gettingbetter or because of a peculiar type of engram command which prohibits contact, these caseswill be inaccessible.Accessibility, then, could be considered, generally, the desire of the individual to attainnew and higher levels of survival and the betterment of mind and body. Accessibility isroughly proportional to the amount of free theta existing on a case, but this ratio may beinterrupted by inhibitions, educational or engramic.The wide-open case is peculiarly deceptive to the auditor. This case is a weathercock inthe environment, and in the presence of high-level people and in a high-level environment mayseem quite normal, but given an average environment this case is considerably below normal,and given a small amount of enturbulence this case begins to obey engramic commandswhichever way they drive. Yet this case apparently has all perceptics available. Such a case,around 1.1, will even run engrams, but the somatic will probably be light even if the other200"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"perceptics are apparently sharp. Here is the case which lacks, structurally probably, amechanism by which to occlude charge. This case, below 2.0, is quite ordinarily inaccessible,unless assisted by manic engrams or a general feeling in the environment that being processedis the thing to do, for this case is often quite impressionable and follows the fashion of theenvironment easily. The inexperienced auditor may find such a case, may discover that sonic,visio, tactile exist and so decide, without beginning to look at his tone scale chart, that the casecan run engrams. Somehow or other he persuades the case to begin processing and plungesthe case down the track into moments of physical pain and unconsciousness. He will find thiscase resistive, quite ordinarily, or easily distracted in processing, but he may persist anddiscover only after he has done considerable processing that the case is not rising veryremarkably on the tone scale.Should the auditor be short-sighted enough to start running engrams on such a case,additional manifestations will tell him that he is doing wrong. The wide-open case will have,usually, some of the perceptics markedly missing. One of these is physical position. This casedoes not roll into a ball or otherwise change position even when apparently strenuous engramsare being run with full sonic and some other perceptics in the basic area. The reverse isoccasionally true. This case may always roll into a ball and have sonic and visio, but will lackmany of the other perceptics. The constant of this wide-open case low on the tone scale is thatit has sonic and visio, that the somatics are light ordinarily, that the case does not progressrapidly up the tone scale despite the fact that engrams are evidently being erased or reduced.This is to say that the incidents never come up to laughter, but the case will run very soberly.This last denotes that the analyzer is not comparing conduct in the usual environment with whathas been commanded by the engrams. Now and then one will find a low-tone wide-open casewhich laughs long and uproariously over everything which is contacted. The auditor should notbe alarmed by or censure this but should be aware of the fact that he is running a great deal ofwhat is called “line charge” off a very heavily charged case. Engrams can be reduced anderased in these low-tone wide-open cases, but the sense of reality about the incidents iscommonly low and, as has been said, the rise up the tone scale is not very apparent. There aresome of these wide-open cases which seem to have all their real somatics converted intophysical distortion and without getting pain will go into various contortions. They willapparently reduce engrams by doing this.Any wide-open case which is low on the tone scale should not have engrams run on ituntil a very great deal of entheta is converted to free theta by the discharge of secondaryengrams and the scanning of locks, for this case will probably become less and less accessibleto the auditor and will protest against being processed and will complain of no relief. This caseis not being contrary. It is an actual fact that the case is experiencing no relief although theauditor, knowing engrams when he sees them, and seeing them erase or reduce, has anotheridea about how this case should be behaving.A low-tone wide-open case, then, should be handled like an occluded low-tone case,which is to say that the address of the auditor should be toward secondaries and locks, asdirected on the chart.Accessibility is a considerable problem to the auditor. He must always work in thedirection of increasing it. Of course, by accessibility is meant the willingness of the preclear toaccept auditing and the ability of the auditor and the preclear to work as a team to increase theposition of the preclear on the tone scale.A case is as accessible as it is willing to cooperate and be audited. Some cases arecompletely inaccessible, and this inaccessiblity is not confined to the sanatorium or should-besanatorium case. Indeed, the only cases which arrive at sanatoriums are those which flagrantlyseem to be a threat to their own lives, to the lives of others, or to property, although those whoare a threat to property normally would wind up in a penitentiary, although they are usually noless psychotic. The low-tone case that is not obviously a suicide but is apparently able to copein some routine fashion with the environment passes the notice of the heavily burdened state,which just now tries to cope with the problem of nineteen million obviously insane persons.201"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Unwillingness to improve in ability to think or act is overcome with considerable easein persons above 2.5 merely by the auditor’s demonstration of the workability and effects ofDianetics. Here is a problem the auditor solves by education. No one above 2.5 who sees somevalidation of Dianetics in terms of testing or who through a little lock scanning or straightmemory picks up some material he thought he had forgotten and which has been troubling him,will refuse processing, unless there is a question of finance involved -- but this can be resolvedby the formation of co-auditing teams. This is not just an optimistic remark; it is borne out byconsiderable experience. Of course, individuals above 2.5 can still be possessed of a very lowtheta endowment or may be to some degree structurally deficient in intelligence. But eventhese, if the auditor takes care with them, gather some understanding of the subject. Some ofthese are incompetent co-auditors, and thus must be assisted by others whom they will notassist in turn.From 2.5 down, inaccessibility is a problem, but even here, individuals who have ahigh theta endowment or who are only temporarily at this level will cooperate. There are twotypes of cases which will baffle the auditor. The first is one who is passing for normal in thesociety because of some routine ability to cope with the environment, who is yet low on thetone scale, who is very trying to the people about him or her, yet who is confirmed inresistance to any aid or assistance. This type of case is not normally recognized as insane inview of the enormous numbers of insane who are dramatically so. Yet this inaccessible case,just as bacteria crawl through the society, is injuring and enturbulating mates, children, andfriends, down the dwindling spiral. Such people are so “reasonable” as to why they are doingwhat they are doing and are usually so set in their enturbulative ways and have been so non-classifiable to one and all that they -- like the lepers who once begged through the streets ofParis, their threat to the social health misunderstood -- continue to plague the society with thejustification of their engrams and their destruction of the dreams, minds, and health of this andthe next generation. Here is the real problem for the auditor. The husband of such a womanmay be a desperately driven man by the neglect he finds in his home, by the scoffing whichmeets his dreams, by the nagging or nullification or domination of his just as thoroughly drivenchildren. He may come to the auditor or may himself undertake a study of Dianetics in an effortto remedy his situation. Dianetics can remedy that situation, but he will not be able to processhis wife, for such husband-wife teams do not work, and if he tries to coax her to process him,he is placing into her hands a further weapon for his own destruction. In the hands of anotherauditor, she will be capricious or sullen or angry. And even if the auditor does achieve successwith this case to the degree of recovering and converting some entheta he and the husband maydiscover this woman possessed of just enough more self-determination to run off with anotherman. The wife who has this same type of situation with her husband may have an even moredifficult time. Dianetics is a remedy which will apply and achieve results but the auditor isquite commonly baffled when he encounters these “rational” inaccessible cases. He should layaside his bafflement and treat these cases as he would treat the most inaccessible, obviouspsychotic. Because such people can keep a flow of “reason” running along accepted or normalchannels, the auditor need not be deceived into thinking them genuinely rational. Here is a casewhere affinity, reality, and communication must be built, where the preclear’s perceptics mustbe directed to present-time objectives, and where the most gentle entrance into the entheta mustbe made. The fact that such cases do not wear a large sign which says “INSANE” and the factthat the death they deal to those around them is not sudden, swift and spectacular, but slow andcreeping, are not reasons to audit them as though they were nearly clear. Methods ofprocessing for these people should be those which the tone scale chart indicates. If anevaluation of them shows them to be at 0.5 or 1.1, then the appropriate methods should beused, no matter how “rational” the preclear is.It should be remarked that individuals may be low on the tone scale and still haveenough theta endowment to desire processing and receive it and make use of it. These areaccessible cases but, of course, should have light methods used on them and should not beallowed to run engrams any more than the inaccessible person at this level.202"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"The next type of case which will give trouble to the auditor is the obviously inaccessiblepsychotic. A psychotic is that person, according to dianetic definition, whose theta has becomeentheta completely, and who is either entirely locked up in an engram or chain of engrams anddoes nothing but dramatize them, or who is under the command of a control circuit and doessome computation, if limited and unreasonable. The psychotic varies in manifestation, but thereason he is psychotic does not vary. There are psychotics who are completely entheta all ofthe time, psychotics who are only acutely so, under certain circumstances, and psychotics whobecome completely enturbulated during certain periods of the day, or of the week, or of themonth. (The last type, which is restimulated cyclically is generally running on a time factorcontained in the engram. The incident may have occurred on the twenty-fifth of the month andcontinued to the thirtieth, so this person becomes psychotic from the twenty-fifth to the thirtiethof every month. Or the incident may have occurred at ten o’clock at night, and the psychotic isonly insane at ten o’clock every night. The cyclic psychotic is processed by the auditor onlyduring periods when a small amount of free theta is available).No engrams must be run on individuals who are below 2.0 on the tone scale whetherthey are accessible or inaccessible save in those rare instances when the file clerk insists onpresenting an engram, and they must be run then only with the gravest caution, and they mustnot be run even then if the auditor considers himself inexperienced. With the inaccessiblepsychotic whose “reason” is so evasive and aberrated as to appear so even to the casualobserver, and with the psychotic who is caught in some engram, the auditor should give hiswhole effort to establishing contact, even by mimicking the psychotic or by discovering somesmall interest the psychotic may have in his environ and directing his attention to the details ofthat thing. Perceptics may be encouraged and recovered by as mild a thing as additional contactwith some object in the environ. This, after it has brought some recovery of affinity,communication, and reality, may be followed by straight memory. All this is included herebecause auditors, knowing the basic cause of aberration, are ambitious to treat cause. Thebasic cause of human aberration, however, is a deeper one than a physical pain engram. It is,by dianetic theory, an enturbulence and entrapment of theta. Free the theta. When the engramsare to be run, they will present themselves.The patter of the auditor in running engrams is a very simple one. It is easy toovercomplicate the simplicity of processing. People have written demanding to know howreverie is obtained, saying that after twenty tries they still have not been able to accomplishreverie in their preclear. They evidently have reverie mixed up with hypnotism and consider itunusual merely because it has a name. One induces reverie simply by asking the preclear toclose his eyes. One brings a preclear out of reverie simply by telling him to open his eyes. Thepatter of running an engram is as follows:“The file clerk will present the engram necessary to resolve the case. The somatic stripwill go to the beginning of the engram. When I count from one to five and snap my fingers thefirst phrase in the engram will flash. One, two, three, four, five.” (Snap !)The first phrase of the engram presents itself. The auditor causes the preclear to repeatit until a somatic turns on. Then the auditor tells the preclear to go to the next phrase in theengram and repeat that, and so on, phrase by phrase, until the engram is run, then to go back tothe beginning. Above 2.5, the action phrases in the case may not be very forceful, and thepreclear may without much auditor assistance, after the above patter of repeating the first phraseis done, run the engram consecutively, repeating each phrase only once. If the preclear beginsto come out of the engram suddenly and move on up the track into locks or if he suddenly startstelling the auditor about locks, the preclear has bounced and is no longer in the engram but hasstruck a phrase which caused him to move out of the engram. If the preclear suddenly movesdown into a lower engram, he has hit a downbouncer. In each case, the auditor working withthe file clerk should procure the data necessary, asking if there is an action phrase, obtainingthe action phrase, and causing the preclear to repeat that phrase until he is back in the engram heshould be running. However, when action phrases are this active the auditor has no businessrunning very many engrams on the case, regardless of his hurry to get his preclear clear. Hewill do it faster by addressing secondaries and locks. The command value of phrases in203"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"engrams upon the preclear is shown by how well bouncers bounce the preclear out of theengrams, how well misdirectors misdirect him, how well denyers deny further content in theengram. This is a very important fact. When the auditor has discovered how active actionphrases are, he will know better whether he should run further engrams on the case or not.When the entheta in locks and secondaries is unburdened, the command value of action phrasesand all phrases in engrams will reduce markedly. An engram phrase depends for its strengthupon secondaries and locks. You can run out of almost any preclear an engram which has justoccurred and which therefore contains no locks, but even this has its exceptions. The fact thathas no exception is that a phrase in an engram loses its potency when the entheta in secondariesand locks is removed from above the engram by lock scanning or running secondaries or bystraight memory. Get rid of the charge, and the ability of the engram to aberrate the preclear isslight.This does not gain say the fact that after you have run a few secondaries or scannedlocks or done some straight memory on a preclear and regained some free theta, even thoughthe preclear remains fairly low on the tone scale, an engram may come into view which willhave to be run by the auditor. The engram is basic, evidently, because it is the basic collisionbetween theta and MEST. It is important because it is a trap for future enturbulences. Anycase may possess from hundreds to thousands of physical pain engrams. It is a dull,inexperienced, and skill-less auditor who will run engrams on a case without assigning the caseto its proper position on the tone scale and being governed thereby.204"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTEEN;COLUMN AJChains of EngramsEngrams exist in chains. Phrases exist in chains. Somatics exist in chains. Percepticsexist in chains. The mind files in terms of time and topic. It is an elaborate filing systemwhich, though simple in concept, would stagger anyone who would attempt to duplicate it inpurely mechanical ways.All the injuries, for instance, to the right thumb lie in the reactive mind in a chain ofinjuries to the right thumb. The phrase “I love you” lies in a chain, wherever it appears, in thereactive mind and in another chain in the analytical mind, and in times of restimulation the twomay become one chain. A smash on the right thumb which was accompanied by the words “Ilove you” would be a crossing of the right-thumb somatic chain and the I-love-you phrasechain. Thus, somatics and words can criss-cross each other up the bank. A time track exists,then, for every topic which can be indexed. This filing system is a highly complexinterweaving, possible to compute mathematically but rather impossible to draw, so varied mayit be.When one speaks of a chain of incidents, one means usually a chain of locks or a chainof engrams or a chain of secondaries which have similar content. These incidents in chains maycontain the same dramatic personnel, such as all secondaries which contain mother and fatheror all engrams which contain grandmother, or may be all locks which depend upon a certainunknown engram or chain of engrams for their existence but which can be identified by the fileclerk as a chain of locks, or may be any incident or perceptic lying on the time track which isinterrelated with other incidents or perceptics.A single engram is a consecutive series of perceptics, which may or may not includeconsecutive phrases, having to do with one injury at one period on the time track. Because anaberree can be expected to say the same things at any time when a certain set of circumstancesis approximated in his environment, one can expect the engrams of any person who was manytimes unconscious in the vicinity of that aberree to contain this same dramatization over andover again.Any of these things cause a chain. The single engram could be considered to lie acrossthe time track in one place, but a chain of engrams is a series running up the time track. Or achain could be considered a series of recurrences of a certain phrase, each time perhaps with adifferent somatic, which ran up the time track.It is possible to collapse the time track. In a very heavily charged case, a grouper, aphrase which pulls everything in toward it such as the phrase, “Everything happens at once” or“You’re all against me,” (the sure central engram phrase of the paranoid or paranoiac), can,when too thoroughly restimulated, crunch the time track together. This occasionally occurssimply in the business of living. An individual has an engram restimulated which contains agrouper and the case is so heavily charged that the entire time track collapses. The auditor willenter such a case and find everything mixed and scrambled, no time track in existence, thepreclear befuddled, low on the tone scale, ordinarily physiologically malformed, and certainlyin a highly aberrated mental condition. It would be very nice if this preclear could simply havethis one grouper run out of him but all the elements of the case (entheta) act to smother thisgrouper. Thus, lighter methods of processing than running the engram itself have to beutilized. The grouper is the chief danger in any scanning of physical pain engrams. A groupercan be hit on a highly charged case which will collapse the time track. The auditor, if thishappened, by acting quickly might get a flash on what the grouper was and get it repeated soonenough to keep it from being closed in upon. But if the time track will collapse on a grouper, it205"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"means the action phrases on this case are extremely active and the auditor has no businesswhatsoever scanning engrams.The scanning of engrams was originally developed and used on any and all cases, andwhile it produced alleviation in some cases (if not the erasure of engrams), in others it produceda marked deterioration. Here is a technique of limited use, which can be used only when theamount of charge on the case has been accurately estimated by the auditor. As will be seen onthe tone scale chart, the scanning of engrams can never be undertaken with any safety belowthe level of 3.5. An individual can be scanned from 3.5 up to clear, but he can only be scannedwhen bouncers do not bounce, misdirectors do not misdirect, when the majority of theperceptics are very clear and when the bulk of the secondaries are gone from the case.The scanning of engrams, then, offers a quick way to finish up a case which hasalready been raised to 3.5 by other auditing skills. Below the level of 3.5, chain scanning ofengrams should not be adventured upon, since sooner or later the auditor will strike a grouperor some other action phrase and enturbulate the case enormously. This is a dangerous techniqueand should be used only when the auditor is absolutely certain that he is dealing with a 3.5.The scanning of secondary engrams can sometimes be done, but again, only if theindividual is at 3.5 on the tone scale, since all the grief on the case may enturbulate into a ball.The scanning of locks can be done from 1.1 on up the tone scale, and cautions relatingto the scanning of engrams do not apply to the scanning of locks. However, in the process ofscanning locks one will occasionally find his preclear dropping into an engram. This isbecause entheta in being freed exposes an engram which is not suspected. In a case which istoo low on the tone scale to have an engram run comfortably, the preclear may be set to boiling-off and then may be scanned on some other chain until he is out of this engram, but ordinarily,physical pain should be avoided. In lock scanning, the file clerk should be consulted asfollows:“Can this chain be scanned without contacting physical pain?” (snap). If the answer isyes, then the chain is scanned. But if the answer is no, then another chain is requested. Inshort, one should not scan through physical pain on any case below 3.5 on the tone scale.There are many ramifications to this technique of chain scanning. At first glance, chainscanning appears to be an excellent way to sweep all the engrams out of a case hastily and havea clear, but this is not what happens. Even at the 3.5 level chain scanning leaves on the casemany somatics which then have to be cleared up. It might be said that the top comes off theengrams during chain scanning of engrams. Engrams which are scanned lower than 3.5 on thetone scale reduce but little, and below 2.5 entrap more than is freed, according to observation.One scans chains of engrams, when he is sure that his preclear is a 3.5, by consultingwith the file clerk as to whether or not a chain of engrams can be scanned. On an affirmativeresponse from the file clerk, the auditor tells the preclear to go to the first engram on the chain.When he is sure that the preclear is there, the auditor signals him to begin scanning, and thepreclear scans to present time through all such engrams. The preclear can scan at a speed slowenough to permit him to vocalize the most aberrative phrases which he crosses, or he can scanslowly enough to recognize the phrases but not to vocalize them, or he can scan at a mediumspeed, getting concepts of the incidents he is passing on the time track or he can scan atmaximum speed, knowing that he is passing through incidents only by the flicking on and offof somatics.Lock scanning can remedy damage which has been done by chain scanning. In otherwords, if the auditor makes an error and chain scans, let us say, a 2.5 level preclear only todiscover that action phrases are sufficiently strong to cause the preclear to hang up on the track,the auditor can then lock-scan off the last few minutes of auditing and lock-scan it off verythoroughly so the damage to that degree can be remedied. However, one should not alwayscount upon this as possible.206"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN;COLUMN AKCircuitsThe circuit is caused by a special type of engram command which, sufficiently chargedup by locks and secondaries, evidently compartments off some section of the analytical mindwhich thereafter, to a limited degree, acts as a separate entity or another personality. “You”phrases such as “I have to do all your thinking for you,” “I’m going to tell you what to do andyou’ve got to do it,” which are said to the individual or near him when he is unconscious and inphysical pain, bring about this phenomenon, according to theory and observation. In practice,these circuits resolve when the case is unburdened of charge or when the engram containing thecircuit is erased or reduced.Distinct from circuits is the valence compartmentation which takes place in the mind.As has been elsewhere discussed, the individual’s survival may become so intricatelyconcerned with that of another human being, particularly during the unconsciousness or illnessof the individual, that the dramatizations, personal habits, and even factors of personalappearance of the imitated person seem to become set up as a segment of the analytical mind.The individual may have several valences by reason of this kind of association. A child quitecommonly has the valence of his father and the valence of his mother and the valences of otherpeople around him. Valence is an exaggeration of that basic of education, mimicry. A humanbeing learns his first lessons, and most of his basic lessons thereafter, in habits, mannerismsand skills, by mimicry. Anything which can be aberrated in the mind has a specific use towardsurvival when unaberrated. A child learns how to talk by imitating sounds. It learns how towalk by imitating the steps of its elders. During moments of physical pain, unconsciousnessand illness, this ability enters into the reactive mind, which thereafter forces or can force theanalytical mind to pattern itself without any self-determinism in thinking or acting, after anotherhuman being. The valence is a representation of a whole individual. When a case becomesfairly well charged a person can or does get into a valence and thereafter demonstrates themannerisms, habits and patterns of thought of that valence. A person has his own valence and,potentially, the valences of the people around him. A case which is very heavily charged goesinto valences so completely that the person sharply and distinctly changes personality andappearance when shifted from one valence to another. The original definition of schizophrenicor “scissors personality” was in observation of this shift of identity. A case must be veryhighly charged indeed and, of course, well below 2.0 for these valence walls to become so welldefined that they are actual compartments in the mind and have such distinct memory banks thatwhen the individual shifts from one valence to another he may have no recollection of what hedid when he was in another valence, or even that he was ever in another valence. An individualcan have two, six, ten, or any number of valences, potentially. A psychotic may be, to anintensified degree, two or more people, changing from one to another without any recognitionthat another has existed.Nearly everyone has some valence trouble, in that when he is confronted by differentpeople he feels he is himself a different personality. A man may feel like a lion when playinggolf with his friends and like a mouse when he is talking to his wife. With his friends he maypossibly be in his own valence (the happiest condition) or in the valence of some jovialindividual he has known, but confronted by his wife, whom, unknowingly, he marriedbecause she reminded him of his mother, he is forced into his father’s valence, and his fathermay have been a badly intimidated man.These valence compartments of the mind operate in an individual above 2.0 under thevery close attention of “I.” The “I” of persons above 2.0 could be said to be actually in controlof each valence, but as the charge on the case increases “I” is less and less able to control thesevalences. And below 2.0, the charge is quite commonly such that the valence compartments of207"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"the mind develop their own “I” or awareness of awareness center. Here the real “I” of theindividual is relegated to the few remaining attention units which compose basic personality.Self-control is an actual thing exerted by “I.” So long as “I” has enough attention unitsto control or command the analyzer, self-determinism exists, and exists to that degree to which“I” is able to exercise this command or control.In the matter of valences, the submergence of “I” into these valence compartmentsbrings about a condition, as the individual descends the tone scale, wherein when he is infather’s valence he controls himself as father would have, and when he is in mother’s valencehe controls himself as mother would have.Valences could be said to have bouncers, groupers, denyers, and holders, just as doesan engram. This is to say that the phrase known as the “valence shifter” may force the personto be in any or every valence (grouper), or may force him to be barred out of a valence(bouncer) so that he cannot imitate some human being such as father, who may have had verygood qualities well worth imitating. Typical valence shifters are such phrases as “You’re justlike your father,” “I’ll have to pretend I’m somebody else,” “You’re just like your mother, andyou grow more like her every day, and I hate you for it” (which would make a person be likehis mother and hate his mother and thus hate himself). There is also the synthetic valence,which is an artificial person. Or the valence command which makes a person like every stageactor he sees. Valences commonly exist for household pets, and it is not uncommon for a littlegirl to be in the valence of her dog or her cat and express herself with imitated mannerisms.When this happens to a marked degree, this child has a valence shifter which shifts her into thevalence of the pet, such as, “You’re just like Bonzo!” Whenever mother is angry, the childbecomes “like Bonzo.”The most obvious place to observe valences is during the running of an engram. Anengram has a valence potential for every individual surrounding the unconscious person. If adoctor, a nurse and a parent are present, for instance, around a tonsillectomy, and if they talkduring the operation (something which should never be done!), there is then a potential valenceset up for the doctor, for the nurse and for that parent. Of course, such an engram requiresvery heavy charge before these valences can take over any section of the analyzer. In running aheavily charged engram the preclear will be found, quite commonly, to go into the valences ofpeople around him in the incident. He will not get his own somatics but he will get somaticswhich are commanded by phrases in the incident. If he is in a prenatal and running in mother’svalence, he will have his mother’s stomach upset rather than the pressure which was on him atthe time. He is, thus, out of valence. After the particular valence is discharged or the valenceshifter is located, the preclear can then run in his own valence, and only in such wise does heexperience much relief. The auditor should not be running engrams continually on a case soheavily charged that it gets command somatics and goes easily out of valence.The circuit is different from the valence. The valence mechanism produces wholepeople for the preclear to be and will include habits and mannerisms that are not mentioned inengrams but are the results of the preclear’s compulsion to copy certain people. The circuit is amechanism which becomes an identity in itself, with its own “I” which takes a piece of theanalyzer, walls it off with the charge, and thereafter dictates to the preclear. In olden times,these were called demons. Socrates, for instance, had a demon which dictated to him, althoughthe Socratic demon might not have been the result of an engram but, instead, a theta perceptic.People commonly have various types of circuits and are unaware of the fact that they dohave circuits. An individual’s vocalization of all his thoughts and problems is actually a circuitat work which tells him how to think or tells him how to act. Thinking is so rapid andcomplicated that one would never have a chance to vocalize it. When thinking becomesvocalized, it is usually at the dictation of a circuit. A preclear may have one circuit that criticizeshim, one circuit that seems to order him around, another circuit that mocks or derides him whenhe does something wrong, and yet another which gives him imaginary pictures.208"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The preclear who has active circuits has a relatively highly charged case, and the caseshould be unburdened of charge before the auditor attempts to locate these circuits in engrams.It can happen when a circuit results from some dramatization of the parent, such as “You staythere and listen to me!” that straight wire can locate an awake incident in the life of the preclearwhen the parent was saying this to someone. The simple location of the actual dramatizationand the identification of it, by straight wire, may nullify this circuit. Similarly, when thepreclear commonly acts like his father and is ill with the same chronic somatics his father had(or approximations of them), it occasionally happens that the identification of the basic valenceshifter, by straight memory, will cause the preclear to shift into his own valence. It also mayhappen that by straight memory one can locate a time when father was complaining about hisstomach, with the result that the preclear, who has been having trouble with his stomach,suddenly ceases to have that trouble.Ordinarily, however, cases have to be unburdened of entheta to a considerable extentbefore circuits and valences become inoperative, at which time the preclear’s “I” regains itsself-determinism and control of the organism which had been contested by artificial “I”’sresident in the engrams.All circuits could be said to be control circuits, in that they are attempting to dosomething to the preclear in contest with the preclear’s own “I.” These control circuits areartificial controls and should not to any degree be confused with the desirable self-control of theindividual. No control circuit is actually able to control the individual toward survival.Admonitions to a human being to control himself if he is awake, may perhaps stimulate “I” toassert “I”’s right to handle the body, but they may as easily restimulate a circuit and put theindividual under the control of some command in an engram.There is a specific type of control circuit which is quite remarkable for giving theauditor trouble. When an engram contains a very forceful phrase such as “Control yourself,”the auditor, running that engram even though it is heavily charged, may suddenly find thepreclear running “auto” and going here and there on the track without any further commands.Here an auditing circuit has suddenly taken over. It is necessary for the auditor to discover theidentity of this phrase and then have it repeated. The file clerk is sometimes unable to deliverup a control circuit, and when the file clerk becomes suddenly inoperative, although he hasbeen working well before, the auditor should suspect that a control circuit phrase has shownup.Similar trouble is encountered in the valence shifter, but here sonic and the somatic maygo off while the preclear is yet in the engram. The valence shifter asserts its control only to thepoint of changing the preclear into another identity rather than changing his position on the timetrack. This is not true of a control circuit. The control circuit may conduct itself as an interiorentity which takes the preclear out of the auditor’s hands. When preclears are very hard tohandle, take the bit in their teeth and try to run their own cases despite anything the auditor maydo (providing the auditor has been doing a fairly good job of it, for “I” will sometimes pull thecase out of the auditor’s hands if the auditor is doing a very bad job), they are running oncontrol circuits, recorded commands which make the preclear misbehave under auditing. Thecase which will do this is very heavily charged, and one should not be running engrams on it.Some further comment should be made on the case who begins to audit himself.Evidently a few isolated cases have been able to do self-auditing, without any damage and,indeed, in one case with considerable benefit. A case may begin to self-audit when there arefactors in the case and in the environment which are unsolved by the preclear or the auditor.The moment the proper computation is struck on the case, the self-auditing ceases. Whileanyone can straightwire himself, and this is a very useful procedure, and while almost anyonecan do lock-scanning by himself, the heavier forms of entheta are more and more difficult toattack unassisted. The person who feels the need to run grief over some specific incidentshould, of course, run it whether there is an auditor present or not. But the individual whodeliberately forces himself into an engram and attempts to reduce it will, in ninety-nine casesout of a hundred, merely restimulate the engram and enturbulate himself into helplessness and209"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"discomfort before he has gotten it beyond the first phrase. Self-auditing is really “doing it thehard way,” when carried beyond straight memory or light lock scanning. In almost every case,heavy self-auditing can be put down infallibly to the engrams’ defending themselves from realauditing by deceiving the befuddled preclear into running himself through irreducible or dub-inincidents.Control circuits not only dominate and order the preclear about, but they also nullifyhim. The preclear may have a circuit of a defeatist variety which makes him believe that he isunable to do what is asked of him and decreases his tone by telling him continually that he willfail. Such a circuit might be worded, “I’m here to tell yon that you’ll never amount toanything. You’re nothing. You’re nobody. You’ll never succeed. You’ll never be a success,and it’s time someone told you the truth.” This circuit, with a heavy charge on it, commandsthe preclear continually down into the lower ranges of the tone scale by discouraging him. Butto be operative at all this circuit would have to be very heavily charged and, probably,restimulated by some other person in the environment who is from day to day echoing thissame attitude toward the preclear.There are such things as sonic-disturbance circuits and visio-disturbance circuits. Soniccircuits are very easily recognized, for they speak audibly inside the head of the preclear or givehim faint sonic impressions. The sonic circuit may occasionally try to manufacture engrams forthe preclear, but there is one characteristic about circuits which always permits the auditor todifferentiate. Circuits are ordinarily stupid. They are also discourteous. The auditor shouldpay no attention to them once he detects them, for to pay attention to them is to validate them tosome degree. Where he discovers a circuit of this character he should not try to hammertoward the circuit; he should take enough charge off the case so that the circuit will beinoperative. These sonic and visio manufacturing circuits are very limited in repertoire, and theauditor should not be upset when he encounters them, nor should he then think that what thepreclear is running is always a result of such circuits. To have these circuits, the case must bewell below 2.0 on the tone scale, and the data at this level is rarely properly interpreted by “I”anyway. The auditor is not interested in data in this area. Thus, the visio and sonic circuitsshould not worry him, since they will not impede getting charge off a case. The auditor is nottrying to run engrams.There is also the occlusion type of circuit, the circuit which drops curtains across certainpieces of information or may mask “I” from contact with the standard bank or the reactivebank. This circuit might be worded, “For your own good I have to protect you from yourself.”This may be very sympathetically uttered in some engram and may be uttered enough timesthereafter by the same person in the preclear’s environ to give a thoroughly charged-upocclusion. This individual, because he is “protecting himself from himself” cannot get into anyportion of his mind for anything like optimum operation. But, again, to be effective any ofthese occlusion circuits require a great deal of charge. Lock scanning and straight memory willdo much to alleviate these circuits, but the occlusion circuit can persist, worded a thousanddifferent ways, to such a degree that all entheta becomes more or less occluded.Circuits are peculiarly vicious in inhibiting the release of emotion. Here the auditor hasa real problem in the heavily charged case which is yet running on circuits which tell him not tocry, not to feel anything, to forget it, and so forth. The auditor may find his initial entrance intothe case seriously impeded. The circuit makes it impossible for the preclear to discharge asecondary engram. But by straight memory and lock scanning the auditor, ordinarily, can bringthe preclear up to an ability to run secondary engrams, even without discharging theseinhibition circuits.Circuits exist which either enforce or inhibit affinity, reality, and communication. “Younever love anybody” inhibits affinity. “You have to love me” enforces affinity. “Nothing isreal to you” and “You’ve got to believe everything you hear” inhibit and enforce reality.“You’ve got to listen to me” or “You never hear what I’m saying” enforces or inhibitscommunication.210"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Valence shifts also give the auditor trouble when he is trying to unburden a case ofsecondaries. A preclear can be in the valence of father, who was not an emotional man, and sobe unable to shed tears. A person may be in the valence of mother, who wept all the time, andmay be in that valence so thoroughly that he appears to be running secondaries but is in realityobeying commands or responding to an imitative urge to cry. The case is not unburdened insuch wise of any secondary. The simple fact of being out of valence places him out of contactnot only with his own pain but also with his own emotional charge. The pain and emotionalcharge are on the case very heavy but the preclear, shifted into another valence, is feelingcommand somatics or the pains of the other person and is weeping the tears and feeling thefears of that other person. An individual could go on doing this for some time without muchimprovement in the case. It should be understood that only below 2.2 can a case be heavilyenough charged to shift the preclear out of his own valence to the point where he cannot feel hisown pain and emotion on at least part of the track. When a preclear is out of valence this way,straight memory, lock scanning (in which the auditor never worries about whether the preclearis in valence or not) and the running of locks are alternated until enough charge is off the caseso that the case comes naturally into its own valence and naturally runs its own physical pain.Fortunately, a case, no matter how badly out of valence it is, and no matter how heavythe circuits are, releases its own anaten in the form of yawns or boil-offs, even though it maynot release its own fear or tears. The valence sometimes has a relatively imperfect butnonetheless existing time track, and one can send a preclear who is in father is valence downfather’s time track, which will exist wherever father was in contact with the preclear. This trackcan actually be lock scanned, but this is a mechanism the auditor need not worry too muchabout.The auditor should understand the mechanisms of valence and circuits to understandwhat may be holding up his case and to understand and evaluate human behavior but a study ofthis chapter should impress upon the auditor that a valence or a circuit has to be heavily chargedin order to be highly operative and thus the resolution of cases which are chronically out ofvalence (such as the coffin case) or cases which are heavily control-circuited depends upon theresolution of charge. Charge can be gotten off a case in the form of locks and even secondariesby straight memory and lock scanning as well as by high affinity, reality and communication asa result of the association with the auditor or of strong present-time survival factors or pleasureor even of education, as will be witnessed in group discussions where the tone of a personquite often rises.Early in Dianetics, a tremendous amount of knowledge and skill was necessary in orderto handle circuits and valences. This was because engrams were being run before the case wassufficiently discharged to have engrams run upon it. Now that a better understanding can becommunicated to the auditor of what he is doing, now that the auditor can understand betterwhat is meant by charge and how to get rid of it, this enormous technology is not so necessaryto the auditor. However, he should have an understanding of it, since there will be those caseswhich would resolve much more rapidly if the auditor understood that all the preclear wasdoing was crying mama’s tears or obeying a circuit.One of the most blunt manifestations of circuits and charge in a case is what is called“prenatal visio.” There actually is a prenatal visio, but it is black: The blackness of the prenatal,when the individual is stuck in a prenatal engram, will actually blot out his visio. Because he isstuck in an engram, his sonic will be blotted out. But here in the matter of visio it should beunderstood that while cells and the theta body probably record light, there is no mechanismsave that of the imagination which is known to produce the pictures that come about with“prenatal visio.” “Prenatal visio” may consist of whole colored scenes, outside of mama. Or itmay consist simply in seeing sudden pictures go and come. A control circuit will produce“prenatal visio.” “Prenatal visio” is false and has no bearing upon reality and means simply thatthe case is heavily charged. It quite often happens that “prenatal visio” will turn on for amoment while a preclear is running an engram in the pre-natal period. The auditor shouldimmediately ask for a control phrase when this momentary manifestation of visio occurs. He211"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"will find some phrase such as “I see what you mean” or simply “Control yourself,” whichsomehow crosses the imagination into the factual bank.“Prenatal ESP” is another manifestation of charge and circuits. A circuit may existwhich says, “I know what you’re thinking about,” and when returned to its vicinity the preclearseems to get the thoughts of mother and father by ESP. Actually these “thoughts” arecomposites of phrases which occur in the reactive and standard banks of the preclear. Theremay well be extra-sensory perception, but “prenatal ESP” is false.There is an additional type of visio which the preclear gets that the auditor should knowabout, and this is not unlike the mirage which appears on the hot desert. A heavy boil-off; orheavy areas of anaten, may cause the preclear to drift off out of contact with reality and seescenes and even hear voices. These scenes and voices are quite disconnected, ordinarily. Thepreclear should never be interrupted when doing this. This is a sure symptom of a boil-off.Shortly (usually) this phase will pass and other perceptics of the engram will turn on. Thepreclear must always be permitted to go through such boil-off uninterruptedly, without beingjogged or shaken or spoken to, because things which happen while he in this condition becomerecorded, since he is close to being unconscious.Dreams seem to stem from this type of circumstance. The dream is usually an engramwhich reflects through the haze of anaten up to “I” by some by-pass route and is considerablydistorted on the way. The dream makes a great deal of sense when one has the engram. It evenmay enable one to find an engram which he would not otherwise suspect. But ordinarily, thistype of guess-work is unnecessary, since a case that dreams heavily is either low on VitaminB1 or heavy with charge.212"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTEENCOLUMN ALCondition of File ClerkAs elsewhere mentioned, there are apparently several entities or response mechanismsin the human mind. Chief among these for the auditor, if not of the highest rank, is the fileclerk.It is evident, upon examination, that the manifestations of aberration in general --valences, circuits, abilities of the mind and their distortions -depend upon the fact that theconstruction of the analytical mind contains, basically, the mechanisms which are subject toaberration by engrams. The reactive mind does not have the operating mechanisms necessaryto put engrams into effect beyond their content of entheta and physical pain. A person sufferingfrom a manic engram which tells him he is the greatest streetcar conductor in the world mayvery well perform as a great streetcar conductor. But it is the analytical mind which could besaid to contain the only potentiality for being a streetcar conductor. This potentiality is notincreased by the engram, but only enforced by it, to the exclusion of other abilities of theindividual. Relief of the engram makes it even more possible for the individual to be a greatstreetcar conductor, since the engram contains physical pain and unconsciousness, whichreduce analytical ability and thus make a person less able to perform. The control circuit canexist as a manifestation of an engram command only because the analytical mind possessesnatively the mechanism of control circuits. The “I,” as a part of its usual thought procedures,sets up and knocks down these control circuits at will. A whole series of circuits are set up byany new learning pattern, and these in turn compute independently of “I,” to drive anautomobile, for example. “I” gives little or no attention to many of the routine acts of the bodybut provides, through learning, circuits to handle these. Furthermore, “I,” in full control of theanalyzer, subdivides and makes up or breaks down compartments of the analyzer to care forvarious reasoning processes. The salesman, for instance, sets up a circuit to sell his product.The “I” of the salesman may be paying very little attention to what the selling circuit is sayingor doing while carrying out the routine sales talk. Thinking is so complex that circuits are verynecessary to care for various things about thinking. The cook ordinarily has many circuitswhich direct what she does with various dishes, while her “I” goes on planning on higherechelon policy or being amused by the radio.In the preceding chapter, the reason for valences was discussed.The imagination can be exaggerated or inhibited by engrams or charge and can actuallybe crossed into computive circuits by engrams or charge, but the imagination has to exist as ananalytical function, a native portion of the analytical mind, before an engram and entheta canaberrate it.Apparently, the main function of the file clerk is taking perceptic data, old conclusionsand imaginations, and other data from the standard memory banks and forwarding them to thelower echelon computers or to “I.” There are probably many attention units back along thestandard banks performing this function, since there are obviously many sub-computersoperating in any well functioning mind.The analytical mind that is in very good working order, which is to say, notmisinformed by the arbitrary data in engrams or suppressed by the entheta in the reactive mind,gets most of its answers on a flash response basis. The “stream of consciousness” of thefiction writer or the useless maundering of the individual who has a circuit which tells him hehas to “think things over very carefully” and who verbalizes endless conclusions to himself areusually the result of engrams and entheta. The file clerk, or his minions, still hand through to“I” that data which is valid and accurate. The transaction is done, ordinarily, in milliseconds.As the analytical mind becomes more and more shut down by entheta, more and more attention213"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"units are tied up or smothered. As this condition progressively worsens, the file clerk has moreand more difficulty passing data through to “I,” since he is beginning to have to send it throughcircuits, through valence walls, and on unlikely routes. Under such conditions themilliseconds stretch out not just to seconds or minutes but to as much as three days. In amediumly aberrated person the file clerk has to receive the order and return the answer throughso much entheta and over so many circuitous routes that one “has to think” to remembersomething and may, indeed, suddenly receive the data requested yesterday this morning at teno’clock, completely unrelated to anything one is doing at the time.As a case becomes even more suppressed by entheta and the analyzer even morecompartmented from the same cause, the file clerk becomes only a faint echo. Memory isconsidered to be “very bad,” the individual reaches his conclusions very slowly.When the individual has dropped below 2.0, not only does the file clerk, as such, ceaseto exist for the individual, but the data begins to be passed back and forth by substitute enthetafile clerks. The real file clerk is still there, but he is so suppressed that his functions areusurped. Thus, the receipt of data and the conclusions of an individual below 2.0 on the tonescale may be astonishing, to say the least. Not only is his analyzer cut down to a point where itcomputes instinctively in the direction of succumbing even though that direction may bemasked, but the data on which the computation is done is mis-selected and distorted by enthetaengramic selectors and storers. One might even go so far as to say that the individual below 2.0fished most of his data from his engram bank rather than from his standard memory bank.It is remarkable that in even a heavily aberrated individual who is amnesia-tranced orheavily sedated (and don’t try these things in processing, since they would result in a muchfurther enturbulence and aberration of the preclear) the calm and serene basic personality maybe discovered, and the file clerk, deeply buried but now revealed, may be found to be still ingood working condition. But so few attention units remain in basic personality, even though itcontains the fundamentals of what this person would be if cleared, that this should beconsidered only as a comment and not as anything useful in processing. It is stated merely tobring home the fact to the auditor that the file clerk does not die or vanish even in the psychotic,even though the auditor may feel this when he is working with the severely aberrated.The file clerk normally gives answers which contain specific data rather than answerswhich require computation. For instance, one can ask the file clerk any question which can beanswered by yes or no with fair confidence, above 1.5, and receive the reply. Further, the fileclerk will give data on time, in terms of days of the week, dates of the month, months or years,to locate the preclear or an incident on the time track. Furthermore, the file clerk will offer upthe names of things or of people or of chains when they are asked for. Or the file clerk, if theconclusion exists elsewhere in the mind, will forward through to the auditor the wordedconclusion as to what should be done with the case.The ordinary use of the file clerk is very simple. The auditor merely asks, “yes or no:are you stuck in birth?” (snap!). The reply will be yes or no. The terms in which the auditordesires his reply should be stated first. Thus the auditor says “Yes or no” before he asks thequestion. He would also say “Date” before he names the occurrence. And each time he wouldfollow the question with a snap. Common, careless mistakes consist of reversing thisprocedure, so that the file clerk receives the “yes or no” after the question. In an ordinarilyaberrated person the file clerk may simply echo “yes or no.” Another but ridiculous error is tosnap before the question is fully asked. The snap is the sound impulse which drives theanswers through the circuits. To snap before the question is complete is to have no data to drivethrough the circuits.The file clerk must be handled with complete regard to the auditor’s code. It actuallyoccurs that the file clerk in a relatively heavily charged case may work perfectly for one auditorwho has high ARC with the preclear but may not work at all with an auditor who has slightlylower ARC with the preclear. This applies, of course, only to those cases which are below 2.0.214"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"The snap impulse seems necessary in most cases. There are cases which objectseriously to the auditor snapping his fingers. These cases are restimulated by the sound of thesnap, and a little straight wire usually finds the source of the objection. However, the auditorshould not throw his hand toward the preclear when he snaps his fingers, as this is veryrestimulative to any preclear who has been slapped. The motion of the hand toward anindividual, if done suddenly, is uniformly evaluated as a hostile gesture. Just as the auditorshould keep his feet off the couch or bed or its baseboards, should refrain from touching thepreclear save when the preclear in distress wishes to hold his hand, so should the auditor useall courtesy with regard to the file clerk.The file clerk should never under any circumstances be invalidated. He should not beasked questions one way and then another, as though the auditor doubted the first reply. Theexception to this is the low-tone case which has a built-in circuit that responds to age questions.This the file clerk can evidently appreciate. But a very questioning attitude on the part of anauditor may well silence the file clerk.There is a great deal to be said on both sides of reality. The file clerk may be validatedby interested and satisfied reception of his data by the auditor, and can be invalidated by raisedeyebrows or shrugs on the auditor’s part. The preclear, in the middle bands, quite commonlydistrusts his file clerk and will do enough invalidating himself. But when the precleardiscovers that the auditor is accepting these answers, the preclear ceases this practice.Just as a general observation in the field of working with the file clerk and the preclear,an auditor can rush a case which is in the middle or low bands of the tone scale and begin toaudit with such energy that the preclear is enturbulated and sometimes sinks considerably intone. Similarly, the file clerk and the preclear become annoyed and restless in the presence ofan apathetic or uninterested auditor, one who will doze when a long chain of locks is beingscanned, or one who will ask questions of the file clerk only when the preclear himselfdemands it. Too furious an interest, then, and too small an interest affect not only the file clerkbut the general working of the case. The auditor must learn to adjust himself and his mood notonly to the type of incident the preclear is running and to the personality of the preclear but alsoto the position on the tone scale of the preclear. The lower on the tone scale the preclear is, themore gentle, patient, and understanding must be the auditor. Even low on the tone scale, apreclear may have a file clerk that occasionally works, and this occasionality can, by validationof the file clerk, be coaxed forth to a steady response. But if the auditor is less gentle andefficient than he should be, then the occasional workability of the file clerk will cease.Nothing shuts off a file clerk or a preclear faster than ineptness. A few errors can becondoned, but continual fumbling and uncertainty can cause a file clerk to give up and canproduce a similar reaction in the preclear.Rather amusingly, in the Foundation there was a spell of deification of the file clerk andother entities that had been discovered in the mind. The overall result was that auditors startedtalking to these entities rather than to the preclear. This tended to invalidate the preclear as anindividual. The preclear is entitled to his opinions and is the focus of attention. The file clerkand other entities are simply, one supposes, portions of the analytical function of the mind. Atone time the auditor form of address became “Mr. File Clerk,” and the file clerk was thankedfor every flash answer.This kind of courtesy is evidently not particularly needed by the file clerk, but now andthen the auditor will find himself working with a response mechanism in the mind which isvery insistent upon courtesy and protocol. The auditor is not in this instance working with thefile clerk, since the file clerk is a rugged mechanism with little to say and a brief way of sayingit. But this does not mean that another entity should not be accepted.Now and then the auditor will become concerned as to whether he is talking to the fileclerk or to a demon circuit. His preclear would have to be fairly low on the tone scale in orderto make this confusion possible. Demon circuits will actually respond, but they do not respond215"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"with the quick flash and simplicity of the file clerk. Now and then one will run into a real audiodemon circuit which is highly insulting to the auditor, for demon circuits are both stupid andunmannerly. The moment the auditor finds himself addressing such a circuit he does well topay it no further attention and accept no further replies from it, because additional attention tothis entheta form serves to validate it for the preclear, if not to strengthen the form itself: Eventhough these demon circuits are amusing, the auditor should limit his attention to them, since alladdress in this direction is wasted effort. The auditor should merely know that such a thing canhappen so that he will not be surprised if, as it rarely occurs, a demon circuit gets in his way.The sharpness and accuracy of a file clerk declines as the case descends the tone scale.Generally, the more entheta there is on a case, the less reliable is the file clerk. This normallydoes not become serious until the case is down to 2.0. After that, the condition of the file clerknot only becomes poor, but manifestations of the file clerk around 1.1 and 0.5 are such that nocredence can be placed in them by the auditor. One will now and then encounter a preclear whogives “file clerk” answers, according to the preclear. The auditor should already recognizewhere his preclear lies on the tone scale before he begins processing, but even so the auditormay now and then be surprised by a “file clerk” who gives very extraordinary responses. “Fileclerks” have been reported by preclears which gave their yes-and-no answers as visible trafficsignals. On the flash response, the signal arm would rise with a yes or a no sometimescomplete with red or green light. Or a “file clerk” may be reported by the preclear as a pair ofhands that deal playing cards on which are written yes and no. Or as in one case the “file clerk”may be a toy railroad train which comes swinging by, stops and turns up a dump car with yesor no painted on the bottom. These “file clerks” are not file clerks at all but circuit mechanismscustomarily found in very heavily charged cases which have a great deal of control circuitry.There is something about this control circuitry that turns on visio. Possibly it is becausethe imagination runs on a relatively self-controlled basis and because a control circuit canswitch on imagination. However that may be, these mechanical devices and othermanifestations when the auditor wants an answer from the true file clerk are symptomatic ofcases low on the tone scale. The answers of these mechanisms should not be trusted.There are heavily entheta’d cases in which the file clerk always responds “yes-no” or“no-yes.” Here again too much charge inhibits the auditor’s use of the file clerk.Unless the auditor can get a clear and authentic, even if occasional, response from thefile clerk, he should not attempt to work with the file clerk. Here is the most certain andautomatic division of types of processing to be used which the auditor can have: Does thepreclear have a working file clerk? If the preclear does, then straight memory, lock scanningand secondaries are usually workable.If the file clerk does not respond, or responds unreliably or with some strangemechanism, the auditor should limit his processing as a general rule to straight memory, verylight lock scanning, and possibly fear secondaries, but avoid grief or apathy. If the file clerk’sresponse is strong and accurate, engrams can probably be run on the case.These comments will give the auditor a quick, jackleg diagnosis, if for some reason hewishes to work with a case for a short time as a demonstration or an assist and yet does nothave a chart at hand or the time to locate his preclear on the chart. The auditor should alwayslocate his preclear on the chart as accurately as possible if he is taking on a case for any term ofprocessing more than a short session.216"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTEENCOLUMN AMHypnotic LevelIt is pertinent to case estimation whether or not the preclear is highly suggestible or canbe hypnotized.Hypnotism is an address to the reactive mind. It reduces self-determinism byinterposing the commands of another below the analytical level of an individual’s mind; itenturbulates a case markedly, and materially aberrates human beings by keying-in engramswhich would otherwise lie dormant. It is the sort of control mechanism in which anauthoritarian individual, cult, or ideology delight. People who indulge in hypnotism may, onlyvery occasionally, be interested in experimentation on the human mind to learn more about themind. Genuine experimental hypnotism, strictly in the laboratory and never in the parlor, anddone wholly in the knowledge that one is reducing the efficiency of the human being on whomone is experimenting and may do him permanent damage, and the use of hypnotism by asurgeon for an operation, but not in company with any other anaesthetic, should end theextension of hypnotism into the society.Submission to being hypnotized is analogous to being raped, with the exception that theindividual can, generally, recover from being raped. To any clear-thinking human who believesin the value of people as human beings, there is something gruesomely obscene abouthypnotism. The interjection of unseen controls below the level of consciousness cannot benefitbut can only pervert the mind. It does not matter if the hypnotist tells his subject that he isgoing to be better at his job or that he will be healthier. Whatever the apparent attemptedbeneficence may be, the individual who would permit himself to be hypnotized is, frankly, afool. Hypnotism, in common use, is simply a dramatization of some individual desiring covertcontrol over his fellow human beings.Hypnotism, by an investigation of it and its uses in the society, has been demonstratedto be much more widespread than was ever before suspected, since prior to dianetic processingthere was no method known to man by which the damage of hypnotism could be undone. Itwas thought by hypnotists that the mere remembering of these suggestions would relieve them,and that the power of the suggestion died out with time. These two ideas do not happen to betrue. The hypnotic suggestion has to be run as a very heavy deposit of entheta, nearly as heavyas a secondary engram, and it is thoroughly permanent until relieved by dianetic processing andis subject to restimulation just like any engram or secondary.Of course, the surgeon or dentist who permits any unnecessary conversation orperceptics to exist in the anaesthetized patient’s environ is practicing a brand of hypnotismmuch more serious, long-lasting, and savage than ordinary hypnotism, which does not includephysical pain or hypnotic drugs. In having dianetic processing demonstrated to them, surgeonswho knew their patients were unconscious and knew that no recording was taking place areastonished when these same patients, under auditing, play back the conversation the surgeonwell remembers having used, and describe in tremendous detail operations of which, lackingtechnical training, they could have had no knowledge. The medical doctor and dentist forgetthat anaesthetics came into general use only late in the last century and are definitely newcomersin the medical field and that not very much is known, or was known, about them. Consideredin this light, it should be less astonishing that they did not know what was happening to apatient under anaesthesia, since neither has man had much data about anaesthesia itself.The obstetrician whose patient after delivery suffers from a post-partum psychosiscringes when he discovers that it was his words, spoken over the obviously unconscious girl,which laid into her mind the command that causes her to abhor the child and to attempt to kill itten days after delivery. It is difficult to get a human being to accept responsibility of this217"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"magnitude since it is so appalling what can be done in the operating room. Obscene jokes, andcrass, derogatory personal remarks about the patient are the common conversation in theoperating theaters of America today. Surgery should not be censured for this, since dianeticprocessing and the knowledge of the consequences of noise and talking and even music aroundthe anaesthetized patient were not released until last year (1950). More and more hospitals inthe United States, now cognizant of the harm which can be done, are training their surgeonsinto silence around anaesthetized patients and offering severe penalties for any conversation inoperating rooms. So medicine at least is trying. However, the individual who knowsDianetics should not be shy or fall back from invalidation by the doctor when a friend or lovedone is going to lie on an operating table. For one can afford a few set-backs, invalidations orrebukes from some behind-the-times doctor if it means that one’s friend or loved one will getwell much more swiftly and will show no greatly increased level of aberration or descent on thetone scale because of the operation or exodontistry. You will yet live to see the time, not manyyears off, when a criminal charge will be placed against anyone speaking in the vicinity of anunconscious person. The regular intake of sedatives such as phenobarbital causes the individualto walk around in a light hypnotic trance. The drug itself may not be very harmful to thenervous system, but this light trance makes it possible for the person to be keyed in byanything and everything around him despite the fact that under sedation he does not apparentlynotice it. Sedation of the neurotic or psychotic is a very dangerous practice. If one must dosomething by way of drugs for these people, better effects, according to medical observation,can be achieved by the administration of stimulants such as benzedrine. For some reason orother, probably because in a low-tone society individuals under thorough control excite lessfear, sedation is considered less harmful. The stimulant is somehow considered to be tooenergizing, and medical doctors seem to prescribe sedatives much more rapidly than they willprescribe stimulants. Investigation of literature and consultation with accurate medicalobservation demonstrate that the individual shows less active aberration under mild stimulants.Below a certain point on the tone scale, of course, sedatives are administered in the hope thatthe patient will then cause the doctor, nurse or others around him less trouble, and are notadministered in any hope or belief that they will in any way aid the patient. Actually, a fewhours of lock scanning on any case will do more for his “nervousness” than a barrel ofphenobarbital.There is another form of hypnotism which falls between the surgical operation andstraight hypnotism without physical pain. This form of hypnotism has been a carefully guardedsecret of certain military and intelligence organizations. It is a vicious war weapon and may beof considerably more use in conquering a society than the atom bomb. This is no exaggeration.The extensiveness of the use of this form of hypnotism in espionage work is so wide today thatit is long past the time when people should have become alarmed about it. It required dianeticprocessing to uncover pain-drug-hypnosis. Otherwise, pain-drug-hypnosis was out of sight,unsuspected, and unknown.Pain-drug-hypnosis is a wicked extension of narco-synthesis, the drug hypnosis usedin America only during and since the last war.Hypnotism has the virtue, at first at least, of requiring the consent of the hypnoticsubject before the hypnotism is done. Further, hypnotism has an additional virtue over drughypnosis and over pain-drug-hypnosis, in that an individual in a hypnotic trance will rarelyperform an immoral act even though commanded to do so by the hypnotist, unless thatindividual would normally perform such acts.Drug hypnotism does not have to be done with the individual’s consent. An individualwho is drugged can receive and will obey hypnotic commands given to him by the doctor oroperator and will continue to obey these commands after waking from the drugged sleep. Byusing the method of dropping a heavy sedative such as chloral hydrate into an individual’sdrink, by suddenly muzzling him with a silk scarf from behind and injecting morphine into hisarm, or by discovering the individual when he is drunk or shortly after he has been operatedupon or during an operation, or during the administration of electric shock or sedation in aninsane asylum, drug hypnosis can be induced. Thereafter, the operator works much as in218"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"ordinary hypnotism. Drug hypnosis can be administered with such wording that the patientwill not only forget what he has been told and yet perform it, but will also forget that he hasever been given drug hypnosis, if that command is included, and he may even be given data toaccount for the time during which he was given the hypnosis. Drug hypnotism, then, can bedone without the consent of the subject and is commonly so done even by doctors in the normalcourse of practice. There is nothing new or strange about drug hypnosis. It occasionally failsto work as the operator intends, and it does not usually strike against the individual’s normalmoral tone save that, of course, it inevitably lowers him on the tone scale, thus bringing about atendency to generally lowered morals. But pain-drug-hypnosis, due mainly to the intent of theoperator, is a much more vicious procedure.It has been discovered that a drugged individual when beaten and given orders wouldalmost invariably obey those orders regardless of the degree to which they flouted his moraltone or his position or his best interests in life.Before Dianetics, the widespread use of this practice was unsuspected, simply becausethere was no means by which one could even detect the existence of pain-drug-hypnosis. Anindividual might be given pain-drug-hypnosis on Tuesday night and wake up Wednesdaymorning without knowledge of the fact that he had been slugged when he stepped out of hiscar, given an injection, painfully beaten but not so as to leave any marks, and put quietly intohis own bed. This individual does not know that anything unusual has happened to him norwill he suspect it even when he is confronted with the fact that his conduct is extremelychanged along certain lines. This individual, if the criminal operator desired it, would actuallyobey the commands to the point of striking up a friendship with some person the operatorindicated, thereafter conducting his business along lines suggested by this “friend.”The Foundation undertook some tests with regard to the effectiveness of pain-drug-hypnosis and found it so appallingly destructive to the personality and so unfailing in its action,save in cases of individuals with theta endowment far beyond that of the normal man, that awider investigation was undertaken, to discover just how many people one could find withineasy reach who had been given pain-drug-hypnosis. Pain-drug-hypnosis is so effectivelydestructive that the Foundation has ceased experimentation along this line, having alreadylearned enough and refusing to endanger the sanity of individuals. Psychotherapists withwhom the Foundation has dealt have been eager to plant an engram in a patient and have theFoundation recover it, to see how many of the perceptics are recoverable. The Foundation willaccept no further experiments in this line and informs experimenters that they do this at theirown grave risk. A much more natural and valid validation of engrams can be done without theuse of drugs.A knowledge of engrams and the fact that people can be aberrated into becoming insaneor criminal by the existence of engrams should be validation enough for the fact that pain-drug-hypnosis can be done without the knowledge of the individual and can command him to dothings which are not only counter to his own survival but highly immoral or destructive. Thyhypnotic level of these individuals is directly proportional to the ratio of entheta on the case.Hypnotism deals in entheta. not in reason. The implantation is made directly into the reactivemind. The more entheta or charge the reactive mind contains the more easily implantations maybe made to work and the more easily the person may be hypnotized. Each hypnosisenturbulates to a slightly greater degree and entraps and encysts more theta into entheta in themind of the hypnotic subject. Continual and repeated hypnotism, simply by continuing toconvert more and more free theta into entheta, causes the individual to descend the tone scale.The manic effect of a manic hypnotic command has a limited duration, but the lowering of toneit produces is permanent, in the absence of dianetic processing.Hypnotism further, acts as a key-in of many engrams and a restimulation of locks andsecondaries, and thus increases the aberration of the hypnotic subject by approximating thewords in engrams and secondaries, at a time of lowered or absent analytical awareness.219"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The auditor should realize, then, what hypnotism does to a case (1) so that he will notuse hypnotism and (2) so that he will pick up out of the case all hypnotic commands as one ofhis first orders of business.The patter of hypnotism goes somewhat as follows: “You are relaxing. You are sinkingdown, down, down (which sends the subject down the time track, although the hypnotistdidn’t know it). You are getting sleepier and sleepier. All you can hear now is the sound of myvoice telling you to go to sleep (which installs a circuit). You want to believe everything I amtelling you (which cuts down the ability of the subject to evaluate data). Everything I say to youwill make a deep and lasting impression on you. When you wake up you will discover thatyou feel very light and airy. You will want to be kind to people. Any time in the future that Isay the word ‘Abracadabra’ you will go into a hypnotic trance, no matter where you are orwhat you are doing. You want to do exactly as I tell you to do. I am your friend. I am the bestfriend you have. When you wake up and I touch my necktie, you will take off your left shoe.When I put my hands in my pockets, you will put your left shoe back on and explain youractions (the subject would, anyway; this is a post hypnotic suggestion, and the subject when hewakens will perform this act at the operator’s signal). You will now forget everything I havesaid to you during this session. You do not want to remember. The harder you try toremember, the more you will forget. As I count from one to seven, your memory of thisincident will grow less and less and finally will vanish. One, you are beginning to forget. Two,you are forgetting a little more. Three, you are forgetting more. Four, its more than halfforgotten. Five, it is becoming very dim. Six, it is just a dim, dim dream. Seven, now shakeyour head and the facts will all fall out.”This is rather typical patter. It varies somewhat and the phrases are often repeated manytimes. The auditor who knows that hypnotic patter is more or less like this can, when he isreaching for it, cause the preclear to repeat these phrases, or phrases like them, or get thephrases from the file clerk -- which is the reliable way to do it -- and so, by knocking out theforgetter mechanism at the end, or knocking out an idiotic statement like “shake your head andthe facts will all fall out,” he may restore to the preclear considerable memory not only of theincident but of his life in general.When drugs are added to hypnotism the amount of entheta is considerably increased,but the drug effect will come off in processing in the form of boil-off (which is covered underRelative Entheta on Case).When an auditor finds his preclear unusually suggestive, he should be very carefulwhat he says to the preclear. He may notice that a preclear after he closes his eyes will begin toflutter his eyelids. This is a symptom of the very lightest level of hypnotic trance. The auditorcannot avoid processing the case, but he should be careful to use language quite unlikehypnotic suggestions and be certain at the end of the processing session to scan off theauditing.There is very little the auditor can do besides straight wire with a case which goes intoan hypnotic trance each time a command is given to close the eyes. Returning back down thetrack slightly increases the suggestibility of any person. There is no harm in this except duringboil-offs. During a boil-off, remarks which are made to the preclear may be forgotten and lost,thus becoming hypnotic suggestions. All sessions, therefore, should be scanned out withparticular attention to any period when the preclear was boiling off. The auditor may find apreclear who insists on being drugged or hypnotized in order to be audited, as a dramatizationof some past command. If this preclear insists on being hypnotized, the auditor can be certainthat hypnotism exists in this case, whether or not the preclear has any recollection of it.Hypnotism is general in our society, and a request for hypnotism is a dramatization ofhypnotism. Further, the percentage of people who remember that they have been hypnotized orhow many times is very slight.Hypnotism has been a parlor game, the tool of the pervert, the command assertion ofthe authoritarian, and is more general than one would immediately suspect, as the auditor willdiscover after he has processed a few cases. He should not be surprised at what he finds in a220"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"hypnotic incident, since the facts may differ entirely from what the hypnotist told the subjecthad taken place. A motto one could use is “Never believe a hypnotist.”In dianetic processing we used to use what was called a “canceller.” At the beginning ofthe session, the preclear was told that anything which had been said to him during the sessionwould be cancelled when the word “cancelled” was uttered at the end of the session. Thiscanceller is no longer employed, not because it was not useful but because lock-scanningprovides the means of scanning off all the auditing. This is a far more effective and positivemechanism than the canceller. In scanning old auditing off cases, the auditor will occasionallyfind that the preclear cannot recover what the auditor said. The reason for this is that thecanceller has acted as a forgetter mechanism and has closed off the auditor. Merely usingrepeater technique, which is to say the standard words of the canceller said over a few times,will bring the preclear into contact with the first canceller in the case, and the consequentcancellers will then have no great aberrative effect.It should be remarked about hypnotism that the early hypnotic session is the more validone, even if it is cancelled by a later hypnotic session. The mere command in a later hypnosisthat the early hypnosis does not exist will do nothing to render the early hypnosis less effective,but it will only make the subject forget it more thoroughly. And the commands of the earlierincident will still be accepted over those of the later. This is the way all engrams work.However, in unburdening hypnotic sessions from a case, sometimes one has to start with thelatest session and work back because of the amount of entheta entrapped in the last sessions,which, being the latest of a long line, will be found to be very aberrative to the case.221"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEENCOLUMN ANLevel of Mind AlertIt could be postulated that there are actually several levels of mind function. Forpurposes of analogy and the communication of the technology of processing, we use,generally, simply the reactive mind and the analytical mind. The analytical mind would be thatpart of the being which perceives when the individual is awake or in normal sleep (for sleep isnot unconsciousness, and anything the individual has perceived while he was asleep isrecorded in the standard memory banks and is relatively easy for the auditor to recover.) Thestandard memory banks, then, would be recordings of everything perceived throughout thelifetime up to present time by the individual except physical pain, which is not recorded in theanalytical mind but is recorded in the reactive mind. The analytical mind would have,additionally, recordings of its conclusions at the time it perceived certain things in theenvironment. conclusions in the analytical mind are taken from observation and experiencesand education adjusted to the environment of present time and the future. conclusions andperceptics are filed by time and topic. The computive mechanism of the analytical mind works,evidently, on the basis of comparison of data and evaluation in terms of differences. Thebrightness of the analytical mind consists first of its ability to record perceptions in theenvironment; next, of its ability to recall them either to review memory or to bring about newcomputations; third, to compare and evaluate data for purposes of optimum survival along anyor all of the dynamics; fourth, its ability to refile the conclusions so reached; fifth, its ability tosummate and compare those conclusions as needed in further computation. The analytical mindwould also contain the imagination, which either creates new realities out of whole cloth, orpatches them together out of old bits and pieces of experience. The function of the imaginationis to postulate goals, foresee obstacles toward them, and give definite shape to present andfuture environments. The analytical mind also records, in company with conclusions, allimaginings and compares and re-imagines these as an aid to optimum survival.Uninfluenced by arbitrary data, the analytical mind theoretically is capable of perfectcomputation at all times. The data on which it computes may be erroneous, but the computeritself is right. An adding machine gets right answers so long as it is used, unless there issomething wrong with the operator or with the machine itself. As the analytical mind is its ownoperator, in looking for errors, then, one must examine the sources of data. The standardmemory banks have erroneous data in them only on an educational basis. Consider an addingmachine which added an extra five into every column without the knowledge of the operator.Each time the operator added five to five he would get fifteen. When he added twenty to ten hewould get thirty-five. In the case of a multiplying machine, if the machine multiplied by anadditional five each time a product was required of it, the operator when he multiplied twotimes ten would get one hundred, when he multiplied one times five he would get twenty-five.In each case, the error in the machine is the addition of a hidden arbitrary. If one were doingsubtraction, and the machine always subtracted five more than the operator called for, whenfive was subtracted from ten, the operator would get zero. When ten was subtracted fromtwenty, the operator would get five. In the case of division, if a machine divided by one morethan the operator desired, when the operator punched out five into thirty, he would get aquotient of five. When he punched out three into twelve, he would get a quotient of three.Here, unseen and hidden errors, lying below the observable mechanical level of the machineand out of the operator’s knowledge, would, by injecting hidden numbers into sums andmultiplications, subtractions and divisions, produce wrong answers.The analytical mind is continually subjected, in an aberrated individual, to thesearbitrary data. The individual is unaware of the existence of these data since these data arriveinto the reactive mind at a time when the analytical mind is unconscious. The analytical minddid not perceive or record the fact that the data came in and it is, then, not aware of the fact that222"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"the data exists. Thus, the analytical mind can be subjected to hidden arbitraries, which obsessor compel it or inhibit it from making correct conclusions.The purpose of the analytical mind is to be right and never to be wrong. A person whois generally more right than wrong survives. A person who is more wrong than rightsuccumbs. It is not until the analytical mind is almost completely shut down, as at 2.0 andbelow, that the direction toward succumbing is taken, since the analytical mind is not present insufficient force to take the course of survival in the face of the arbitrary data forced upon it bythe reactive mind.The reactive mind is the composite of entheta on the case. The analytical mind wouldbe the sum of reasoning theta. The total content of the reactive mind consists of locks,secondaries, and engrams. These contain phrases which are capable of considerably derangingcomputation and imagination. Enforced by the physical pain portion of the engram, thesearbitrary data have command power on the analytical mind. The analytical mind, resisting thiscommand power, will force the pain to turn against the body, producing chronic somatics,which compare to rheumatism, bad hearts, migraine headaches, malfunction of the endocrinesystem, and other undesirable characteristic chronic somatics. Theoretically the analytical mindhas as part of its ability, when it is working freely, command over any part of the organism.This is true at least when the analytical mind works via the somatic mind. The somatic mindwould be that mind which takes care of the automatic mechanisms of the body, the regulationof the minutiae which keep the organism running. Here is a vast system of valves andmeterings. However, the reactive mind can work against the analytical and somatic minds toenforce and inhibit all these regulative functions and throw them out of adjustment, bringingabout various non-optimum physical conditions.As has been stated, other levels of mind can be postulated. One could consider as manyas eight or ten mind levels. The somatic mind level would be that which concerned body cells.These seem to run on a theta-MEST union which gives to each cell an organism life of its own.Science for many years believed that the life of the whole organism was only the composite lifeof the cells. This is extremely unworkable, and the discovery of the point field of energy of thebody by recent scientific workers gave the most precise kind of evidence as to the existence ofan overall organism life. A body composed simply of cells, each one with a life of its own,would not have a point field. The overall organism, however, does have a point field. Here isa measurable aura which evidently is in addition to and, according to work in Dianetics,independent of the cellular life of the body. In other words, there is evidently a theta body,capable of its own independent survival, superimposed on the organism. The departure of thistheta body marks the point of organism death. The organism, however, still contains life. Thecellular organism survives, as concerns the least independent cells, eight to ten minutes, or asin the case of highly independent cells, upwards of a year. In other words, there is a separationof the organism body and the theta body, according to these postulates and observations, andthen ensuing death to the cellular life of the organism body.The somatic level could, then, be considered a low mind form, for these cells havecertain responsive actions and habit patterns of their own, and their overall network oforganization is below the level of rational thought. Next would be the reactive mind, that typeof mind which predominates in most lower forms of life. The reactive mind learns by physicalpain, and thinks in identities, and reacts by absolute authoritarian command. It carries theorganism up to 2.0 on the tone scale. From 2.0 down on the tone scale, nearly all thinking isstimulus-response, the type of thinking which some authoritarians would have liked us tobelieve was all the thinking of which man was capable.The analytical mind comes more and more into command of the organism as the tonescale is ascended. Of course, it occurs in all human beings, even those below 2.0, that someanalytical activity remains. But from 2.0 down, this analytical activity is normally used forjustification of the organism’s reactive actions. From 2.0 up, the analytical mind is more andmore in control of its own organism, and computes more and more along optimum levels ofthinking, which is to say it becomes more and more reasonable. By the time 4.0 is reached, the223"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"free theta with which the person is endowed is able to circulate freely through the thoughtstructure possessed by the person (and by thought structure is not meant, necessarily, physicalstructure).Many more mind levels apparently exist above the analytical level. There is, forinstance, clear evidence that there is an aesthetic mind level, which is probably immediatelyabove the analytical mind level. The aesthetic mind would be that mind which, by an interplayof the dynamics, deals with the nebulous field of art and creation. It is a strange thing that theshut-down of the analytical mind and the aberration of the reactive mind may still leave in fairlygood working order the aesthetic mind. The aesthetic mind is not much influenced by theposition on the tone scale, but as it evidently has to employ the analytical, reactive, and somaticminds in the creation of art and art forms, the amount of aberration of the individual greatlyinhibits the ability of the aesthetic mind to execute. A person with a great deal of theta as aninitial endowment may be potentially a powerful musician by reason of his aesthetic mind. Theaesthetic mind, evidently, attempts to execute music through the existing media of the analyticaland reactive minds, through both the analytical power of the individual and the aberrations ofthe individual. The more theta, whether in terms of free theta or entheta, an individual has, themore forceful will be his demonstration of all factors, both analytical and reactive. Becauseindividuals who are very heavily endowed with theta seek to control enormous quantities ofMEST and other organisms, they are fought hard by organisms exercising their own self-determinism. Thus, a person of great theta endowment picks up more numerous and heavierlocks and secondaries than persons of smaller endowment. This is not because more theta isthere to enturbulate, but because there is more counterattack against the individual. Theaesthetic mind, according to theory, attempting to bring about art forms, uses all the theta.It was once thought that it was absolutely necessary for an artist to be neurotic. Lackingthe ability to do anything about neurosis, like Aesop’s fox who had no tail and tried to persuadethe other foxes to cut theirs off, frustrated mental pundits glorified what they could not preventor cure. Silly little books on the subject of how fortunate was the crazy person were offered injustification of this defeatism and helplessness.Aesthetics and the aesthetic mind are both highly nebulous so far as our presentunderstanding of them is concerned. But this is known, that any creative artist, as he descendsdown the tone scale, becomes less and less able to execute creative impulses and at lastbecomes unable to contact his creative impulses. By dianetic processing, we take a currentlysuccessful but heavily aberrated artist and we bring him up the tone scale. We can observe thathis ability to execute what he conceives and the clarity with which he conceives it both increasevery markedly. His aesthetic ideas do not become conservative or humdrum but become oftenwider and more complex. He becomes more himself and better able to do what he can in thefield of aesthetics. The only modification of this is that as he rises up the tone scale he adoptsgreater scope and robustness in his work. The art form with which he is working and hismethod of handling it might have demonstrated considerable aberration, as measured by thecasual observer. His paintings might have been strange and creepy, or his music hauntinglymorbid. His art form, as he rises up the tone scale, evidently alters little except to increase inforce of execution and deftness of communication. The morbidity in his music, if it did notdepend on how sad he was personally with life, does not disappear. But as he rises on the tonescale, he is no longer fixed at a position where he must paint strange and creepy paintings orwrite morbid music. His versatility increases. The author who can write only one book of onekind with one tone is not, frankly, much of an author.The artist laughed himself into very short breath over the fumblings and mumblings ofthe many warring camps of mental therapy when they confronted aesthetics. Some of themeven assumed that they could judge the mental state of an author by reviewing his writings.This is somewhat on the order of a snail giving his opinion of the Parthenon by crawlingthrough its reliefs. As an illustration, any able composer or author can write in many aestheticforms and can approximate with his work any level of the tone scale. No artist attempting tointerpret life is worthy of being called an artist unless he can view almost in the same sweepboth apathy and exhilaration. A good poet can cheerfully write a poem gruesome enough to224"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"make strong men cringe, or he can write verses happy enough to make the weeping laugh.Any able composer can write music either covert enough to make the sadist wriggle withdelight or open enough to rejoice the greatest souls. The artist works with life and withuniverses. He can deal with any level of communication. He can create any reality. He canenhance or inhibit any affinity. The aesthetics have very much to do with the tone scale andwith the interweaving of the various dynamics and urges along these dynamics into harmoniouspatterns random enough and artful enough to accomplish what the artist intends to accomplish.The artist has an enormous role in the enhancement of today’s and the creation of tomorrow’sreality. He operates in a rank in advance of science as to the necessities and requirements ofman. The elevation of a culture can be measured directly by the numbers of its people workingin the field of aesthetics. A society which in any way inhibits, suppresses, or regiments itsartists is a society not only low on the tone scale but most certainly doomed. A totalitarian state,following its usual line of perversion of truth, talks endlessly and raucously about itssubsidization of the artist. But it subsidizes only those artists who are willing to work for thestate exactly as the state dictates. It regiments the artist and prescribes what he will do and whathe will write and what he will think.This is in direct controversion to the function of the artist in a society. Because theartist deals in future realities, he always seeks improvements or changes in the existing reality.This makes the artist, inevitably and invariably, a rebel against the status quo. The artist, dayby day, by postulating the new realities of the future, accomplishes peaceful revolution. Ithappens, however, that democracies and other forms of government are prone to overlook therole of the artist in the society. In the United States, for instance, the artist may write one greatbook or make a great motion picture or compose one great symphony and may achieve, all in amoment, the bulk of the gains of his lifetime. His whole dedication, from childhood, mighthave been toward the creation of this one great work, and yet democracy, avidly taxing itspowerfully creative individuals into non-production, snatches from the artist any such fruits ofvictory and exacts an enormous penalty for the creation of any work of art. One of the greatestsingle moves which could be made to advance and vitalize a culture such as America would beto free, completely, the artist. from all taxes and similar oppressions, and thus attract into thearts the most ambitious and able and invite them to pursue unchecked the creation of all thebeauty and glory on which any culture depends if it would have material wealth. The artistinjects the theta into the culture, and without that theta the culture becomes reactive.This dissertation on the function of the artist is given at this place partly because itshould be said and partly because the auditor should understand that the impulse to create andconstruct surmounts the merely rational and reactive fields of reason. Further, the auditor mayoccasionally have to defend Dianetics against the strange, neurotic belief that when an artistbecomes less neurotic he becomes less able. Some artists, regrettably, have been educated tothis belief and so, by this very education, seek to act in their private and public lives in anintensely aberrated fashion in order to prove that they are artists. The education to this effect issuch that the auditor can commonly discover some young girl in the field of the arts living like aprostitute in order to convince herself and her friends that she is truly artistic.In the early days of Rome, art was fairly good. The Christian revolted against Romandisregard for human life. When the Christian revolted he did the reactive computation that hewas revolting against the Romans. He condemned everything that was Roman as bad, and forfifteen hundred years it was an evil thing to take a bath, because the Romans had bathed.Unfortunately, although the Catholic Church recovered early and began to appreciate the artist,this was not true of some of the early religions which came to America. These were still in fullrevolt against anything that was Roman. They revolted against pleasure, against beauty,against cleanliness, and against many other desirable things which are in themselves the gloryof man. The artist then revolted against this declared unreasonableness and went on a course asthoroughly reactive as had been the course of Puritanism and Calvinism. Being artistic wascommonly identified with being loose-moraled, wicked, idle and drunken, and the artist, to berecognized, tried to live up to this role. This feeling persists to this day and low-tone peopleoften embrace the arts solely as an excuse to be promiscuous, unconventional and loose inmorals.225"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"One finds, hanging around the easel of the painter, women who are “artistic” but whoare, so far as their actual conduct is concerned, seeking not to create anything but to escape thename which is rightly theirs. One finds some poor young fellow who could have been a finearchitect educated into the Great-Art-Can-Only-Be-Done-By-Moral-Lepers School. Theseobservations are brought to the attention of the auditor for just one reason: the individuals ofgreatest potential worth that he will process will probably be artists. He will do well to addressthoroughly all the “education” and “artistic environment” of the artists and would-be artists,whether writers, composers, poets or painters, because here he will find the track strewn withentheta. If the auditor wishes to rehabilitate an aesthetic mind, he must address all the enthetawhich has accumulated around the subject of aesthetics. No more authoritarian field exists,since none of the principles of aesthetics have been accurately formulated, and it is an axiom ofDianetics that the less is accurately known about a field of the humanities the more authoritarianwill be that field. Any field which has critics galore, wherein a thousand different schools ofdivergent opinion can exist, where opinion is listened to with open mouths in lieu of reason bywhich any man can reach a conclusion, is an authoritarian field. Aesthetics, unfortunately,abounds in these critics and opinions.The whole field of arts is thus enturbulated, and the artistry of the culture is therebygreatly reduced. The rehabilitation of the art-ability of a culture is a tremendously validundertaking, and will repay a thousand times any effort made in that direction. A culture isonly as great as its dreams, and its dreams are dreamed by artists. When the level of existenceof the artist becomes impure, so becomes impure the art itself, to the deterioration of thesociety. It is a dying society indeed into which can penetrate totalitarianism. The groupaesthetic mind of that society must be almost wholly unable to operate. No society in which artwas elevated and supported, in which the writer, the musician, the poet, or the architect hadany stability or position, would tolerate the work-dog theory of man’s highest destination. Forif the industry and commerce and material projects of a nation are carried on the backs of a fewable, desperate men, then the honor and the glory of that society is carried and enhanced by theartist.There may be many levels of mind above the aesthetic mind. It would be presumptuousto classify them if one did not understand but had only observed the possibility of theirexistence. Classification of or assignment of names to things which one does not encompasswith one’s understanding is an authoritarian procedure and leads to nothing but confusion. Amental illness, for instance, should be classified with a designation which would lead to itsalleviation. Simply classifying one introduces complexity without advancing understanding. Itis quite common in authoritarian fields to advance a great many descriptive names for thingsbased on partial or obscure observations of uninformed and unskilled observers. This makesfor a vast amount of “technology” and gives a certain “dignity” (pomposity) to an “authority” inan authoritarian field. One would not in any sense consider a professor of English literature acreator of literature simply because the professor knows the names of the writers and all theirworks and the multitude of opinions critics have expressed about them. This cataloguing canvery easily pass for “appreciation.” In a low-tone society, which will admit authoritarianismwithout much rebuke and bend before the thundering witless manifestos of some critic orpractitioner who knows nothing more of his subject than an enormously complex vocabulary,one can expect the definition of a “cultured person” to be that person who can recite and givethe standard opinion about numerous artistic works and humanitarian “ologies.” This makes itvery simple for an individual to obtain “culture.” He must only memorize, without thinkingabout, the names of the great operas, the great books, the great paintings, and the humanitarianprojects of the past. In a low-tone society, the universities perform this function ably, ifraucously. In a low-tone society, institutions of “learning” are commonly deserted after a yearor two by most persons who, through reason, wish to be of worth to their fellow men. In otherwords, in a low-tone society, education is denied, because it is education by classification, tomost of the individuals who would actually help that society.Thus, no attempt to classify any level of mind alertness above the level of the aestheticmind will be made beyond stating that these mind levels more and more seem to approach anomniscient status. Somewhere, possibly on the fifth level, lies the functioning mind of the226"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"spiritual or religious man who has passed over the border of a consideration of MEST or oforganisms and is turned toward an understanding of and a co-operation with both the thetauniverse and the Supreme Being. What vast frontiers are opened by the scientific evidencewhich continues to accumulate in Dianetics, what these frontiers and the knowledge theyembrace will do to alter or enhance man’s culture cannot at this time be estimated. Forexample, even at this time in Dianetics one can prove, as science demands proof in terms ofsensing, measuring, and experiencing, the immortality or near immortality of the individual.Oddly enough, or perhaps not so oddly, hardly any re-interpretation of scripture is necessary’,save that the boldness and scope of past considerations about the human soul, God and theDevil, and Heaven and Hell are stabilized and made contactable. The importance and value oforganism death is enormously reduced, should dianetic investigations and conclusions continueto be corollary to or concordant with man’s great religions. Religions, fighting uphill againstthe oppressions of Godless ideologies, may gain new strength and meaning. The level ofbehavior of the individual, whether good or evil, would appear to have new significance. Forthose people who overcome the suppressors to their goodness, ethics, and honor, an upwardsurge toward spiritual immortality seems to be indicated. Those who succumb to the Forces ofEvil and are unable to live more than evil and destructive lives would seem, should theseconclusions be borne out on further investigation of a scientific nature, to be entered not onlyupon a dwindling spiral in one generation but upon a decline toward a final end of pain or non-survival as personal identities. Some of these partially observed and explored possibilities (orprobabilities) would seem to give newer meaning to the cycles of societies and groups and theirsurvival or death.As one examines these upper levels of mind, when one examines the evidence of thetheta body, and when one himself experiences, incidental to processing, the evidence of hisown continuation into yesterdays and an evident guarantee of his tomorrows past his death inthe current generation, one’s orientation with regard to goals and purposes may undergo aconsiderable alteration. The biologist, revolting against churches which may or may not haveconsiderably suppressed scientific research in the past, has sought to dream for man an originout of mud and ammonia seas and a source for him independent of God, but springing onlyfrom material things. This reactive overreaching gave us no method of alleviating theunhappiness of man, even in the restricted fields of chronic somatics and mental aberration, andgave to us instead tremendous weapons of destruction without providing as well any sanitywith which to use them.Under the guidance of the material-blinkered scientist, whose greatest goal was a work-animal adjustment of man to a physical environment, whose end for the individual was six feetof ground and a coffin sometimes proof against worms, and whose goal for the group was anant society wherein the smallest unit of life worthy of notice was ten thousand individuals, wehave been led down dark and evil byways of destruction not only of the dreams, hopes, andethics of men but of the MEST planet as well. Materialistic science, operating on the premisethat man came from mud only, that the mind is a queerly erroneous stimulus-responsemechanism, that the human soul is a delusion, that God was a myth of some aberratedMesopotamian, has presented us at last with the immediate and real threat of man’s extinctionas a species. In view of the fact that this materialistic science led only, then, in the direction ofdeath, even the unthinking should see the fact that something must be desperately wrong withthe teachings of the Lysenkos, the Darwins, and my learned schoolmates, the atomic scientistswho have given man at last for his gravespade the atomic bomb.However, it was natural for man, as an organism heavily enturbulated with MEST, tobring to perfection something like the understanding of the laws of MEST before he lookedabout to see whether anything else might exist. The materialist scientist has enormouslyadvanced man’s control of MEST, even if he has by his doctrines considerably inhibited man’sunderstanding of what in Dianetics we call theta. Francis Bacon, Newton, and the restdeveloped ways of thinking about thinking and ways of reasoning about reason which havebeen of considerable value to Dianetics and without which, indeed, Dianetics could not havebeen formulated. But Bacon and Newton did not espouse the materialist cause. Their disciplesdeveloped the doctrine that man came from mud and that man’s destiny was mud. If Dianetics227"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"does not come too late upon the scene, its investigation of higher mind levels, even at this lowand undeveloped point, may be of assistance to a resurgence in man of something of his beliefin a Divine Being and in himself as an entity partially divine. The basic principles of Dianeticsdemand that a fact, to be proven, must be sensed, measured, or experienced. When sciencethrust this onto the scene of thinking, man’s willingness to accept a fact merely upon faith wasin itself reduced. Caught unprepared before this new doctrine without which, so its espousersclaim, nothing could be valid, the religions still attempted to hold at high value what wasactually a vitally necessary part of man’s social existence. But generation after generation ofyoung men and women came off the assembly lines marked “educational courses,” filled full ofthe doctrine that they must believe only what they could experience, and ground very fine in themills of the materialist. These generations, actually, regardless of their ability to quote Hamletor play Bach on the piano, to look into microscopes, to serve as executives in steamshipoffices, to shift and command and generally alter MEST, were nevertheless socially lostgenerations which had no concept of the value of themselves as individuals, which had noworkable social order worth mentioning if the value of a social order is to be measured in termsof happiness. These generations were wrecked by divorce, inhibitions, purposelessness,sophistication, insecurity and general hopelessness. Representative of their feeling in the fieldof humanity were schools of thought which taught them that a man’s highest goal was tobecome “adjusted to his environment” without once realizing that man’s only advance dependedon man’s ability to adjust the environment to him as a species; which taught that geneticheredity alone was responsible for neurosis and insanity, and that filth and muck alone coveredthe entire problem of the human mind from top to bottom. This is a sad and piteous thing. Noempire one has studied in any former day had ever become so depraved and Godless in itssenility as the overall average of the societies of man in the world today.It is no wonder that an ideology which holds that man, generation after generation, canbe moulded into mindless machine parts, that there is no destiny for the individual beyond hisplace as an emotionless, rigidly-held cog in a dully, hopelessly grinding social wheel,commands of its minions the destruction and eradication from any society of the producer, theindividuals, the thinker, or any noble man. The progress upward toward survival on higherlevels is a progress as well toward God. The auditor will notice this in case after case. He willprobably be struck by the fact that those atheists he processes soon cease to be atheistic in theirinclinations and attain at least a tolerance for the idea that religion can exist and have a validfunction in a social order. Scanning out some of the education of the individual simply as a steptoward converting entheta along a very likely line, the auditor may be interested to note that thepreclear begins to speculate on the possibility of a spiritual existence. Although he mayembrace no doctrine, the preclear, when he is well up the tone scale, is apparently instinctivelyaware of some higher level of existence. He normally abandons his materialistic stand as headvances up the tone scale, since this stand happens to be compatible with individuals from 2.0down.One could postulate that from 2.0 down there is more MEST in an individual than thereis theta, for individuals along these levels prefer to use MEST force, foot-pounds of energy, inorder to accomplish their desires, rather than reason. Individuals on this level normally do notimprove MEST but will make structures into enMEST. When individuals are enturbulatedbelow the level of 2.0, they tend, as a general rule, to consider all life, all organisms as MESTand will in their handling of life and organisms reduce them down toward MEST. Oddlyenough, this happens to compare with past ideas of missions of minions of the Devil. Theforces of Evil reduced life down into materialism and death. Above 2.0, the tendency of theindividual is to enhance life and organisms in their existence and to assist them to a harmoniouscontrol over MEST. This is strangely similar to what in the past have been considered good andGodly actions.It should not be considered strange that the organism can go so much higher above 2.0than it can go down below 2.0. 4.0 is so far short of the altitude evidently obtainable bywhatever means, according to tentative observations, that one cannot but feel that man so far inhis evolution of existence has been but slightly graduated from his animal cousins incomparison to the distance he has yet to travel to attain anything like an ultimate. To observe228"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"that an entire social order such as America can drift around 2.5 and that the normal individualprobably falls below 3.0 is to compare man’s current state with that of the ugly duckling whowill grow up to be a swan.

Faced with theinsanities of the world today, man’s chances of reaching God are not that good.229"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETEENCOLUMN AORelative Entheta On CaseAs noted in the accompanying graph, an organism, by dianetic postulate andobservation, is composed of theta and MEST and their altered form, entheta and enMEST.By theta is meant, of course, thought energy, possibly existing as thought matter inthought space. By MEST is meant the physical universe of matter, energy, space, and time, aswe know them in the physical sciences. It is postulated that these two energies combine, andthat through the harmonious control of MEST by theta a life organism is formed. Theta plusMEST could be said, then, to compose life.The formation of organisms and their development evidently comes about through fourevolutionary tracks. First, there is the evolution of the theta body, of which we know littlebeyond the fact that it appears to exist, at least for human organisms, and to move forward intime, developing from generation to generation independent of the genetic line. The secondevolution is, apparently, the evolution of organisms themselves, continuing along aprotoplasmic line from generation to generation, each generation altering somewhat by virtue ofthe environment, by natural selection which weeds out the least fit or least adaptable, and bywhat appears to be planned construction based on computation for the future. The thirdevolution is the evolution in MEST. This may not be readily seen, but MEST is changed,ordered, disordered, an made more complex by the advancing generations of life forms: theintricate During processing entheta is converted into theta, and enMEST is converted intoMEST. It is postulated that this happens in the following way. EnMEST becomes MEST, partof which (A) is retained for use by the organism, and part of which (B) leaves the organism, tobe replaced later (C) by new MEST. Entheta (a) becomes theta. It may also be postulated thatentheta leaves the organism (b) and is replaced by new theta (c) complexity of bacterial by-products and the formation or destruction of mountains or machines is no less an evolution thanthat along the organism lines.There is a fourth evolution which has been but slightly considered. This is the gradientscale in present time of growing complexity of life forms as they support themselves, in now,on MEST. The basic on this scale of complexity is, of course, those minute life forms whichlive on sunlight and inorganic chemicals alone and which convert rock and sand into soil, or inthe sea, which provide food for the next highest vegetable form. The soil then supports aslightly higher plant form. This, in turn, makes better or more soil, or in the sea, better ormore food, and an evolution of complexity then is observed in the higher and higher levels ofthe vegetable kingdom, then in the more simple animal and fish forms, and finally forms ascomplex as man. This last evolution is taking place continuously in present time. Here with usat this moment the lowliest forms are actively converting sunlight and minerals for the supportof higher forms. The more MEST the form handles external to itself, the more complex are itsrequirements in terms of preprocessed MEST. This processing of MEST, then, for higher andhigher form consumption is necessary as a staff of life. Theta could be said to exist across theMEST line of parade in time as a “now” band, just as the MEST universe probably lies in thecontinuous present time of the theta universe.It seems to be a rule of theta and MEST that they form union only at a moment of heavycollision with each other. Although theta has a natural attraction for MEST and MEST has anatural attraction for theta, if MEST has any intention, this does not mean that the union is atfirst a harmonious one. The first moment of impact is a collision in which a considerableportion of the theta becomes tangled with the MEST, leaving some free theta and some usefulMEST. The remainder changes wave length or polarity and becomes what we call enturbulatedtheta and enturbulated MEST, which in Dianetics we shorten to entheta and enMEST.230"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"While some organization may be made in this first union it seems that the entheta andenMEST must separate in order for the theta to extract with it knowledge of the physical lawsof MEST. Then a second collision is made, and a greater advance comes about, since theta hasmore knowledge of MEST and can make a more harmonious conquest. Continual repetitions ofthis bring theta more and more informations; and more and more ability in the handling ofMEST brings about more complex forms and organizations. This is as true of the group as it isof the individual, and all group activities which will eventually result in learning begin withconsiderable turbulence. After the turbulence is over, greater advances are then made possiblethrough a much greater understanding of the physical universe by theta. An illustration of thiswould be the scientific advances obtained in wars, which in the after peace serve menconstructively. There is a limiting factor on this, however, in that all the theta must not becomeenturbulated, thus carrying the organism evolution downward.Death is a name assigned to what is apparently the mechanism by which theta recoversitself and the bulk of its volume from the MEST, so as to be able to accomplish a moreharmonious conquest of the MEST in a next generation. Species advance so long as the thetaand the MEST can still separate, leaving free theta, but at last the theta apparently begins toenter the genetic line on a dwindling spiral, the species decays and dies out.The tone scale does not represent the idea that everything above 2.0 is theta in pureform and everything below 2.0 is entheta in pure form, nor that in the organism everythingabove 2.0 is MEST well organized by theta, and that, sharply, everything below 2.0 isenMEST, or disorganized matter. In older ways of thinking, which permitted only two-valuedlogic, which is to say black and white or right and wrong with no in-between values, the tonescale and its usefulness would have been greatly decreased. In Dianetics, there is a new way ofthinking about things which underlies a great deal of its technology. Instead of two-valuedlogic or three-valued logic we have infinity-valued logic. Here is a gradient scale which permitsno absolute at either end. In other words there is not an absolute right and an absolute wrong,just as there is no absolute stillness and no absolute motion. Of course, it is one of the tenets ofDianetics that absolutes are not attainable but only approachable. Thus, We have gradientscales. Death is approached by degrees, in terms of failures, being wrong, accumulatedsickness and accidents. An ascendency upward toward life is an accumulation of minorsuccesses which lead to higher and higher levels of survival, successes in organism growth andperfection and in education and in attaining goals. Actually, 2.0 on the tone scale is the placewhere the ARC of theta and the organism order in terms of MEST have each and intermingledlybecome sufficiently dissonant so that a slight discomfort exists. The enMEST is not veryenMEST, and the entheta is not very entheta, but as the scale is descended this dissonancegrows stronger and wider until it is finally so wide that it is almost a null, which is to say thatvery little inter-activity between entheta and enMEST exists and the components of enMEST arebecoming so poorly organized as not even to be in conflict with one another, and the ARC oftheta is almost entirely interrupted, dispersed and dissonant. The complete null point for theorganism life is 0.0, where theta and MEST, so far as the organism is concerned, have so littlein common with each other that they separate. This separation of the theta body from the MESTbody ejects into being for further use in new organisms the MEST of the old body and releasesinto freedom for future conquest of organisms, according to present theory, the theta body.If the auditor finds this too vastly technical, he should at least understand that in orderto bring an organism up the tone scale he has to separate the enturbulations of theta and MEST,which exist as entheta and enMEST in the organism. Every moment of hard collision betweenthe theta portion and the MEST portion of the body or between the organism and otherorganisms or MEST has formed a point of such intensity of entheta and enMEST that this pointwill thereafter enturbulate the theta and the MEST with which it comes into contact.This is the engram, a moment of physical pain with its resultant unconsciousness andthe perceptics entrapped therein. Entheta and enMEST from 0.1 up to 2.0 are seeking toseparate and in so seeking enturbulate the existing theta and MEST. Any instant or area ofphysical pain, then, is trying itself to die, so that the entrapped entheta and enMEST canbecome free. In dianetic processing something new, in that it can be done thoroughly, in the231"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"evolutions of organisms, the theta body and MEST, has been introduced. Processing separatesentheta and enMEST without bringing about the death of the organism. These points ofcontagion, if unprocessed, sum up finally to organism death. Just as, apparently, the MESTbody of the organism is replenished by other MEST, processes it, and gives off MEST, so isthe theta body, possibly, replenished and so does it evidently give off theta. Beyond the fact ofexistence of and basic descriptions of theta, which are useful to the auditor, very little is knownabout theta at this time, although the recognition of its probable existence has enormouslywidened the scope of knowledge on the subject of the humanities, and the discovery of thetheta body in terms that can be sensed, measured and experienced according to good scientificusage means a considerable advance, if it continues to be borne out by accumulating evidence.Entheta, either over some by-pass route or directly, converts into organism theta ormakes it possible for more theta to be attracted to the organism simply by, according to presenttheory, the address of theta itself to the vicinity of the entheta and enMEST. The mereproximity of a considerable quantity of theta, apparently, to an area of entheta causes theentheta to change wave length, vibration rate, or polarity and either to become theta or todischarge and leave an area into which fresh theta can penetrate. just as enough smoothlyflowing water overcomes the turbulence of a disturbed area of flow so does theta introducedinto the entheta area convert or smooth out the entheta. It happens that the conversion effect oftheta on entheta can occur when the theta to be applied to the entheta, or brought to bear uponit, exists in another organism or in a group of organisms. There is something everywhere-coexistent about theta, and perhaps there are various forms and types of it, all having more orless the same basic components, just as there is a great difference in quality amongst ideas,which seem to be the matter of theta. From 2.0 up on the tone scale, the theta is less and lessdissonant, or more and more compatible in its three components of affinity, reality andcommunication, but this does not mean that 4.0 is perfection of theta. Theta contained inorganisms, from one organism to another, seems to have at least some of its factors morerefined, and theta appears to assume other qualities above 4.0. Exactly how high thesequalities go, whether or not the 2.0 to 4.0 range is highly personalized, where the band of truefree theta is, if there is increasing power above these levels, are all questions subject at this timeto considerable speculation. Only enough data exists to make it fairly certain that with the thetatheory we are dealing with something much closer to natural law than man has widely acceptedbefore in his attempts to understand life, human behavior and the humanities in general. Thus,it may be that as one proceeds on up the tone scale one discovers progressive advances in theta.MEST is considerably easier to understand, being an old idea which has been worked over byseveral generations, to say the least, of physical-universe-minded individuals. Yet here again,with Dianetics, there was a great deal more to learn, particularly where MEST was concernedas a component part of the organism.However lightly the auditor wishes to study or regard the above data on the theta-MESTtheory, this following data concerning MEST and enMEST is vital to processing, and theauditor who does not know this data will not be able to achieve very good results on a case.Much of this data is new and has not before been released, but it has resolved, by theory andapplication of the techniques, cases which hitherto were considered extremely difficult, such asthe heavily occluded case, which not only “could not get out of present time” but did not evenseem to benefit very greatly from processing. Any auditor who has difficulty with his preclearwould do well to read this section over again.During processing, the individual can be observed to have what may be consideredincreasing theta as fast as entheta is recovered and converted. There may be othermanifestations of the release of entheta which have not yet been observed. If they exist and areobserved, possibly processing may increase in technology.The enMEST portion of conversion of exhaustion of charge on a case is considerablymore obvious to the observer, possibly because at this time our knowledge of the materialuniverse is so much greater and because we are trained to observe organism behavior.232"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The larger deposits of entheta and enMEST exist in secondaries, not in physical painengrams. A physical pain engram acts as a sort of trap. It is the basic enturbulator. Bycontagion it can, in moments of loss or threatened loss, contain various misemotions. Thesecondary, primarily, charges up the physical pain engram to a point where it can assert itsentheta side strongly against the analytical processes, or its enMEST side strongly against thephysical part of the organism, creating chronic somatics, to which Dianetics attributespsychosomatic illnesses. A great deal of entheta, but not as much as can be trapped insecondaries, is contained in lock chains. Here gradually, day by day, little by little, theta iscaught and converted into entheta, and the MEST at its level on the time track is converted intoenMEST, to a slight degree. One should not ignore any deposit of entheta and enMEST. Thewhole task of processing confines itself to this conversion.Contact with present time, if any part of that time can be demonstrably present to thepreclear, has some tendency to disenturbulate some entheta. Straight memory, by bringing tobear the theta of the analytical mind on the past, particularly in areas which are occluded, sinceall those occlusions are entheta areas, brings into being some theta. The running of a lockthrough and through as though it were an engram can, in a low-tone case particularly, bringinto being more theta. Lock scanning is a particularly efficacious technique in convertingentheta. Sudden, severe secondaries can greatly charge up engrams which have been keyed in,and are heavy, extensive deposits. Engrams themselves have the basic entheta and enMESTand are able to enturbulate and hold to themselves considerable entheta, but it is interesting tonote that the engram could be taken down to a level of entheta content approximating that whichit had originally without running the engram. This is easily understood as soon as one runs outa near-present-time injury. This near-present-time injury has not been charged up. The lastmoment of physical pain and unconsciousness on a case can usually be run. After a time,which may extend from a few days even to years, this engram is keyed in, at which time itbegins to link up and index itself with the reactive mind, in direct ratio to the amount ofrestimulation that it receives, which is to say in direct ratio to the number of times words andother perceptics contained in this engram are approximated in an enturbulated environment. Theskill and ability of the auditor is, then, addressed to removing entheta by converting it, andanything which will do this is valid processing.There are certain definite components in enMEST which manifest themselves duringtheir release. Whenever entheta is converted to theta it is always done with an accompanyingphysiological manifestation. It is very easy for the auditor to aim for and achieve thisphysiological manifestation, for enMEST has certain definite components. In other words,when entheta is being converted to theta, the organism manifests certain signs. These can bedivided into the four general classifications of gasses, liquids, solids, and physical energy. Oneshould understand that the enMEST portion of charge is the physical suppressor of aberrationand chronic somatics. One of the main manifestations in the organism, on the release of enthetaand its conversion to theta as in the running of locks, secondaries or engrams, or occasionallyeven during straight wire, is gas. There is something about oxygenation which is not yetunderstood but which again, if understood, might speed up processing. When one erases anengram, for instance, the erasure is accompanied by yawns. This is a gaseous and energymanifestation. Something is coming off the case. In running locks the preclear occasionallyyawns. Flatulence also occasionally accompanies the release of entheta.Liquids are released by the body in several forms during the release of enMEST. Themost obvious form is tears. When a secondary engram is reduced, on the grief level, it isreduced in tears. When tears occur, the secondary should be run until it is completelyexhausted, or the phrase, if that is all that can be recovered, should be repeated by the preclearuntil it no longer occasions tears, since tears seem to be the primary manifestation of theexhaustion of the most harmful secondaries, those of grief. But tears are not the onlymanifestation. Fear seems to be released with accompanying sweat, sometimes of a peculiarodor. There are individuals who are chronically in such a state of fear that each present-timeperceptic discharges itself through sweat. Apathy commonly discharges itself as panting orurine, but more work must be done to establish the discharge of apathy in physiological terms.233"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"Solids are discharged on the level of fear as vomiting, and there also, and on lower levels, asexcreta.There is a peculiar manifestation in Dianetics known as boil-off. Boil-off has assumedtremendously important proportions in processing, since the case that is very heavily entheta’dhas its charge held down by such quantities of anaten that the induction of boil-off seems to bethe most efficacious way to unburden the case. In a boil-off, a preclear will go into an apparentsleep. This is not sleep, no matter how much it may appear to be, but is actually a release ofunconsciousness which is extremely concentrated and heavy. The release of this permits thecase to go forward much more rapidly, because under it will lie quantities of specific incidentswhich otherwise are masked by this heavy layer. It is possible that a preclear may boil off fortwenty-five to fifty hours, if he is extremely heavily burdened with entheta. The boil-off hascertain strange manifestations. The preclear may, when running an incident, suddenly begin tomaunder and trail off, giving muttered accounts of strange pictures and unrelated events. Thisis a mirage effect, through boil-off, and peculiarly disconnected things will clutter up hisattention at this time, but he does all this in a very sleepy, dazed condition and shortly after maygo into an even deeper boil-off.Early in Dianetics, it was thought necessary to keep the preclear more or less alert in aboil-off. This was an error. The preclear should never be disturbed in a boil-off, but shouldbe permitted to continue in this state until the boil-off is exhausted. Further, it was once thoughtthat the preclear could be brought up to present time during the boil-off and that the boil-offwould continue automatically. This does not appear to be the case boil-off must be continuedon the point of the track where it began to occur.A boil-off may be boring for the auditor, for the preclear lies in a dazed state and maydo so for many minutes or even one or two hours. Even so, the auditor should not interrupt thepreclear. The efficacy of boil-off is demonstrated by the fact that when one is finished thepreclear is alert and can run other forms of entheta, but that when one is interrupted the preclearwill be in an unsatisfactory condition. When boil-offs are not permitted to be induced, the casewill not progress rapidly, and in an occluded case may progress with remarkable slowness.Perhaps the boil-off’s importance was minimized in the past because insufficient patience wasdevoted by the auditor to watching one continue through its full extent, which can be very long.A boil-off can be induced, and fade away, and be reinduced by a single phrase. The file clerkshould be depended on by the auditor to give the phrase which will induce a boil-off. It hasbeen commented upon that the boil-off occurs on circuit phrases and that it is actually theexhaustion of enormous quantities of anaten in a very concentrated form from the reactive mindfrom areas which have formerly been valence compartments or the location of demon circuits.This has not been adequately observed at this time for confirmation, for boil-off has been notedon phrases which were not circuit phrases. The auditor may ask the preclear’s file clerkwhether or not a boil-off can now be obtained, and then request the phrase. The preclearrepeats this phrase a few times and suddenly goes into a boil-off. He may emerge from thisboil-off very shortly, at which time the auditor requests him to repeat the phrase, and he goesback into the boil-off. This phrase is repeated by the preclear, to himself or to the auditor, eachtime the boil-off recedes, until there is no longer any boil-off on the repeating of this phrase.Then the auditor may procure from the preclear’s file clerk another phrase on which boil-offcan occur, and so on until a considerable amount of this apparently concentrated anaten hasbeen exhausted. The case will show a very marked improvement.Physical pain should not be overlooked as one of the factors which hold entheta inplace. It may occur that the auditor has a case which cannot run engrams but which canoccasionally get physical pain on the repetition of a single phrase. If the preclear has a new,not a chronic, somatic, the auditor may ask him for the phrase which will reduce this somatic,but only after he has ascertained from the file clerk whether or not the somatic will reduce.Such somatics, normally, are best reduced merely by scanning pleasure incidents, if they arebothering the preclear at the beginning of the session or at the end or it. The perceptics arecontacted when the case is lock-scanned. The perceptics themselves seem to have an234"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"entrapment of entheta. Thus, running all the perceptics out of an engram releases considerableentheta.Additionally, there is body movement. The preclear may twist and turn while runningfear, or may beat the bed with his fist while running anger, but in any event, by physicalmotion he exhausts energy. This is apparently beneficial, and the phrases and circumstanceswhich cause the preclear to do this should be repeated. However, the auditor should not bedeluded into wasting his time on a dramatization. The preclear must be in processing and,ordinarily, returned to a specific incident before any physical motion is of benefit.There are probably numerous other manifestations of entheta and enMEST, and futureobservation should be devoted to their determination and their use in processing.It is known that a good protein ration and certain vitamins assist the exhaustion andconversion of enMEST, and that a fairly stable present time, including a high-theta auditor,assists the exhaustion and conversion of entheta, and it is known that certain physiologicalmanifestations accompany the conversion of enMEST; and possibly theta manifestationsaccompany the conversion of entheta, but these have not been determined or observed to theextent that they would assist processing.In an occluded case, an auditor may very well find himself on this routine, and heshould know this very well. At the beginning of the case he attempts a little straight memory orperhaps some lock scanning. He may discover that the preclear is induced to weep on a certainphrase or to be frightened by a certain phrase. The auditor should cause that phrase to berepeated and the incident with which it is connected, as nearly as possible, be given somefurther attention. Conversion has already begun when this occurs. Next, the auditor may find,while lock scanning or when asking specifically for a phrase which will induce it, that thepreclear is going into a boil-off. The auditor, as the boil-off recedes, should discover the phraseon which the preclear is boiling-off, so that the boil-off can be continued until it is exhausted.More entheta has been converted and more incident has been made available. Additional lockscanning may then recover moments of physical tension or mental duress of the lock variety.These should then be scanned until thoroughly exhausted. At this time it may happen that anentire secondary engram will show up, and when this is run the case will rebound remarkablyup the tone scale. But in the next day or two it may be discovered that another boil-off is readyor that another series of locks containing duress should be scanned. Thus, from boil-off tolock scanning to the running of secondaries with as many of the perceptics as are available, theauditor may find himself with a case coming swiftly up the tone scale.In any event, the auditor should discover this to be taking place, and if it is not takingplace, then the auditor is doing something wrong. By straight wire he stabilizes his case, andhe may by straight wire get the case out of some incident which cannot be run. Here, he isconverting entheta into theta. More theta is then available to attack more entheta, and so he maybe able to scan locks or run a secondary engram or even an engram on a high-level case, or hemay be able to get a boil-off. But each time, the auditor should be achieving some result. Andeach time he gains more theta for the preclear he should reinvest in a further and perhapsheavier attack upon entheta and enMEST. If he does this his case will continue on up the tonescale, not in a steady rise along an even line but along an uneven course in which the highsbecome always a little higher and lows not quite so low. Running engrams or slugging hardinto the case may simply take the existing theta, place it in proximity with too large an amountof entheta, and enturbulate and entrap more of it, thus lowering the preclear on the tone scaleinstead of raising him.With some preclears, the auditor can be quite non-directive, which is to say he canpermit the preclear to run phrases and choose the next type of entheta to be attacked. Theauditor, in any event, should consult with the file clerk as much as possible.The auditor should not permit his preclear, however, to chain-scan engrams or goaround running himself automatically on various phrases, as this results in the enturbulation of235"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"the existing theta. The only time engrams can be chain scanned is when the preclear is up toabout 3.5, constantly and unmistakably, and has so much free theta and so little entheta that theeffect of the theta on the entheta is overpowering, even to the point of blowing out physicalpain.The auditor, if he wishes, may even put his preclear on free wheeling with a ration ofGuk, between sessions. He will find that this has the efficacy of occasionally knocking outwhole somatics and making the future job of processing easier. In any event, the Guk seems topromote the case. In free wheeling, where the somatic strip and file clerk are put into unison inthe running of incidents but “I” is left in present time, the preclear may hang up in a holder orhit a bouncer and the free-wheeling may stop. It so happens, however, that repeating the actionphrase while free wheeling does not free the preclear but acts as repeater technique and takes“I” down the bank to join the somatic strip. This may considerably enturbulate the case. Theauditor, when the preclear is hung up while free wheeling, should ask the file clerk for thephrase and then cause the preclear to remember, by straight memory, when he has heard thatphrase uttered. When the preclear recovers such an incident, any incident containing thatphrase, the free wheeling seems then to continue. Apparently, the only danger in free wheelingis the use of repeater technique in connection with it. However, one should never believe a“file clerk” when the auditor asks, “Are you clear?” and the “file clerk” says “Yes!” For somereason or other “file clerks” are entirely too optimistic on this subject. The “file-clerk-clear”and the use of repeater technique threw free wheeling into disrepute. However, a person whohas been free wheeling can and should have it scanned out by lock scanning, just as anysession would be, and the free wheeling occasionally seems to benefit a case. To put a preclearinto free wheeling it is only necessary to tell him to close his eyes and for the auditor to say,“The file clerk will furnish moments of physical pain or discomfort and the somatic strip willrun them out, and this process will continue until I say ‘cancelled’“ or “until I tell the somaticstrip to come to present time.”It should be remembered by the auditor that the circuit phrase is both recalcitrant andresistant to auditing. One of the main troubles with chain scanning is that the individual chain-scans out all manner of phrases but merely puts the circuit phrases into restimulation. Thus, thecircuits seem to be activated, and we get a condition in chain scanning where the individualapparently has no more engrams, and yet by close processing, numbers of circuit phrasescomplete with somatics may be discovered on the case. Lock scanning also has this difficultyto a slight degree, but this can be remedied by finding all types of circuit phrases by straightmemory. Circuit phrases sometimes will not even flash, even when the action phrases in thecase are relatively low in power, but the auditor, by guessing and talking with the preclear mayeventually discover types of phrases which are circuit phrases and which would more or lesstake over control of auditing from the auditor and from the “I” of the preclear. Straight memoryrecovers a specific moment when a phrase was uttered and the preclear can usually be lock-scanned through all similar moments, thus taking some of the charge off the basic engramwhich contains the circuit phrase and weakening or getting rid of the demon control circuit,which may have been giving the auditor considerable trouble.There are probably numberless ways of converting entheta to theta and of relieving thedeposits of enMEST in the organism. These are simply the best ways known to date. Theseways are proven and reliable. The auditor can discover on the tone scale chart the levels atwhich he can run various types of entheta. This is a safeguard and will keep the auditor out ofa great deal of trouble. There are several freak techniques around, such as getting a personautomatically on chain scanning, which are almost certain to increase the enturbulation on thecase. I tested one some time ago in which the individual was sent home at night to run outchains of secondaries in his sleep. This was rather unsatisfactory, but it was interesting to notethat one who was set to running a chain of grief secondaries in his sleep woke up in themorning to find his pillow saturated with tears and yet had no knowledge of what he had beencrying about. This is added here to demonstrate that there are not only many combinations ofthe known existing mechanisms of the mind, but that there are probably a great number ofmechanisms not known.236"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Possibly a very fruitful field is the exploration of theta perceptics, for theoretically itmight be possible for new resurgences of theta to be entered into a case with excellent results.Possibly this is what is happening when a person reaches toward a spiritual resurgence. This isvery well worth investigating.The auditor should keep in mind that cases, one to another, have different amounts offree theta endowment. He will find cases which are low on the tone scale and very occluded,which yet have great reasoning and constructive power, despite their tendencies towardsuccumbing. He will find these cases rising rather rapidly, but because the individual is hereand there through the columns higher than the level assigned, the auditor should not thereforeabandon the types of processing assigned for the general level where his preclear is located.Likewise, it is a great temptation for the auditor when he finds a case which apparentlyhas sonic and visio and some perception of pain to dive for the bottom of the case and startrunning engrams. After he has done this for a while he may find that his case is not making avery good rise on the tone scale and may only then check the chart, to discover that he has beenworking with a 0.8, much to his dismay. These low-level cases enturbulate rapidly, and therunning of engrams on them, no matter how wide-open they are, may be done for hundreds ofhours without any marked increase in the tone level of the case. This is because the auditor istoo enthusiastically investing free theta into the running of physical pain engrams which are notyet exhausted of their secondary and lock entheta. The goal in any case is the freeing of theta,and by this the auditor should be guided.237"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTYCOLUMN AQTone Level of Auditor Necessary To Handle CaseThis column is included as an estimate of optimum performance.The auditor should be aware of the fact that the engrams of the preclear, his secondariesand locks, respond only in the presence of all available free theta. The theta of the auditor plusthe remaining theta of the preclear are a sum which is directed at the entheta in the reactive mindof the preclear. It is a strange fact that the mere presence of an auditor makes it possible for thepreclear to run incidents which he could not touch if no auditor were present, although therehave been preclears who have successfully run out locks and some secondaries, alone. Butself-auditing, normally, gets a case confused, and the presence of an auditor is very desirable.Auditors who are below 2.0 on the tone scale tend unconsciously, and evenconsciously, in the direction of succumbing. They have a ratio in themselves of more enthetathan theta. Auditors below 2.0 on the tone scale have accomplished something with cases fromtime to time, because Dianetics can be, in part, mechanically applied. But the preclear whoplaces himself in the hands of an auditor below 2.0 is asking for unsuccessful processing,since auditor code breaks will inevitably ensue and the case will be unwittingly mishandled,regardless of the apparent intention of the auditor.One can say, then, that 2.5 is the lowest level the preclear should accept in the auditor.And even this has some slight risk, since the interest of the 2.5 auditor in the preclear is apt tobe lackadaisical and not to encourage any great or rapid advances in the case.3.0 would be the lowest level of the auditor, for any truly successful auditing. At thislevel, the auditor will be interested, sympathetic, able to follow the auditor’s code with nostrain, will be quick to understand any trouble which the preclear encounters, and canordinarily, if properly educated, be expected to carry out a good and responsible role as anauditor. Furthermore, any discreditable data on a case which an auditor at this level uncovers inthe life of the preclear will not be used as conversational material by the auditor. This iscertainly not the case with low-tone auditors.When one is handling preclears from 1.5 down, one will normally discover that thepreclear is very highly restimulative to the auditor, is apt to become angry or recalcitrant orinsulting, has a great deal of trouble contacting some of the entheta, and is in general so highlycharged that great patience and tolerance is required of the auditor. This means, simply, that theauditor must not be easily restimulated by his preclear. Those cases from 1.5 down are highlyrestimulative, on the average. Cases from this level down, which are chronically psychotic orpsychotic at the time of processing, which is to say cases which have all of their free thetaenturbulated, particularly require auditors on a high tone level, for auditors at lower levels areapt to consider the psychotic too critically, and a critical or restrictive attitude toward thepsychotic denies him his recovery.Further, the psychotic demands of the auditor a high courage level, a level certainly notfound below 3.0, and guaranteed (given a good endowment of free theta and an education notcontrary to courage) only at the 3.5 level. The psychotic, or persons who are on the tone bandbelow 2.0 but who are easily enturbulated, has such a highly charged background in mostcases that he may scream or express misemotion or dramatize to a frightening extent. A fullyenturbulated paranoid may very well attempt to kill an auditor during the processing session, ifthe auditor suddenly reminds the paranoid of an enemy. Below 3.0, the reaction of theprocessor toward the psychotic may be irrational to the point of hastily giving the psychoticsedation or putting him in restraint or giving him electric shock or ordering a prefrontallobotomy, or doing any of those things, in short, which express crawling fear of another238"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"human being whose rationality cannot be trusted. A 1.5 trying to treat psychotics can thinkonly in terms of punishment and nullification of the psychotic, and cannot possibly producesimply by his presence and the quality of his reasoning any alleviation in the case, but by hisown fear further enturbulates the psychotic. Additionally, living in an environment filled withpsychotics (such as an institution, with individuals dramatizing, screaming, being irrational ordully stupid) is intensely restimulating -- so much so that a considerable portion of theattendants and attending doctors of institutions themselves eventually find their way into thewards as patients. In short, it takes life and energy in an individual to bring into being life andenergy in others. And conversely, that person low on the tone scale, in order to climb up thescale or even to exist at his level, pulls heavily upon the life and energy of those around him.The legends of vampires probably originated from an observation that some persons seem tohave no life of their own but only express themselves in the vicinity of and at the expense ofother individuals. Low-tone people commonly yearn to marry out of no other reason than thatthey can obtain from a mate the energy and life necessary to continue existence, or perhapsbecause here they have free theta to attack and desire to pull it down.The auditor should be very cognizant of the fact that addressing entheta in a preclear isrestimulative to the auditor. A certain amount of the auditor’s free theta is going to becomeenturbulated when he processes preclears. New locks, at the very least, will be formed on hisown chains. Thus the enturbulation is not wholly temporary, but a certain amount of theenturbulation will become “permanent,” which is to say that it must be processed out. Auditorswho are not themselves being processed are unsuccessful. A group of auditors processingpreclears but not being processed themselves will become, in a relatively short time, a veritablesnake-pit of entheta and, willy-nilly, will go down the tone scale.The very least an auditor should do for himself if he is processing people is to keep theprocessing sessions he has done on other people scanned out of himself. He should considerthat this is as necessary to him as eating and getting proper rest, for his own descent down thetone scale as a result of auditing will be so unobserved by himself that he will not know howlow he has descended until he suddenly realizes that not only is he no longer taking anypleasure in auditing but he is facing the next session with considerable distaste. When thishappens the auditor can be sure that through failure to observe the necessity of having thesesessions lock-scanned he now needs processing fully as badly as his preclears. He shouldtake, then, every possible measure to bring himself up the scale, and the most immediatelyindicated of these is having processing sessions scanned out. As the auditor descends lowerand lower on the tone scale he tends more and more toward succumbing, and he will reach apoint where he does not think he needs any processing. When this happens, he has becomevery enturbulated.Dianetics provides effective means of bringing people into a higher level of reason,energy, and happiness and into a better state of physical well being. If Dianetics is to succeedwidely, and it will whether it takes two years or the next twenty, that success depends upon theco-auditing team, where two people audit each other alternately. It has been publicized thatDianetics is simply a low-cost therapy. Aside from the fact that Dianetics is not a therapy,Dianetics provides a means for any two people who are intelligent and fairly well up the tonescale to lift themselves by their bootstraps into much more desirable levels of human existence.It has never before happened that people could do this. The formation of a co-auditing teamshould be done with some care. The two individuals should be somewhere near parity on thetone scale and should be, certainly, above 2.0 on the tone scale. A disparity will bring aboutthe condition that one of them is doing all the auditing, and there is no mutual exchange.Husband-wife teams do not, ordinarily, make good co-auditing teams. Whereas a fewsuch teams have been successful, the bulk of them have after a short time broken up asunworkable, and the husband and the wife have had to look outside the home for otherprocessors. Thus, at the very start it would probably be wise to obtain co-auditors outside thehome. There are many reasons for this. In the first place, marital relations have a certaindelicacy, and the introduction of dianetic processing between two individuals brings aboutanother type of affinity. In a co-auditing team between husband and wife many auditor code239"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"breaks may, indeed, break up the marriage. Looking outside the home, one can findcoauditors, if the original co-auditing team proved to be unsuccessful. Additionally, there arecertain information barriers between husbands and wives in most marriages. And where thewife cannot tell the husband all she knows, and where the husband cannot tell the wife all heknows, enough of a brake is put on communication to inhibit processing. At the recent level ofteenage morals, there is usually much in any marital partner’s background which he does notwish to communicate to his spouse. With a co-auditing partner outside the home one can freelycommunicate, and thus the affinity required for co-auditing can be established, which it rarelycan between husbands and wives.There is also the three-way team, in which three people coaudit. This has the advantageof keeping altitude for each auditor, since in the triangle, none is being processed by anyone heis auditing.When the preclear has come up the tone scale to 3.0 he can be processed by nearlyanyone educated in Dianetics who is not below 2.0, for he can stand up to considerable auditorcode breaking or ineptness, but he should be aware of the fact that he will proceed faster, thehigher the level of his auditor.Any double or triangular co-auditing team should be careful to keep parity. No memberof the team should be permitted to lag so that a disparity in tone level can result. This is quiteimportant, since by permitting the disparity to occur, the auditor who is higher on the scale willhimself be brought back down the tone scale.According to theory, the best auditors would be clears, but people who have lost theirown aberrations are quite likely to be interested in the activity dictated by their basic purpose.If their basic purpose happens to be to make individual fellow human beings happier, healthierand more reasonable, then they will remain in Dianetics, but ordinarily, they go very far afield.240"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWENTY-ONECOLUMN ARHow To Audit The CaseIn this chapter we will take up cases at particular tone levels. It should be rememberedthat an individual can exist at any one of these tone levels and still be considered “rational” bythe current society.There is one very important caution an auditor should observe in starting a case. Eitherhe evaluates the case on the chart with thoroughness and so knows the type of case he isaddressing, or he uses, in the absence of chart evaluation, very light methods of processingsuch as straight memory or the scanning of minor lock chains. The auditor will not be able todetermine rapidly where his preclear lies on the tone scale, unless he has the chart before himand has made a test of the somatic and general responses of his preclear.Learning to use the chart and to locate the preclear on it may take the auditor some time,for the chart is complicated in that it contains several elements. There are at least five differentways that tone may be said to vary. The auditor is looking, mainly, for the chronic reactive toneof the preclear, in order to know at what level it will be safe to process him. Some high-thetaauditors can successfully use methods on preclears which are above their chronic reactive tonelevel. They do this by bringing the preclear temporarily up the tone scale with very high ARC.But this is, unfortunately, an unusual ability, and the auditor who wishes to make sure that hewill not enturbulate the preclear should be very careful not to use methods which are above thepreclear’s level on the tone scale. Five things which affect the tone manifestations which thepreclear is showing are (1) the theta-entheta ratio on the case, the relative amount of “frozen”entheta in locks, secondaries, and engrams, (2) the present-time environment of the preclear, itstone and volume, (3) the tone of the particular engram in which the preclear happens to bestuck, if he is stuck, (4) the tone commanded by a particular engram command phrase or seriesof phrases which are in restimulation, either acute or chronic, (5) the general environmentalbackground of the preclear, the tone of his education, family, group, and so on. It may be asomewhat difficult job for the auditor to separate these various elements in the preclear’smanifested tone, in order to discover the one thing which is most important to the level ofprocessing to be used on the preclear, namely the theta-entheta ratio on the case.Straight wire on the present-time environment of the preclear, the events of the last twoor three days or even hours, will give the auditor some idea of what effect present-time ishaving on the manifested tone.Straight wire on the preclear’s general background, during the taking of the inventoryand after, will give the auditor a somewhat less clear estimate of the effect of this element on thepreclear’s manifested tone, since much of the material may be occluded or purposely hidden.An attempt at running a pleasure moment and a few flash answers will tell the auditor whetheror not this preclear is badly stuck on the track and, therefore, whether this is an important factorin his manifested tone.The effect of a chronically or acutely restimulated engram or chain of engrams will be,perhaps, the most difficult to track down and allow for. It is here that the manic case enters thepicture, and this is the greatest danger that the auditor will encounter of rating his preclear toohigh on the scale: a wide-open case with a high manic in full restimulation. Because all thesethings complicate the problem, the auditor will find that his most reliable test of the theta-entheta ratio on the case will be the behavior columns on the tone scale chart -- after he learns touse them, and not to be deceived by the preclear’s idea of what his own tone is. Subtle, patientquestioning, perhaps over many hours, will be necessary before the auditor will be justified infeeling that he has truly discovered the chronic tone level of the preclear in each of thesecolumns. For this reason, it might be said that every case, almost without exception, should be241"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"started with many hours of straight wire. To ask the preclear, for instance, what his attitude isabout children will gain for the auditor information on what the preclear thinks his attitude is, orwhat he wants the auditor to think it is, or, perhaps, what it really is. The preclear’s gesturesand voice tones in answering the question will tell the auditor much, and the questioning is initself of benefit to the case. But the auditor will be sure of the preclear’s attitude towardschildren only when he has straightwired the preclear on several incidents with children. Theremay be cases in which direct questions on these things will only serve to alert the preclear’ssecrecy computations and in which the auditor would be wise to use the chart thoroughly andexhaustively but not obviously, with direct questions. A direct question such as, “Do you likechildren?” may easily seem like probing or criticism to the preclear, if unconsciously so. Arequest to relate an incident with children may provide the auditor with invaluable data which hecould not get with direct questions.The tone scale chart is a delicate and somewhat complex tool. The auditor who, bypractice and alert observation of results, learns to use it well will find both his abilities and hisunderstanding immeasurably increased.A case at 4.0, the dianetic MEST clear -- which is to say the current-life-organism clear,until we know more areas which can be processed -- can be considered to need no furtherProcessing. The 3.5 case is very easy to process, but a case is almost never at this level whenfirst addressed. When a case has reached this level through processing, it is relatively easy tobring the case up to clear. Almost anything can be done with this case in the way of runningentheta, and it is merely a question of how fast this individual can be brought to the state ofclear rather than whether or not he will reach it, for he can almost audit himself to that point ifhe has attained 3.5. Here, engrams can be scanned, a process which is done much like lockscanning except that physical pain incidents, secondaries, and word chains which aresurrounded by physical pain can be scanned. On the 3.5, however, just as on any other case,one should keep the auditing sessions scanned off the case. The 3.0 case should not be scannedthrough engrams. Scanning is a very attractive mechanism. It seems to be such a simple thingto start the individual at basic-basic and tell him to scan out all the engrams on the track topresent time. But considerable entheta exists on the 3.0 and the scanning mechanism willenturbulate him and bring him down the tone scale. Here, circuits are still active enough so thatthey will be activated by chain scanning and a “false clear” will result, which is to say theauditor will have a preclear whose circuits have been charged to the point where the auditorcannot find an engram and so assumes that he has a clear, when he does not. However, the3.0 has nearly all of his engrams ready to be run as individual incidents. The auditor sends the3.0 back to the earliest moment of pain or discomfort, picks up the earliest phrase and runs theengram on through.Usually it is not necessary for the auditor to have the preclear repeat the Phrases, eachone time after time, but the auditor can let the preclear run straight on through the engram frombeginning to end and then run it through from beginning to end again. On an erasure, ofcourse, the auditor has located the first moment of pain or discomfort and has reduced a greatmany of the secondaries. The earliest physical pain engram has been run out, and it isnecessary then only to proceed up the bank, on the ladder of time, erasing each consecutiveengram as contacted, from the first inception of the pain or unconsciousness in the engram tothe last. In the 3.0, it will be found that engrams erase rather rapidly. One or two passes willresult in yawns, and the next engram can then be reached. It must not be overlooked by theauditor, however, that in the progress of going up the bank from engram to engram each timetaking the earliest one that can be found, secondary engrams may come to light which have tobe discharged. An auditor can actually start up the bank and complete an erasure nearly topresent time, and find then a new chain of secondary engrams which have to be released interms of tears or other manifestations, and after this the auditor may discover that a newmoment of physical pain or discomfort exists as early as conception. He must then return tothis earliest engram. It is not difficult for the auditor to discover this, if he asks each time forthe earliest moment of pain or discomfort existing on the case. The auditor remains very alertto the fact that the release of anaten, misemotion or physical pain brings into view new areas ofanaten, misemotion or physical pain. By asking for the earliest moment of pain or discomfort242"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"and staying alert to the fact that new secondaries may appear, the auditor continues with hiserasure of the content of the reactive mind. But at 3.0 it is necessary for the auditor to keep thecase thoroughly scanned off, not only as to auditing but as to near-present-time incidents whichmay be enturbulative to the preclear. At 3.0 and below, the auditor must at all times rememberthat he is bringing the case up the tone scale and that the simple erasure of engrams is notenough to cause the case to progress satisfactorily, but that the erasure of engrams all by itselfcan actually, if no other form of entheta is addressed, bring this case back down the tone scaleagain. particularly in the presence of a present-time restimulative situation which considerablyenturbulates the preclear. The 3.0 level is definitely the area where an erasure is begun.Engrams do not ordinarily reduce at this level, but erase.The 2.5-level case offers a little more concern to the auditor than the 3.0. This is so allthe way down the bank, since the lower one goes on the tone scale, the more entheta one findson the case and the greater care he must take in order to keep up the present-time tone of thepreclear and to keep the preclear progressing up the tone scale. The 2.5 scans locks veryeasily; however he cannot, like the 3.5, scan secondaries. It is not advisable to scan a 2.5through any moments of heavy misemotion, because the case will become restimulated andmore theta will be absorbed into the turbulent areas than will be freed out of those areas byauditing. However, the 2.5 will run engrams as a routine matter, when they are addressed assingle engrams, not as chains of engrams as in chain scanning. Moments of great sorrow,loss, anger, apathy, are run out as incidents, perceptic by perceptic, until they are reduced.New secondaries and new engram chains are recovered in the 2.5 by lock scanning. The onlytime the 2.5 requires straight memory as a processing technique is when the auditor desires todiscover more about his case or to discover circuits. In the 2.5, the auditor locates circuits bystraight memory, finding who in the preclear’s environ tried to dominate or nullify him, andfinding moments during the awake life of the preclear when these people made statementswhich were circuit-type statements, such as “Control yourself” or “Keep a good grip onyourself.” At this level, the circuit is important. Here, considerable address should be made tocircuits. The phrases should be located by straight memory and should then be lock-scannedout as phrases so as to discharge and de-intensify all circuit phrases contained in engrams; forhere, and on down, a circuit can more or less take over from an auditor, so that the preclear willoccasionally insist on running his own case. Or a circuit can bar off large quantities of entheta.The biggest trouble the 2.5 gives the auditor is the fact that the 2.5 normally considers himselfto be in a fine state of health and is rather bored with processing. When the preclear has reachedthe level of 2.5 from a lower level, he would quite commonly just as soon forego furtherprocessing. It is at this point that the auditor must apply his own personality to the situationand coax his preclear through this rather stagnant area on the tone scale.The 2.0 who is willing to work does not offer any particular problem to the auditor.Here the auditor can scan locks, he can run secondaries as individual moments of misemotion,but here the auditor may very well overestimate his preclear and decide to run, as routine,physical pain engrams. Here, the auditor can run physical pain engrams one after another, buthe will tie up more free theta by creating new locks on the case through the running of theseengrams than he gains out of the engrams. Any auditor is very ambitious for his preclear and islikely to begin running engrams long before the preclear is able to benefit from or even supportrunning them. Nevertheless, particularly in the case where the preclear has received a drug-hypnosis or has had a recent operation, some physical-pain engram may present itself at thislevel and insist on being run. The file clerk is usually working at 2.0, and the file clerk shouldbe very carefully consulted before any physical pain engrams are addressed. If physical painengrams are run on the 2.0, the auditor should be very careful to scan off the session ofauditing thoroughly, in order to knock apart the locks which are formed by the auditing itself.The 1.5 responds to the scanning of locks, but the auditor will find that the 1.5 willsometimes hang up in individual locks. When this happens, the lock may have to be run like anengram, perceptic by perceptic, until it is reduced. After this, lock scanning can continue. Thisis of benefit to the case, since the scanning of locks brings the preclear closer to the most severelocks, which can then be contacted and run. These heavy locks remain out of sight untilscanning brings to the preclear enough free theta to permit an address to heavy locks which are243"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"holding up the progress of the case. On a 1.5, secondaries can be located best which are at theanger level. The auditor can discover a moment when the preclear was dramatizing anger andcan ask the preclear to run through this moment or ask him to go back to an earlier momentwhen somebody was that angry with him. The preclear will discover an earlier lock where hehimself was the recipient of the anger he later dramatized, and ordinarily he will run this earlylock. The auditor should be very careful of any physical pain he runs on the 1.5. Here is alevel where any physical pain is a thoroughly greedy trap. The engram in the 1.5 has so muchauthority that when free theta approaches it, that theta is itself enturbulated. Thus, the auditorshould avoid running engrams at 1.5. The use of straight memory becomes very important at1.5. Here a trick of straight memory becomes very important. The auditor should try to find anincident of an ARC break or enforcement variety which the preclear can credit with thoroughand full reality. Actually, from this point on down the reality of the preclear can be confirmedand should be confirmed at every opportunity by straight memory contact with locks which thepreclear himself and without any assistance from the auditor fully credits as actually havinghappened. This boosts the preclear up the tone scale more swiftly than any other method ofprocessing which can be used from 1.5 on down.Here, the auditor should be particularly careful to keep the auditing scanned off andshould use any and every means to keep the free theta which he finds in the case as free aspossible. Bad auditing and auditor code breaks at this level can cost the preclear in one sessionmore theta than can be won in several sessions. The preclear at 1.5 commonly becomes angrywith the auditor. He is still at a level where he seeks to dominate, and his method of dominationis to express anger. This does not mean that the 1.5 is only angry or that he will not worksmoothly for the auditor. Usually, only bad auditing will cause anger. There are 1.5’s whichare wide open and which deceptively invite the running of engrams. There are 1.5’s which arethoroughly occluded. In either case exactly the same type of entheta is addressed and the samemethods of handling it are used.When one comes down to the 1.1, a great deal of care must be used because of thetremendous amount of entheta which exists on the case in proportion to the free theta. A 1.1may have enough theta endowment originally to want to be processed. His desire to beprocessed, however, is very tentative and he is intensely critical of his auditor. He is afraid,and with good reason, for he has so little free theta left in comparison to the entheta on his casethat bad auditing can bring about a much worsened condition. The 1.1 may not, however, beinterested in processing and may consider himself in good condition, despite a very bad recordin dealing with life. He is, quite commonly, chronically ill from one somatic or another. Hemay be diffident about his food. What free theta he has left is in such combat with the entheta,that he is continually on a border line. The auditor must recognize this. The auditor mustrecognize as well that a 1.1 can be insulting, can be sullen, can be thoroughly unwilling to beprocessed, and can be extremely trying. The patience of an auditor is easily exhausted whendealing with a 1.1, for the 1.1 may lie down on the couch and knowingly run completeimaginary incidents, reporting somatics and perceptics which he does not have. He maymanufacture for the auditor an entire past life. Further, he may unknowingly advance datawhich is wrong. He may consider, for instance, and believe that he is telling the truth, that hewas beaten a thousand times by his father, whereas his father laid hands on him but twice in hiswhole life. Or he may believe that he was treated royally by his parents, when actually theywere extremely non-survival in their attitude toward him. The auditor must remember that inboth the 1.5 and the 1.1, truth is not regarded as a very valuable commodity and is hard for thepreclear to contact. Although the 1.1 may continually advance protests and evidences as to hishonesty and open-heartedness, the auditor is dealing with a level where trickery is automatic.The auditor may actually succeed at this level in turning off chronic somatics, such as amigraine headache or ulcers, without decreasing the turbulence of the case. He has, evidently,merely turned an enMEST manifestation into an entheta manifestation, so that although thechronic somatic no longer troubles the 1.1 as physical pain, it troubles him exceedingly asmental aberration. Transfer of one somatic to another, or transfer of physical aberration tomental aberration can be expected to result if the auditor mistakes the preclear’s level on thetone scale and attempts to use methods of processing that are above the 1.1’s level. In a wide-open case, the auditor can be completely fooled, and can go on running the case with heavy244"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"methods ad infinitum (until the preclear tires of processing and refuses it), more and moreenturbulating the case, unless he pays careful attention to the preclear’s behavior in locating thepreclear on the tone scale chart.Probably the chief characteristic of the 0.5 as far as the auditor-preclear relationship isconcerned is the 0.5’s complete helplessness. Even if the 0.5 wants to be audited, the auditorcannot depend upon his preclear for any responsibility about processing, or about anythingelse. This case requires an auditor of great patience and endurance. The auditor is faced withan individual to whom black is white, good is bad, and all is lost. His preclear may run hoursof dub-in incidents if permitted, but the auditor has to be very careful how he steers the precleartoward real incidents, which should never be heavier than locks, preferably of the apathyvariety, because the slightest disapproval or lack of acceptance of what the preclear is sayingmay enturbulate all of the preclear’s meagre remaining theta. The 0.5 is only half a point abovedeath. Any auditor who uses methods heavier than straight memory and the running ofindividual light locks on a 0.5 runs a risk of causing some death manifestation in the preclear,either suicide or (occasionally) murder, and most certainly will depress the 0.5 down towardpretended death. However, if the auditor keeps his own case well processed so that he canpersevere in processing the 0.5 with the gentlest methods and so that he can preserve a veryhigh ARC (which will depend entirely on the auditor) with the preclear, he will sooner or laterhave a preclear who is beginning to come up into the 1.1 band. This rise on the scale may notbring the auditor any relief since 1.1 is a very unpleasant level, but it will be a great relief to thepreclear, although the auditor should not expect any thanks from the new 1.1. The averageauditor will not be working with a 0.1 in the very near future, since most pretended death casesare in hospitals, sanatoriums, or institutions where they are out of contact with the society.However the circumstances of the 0.1 in the society at this time have no bearing upon themethods used to process a 0.1, and no auditor should think that the principles of mindoperation change in any way in the case of the 0.1. The auditor who is invited to some privatesanatorium by an alert but baffled medical doctor may find that he has just such a case to dealwith. There are various methods of approaching the problem of the 0.1 case, but all of themadd up to one thing: cause the preclear to be aware of present time perceptics, or at least of theidea that there is such a thing as present time. In all other levels it is necessary to establish andmaintain high ARC between the auditor and the preclear, but here the main problem is toestablish ARC between the preclear and anything in present time, including, of course, theauditor. How this may be done will depend upon the auditor’s thorough understanding of theprinciples outlined in this book, for here is a case in which the theta might be considered to beninety-eight percent enturbulated. It has been seen that as the tone scale was descended, gentlerand gentler methods of processing had to be used. The auditor may feel, then, that there is nomethod of processing gentle enough for a 0.1, but the auditor should not overlook the fact thatthe mere presence of an auditor in the room with the preclear is, to some degree, processing.Starting from there, the auditor can begin to work to make present time interesting and attractiveto the preclear. The auditor’s presence for a few hours may build up enough affinity to make itpossible for the auditor to call the preclear’s attention to some object. When the preclearcommunicates with this object, by looking at it, the fact that the auditor is holding it, or alsolooking at it, will tend to establish an agreement about this object and some one thing in theworld will then have a little reality for this preclear.Future publications will deal more thoroughly with the processing of inaccessiblepsychotics, including the 0.1. But the principles which you have encountered while readingthis book are the principles upon which future and more refined techniques will be based andany auditor who has the opportunity and the perseverance to process such a case will find that,simple as these basics are, they are far more powerful than any means man has had before tobring light where there is darkness, to bring order out of disorder, and to convert unreason intoreason -- or entheta into theta.UNBURDENING ENGRAMSRecently I developed a technique called “Unburdening” which seems to haveconsiderable possibilities. I have not had sufficient opportunity to test thoroughly its245"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"potentialities or to locate it properly on the tone scale. I give it here for your information andwould greatly appreciate hearing about whatever results you achieve with it.Ordinarily the last engram on a case can be run providing it has not acquired too manylocks. Further, any engram seems to depend, for its inaccessibility, on the locks it hasaccumulated.The auditor occasionally finds it necessary to run an engram even though he cannot getall the perceptics which are contained in that engram. It would be valuable if he could obtain allthe perceptics and reduce or erase them. Unburdening would be a technique designed to assistthe auditor in running out all the perceptics.The engram, in this technique, is run until everything in it which can be contacted isreduced. Then the auditor lock scans the preclear from the moment of the engram up to presenttime through all the locks of that engram. The auditor has the locks scanned one or more times,working with the file clerk. Then the auditor, using again standard procedure for engrams, runsthat engram once more or twice more or until any additional material has been reduced. Then hehas the preclear scan all the locks of that engram again. Then he once more runs the engram.It is the charge in the locks which seals in the engram. By discharging the locks,through the technique of lock scanning, more and more perceptics should show up in theengram. Unburdening, then, would be the technique of thoroughly bringing to view everythingcontained in an engram by scanning its locks. Alternate running of the engram and scanning itslocks should bring about a maximal release of entheta.The practicality of this technique is certain. The extent of its usefulness has not beenthoroughly explored.It is completely assured that a physical pain engram underlies all misemotion and thatwhen misemotion is run from a secondary, a physical pain engram is commonly exposed toview. Indeed, the preclear may dive into the physical pain engram and start running it while theauditor is still attempting to get a discharge from the secondary. It also happens that when anauditor is trying to run an engram his preclear may suddenly run into the misemotion of asecondary (which should then be run).It also occurs commonly that the preclear, when the auditor is trying to run an engram,will soar up into the locks of that engram. This is the result, usually, of a bouncer in theengram. But bouncer or no bouncer, the locks are there and they are important. Thus, whenan engram is reduced, the locks may be run, after which more perceptics may be found.POSITIVE PROCESSINGA variation of technique which is of value to the auditor is “positive processing.” Thisconsists of addressing the theta on the case and bringing it to view. The auditor may become soengrossed in addressing entheta directly that he may overlook the fact that theta may be buriedunder the entheta. By looking for and bringing to view the theta, the auditor may improve thepreclear’s tone considerably.Below many areas of entheta on a track there may be what we could call deposits oftheta. The theta of the auditor and preclear addressed to such deposits of theta willdisenturbulate the entheta which may overlie such moments.Pleasure moments are, one could say, deposits of theta. Such deposits assist theconversion of entheta to theta. The running of pleasure moments then materially assists theraising of tone. One can use this in many ways and all these ways could be grouped under“positive processing.” There are probably innumerable variations of positive processing. Therunning of a pleasure moment just as though it were an engram, until all perceptics are246"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"recovered, is just one instance of positive processing. The scanning of chains of pleasuremoments is another variation. The running of “future pleasure moments” ties in theimagination but is just another variation of positive processing.Affinity, reality and communication can be used to excellent advantage in positiveprocessing. The auditor, in this instance, is not looking for ARC locks when ARC wasenforced or inhibited. He is looking for moments when they existed. By straight memory theauditor causes the preclear to recall moments when he actually felt he was receiving or givingaffinity or communication, or actually experiencing reality. The preclear fairly well down thescale may have to search for some time before he can recall an instance when he actually feltaffinity for something or some person or actually felt he was receiving affinity. Similarly, thepreclear may have difficulty finding a moment of actual communication -- he may be in anaudience or talking with a friend or even simply talking to a dog. Further, the auditor shouldremember that communication extends to perception and that actually seeing something orrecalling that something was heard or felt may discover a theta deposit. Causing the preclear torecall something he knew was truly real or even recall somebody agreeing thoroughly with himis another instance of positive processing.Straight memory on ARC positives is very valuable on low-tone cases. Further it isvaluable in any case as a means of ending a session. The auditor will find sometimes that whenhe gives positive processing he will get yawns from the preclear. This is particularly true ofscanning pleasure moments. These yawns indicate that the preclear has pleasure suppressors --that something makes him feel guilty for experiencing pleasure. By some standards, notsurvival ones, pleasure is seen to be wicked and the engrams of the preclear will be found tocontain admonitions against pleasure.Occasionally the auditor will find a preclear breaking into tears under positiveprocessing. Here, evidently (though several opinions could be advanced) the suppression ofpleasure is such that the overlying entheta is of the same value as that in a secondary engram.The tears of relief signify the progress of the preclear up from apathy through grief in certainincidents. For any incident, irrespective of the preclear’s tone, has its own position on the tonescale and, as it is reduced, comes up the scale in stages.There was once a whole philosophy devoted to pleasure -- hedonism. Survival ispleasure, but idle satisfaction of the senses without plan or progress toward any goal is itself(like Aesop’s grasshopper) destructive in the long run. It was this idle and purposelessgratification of the senses at which the moralist raged -- and with considerable justification.But better terminology should have been used. Pleasure is something neither man nor acivilization can do without -- its omission results in succumbing. In that happiness can befound to be the overcoming of not unknowable obstacles toward a known goal or thecontemplation of goals, one can see that idle pleasure would have to be static or destructivesensual gratification. Pleasure is seldom idle in that sense, but it is as often lazy and relaxing asit is dynamic and constructive. Man cannot live without it. And the auditor, using positiveprocessing will find it a helpful ally.The goal of processing is to raise the individual on the tone scale. Part of thisprocedure is the running out of all engrams in order to make the rise permanent. But theimportant thing is the rise itself. The behavior of a 4.0, or even a 3.5 is so far superior tonormal human behavior, the ability of these higher levels to provide happiness,accomplishment, creation, and joy in living is so great, that we tend to think of them as distantgoals simply because they are so high. But they are not so distant. Even as this book iscompleted, new methods, new approaches to a case are developing which make the higherranges of the tone scale easier to reach for more and more cases. The validation or positiveapproach to the case, the advent of dynamic straight wire (in which the effect of each dynamicon every other discovers all possible locks), the discovery of the fundamental nature of MESTlocks and the development of MEST technique, are but some of the new things that are comingoff the “drawing boards.” Dianetics does not rest or stay, it does not flag or halt. As theauditor and preclear continue their progress up the tone scale, they may be encouraged not onlyby their own successes but also by the fact that as they approach the goal, it is approaching247"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"them. A fact which has been forgotten in this time of war and spiritual pestilence is that therehave been times in man’s history and pre-history when he has succeeded. It has not all beengloom and hopelessness, else we would not be here today -- even as poorly as we are. Menhave lived to conquer all other forms of life, from the mastodon to the microbe. Men havelived to build walls and roads and pyramids which have defied the elements for thousands ofyears. Men have lived to write music which has pleased the gods and lines which have madethe angels sigh and the devil weep. This is a time for man to succeed again. Here is the word,the technology, the goal.

At the oppositeend of the spectrum of existence is Succumb.DynamicsThe dynamics are the urge to survive expressed through eightdivisions. (1) self, (2) sex, and the future generation, (3) thegroup, (4) mankind, (5) life, (6) MEST, (7) theta, (8) theSupreme Being.ImmortalityInfinite survival, the absolute goal of survival. The individualseeks this on the first dynamic as an organism and as a thetaentity and in the perpetuation of his name by his group. On thesecond dynamic he seeks it through his children, and so onthrough the eight dynamics. Life survives through thepersistence of theta. A species survives through the persistenceof the life in it. A culture survives through the persistence of thespecies using it. There is evidence that the theta of an individualmay survive as a personal entity from life to life, through manylives on Earth.PleasurePleasure is the reward of survival activity along any of thedynamics. Successes bring pleasure and survival.SuccumbSuccumbing is the ultimate penalty on nonsurvival activity. Thisis pain. Failures bring pain and death.HumanA process of perceiving and storing data,Thoughtcomputing conclusions, posing and resolving problems. Thepurpose of this is survival along all of the dynamics.IntelligenceThe ability to perceive, pose, and resolve problems. Intelligenceand the urge to survive (the dynamic) are both necessary tocontinued existence. The quantity of each varies fromindividual to individual and group to group. The dynamics areinhibited by engrams which block their flow of theta, or lifeforce, and disperse it. Intelligence is also inhibited by engrams,which enter false or improperly graded data into the analyticalmind.HappinessThe overcoming of not unknowable obstacles toward a knowngoal.AnalyticalThat portion of the mind which perceives Mind and retainsexperience data to compose and resolve problems and direct theorganism along the eight dynamics. It thinks in differences andsimilarities.Reactive MindThat portion of the mind which files and retains physical painand misemotion and seeks to direct the organism solely on astimulus-response basis. It thinks only in identities.Somatic MindThat portion of the mind which, at the direction of either thereactive or analytical mind, puts solutions into effect physically.TrainingA stimulus-response mechanism set up by the Pattern analyticalmind to carry out activity of either a routine or an emergencynature. The training pattern may be said to be held in the somaticmind, but it can be changed at will by the analytical mind.HabitA stimulus-response mechanism similar to the training patternbut set up by the reactive mind out of the content of engrams. Itcannot be changed at will by the analytical mind.AberrationIrrational behavior or computation (thinking). They are stimulus-response in nature and may be pro-survival or contra-survival.The engram is the basic source of aberrations.249"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"PV=IDxThis formula expresses the Potential Value of an individual. Irepresents Intelligence, and D represents Dynamic. Worth. If anindividual’s PV is high and is aligned with the dynamics towardsurvival, his worth may be said to be very high. A person with ahigh PV, however, may be aberrated so that his PV is reversedin the direction of succumbing and his worth is low. This maybe computed for any one of the eight dynamics or for all.ThetaThought, potentially independent of a material vessel or medium.Life force.

Death is the withdrawal oftheta from the organism.EnthetaTheta which is enturbulated with MEST (enMEST) in aninharmonious combination.EnMESTMEST which has been enturbulated by entheta or crushed toohard into theta and rendered less usable.PainThe alarm reaction to theta which has been crushed too severelyinto MEST. The penalty of non-survival activity.EngramAn encystment containing entheta and enMEST. A recording(possibly cellular) of a period of pain and unconsciousness (oranaten). Not available to the analytical mind as experience. Thesole source of aberrations and “psychosomatic illnesses.”LockAn analytical incident of greater or lesser enturbulence of thetawhich approximates the perceptics of an engram or chain ofengrams and therefore becomes trapped due to the physical painrecorded in the engram and remains as an encystment of entheta.SecondaryA lock of such magnitude that it must be run as anEngramengram in processing. A lock with great magnitude of entheta.ChargeThe accumulation of entheta in locks and secondaries whichcharges up the engrams and gives them their force to aberrate.DeathThe withdrawal of theta from an organism, leaving only MEST,in order to conquer new MEST and form another organismwhich can better survive.Life CycleThe periodic conquest of, withdrawal from, and reconquest ofMEST by theta. It is postulated that a given segment or entity oftheta undergoes birth, growth, death, birth, growth, death, etc.,each time learning more about the business of making MESTinto successful organisms which can better survive.EvolutionThere are four evolutionary tracks, evidently. Organismevolution, through natural selection, accident, and (evidencesuggests) outright planning. MEST evolution, brought aboutthrough the agency of life organisms. Theta evolution, apostulated process of learning in theta as a whole or as entities.And present-time ladder-of-support evolution, in which lesscomplicated organisms support more complicated organisms.Theta BodyThe postulated theta entity. The soul. Evidencesuggests that the theta body may, through many low-tone lives,become an entheta body, but that such an entheta body might becleared by dianetic processing.MEST BodyThe physical body. The organism in all its MEST aspects.250"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"PersonalityA complex of inherited (MEST, organic, theta) andenvironmental (aberration, education, present-time environment,nutrition, etc.) factors.GeneticPersonal characteristics and tendencies derived Personality fromthe three inheritance sources (MEST, organic line, theta).

Reality of the future (“I”’s concept of the future agreeswith past and present data, and “I” agrees that it does). Realitybetween two people (they agree on something). Reality in agroup (the majority in agreement).

If these do not agree, we saythat he does not know the reality (ours, that is, for we have onlyour own perceptions by which to judge the MEST conditions).There are emotions on the reality scale. One of them is shame.EmotionThis word is re-defined in Dianetics and is given an opposite forcomparison, “misemotion.” Previously the word emotion wasnever satisfactorily defined. Now it is defined as an organismmanifestation of position on the tone scale which is rationallyappropriate to the present-time environment and which trulyrepresents the present-time position on the tone scale. Rationalaffect.

The gradient scale is a way of thinkingabout the universe which approximates the actual conditions ofthe universe more closely than any other existing logical method.Introduction of An arbitrary may be considered as a factor anArbitrary introduced into a problem’s solution when that factordoes not derive from a known natural law but only from anopinion or authoritarian command. A problem resolved by dataderived from known natural laws resolves well and smoothlyand has a useful solution. When a problem is resolved byintroducing arbitraries (factors based on opinion or command butnot natural law) then that solution, when used, will ordinarilyrequire more arbitraries to make the solution applicable. Theharder one tries to apply the solution corrupted by arbitraries toany situation, the more arbitraries have to be introduced. This ingovernment, laws passed which contain arbitraries create newproblems which cannot be solved without more new arbitrariesand thus, rapidly, a top heavy and unworkable structure ofgovernment comes into being which would be workable only ifwholly re-designed in the light of known natural laws aboutgovernment.EvaluationA datum is as understood as it can be related to Data and otherdata.Value of DatumA datum is as important or valuable as it relates to survival.ComparableA datum can only be evaluated by comparison Magnitude withanother datum of comparable magnitude. This means that thebasic unit must, therefore, be two.AccessibilityThe desire of the preclear to be raised on the tone scale byprocessing. (In a past publication, the word “accessibility” wasused to mean not only the above but also the accessibility ofentheta on the case to various methods of processing. This lastmeaning is not used in the present work.) A case is consideredaccessible when it will work willingly with the auditor, no matterhow occluded the case may be.“I”The awareness of awareness center. Organisms are aware oftheir environment. Higher organisms are aware, also, of thisvery awareness. The “I” of the human being may be said to bethe center or monitor of this awareness of awareness.AltitudeA prestige which the auditor has in the eyes of the preclear. Asomewhat artificial position of the auditor which gives thepreclear greater confidence and therefore greater ability to runthan he would otherwise have. In the society in general, thereare four kinds of altitude an individual may have.Data AltitudeSignifying that the individual has a fund of knowledge gatheredfrom books and records, or sometimes from experience, withwhich others are not familiar. The college professor has dataaltitude.ComputationalSignifying that the individual has an outstanding Attitude abilityto think, to compute upon data. Albert Einstein hadcomputational altitude.PositionalDeriving from an arbitrarily assigned position. Military officersand bureaucrats often depend heavily upon positional altitude.PersonalThe individual who leads or makes an impressionPresenceupon others merely by his presence, by his exampleAltitudeand the fact of his existence, has personal presence altitude.Ghandi had this to a very high degree.CommandA somatic brought from a different part of the timeSomatictrack by some command phrase, such as “My arm hurts.” Thepreclear may have this somatic while running a prenatal engram254"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"although he was only three days conceived in the incident.Command somatics occur where the preclear is out of valence.False FourThe laughter and gaiety which the preclear exhibits when he hasthoroughly exhausted an incident of charge. There is nothingreally “false” about false four, except that it is often of very shortduration.Basic PurposeEven at the age of two or three years an individual seems toknow what his basic purpose is in life. Later this becomescorrupted by individual and social aberrations but is recovered indianetic processing. Possibly past lives have something to dowith forming basic purpose.Basic EngramThe first engram on a given chain of engrams.Basic AreaThe time track from the first recording on the sperm or ovumtrack to the first missed menstrual period of the mother.Basic-BasicThe first moment of pain, anaten, or discomfort in the currentlife of the individual.LanguageLocks in which the main aberrative content is in Locks terms oflanguage. These may be considered symbolic restimulators ofMEST locks, which are more fundamental.MEST LocksLocks which come about through the inhibition or enforcementof the individual’s experience or control of matter or energy orspace or time. It is postulated that the reduction of the MESTlocks in which the individual was made to go up or not permittedto come down will make any bouncer phrases in the caseinactive, and so on with all types of action phrases.Validation Processing in which the auditor, at least for one session, concentratesexclusively on the theta side of lock chains, not allowing thepreclear to run any but analytical moments on any given subject.When the preclear encounters too much entheta on a given chain,the auditor takes him to analytical moments on another subject(which moments constitute, of course, a parallel chain to thelocks on that subject) obtained from the file clerk. During thistype of processing somatics will turn on and off, sometimesseverely, but the auditor ignores them, and keeps bringing thepreclear back to analytical (not necessarily pleasure) moments.Validation technique should not be mixed with entheta technique.MEST Straight wire, repetitive straight wire (slow, Techniqueauditor-managed lock scanning), and lock scanning on MESTlocks. Language locks are found by straight wire only as a clueto the underlying MEST locks. MEST technique and validationtechnique may be combined and should be.
