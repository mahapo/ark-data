Before the beginning was a Cause and the entire purpose of the cause was the creationof effect.2. In the beginning and forever is the decision and the decision is TO BE.3. The first action of beingness is to assume a viewpoint.4. The second action of beingness is to extend from the viewpoint, points to view, whichare dimension points.5. Thus there is space created, for the definition of space is: viewpoint of dimension. Andthe purpose of a dimension point is space and a point of view.6. The action of a dimension point is reaching and withdrawing.7. And from the viewpoint to the dimension points there are connection and interchange.Thus new dimension points are made. Thus there is communication.8. And thus there is light.9. And thus there is energy.10. And thus there is life.11. But there are other viewpoints and these viewpoints outthrust points to view. And therecomes about an interchange amongst viewpoints; but the interchange is never otherwisethan in terms of exchanging dimension points.12. The dimension point can be moved by the viewpoint, for the viewpoint, in addition tocreative ability and consideration, possesses volition and potential independence ofaction; and the viewpoint, viewing dimension points, can change in relation to its ownor other dimension points or viewpoints. Thus comes about all the fundamentals thereare to motion.13. The dimension points are each and every one, whether large or small, SOLID. Andthey are solid solely because the viewpoints say they are solid.14. Many dimension points combine into larges gases, fluids or solids. Thus there ismatter. But the most valued point is admiration, and admiration is so strong its absencealone permits persistence.15. The dimension point can be different from other dimension points and thus can possessan individual quality. And many dimension points can possess a similar quality, andothers can possess a similar quality unto themselves. Thus comes about the quality ofclasses of matter.16. The viewpoint can combine dimension points into forms and the forms can be simple orcomplex and can be at different distances from the viewpoints and so there can becombinations of form. And the forms are capable of motion and the viewpoints arecapable of motion and so there can be motion of forms.1"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"17. And the opinion of the viewpoint regulates the consideration of the forms, their stillnessor their motion, and these considerations consist of assignment of beauty or ugliness tothe forms and these considerations alone are art.18. It is the opinions of the viewpoints that some of these forms should endure. Thus thereis survival.19. And the viewpoint can never perish; but the form can perish.20. And the many viewpoints, interacting, become dependent upon one another’s formsand do not choose to distinguish completely the ownership of dimension points and socomes about a dependency upon the dimension points and upon the other viewpoints.21. From this comes a consistency of viewpoint of the interaction of dimension points andthis, regulated, is TIME.22. And there are universes.23. The universes, then, are three in number: the universe created by one viewpoint, theuniverse created by every other viewpoint, the universe created by the mutual action ofviewpoints which is agreed to be upheld - the physical universe.24. And the viewpoints are never seen. And the viewpoints consider more and more thatthe dimension points are valuable. And the viewpoints try to become the anchor pointsand forget that they can create more points and space and forms. Thus comes aboutscarcity. And the dimension points can perish and so the viewpoints assume that they,too, can perish.25. Thus comes about death.26. The manifestations of pleasure and pain, of thought, emotion and effort, of thinking, ofsensation, of affinity, reality, communication, of behavior and being are thus derivedand the riddles of our universe are apparently contained and answered herein. There ISbeingness, but Man believes there is only becomingness.28. The resolution of any problem posed hereby is the establishment of viewpointsand dimension points. the betterment of condition and concourse amongstdimension points, and, thereby, viewpoints, and the remedy of abundance orscarcity in all things, pleasant or ugly, by the rehabilitation of the ability of theviewpoint to assume points of view and create and uncreate, neglect, start, changeand stop dimension points of any kind at the determinism of the viewpoint.Certainty in all three universes must be regained, for certainty, not data, isknowledge.29. In the opinion of the viewpoint, any beingness, anything, is better than nothing,any effect is better than no effect, any universe better than no universe, any particlebetter than no particle, but the particle of admiration is best of all.30. And above these things there might be speculation only. And below these things thereis the playing of the game. But these things which are written here Man canexperience and know. And some may care to teach these things and some may care touse them to assist those in distress and some may desire to employ them to makeindividuals and organizations more able and so give to Earth a culture of which we canbe proud.Humbly tendered as a gift to Manby L.Ron Hubbard, April 23, 19532"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE Qs(THE PRELOGICS)Q1 SELF-DETERMINISM IS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR OF ALL LIFEIMPULSES.(A) DEFINITION OF SELF-DETERMINISM: THE ABILITY TO LOCATE IN SPACEAND TIME ENERGY AND MATTER, ALSO THE ABILITY TO LOCATE INSPACE AND TIME ENERGY AND MATTER, ALSO THE ABILITY TOCREATE SPACE AND TIME IN WHICH TO CREATE AND LOCATE ENERGYAND MATTER.(B) THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SOURCE OF THAT WHICH PLACESMATTER AND ENERGY AND ORIGINATES SPACE AND TIME IS NOTNECESSARY TO THE RESOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM AT THIS TIME.Q2 THETA CREATES SPACE, ENERGY AND OBJECTS BY POSTULATES.Q3 UNIVERSES ARE CREATED BY THE APPLICATION OF SELF-DETERMINISM ON EIGHT DYNAMICS.Q4 SELF-DETERMINISM, APPLIED, WILL CREATE, ALTER, CONSERVE ANDPOSSIBLY DESTROY UNIVERSES.Q5 THE ACTION CYCLE IS ONE OF THE ABILITIES OF A THETAN.

By this it is meant that an idea or opinion is, fundamentally,superior to space, energy, and time, or organizations of form, since it is conceived thatspace, energy, and time are themselves broadly agreed-upon considerations. That so manyminds agree brings about Reality in the form of space, energy, and time. Thesemechanics, then, of space, energy, and time are the product of agreed-upon considerationsmutually held by life.The aspects of existence when viewed from the level of Man, however, is a reverse ofthe greater truth above for Man works on the secondary opinion that mechanics are real, andthat his own personal considerations are less important than space, energy, and time. This is aninversion. These mechanics of space, energy, and time, the forms, objects and combinationsthereof, have taken such precedence in Man that they have become more important thanconsiderations as such,and so his ability is overpowered and he is unable to act freely in theframework of mechanics. Man, therefore, has an inverted view. Whereas considerations suchas those he daily makes are the actual source of space, energy, time and forms, Man isoperating so as not to alter his basic considerations; he therefore invalidates himself bysupposing another determinism of space, energy, time and form. Although he is part of thatwhich created these, he gives them such strength and validity that his own considerationsthereafter must fall subordinate to space, energy, time, and form, and so he cannot alter theUniverse in which he dwells.The freedom of an individual depends upon that individual’s freedom to alter hisconsiderations of space,energy, time, and forms of life and his roles in it. If he cannot changehis mind about these, he is then fixed and enslaved amidst barriers such as those of thephysical universe, and barriers of his own creation. Man thus is seen to be enslaved by barriersof his own creation. He creates these barriers himself, or by agreeing with things which holdthese barriers to be actual.There is a basic series of assumptions in processing, which assumptions do not alterthe philosophy of Scientology. The first of these assumptions is that Man can have a greaterfreedom. The second is that so long as he remains relatively sane, he desires a greater freedom.And the third assumption is that the auditor desires to deliver a greater freedom to that personwith whom he is working. If these assumptions are not agreed upon and are not used, thenauditing degenerates into “the observation of effect”, which is, of course, a goal-less, soullesspursuit, and is, indeed, a pursuit which has degraded what is called modern science.The goal of processing is to bring an individual into such thorough communication withthe physical universe that he can regain the power and ability of his own considerations(postulates).4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE AXIOMS OF SCIENTOLOGYAXIOM 1.

Is-ness is an apparency, it is not an Actuality. TheActuality is As-is-ness altered so as to obtain a persistency.Unreality is theconsequence and apparency of the practice of Not-is-ness.AXIOM 28.COMMUNICATION IS THE CONSIDERATION AND ACTION OFCOMPELLING AN IMPULSE OR PARTICLE FROM SOURCE-POINTACROSS A DISTANCE TO RECEIPT POINT, WITH THE INTENTION OFBRINGING INTO BEING AT THE RECEIPT-POINT A DUPLICATIONAND UNDERSTANDING OF THAT WHICH EMANATED FROM THESOURCE- POINT.The formula of Communication is: Cause, Distance, Effect, with Intention,Attention and Duplication WITH UNDERSTANDING. The component parts ofCommunication are Consideration, Intention, Attention, Cause, Source-point,Distance, Effect, Receipt-point, Duplication, Understanding, the Velocity of theimpulse or particle, Nothingness or Somethingness. A non-communicationconsists of Barriers. Barriers consist of Space, Interpositions (such as wallsand screens of fast-moving particles), and Time. A communication, bydefinition, does not need to be two-way. When a communication is returned,the formula is repeated, with the receipt-point now becoming a source point andthe former source-point now becoming a receipt-point.AXIOM 29.IN ORDER TO CAUSE AN AS-IS-NESS TO PERSIST, ONE MUSTASSIGN OTHER AUTHORSHIP TO THE CREATION THAN HIS OWN.OTHERWISE HIS VIEW OF IT WOULD CAUSE ITS VANISHMENT.Any space, energy, form, object, individual, or physical universe condition canexist only when an alteration has occurred of the original As-is-ness so as toprevent a casual view from vanishing it. In other words, anything which ispersisting must contain a “lie” so that the original consideration is notcompletely duplicated.AXIOM 30.THE GENERAL RULE OF AUDITING IS THAT ANYTHING WHICHIS IS UNWANTED AND YET PERSISTS MUST BE THOROUGHLYVIEWED, AT WHICH TIME IT WILL VANISH.If only partially viewed, its intensity, at least, will decrease.AXIOM 31.GOODNESS AND BADNESS, BEAUTIFULNESS AND UGLINESS,ARE ALIKE CONSIDERATIONS AND HAVE NO OTHER BASIS THANOPINION.AXIOM 32.ANYTHING WHICH IS NOT DIRECTLY OBSERVED TENDS TOPERSIST.AXIOM 33.

This has the technical name of “Basic Truth”.AXIOM 36.A LIE IS A SECOND POSTULATE, STATEMENT OR CONDITIONDESIGNED TO MASK A PRIMARY POSTULATE WHICH ISPERMITTED TO REMAIN.EXAMPLES:Neither truth nor a lie is a motion or alteration of a particle from one position toanother.A lie is a statement that a particle having moved did not move, or a statementthat a particle, not having moved, did move.The basic lie is that a consideration which was made was not made or that it wasdifferent.AXIOM 37.WHEN A PRIMARY CONSIDERATION IS ALTERED BUT STILLEXISTS, PERSISTENCE IS ACHIEVED FOR THE ALTERINGCONSIDERATION.All persistence depends on the Basic Truth, but the persistence is of the alteringconsideration, for the Basic Truth has neither persistence nor impersistence.AXIOM 38. 1: STUPIDITY IS THE UNKNOWNNESS OF CONSIDERATION.2: MECHANICAL DEFINITION: STUPIDITY IS UNKNOWNESS OFTIME, PLACE, FORM AND EVENT.1: TRUTH IS THE EXACT CONSIDERATION.2: TRUTH IS THE EXACT TIME, PLACE, FORM AND EVENT.Thus we see that failure to discover Truth brings about stupidity.Thus we see that the discovery of Truth would bring about an As-is-ness byactual experiment.Thus we see that an ultimate truth would have no time, place, form or event.Thus, then, we perceive that we can achieve a persistence only when we mask atruth.Lying is an alteration of time, place, event, or form.Lying becomes Alter-is-ness, becomes Stupidity.

Auditing is for thepreclear, is intended to improve the preclear’s case. Auditing is not just a matter of good form.The reason some students do not accomplish auditing is that they become so orientedon form alone that they forget the purpose of the form.Good auditing form and correct sessioning obtains many times the result of bad formand incorrect sessioning. But total form and no effort to do something for the preclear results inno auditing.The result comes before the form in importance. Because students may use this idea toexcuse lack of form, Q and A-ing, and to squirrel with their processes, the datum becomesunpopular with supervisors.A student should first be held responsible for the state of the preclear during and aftersessions and made to know that as an auditor he is there to get a fast, good result. The studentshould then be taught that he can get a better, faster result with better form. After that thestudent should be taught that Scientology results are only obtained by correct and exactduplication of Scientology processes, not by off-beat variations.The student wants to know how to do this or that. Refer him to his materials on how todo the most fundamental actions, but MAKE HIM OR HER DO IT. And keep up a runningrefrain that you want results, results, results, on his preclear.The student will be all thumbs and faint. The Supervisor may be horrified by the goofs.But don’t bother with the goofs. Just demand results on the preclear, results on the preclear,results on the preclear.17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"This action by the Supervisor will teach the student (a) that he or she is supposed to getresults in auditing and (b) that results can be obtained and (c) that he or she sure needs betterskill.So the first address in training is to teach those above three things (a), (b) and (c).You can’t teach a student who doesn’t realize that results in the preclear depend on theauditor and auditing and that results are EXPECTED from auditing; who believes results can’tbe obtained from auditing or wants to prove auditing doesn’t work; and who doesn’t yet knowthat he or she doesn’t know. THESE are the barriers to training and a good auditor.The gradient approach to the mind is vital. Clearing will not occur without it. But thegradient approach to auditing can be overdone to a point where the student completely losessight of why he is auditing.(1) First and foremost the auditor ACCOMPLISHES something for the preclearand without that there is neither sense nor purpose to auditing;(2) Excellent form accomplishes more for the preclear faster; and(3) Exact duplication of processes alone returns standard high level results on allpreclears.The student thrown in over his head learns:(A) Results in the preclear depend on the auditor and auditing and that results areexpected from auditing;(B) That results CAN be obtained in auditing and the better the form andduplication, the better the results; and(C) That the student has more to learn about auditing and that the student doesn’t yetknow.Therefore the Supervisor must teach the student:(a) That he or she is supposed to get results in auditing;(b) That Scientology can obtain results; and(c) That better form and duplication obtain better, faster results.I dare say many students learn things just because they are told to and find norelationship between form, duplication and the preclear. Let them fall on their heads and yetobtain results and this attitude will change - and you’ll save us a lot of off-beat nonsense andcase failures in organizations and the field.18"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE CREDO OF A GOOD AND SKILLED MANAGERTo be effective and successful a manager must:1.

By symbiote is meant all entities and energies which aid survival.DYNAMIC TWO is the urge of the individual toward survival through procreation; it includesboth the sex act and the raising of progeny, the care of children and their symbiotes.DYNAMIC THREE is the urge of the individual toward survival for the group or the group forthe group and includes the symbiotes of that group.DYNAMIC FOUR is the urge of the individual toward survival for Mankind or the urgetoward survival of Mankind for Mankind as well as the group for Mankind, etc., and includesthe symbiotes of Mankind.THE ABSOLUTE GOAL of survival is immortality or infinite survival. This is sought by theindividual in terms of himself as an organism, as a spirit or as a name or as his children, as agroup of which he is a member or as Mankind and the progeny and symbiotes of others as wellas his own.The reward of survival activity is PLEASURE.The ultimate penalty of destructive activity is death or complete non-survival, and is PAIN.Successes raise the survival potential toward infinite survival.Failures lower the survival potential toward death.The human mind is engaged upon perceiving and retaining data, composing or computingconclusions and posing and resolving problems related to organisms along all four dynamics;and the purpose of perception, retention, concluding and resolving problems is to direct itsown organism and symbiotes and other organisms and symbiotes along the four dynamicstoward survival.INTELLIGENCE is the ability to perceive, pose and resolve problems.THE DYNAMIC is the tenacity to life and vigor and persistence in surivival.BOTH THE DYNAMIC AND INTELLIGENCE are necessary to persist and accomplish andneither is a constant quantity from individual to individual, group to group.THE DYNAMICS are inhibited by engrams, which lie across them and disperse life force.INTELLIGENCE is inhibited by engrams, which feed false or improperly graded data into theanalyzer.HAPPINESS is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal and,transiently, the contemplation of or indulgence in pleasure.THE ANALYTICAL MIND is that portion of the mind which perceives and retains experiencedata to compose and resolve problems and direct the organism along the four dynamics.

Depending on the direction in which the scale is graduated,there could be an infinity of wrongness or an infinity of rightness.Absolutes are considered unobtainable.The difference between one point on these scales and another point could be as differentor as wide as the entire range of the scale itself, or it could be so tiny as to need the mostminute discernment for its establishment.Life in its highest state (top of the scale) is understanding. Life in its lower states is in alower level of understanding.Understanding is composed of Affinity, Reality and Communication. This triangle tellsus that the co-existent relationship between affinity, reality and communication is such thatnone can be decreased without decreasing the other two. Of the three, COMMUNICATION isby far the most important. Affinity and reality exist to further communication. Under theheading of affinity we have, for instance, all the varied emotions which go from apathy at 0.1through grief, fear, anger, antagonism, boredom, enthusiasm, exhilaration and serenity INTHAT ORDER. It is affinity and this rising scale of the characteristics of emotion which giveus the Tone Scale.The characteristics and potentiality of the top of the scale or near the top are unboundedcreation, outflow, certainty, certainty of awareness, going-awayness, explosion, holding apart,spreading apart, letting go, reaching, goals of a causative nature, widening space, freedomfrom time, separateness, differentiation, givingness of sensation, vaporizingness,glowingness, lightness, whiteness, desolidifyingness, total awareness, total understanding,total ARC.The bottom of the scale and the vicinity around it includes death, inflow, certainty (ofunawareness), coming-backness, implosion, letting-come-together, pulling together, holdingtogether, with-drawing, effect goals (ambition to be an effect rather than a cause), contractingspace, no time or infinite time in a moment, connectingness, identification, identity,receivingness of sensation, condensation, blackness, solidification, no awareness, nounderstanding, no ARC.The various characteristics or intentions are observable for any dynamic and anyuniverse.Between these two extremes is the mean of action where complete freedom to do any ofthese things of the top or bottom of the scale is exercised. Therefore, somewhere between 3.5on the Tone Scale and 36.5, there is action.Wherever you find an individual on any of the following scales, that is his level ofARC.

Doesnot compulsively prevent effect on self.EFFECT BELIEVED NECESSARY ON OTHERS:He has considerable ability to create effects on others but is not under compulsion tocreate effects, he is not compelled to affect other people’s lives, he grants beingness,can tolerate differences in people.CONSERVATISMEFFECT TOLERABLE ON SELF:Not very willing to receive effects that change the status quo. Not willing to bequestioned on some subjects, not willing to have other people’s attention directed tohim such as being pointed out in a crowd, wearing outstanding clothes, etc.EFFECT BELIEVED NECESSARY ON OTHERS:Believes effects which preserve the status quo are necessary. Somewhat cautious aboutcreating an effect, witholds those things he thinks might hurt your feelings, or that youmight not approve of. Believes he should not create too much effect but should be “oneof the crowd”. Should respect the privacy of others.BOREDOMEFFECT TOLERABLE ON SELF:Will receive any effect which produces a pleasant randomity, wants to be entertainedbut otherwise doesn’t like to be shifted.

Must cause an effect but is unwilling to be known as the causeof bad effects. If accused of having created bad effects he will claim his intention wasgood.

Someone else’s grief might beenough effect to cause him to cry. A rough word might not be tolerable.EFFECT BELIEVED NECESSARY ON OTHERS:Believes that a large effect would have to be created to overcome his overwhelmingopposition, but the idea of creating an effect on others produces the idea of loss andthough he must create vast effects, he is very close to the idea that he cannot createANY effect, thus the only thing he can do about it is cry.68"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"APATHYEFFECT TOLERABLE ON SELF:Can accept even less effect here.

the application of this is accomplished by negativeorientation of beingness, havingness and doingness on each of eight dynamics in the present,past and future.II: BODIESAXIOM: In life experience energy becomes doingness.AXIOM: Compulsive position precedes compulsive thinking.AXIOM: That which changes the preclear in space can evaluate for him.FORMULA II: Permit the preclear to discover that he handles bodies and allow him to handlebodies in mock-ups and actuality; and remedy his thirst for attention which he has received bycontagion from bodies.III: SPACEPRE-LOGIC: Theta creates space and time and objects to locate in them.DEFINITION: Space is a viewpoint of dimension.AXIOM: Energy derives from imposition of space between terminals and a reduction andexpansion of that space.FORMULA III: Permit the preclear to regain his ability to create space and impose it uponterminals, to remove it from between terminals and to regain his security concerning thestability of MEST space.IV: HAVINGNESSAXIOM: In life experience matter becomes havingness.OBSERVATION: To a thetan ANYTHING is better than nothing.OBSERVATION: Any preclear is suffering from problems of too little havingness any anyreduction of his existing energy, if not replaced, will cause him to drop in tone.FORMULA IV: The remedy of problems of havingness is accomplished by creating anabundance of all things.As the preclear has rendered automatic his desires and ability to create and destroy, and thushas placed havingness beyond his control, the Auditor should place in the control of thepreclear his automaticities of havingness and unhavingness and permit him, on his own self-determinism, to balance his havingness.V: TERMINALSAXIOM: Space exists by reason of anchor points.81"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"DEFINITION: An anchor point is any particle or mass or terminal.AXIOM: Energy is derived from mass by fixing two terminals in proximity in space.AXIOM: Self-determinism is related to the ability to impose space between terminals.AXIOM: Cause is a potential source of flow.AXIOM: Effect is a potential receipt of flow.AXIOM: Communication is the duplication at the receipt point of that which emanated at acause point.AXIOM: Wrongness in terms of flow is inflow.FORMULA V: The thetan is rehabilitated as to energy and terminals by remedying hispostulates about outflow and inflow and drills relating to the outflow and inflow of energyaccording to the above axioms.VI: SYMBOLIZATIONDEFINITION: A symbol is an idea fixed in energy and mobile in space.FORMULA VI: The thetan who has been moved about by symbols is strengthened by mockingup and moving about and fixing in space ideas which have formerly moved him.VII: BARRIERSAXIOM: The MEST universe is a game consisting of barriers.DEFINITION: A barrier is space, energy, object, obstacles, or time.FORMULA VII: Problems of barriers or their lack are resolved by contacting and penetrating,creating and destroying, validating and neglecting barriers by changing them or substitutingothers for them, by fixing and unfixing attention upon their somethingness and nothingness.VIII: DUPLICATIONFUNDAMENTAL: The basic action of existence is duplication.LOGIC: All operating principles of life may be derived from duplication.AXIOM: Communication is as exact as it approaches duplication.AXIOM: Unwillingness to be cause is monitored by unwillingness to be duplicated.AXIOM: Unwillingness to be an effect is monitored by unwillingness to duplicate.AXIOM: An inability to remain in a geographical position brings about an unwillingness toduplicate.AXIOM: An enforced fixation in a geographical position brings about an unwillingness toduplicate.AXIOM: Inability to duplicate on any dynamic is the primary degeneration of the thetan.82"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"AXIOM: Perception depends upon duplication.AXIOM: Communication depends upon duplication.AXIOM: In the MEST universe, the single crime is duplication.FORMULA VIII: The primary ability and willingness of the thetan to duplicate must berehabilitated by handling desires, enforcements and inhibitions relating to it on all dynamics.The Creation of Human Ability83"}]
