Far simpler than physics orchemistry, it compares with them in the exactness of its axioms and is on a considerably higherechelon of usefulness. The hidden source of all psycho-somatic ills and human aberration hasbeen discovered and skills have been developed for their invariable cure.Dianetics is actually a family of sciences embracing the various humanities andtranslating them into usefully precise definitions. The present volume deals with IndividualDianetics and is a handbook containing the necessary skills both for the handling ofinterpersonal relations and the treatment of the mind. With the techniques presented in thishandbook the psychiatrist, psycho-analyst and intelligent layman can successfully andinvariably treat all psycho-somatic ills and inorganic aberrations. More importantly, the skillsoffered in this handbook will produce the dianetic clear, an optimum individual withintelligence considerably greater than the current normal, or the dianetic release, an individualwho has been freed from his major anxieties or illnesses. The release can be done in less thantwenty hours of work and is a state superior to any produced by several years of psycho-analysis, since the release will not release.Dianetics is an exact science and its application is on the order of, but simpler than,engineering. Its axioms should not be confused with theories since they demonstrably exist asnatural laws hitherto undiscovered. Man has known many portions of dianetics in the pastthousands of years, but the data was not evaluated for importance, was not organized into abody of precise knowledge. In addition to things known, if not evaluated, dianetics includes alarge number of new discoveries of its own about thought and the mind.The axioms may be found on Page 42 of this volume. Understood and applied, theyembrace the field of human endeavor and thought and yield precision results.The first contribution of dianetics is the discovery that the problems of thought andmental function can be resolved within the bounds of the finite universe, which is to say that alldata needful to the solution of mental action and Man’s endeavor can be measured, sensed andexperienced as scientific truths independent of mysticism or metaphysics. The various axiomsare not assumptions or theories -- the case of past ideas about the mind -- but are laws whichcan be subjected to the most vigorous laboratory and clinical tests.The first law of dianetics is a statement of the dynamic principle of existence. THE DYNAMIC PRINCIPLE OF EXISTENCE IS: SURVIVE!No behavior or activity has been found to exist without this principle. It is not new thatlife is surviving. It is new that life has as its entire dynamic urge only survival.Survival is divided into four dynamics. Survival can be understood to lie in any one ofthe dynamics and by faulty logic can be explained in terms of any one dynamic. A man can besaid to survive for self alone and by this all behavior can be formulated. He can be said tosurvive for sex alone and by sex alone all behavior can be formulated. He can be said tosurvive for the group only or for Mankind only and in either of these the entire endeavor andbehavior of the individual can be equated and explained. These are four equations of survival,each one apparently true. However, the entire problem of the purpose of Man cannot beresolved unless one admits all four dynamics in each individual. So equated, the behavior of1"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the individual can be estimated with precision. These dynamics then embrace the activity ofone or many men.DYNAMIC ONE: The urge of the individual to reach the highest potential of survival in termsof self and his immediate symbiotes.DYNAMIC TWO: The urge of the individual to reach the highest potential of survival in termsof sex, the act and the creation of children and their rearing.DYNAMIC THREE: The urge of the individual to reach the highest potential of survival interms of the group, whether civil, political, or racial, and the symbiotes of that group.DYNAMIC FOUR: The urge of the individual to reach the highest potential of survival in termsof Mankind and the symbiotes of Mankind.Thus motivated, the individual or a society seeks survival and no human activity of anykind has other basis: experiment, investigation and long testing demonstrated that theunaberrated individual, the clear, was motivated in his actions and decisions by all the abovedynamics and not one alone.The clear, the goal of dianetic therapy, can be created from psychotic, neurotic,deranged, criminal or normal people if they have organically sound nervous systems. Hedemonstrates the basic nature of Mankind and that basic nature has been found uniformly andinvariably to be good. That is now an established scientific fact, not an opinion. The clear has attained a stable state on a very high plane. He is persistent and vigorousand pursues life with enthusiasm and satisfaction. He is motivated by the four dynamics asabove. He has attained the full power and use of hitherto hidden abilities.The inhibition of one or more dynamics in an individual causes an aberrated condition,tends toward mental derangement and psycho-somatic illness and causes the individual to makeirrational conclusions and act, still in an effort to survive, in destructive ways.Dianetic technique deletes, without drugs, hypnotism, surgery, shock or other artificialmeans, the blocks from these various dynamics. The removal of these blocks permits the freeflow of the various dynamics and, of course, results in a heightened persistency in life and amuch higher intelligence.The precision of dianetics makes it possible to impede or release these dynamics at willwith invariable results.The hidden source of all inorganic mental disturbance and psycho-somatic illness wasone of the discoveries of dianetics. This source had been unknown and unsuspected, thoughvigorously sought, for thousands of years. That the discovered source is the source requiresless laboratory proof than would have been necessary to have proven the correctness ofWilliam Harvey’s discovery of the circulation of the blood. The proof does not depend upon alaboratory test with complicated apparatus but can be made in any group of men by anyintelligent individual.The source of aberration has been found to be a hitherto unsuspected sub-mind which,complete with its own recordings, underlies what man understands to be his “conscious” mind.The concept of the unconscious mind is replaced in dianetics by the discovery that the“unconscious” mind is the only mind which is always conscious. In dianetics this sub-mind iscalled the reactive mind. A holdover from an earlier step in Man’s evolution, the reactive mindpossesses vigor and command power on a cellular level. It does not “remember”; it records anduses the recordings only to produce action. It does not “think”; it selects recordings andimpinges them upon the “conscious” mind and the body without the knowledge or consent ofthe individual. The only information the individual has of such action is his occasional2"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"perception that he is not acting rationally about one thing or another and cannot understandwhy. There is no Censor.The reactive mind operates exclusively on physical pain and painful emotion. It is notcapable of differentiative thought but acts on the stimulus-response basis. This is the principleon which the animal mind functions. It does not receive its recordings as memory orexperience but only as forces to be reactivated. It receives its recordings as cellular engramswhen the “conscious” mind is “unconscious.”In a drugged state, when anaesthetized as in an operation, when rendered“unconscious” by injury or illness, the individual yet has his reactive mind in full operation.He may not be “aware” of what has taken place, but, as dianetics has discovered and canprove, everything which happened to him in the interval of “unconsciousness” was fully andcompletely recorded. This information is unappraised by his conscious mind, neither evaluatednor reasoned. It can, at any future date, become reactivated by similar circumstances observedby the awake and conscious individual. When any such recording, an engram, becomesreactivated, it has command power. It shuts down the conscious mind to greater or lesserdegree, takes over the motor controls of the body and causes behavior and action to which theconscious mind, the individual himself, would never consent. He is, nevertheless, handled likea marionette by his engrams.The antagonistic forces of the exterior environment thus become entered into theindividual himself without the knowledge or consent of the individual. And there they create aninterior world of force which exerts itself not only against the exterior world but against theindividual himself. Aberration is caused by what has been done to not done by the individual.Man has unwittingly long aided the reactive mind by supposing that a person, when“unconscious” from drugs, illness, injury or anaesthetic, had no recording ability. This permitsan enormous amount of data to enter into the reactive bank since none have been careful tomaintain silence around an “unconscious” person. The invention of language and the entranceof language into the engram bank of the reactive mind seriously complicates the mechanisticreactions. The engrams containing language impinge themselves upon the conscious mind ascommands. Engrams then contain command value much higher than any in the exterior world.Thought is directed and motivated by the irrational engrams. Thought processes are disturbednot only by these engramic commands but also by the fact that the reactive mind reduces, byregenerating unconsciousness, the actual ability to think. Few people possess, because of this,more than 10% of their potential awareness.The entire physical pain and painful emotion of a lifetime, whether the individual“knows” about it or not, is contained, recorded, in the engram bank. Nothing is forgotten. Andall physical pain and painful emotion, no matter how the individual may think he has handledit, is capable of re-inflicting itself upon him from this hidden level, unless that pain is removedby dianetic therapy.The engram and only the engram causes aberration and psycho-somatic illness.Dianetic therapy may be briefly stated. Dianetics deletes all the pain from a lifetime.When this pain is erased in the engram bank and refiled as memory and experience in thememory banks, all aberrations and psycho-somatic illnesses vanish, the dynamics are entirelyrehabilitated and the physical and mental being regenerate.Dianetics leaves an individual full memory but without pain. Exhaustive tests havedemonstrated that hidden pain is not a necessity but is invariably and always a liability to thehealth, skill, happiness and survival potential of the individual. It has no survival value.The method which is used to refile pain is another discovery. Man has unknowinglypossessed another process of remembering of which he has not been cognizant. Here andthere a few have known about it and used it without realizing what they did or that they did3"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"something which Man as a whole did not know could be done. This process is returning.Wide awake and without drugs an individual can return to any period of his entire lifeproviding his passage is not blocked by engrams. Dianetics developed techniques forcircumventing these blocks and reducing them from the status of Powerful Unknown to usefulmemory.The technique of therapy is done in what is called a dianetic reverie. The individualundergoing this process sits or lies in a quiet room accompanied by a friend or professionaltherapist who acts as auditor. The auditor directs the attention of the patient to the patient’s selfand then begins to place the patient in various periods of the patient’s life merely by telling himto go there rather than remember.All therapy is done, not by remembering or associating, but by travel on the time track.Every human being has a time track. It begins with life and it ends with death. It is a sequenceof events complete from portal to portal as recorded.The conscious mind, in dianetics, is called by the somewhat more precise term ofanalytical mind. The analytical mind consists of the “I” (the center of awareness), allcomputational ability of the individual, and the standard memory banks which are filled with allpast perceptions of the individual, awake or normally asleep (all material which is notengramic). No data are missing from these standard banks, all are there, barring physicalorganic defects, in full motion, color, sound, tactile, smell and all other senses. The “I” maynot be able to reach his standard banks because of reactive data which bar portions of thestandard banks from the view of “I.”Cleared, “I” is able to reach all moments of his lifetime without exertion or discomfortand perceive all he has ever sensed, recalling them in full motion, color, sound, tone and othersenses. The completeness and profusion of data in the standard banks is a discovery ofdianetics, and the significance of such recalls is yet another discovery.The auditor directs the travel of “I” along the patient’s time track. The patient knowseverything which is taking place, is in full control of himself, and is able to bring himself to thepresent whenever he likes. No hypnotism or other means are used. Man may not have knownhe could do this but it is simple.The auditor, with precision methods, recovers data from the earliest “unconscious”moments of the patient’s life, such “unconsciousness” being understood to be caused by shockor pain, not mere unawareness. The patient thus contacts the cellular level engrams. Returnedto them and progressed through them by the auditor, the patient re-experiences these momentsa few times, when they are then erased and refiled automatically as standard memory. So far asthe auditor and the patient can discover, the entire incident has now vanished and does notexist. If they searched carefully in the standard banks they would find it again but refiled as“Once aberrative, do not permit as such into computer.” Late areas of “unconsciousness” areimpenetrable until early ones are erased.The amount of discomfort experienced by the patient is minor. He is repelled mainly byengramic commands which variously dictate emotion and reaction. In a release, the case is not progressed to the point of complete recall. In a clear, fillmemory exists throughout the lifetime, with the additional bonus that he has photographicrecall in color, motion, sound, etc., as well as optimum computational ability.The psycho-somatic illnesses of the release are reduced, ordinarily, to a level wherethey do not thereafter trouble him. In a clear, psycho-somatic illness has become non-existentand will not return since its actual source is nullified permanently.The dianetic release is comparable to a current normal or above. The dianetic clear is toa current normal individual as the current normal is to the severely insane.4"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Dianetics elucidates various problems with its many discoveries, its axioms, itsorganization and its technique. In the progress of its development many astonishing data werethrust upon it, for when one deals with natural laws and measurable actualities which producespecific and invariable results, one must accept what Nature holds, not what is pleasing ordesired.When one deals with facts rather than theories and gazes for the first time upon themechanisms of human action several things confound him, much as the flutterings of the heartdidHarvey or the actions of yeasts did Pasteur. The blood did not circulate because Harveysaid it could nor yet because he said it did. It circulated and had been circulating for eons;Harvey was clever and observant enough to find it; and this was much the case with Pasteurand other explorers of the hitherto unknown or unconfirmed. In dianetics the fact that theanalytical mind was inherently perfect and remained structurally capable of restoration to fulloperation was not the least of the data found.That man was good, as established by exacting research, was no great surprise, but thatan unaberrated individual was vigorously repelled by evil and yet gained enormous strengthwas astonishing since aberration had been so long incorrectly supposed to be the root ofstrength and ambition according to authorities since the time of Plato.That a man contained a mechanism which recorded with diabolical accuracy when theman was observably and by all presumable tests “unconscious” was newsworthy andsurprising. To the layman the relationship of prenatal life to mental function has not entirelybeen disregarded since for centuries beyond count people were concerned with “prenatalinfluence.” To the psychiatrist, the psychologist and psycho-analyst, prenatal memory had longbeen an accepted fact since “memories of the womb” were agreed to influence the adult mind.But the prenatal aspect of the mind came as an entire surprise to dianetics, an unwanted and atthe time unwelcome observation.Despite existing beliefs -- which are not scientific facts -- that the foetus had memory,the psychiatrist and other workers believed as well that memory could not exist in a humanbeing until myelin sheathing was formed around the nerves. This was as confusing to dianeticsas it was to psychiatry. After much work over some years the exact influence prenatal life hadon the later mind was established by dianetics with accuracy. There will be those who,uninformed, will say that dianetics “accepts and believes in” prenatal memory.Completely aside from the fact that an exact science does not “believe” but establishesand proves facts, dianetics emphatically does nor believe in “prenatal memory.” Dianetics hadto invade cytology and biology and form many conclusions by research; it had to locate andestablish both the reactive mind and the hidden engram banks never before known before itcame upon “prenatal” problems. It had been discovered that the engram recording wasprobably done on the cellular level, that the engram bank was contained in the cells. It was thendiscovered that the cells, reproducing from one generation to the next, within the organism,apparently carried with them their own memory banks. The cells are the first echelon ofstructure, the basic building blocks. They built the analytical mind. They operate, as the whip,the reactive mind. Where one has human cells, one has potential engrams. Human cells beginwith the zygote, proceed in development with the embryo, become the foetus and finally theinfant.Each stage of this growth is capable of reaction. Each stage in the growth of the colonyof cells finds them fully cells, capable of recording engrams. In dianetics “prenatal memory” isnot considered since the standard banks which will someday serve the completed analyzer inthe infant, child and man are not themselves complete. There is neither “memory” or“experience” before the nerves are sheathed as far as dianetic therapy is concerned. But dianetictherapy is concerned with engrams, not memories, with recordings, not experience, and5"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"wherever there are human cells, engrams are demonstrably possible and, when physical painwas present, engrams can be demonstrated to have been created.The engram is a recording like the ripples in the groove of a phonograph record: it is acomplete recording of everything which occurred during the period of pain. Dianetics canlocate, with its techniques, any engram which the cells have hidden, and in therapy the patientwill often discover himself to be upon the prenatal cellular time track. There he will locateengrams and he goes there only because engrams exist there.Birth is an engram and is recovered by dianetics as a recording, not as a memory. Byreturn and the cellular extension of the time track, zygote pain storage can be and is recovered.It is not memory. It impinged upon the analytical mind and it obstructed the standard bankswhere memory is stored. This is a very great difference from prenatal memory. Dianeticsrecovers prenatal engrams and finds them responsible for much aberration and discovers thatany longing for the womb is not present in any patient but that engrams sometimes dictate areturn to it, as in some regressive psychoses which then attempt to remake the body into afoetus.This matter of prenatal life is discussed here at length in this synopsis to give the readera perspective on the subject. We are dealing here with an exact science, precision axioms andnew skills of application. By them we gain a command over aberration and psycho-somatic illsand with them we take an evolutionary step in the development of Man which places him yetanother stage above his distant cousins of the animal kingdom.6"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONThe progress of Mankind from the period of savagery to the present is marked withmilestones. Conventional history books would have you believe that these milestones are battlemonuments or the tombs of great men. Yet there are more important markers of Man’sprogress -- and these are New Ideas. Whenever a New Idea has been created, Man’s chancesfor survival have been improved and the arduousness of his journey away from animalhood islessened.There have been numerous New Ideas in the past. To name a few of the more obvious,consider the invention of the wheel, the control of fire, the development of mathematics or eventhe newest one -- the discovery of the means of atomic fission. Every one of these ideas hasaltered the progress of Mankind -- sometimes temporarily for the worse, but ultimately forMan’s betterment.In my opinion DIANETICS is worthy of being called a New Idea, and is destined totake its place alongside of these other milestones of progress. It might even be considered to bemore important than any of these, for it is a science which for the first time gives us anunderstanding of the tool with which these other inventions were created -- the human mind.In the creation of any New Idea, there is one step which is highly important. It is soobvious as to be frequently overlooked. This step, the sine qua non of any idea, consists inexamining the basic assumptions of the subject and determining whether or not they need to berevised. The creator of a New Idea asks, “What would happen if I assume that this beliefwhich everyone has had for centuries isn’t necessarily so?”The primitive man who invented the wheel did just that. His fellows assumed that,when one wanted to transport an object, it had to be carried or dragged along the ground. Theinventor changed the assumption -- and the wheel was born.Again, so long as man assumed that fire was dangerous and should be avoided, hemade no attempt to control it. When some brave soul re-examined this assumption and decidedthat fire, although it entailed some hazards, might offer certain advantages to the dwellers in hiscave, he took the first step toward the creation of the science of chemistry and nuclear physics.So it is with DIANETICS. In it there has been a reexamination and a re-evaluation ofnumerous basic assumptions regarding the functioning of the human mind.The originator has had both the temerity and the wisdom to refuse to accept all of theold assumptions.For example, we have all assumed that when a person is unconscious, he isunconscious -- that’s all there is to it. The originator of dianetics was critical of that assumptionand, as a result, was able to demonstrate that the mind is never totally unconscious. Theassumption that nobody can remember anything which happened to him before the age of threeor four also came in for consideration -- and the result of these and other reassessments wasDIANETICS.Yes, basic assumptions are important. They are especially important when they getsuch a strangle-hold on our ways of thinking that we can’t get away from them. For hundredsof years it was assumed that the sun and the planets revolved around the earth; it was not untilthe assumption was tested and found to be faulty that modern astronomy was able to develop.For hundreds of years a certain group of philosophers and religionists have assumed that Manis fundamentally evil; now comes DIANETICS to test this assumption. It will be highlyinteresting to see if there will be any change in our interpersonal relationships as a result of anew, different basic assumption.7"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The basic assumption is also a long-lived brute, hard to kill. Perhaps one reason for hishardiness is that he feeds upon Authority. There is a vast difference between Authority and anauthority. An authority might be described as a man who propounds a basic assumption whichis valid for his time and applicable to the state of knowledge at the time it was propounded andhas had his ideas accepted. No doubt this man would not be at all averse to altering hisassumptions if a change in knowledge warranted it. His protagonists and disciples don’t seemto act this way, however; before very long they begin to treat his idea as if it were some sort ofdivine revelation -- and the man now becomes an Authority.The words of an Authority carry much more weight than do those of a mere authority.They are sacrosanct, holy, not to be questioned; the words themselves are Authority. And, intime, another change occurs; Authority becomes confused with knowledge and is acceptedblindly, unthinkingly. A man can even become an authority himself by knowing a great dealabout the things Authority said.Perhaps the epitome of this sort of foolishness is exemplified in the attitude ofnumerous doctors toward the work of Harvey, the man who first described the circulation ofthe blood. Harvey’s views, even though they were well founded in observation andexperimentation, ran counter to those held by his predecessor, Galen, who was the greatmedical Authority of that day. So great was the controversy that some men took the stand,“Male errare cum Galen qualm veritam Harveii amplecti.” (“I would rather err with Galen thanaccept Harvey’s truth.”)Now, respect for authority is all very well. There are certain brands of authority whichwe may tacitly agree to accept, such as customs and morals; there are other brands of authoritywhich we may vote to accept, such as our laws. But we should be wary of self-constitutedauthority, especially the type I have called Authority. We should feel free to examine the basicassumptions of any body of knowledge we wish, without fear of committing lese majeste. Ifany system of thought is going to wither in the light of investigation, it does not deserve thetitle of Authority.The originator of DIANETICS has, without the slightest effort towards beingiconoclastic, succeeded in dislodging a good many of our false gods of Authority from theirpedestals. perhaps the job wasn’t too difficult -- so many of the idols who bear that name havefeet of the poorest sort of clay. Those authorities whose work was sound and valid are still intheir proper places in the temple of Knowledge, and will no doubt continue to remain.In early 1948 I first heard about DIANETICS from a colleague. I studied it, gettingreports from others who were familiar with aspects of the therapy. Shortly thereafter Icorresponded with the originator of dianetics, which resulted in my traveling East to study withhim, and finally, in my experiencing personal dianetic therapy under his supervision.For the past year I have been practicing DIANETICS on my patients, on my friends,and on my family. For the first time in my life, I’m satisfied that there is a method by whichmany questions, hitherto unanswerable, can be answered with definiteness and proven correct.Correct, insofar as the improved health of the patient is concerned. Correct, insofar as hiswell-being has been implemented by a feeling of security. Correct, insofar as his approach toliving has become more advanced, interesting, and productive of growth. To me thiscorrectness is meaningful and worthy of acceptance.Let me state that this is my opinion. I do not urge you to accept that opinion; I wouldmuch prefer that you make your own tests of DIANETICS, carefully, impartially, and arrive atyour own opinion. This statement is directed towards doctors in general, psychiatrists,psychologists, psycho-analysts, etc., as well as the layman.DIANETICS is a science. It has certain laws, and by following these laws we canpredict the results which will be obtained under given circumstances. These laws have noexceptions -- or at least, no exceptions have been found. In this respect the laws of8"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"DIANETICS are like the law of gravity: if you suspend a mass heavier than air above theground and then remove the support, it will fall. It won’t fall seventy per cent of the time oreighty per cent of the time; it will always fall. And if it doesn’t fall, we are justified in re-examining the law.The discovery that engrams (the ability of the cell to record a lasting trace of an event)are recorded on a cellular level when the higher sphere of the mind is “unconscious,”insensitive, and not recording (as, for instance, in severe injury, delirium, or surgicalanaesthesia) and that the recorded engrams then received are highly reactive, portends a newtrend for psychological and psychiatric thought and practice. The engram recorded during aperiod of “unconsciousness” is susceptible to reactivation during future periods of mentalanguish. This fact has been found to be a single, direct source of aberrated behavior. Itsdiscovery and isolation with the mechanics of its operation within the psyche, bring new andbrilliant light to hitherto obscure phenomena of the mind and its behavior. The engram, hiddenbeneath unexplored layers of “unconsciousness,” possesses a power of command not unlikethat of a hidden and unsuspected monitor upon the conscious mind; it produces effects whichare comparable to those of a post-hypnotic suggestion, though in a far more insidious andinvolved manner and with greater and more tragic effect.The technique of DIANETIC therapy is basically simple and can be understood andapplied to each other by any two reasonably intelligent people after a brief study of thisvolume, which is the operating manual for therapy. (Dianetic psychiatric treatment of severederangements is also delineated.) No previous background in psycho-analysis or psychology isnecessary. The therapeutic technique offered in DIANETICS is independent of hypnotism ornarco-synthesis.1. DIANETICS will help you to eliminate any psychosomatic illness from which you maysuffer.2. DIANETICS will help you achieve at least one-third more than present capacity forwork and happiness.3. DIANETICS offers to the medical profession, to psychiatrists, to psycho-analysts, toall who are interested in the advancement of their fellow men, a new theory andtechnique which makes accessible for therapy diseases and symptoms which hithertowere unusually complex and obscure.4. DIANETICS is the most advanced and most clearly presented method of psycho-therapy and self-improvement ever discovered.At this point, I step out -- the job ahead is yours.J. A. Winter, M.

It is an exploration into Terra Incognita, the human mind,that vast and hitherto unknown realm half an inch back of our foreheads.The discoveries and developments which made the formulation of dianetics possibleoccupied many years of exact research and careful testing. This was exploration, it was alsoconsolidation. The trail is blazed, the routes are sufficiently mapped for you to voyage in safetyinto your own mind and recover there your full inherent potential, which is not, we now know,low but very, very high. As you progress in therapy the adventure is yours to know why youdid what you did when you did it, to know what caused those Dark and Unknown Fears whichcame in nightmares as a child, to know where your moments of pain and pleasure lay. There ismuch which an individual does not know about himself, about his parents, about his“motives.” Some of the things you will find may astonish you, for the most important data ofyour life may be not memory but engrams in the hidden depths of your mind, not articulate butonly destructive.You will find many reasons why you “cannot get well” and you will know at length,when you find the dictating lines in the engrams, how amusing those reasons are, especially toyou.Dianetics is no solemn adventure. For all that it has to do with suffering and loss, itsend is always laughter, so foolish, so misinterpreted were the things which caused the woe. Your first voyage into your own Terra Incognita will be through the pages of this book.You will find as you read that many things “you always knew were so” are articulated here.You will be gratified to know that you held not opinions but scientific facts in many of yourconcepts of existence. You will find, too, many data that have long been known by all, andyou will possibly consider them far from news and be prone to underevaluate them: be assuredthat underevaluation of these facts kept them from being valuable, no matter how long theywere known, for a fact is never important without a proper evaluation of it and its preciserelationship to other facts. You are following here a vast network of facts which, reaching out,can be seen to embrace the whole field of Man in all his works. Fortunately you do not have toconcern yourself with following far any one of these lines until you are done. And then thesehorizons will stretch wide enough to satisfy anyone.Dianetics is a large subject, but that is only because Man is himself a large subject. Thescience of his thought cannot but embrace all his actions. By careful compartmenting andrelating of data, the field has been kept narrow enough to be easily followed. Mostly thishandbook will tell you, without any specific mention, about yourself and your family andfriends, for you will meet them here and know them.This volume has made no effort to use resounding or thunderous phrases, frowningpolysyllables or professorial detachment. When one is delivering answers which are simple, heneed not make the communication any more difficult than is necessary to convey the ideas.“Basic language” has been used, much of the nomenclature is colloquial; the pedantic has notonly not been employed, it has also been ignored. This volume communicates to several strataof life and professions; the favorite nomenclatures of none have been observed since such ausage would impede the understanding of others. And so bear with us, psychiatrist, whenyour structure is not used, for we have no need for structure here, and bear with us, doctor,when we call a cold a cold and not a catarrhal disorder of the respiratory tract.

This book follows, more or less, the actual steps of thedevelopment of dianetics. First there was the dynamic principle of existence, then its meaning,then the source of aberration, and finally the application of all as therapy and the techniques oftherapy. You won’t find any of this very difficult. It was the originator who had the difficulty.You should have seen the first equations and postulates of dianetics! As research progressedand as the field developed, dianetics began to simplify. That is a fair guarantee that one is on astraight trail of science. Only things which are poorly known become more complex the longerone works upon them.It is suggested that you read straight on through. By the time you get into the appendix,you should have an excellent command of the subject. The book is arranged that way. Everyfact related to dianetic therapy is stated in several ways and is introduced again and again. Inthis way, the important facts have been pointed up to your attention. When you have finishedthe book you can come back to the beginning and look through it and study what you think youneed to know. Almost all the basic philosophy and certainly all the derivations of the master subject ofdianetics were excluded here, partly because this volume had to stay under half a million wordsand partly because they belong in a separate text where they can receive full justice.Nevertheless, you have the scope of the science with this volume in addition to therapy itself.You are beginning an adventure. Treat it as an adventure. And may you never be thesame again. 11"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":" Book OneTHE GOAL OF MAN12"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IThe Scope of DianeticsA science of mind is a goal which has engrossed thousands of generations of Man.Armies, dynasties and whole civilizations have perished for the lack of it. Rome went to dustfor the want of it. China swims in blood for the need of it; and down in the arsenal is an atombomb, its hopeful nose full-armed in ignorance of it.No quest has been more relentlessly pursued or has been more violent. No primitivetribe, no matter how ignorant, has failed to recognize the problem as a problem, nor has itfailed to bring forth at least an attempted formulation. Today one finds the aborigine ofAustralia substituting for a science of mind a “magic healing crystal.” The Shaman of BritishGuiana makes shift for actual mental laws with his monotonous song and consecrated cigar.The throbbing drum of the Goldi medicine man serves in the stead of an adequate technique toalleviate the lack of serenity in patients.The enlightened and golden age of Greece yet had but superstition in its principalsanatoria for mental ills, the Aesculapian temple. The most the Roman could do for peace ofmind for the sick was to appeal to the penates, the household divinities, or sacrifice to Febris,goddess of fevers. And an English king, centuries after, could have been found in the hands ofexorcists who sought to cure his deliriums by driving the demons from him.From the most ancient times to the present, in the crudest primitive tribe or the mostmagnificently ornamented civilization, Man has found himself in a state of awed helplessnesswhen confronted by the phenomena of strange illnesses or aberrations. His desperation, in hisefforts to treat the individual, has been but slightly altered during his entire history, and untilthis twentieth century passed mid-term, the percentages of his alleviations, in terms ofindividual mental derangements, compared evenly with the successes of the shamansconfronted with the same problems. According to a modern writer, the single advance ofpsycho-therapy was clean quarters for the madman. In terms of brutality in treatment of theinsane, the methods of the shaman or Bedlam have been far exceeded by the “civilized”techniques of destroying nerve tissues with the violence of shock and surgery, treatmentswhich were not warranted by the results obtained and which would not have been tolerated inthe meanest primitive society, since they reduce the victim to mere zombie-ism, destroyingmost of his personality and ambition and leaving him nothing more than a manageable animal.Far from an indictment of the practices of the “neurosurgeon” and the ice-pick which he thrustsand twists into insane minds, they are brought forth only to demonstrate the depths ofdesperation man can reach when confronted with the seemingly unsolvable problem ofderanged minds.In the larger sphere of societies and nations, the lack of such a science of mind wasnever more evident; for the physical sciences, advancing thoughtlessly far in advance of man’sability to understand man, have armed him with terrible and thorough weapons which awaitonly another outburst of the social insanity of war.These problems are not mild ones; they lie across every man’s path; they wait incompany with his future. As long as Man has recognized that his chief superiority over theanimal kingdom was a thinking mind, so long as he understood that his mind alone was hisweapon, he has searched and pondered and postulated in efforts to find a solution.Like a jig-saw puzzle spilled by a careless hand, the equations which would lead to ascience of the mind and, above that, to a master science of the universe, were stirred round andround. Sometimes two fragments would be united; sometimes, as in the case of the golden ageof Greece, a whole section would be built. Philosopher, shaman, medicine man,mathematician: each looked at the pieces. Some saw they must all belong to different puzzles.Some thought they all belonged to the same puzzle. Some said there were really six puzzles in13"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"it, some said two. And the wars went on and the societies sickened or were dispersed, andlearned tomes were written about ever-increasing hordes of madmen.With the methods of Bacon, with the mathematics of Newton, the physical scienceswent on, consolidating and advancing their frontiers. And, like a derelict battalion, careless ofhow many allied ranks it exposed to destruction by the enemy, studies of the mind laggedbehind.But after all, there are just so many pieces in any puzzle. Before and after FrancisBacon, Herbert Spencer and a very few more, many of the small sections had been puttogether, many honest facts had been observed.To adventure into the thousands of variables of which that puzzle was composed, onehad only to know right from wrong, true from false, and use all Man and Nature as his testtube.Of what must a science of mind be composed?1. An answer to the goal of thought.2. A single source of all insanities, psychoses, neuroses, compulsions, repressions andsocial derangements.3. Invariant scientific evidence as to the basic nature and functional background of thehuman mind.4. Techniques, the art of application, by which the discovered single source could beinvariably cured, ruling out, of course, the insanities of malformed, deleted orpathologically injured brains or nervous systems and, particularly, iatrogenic psychoses(those caused by doctors and involving the destruction of the living brain itself). 5. Methods of prevention of mental derangement.6. The cause and cure of all psycho-somatic ills, which number, some say, 70% of Man’slisted ailments.Such a science would exceed the severest terms previously laid down for it in any age,but any computation on the subject should discover that a science of mind ought to be able tobe and do just these things.A science of the mind, if it were truly worthy of that name, would have to rank, inexperimental precision, with physics and chemistry. There could be no “special cases” to itslaws. There could be no recourse to Authority. The atom bomb bursts whether Einstein gives itpermission or not. Laws native to Nature regulate the bursting of that bomb. Technicians,applying techniques derived from discovered natural laws, can make one or a million atombombs, all alike.After the body of axioms and technique was organized and working as a science ofmind, in rank with the physical sciences, it would be found to have points of agreement withalmost every school of thought about thought which had ever existed. This is again a virtue andnot a fault.Simple though it is, dianetics does and is these things:1. It is an organized science of thought built on definite axioms: statements of natural lawson the order of those of the physical sciences.14"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"2. It contains a therapeutic technique with which can be treated all inorganic mental ills andall organic psychosomatic ills, with assurance of complete cure in unselected cases.3. It produces a condition of ability and rationality for Man well in advance of the currentnorm, enhancing rather than destroying his vigor and personality.4. Dianetics gives a complete insight into the full potentialities of the mind, discoveringthem to be well in excess of past suppression.5. The basic nature of man is discovered in dianetics rather than hazarded or postulated,since that basic nature can be brought into action in any individual completely. And thatbasic nature is discovered to be good.6. The single source of mental derangement is discovered and demonstrated, on a clinicalor laboratory basis, by dianetics.7. The extent, storage capacity and recallability of the human memory is finally establishedby dianetics.8. The full recording abilities of the mind are discovered by dianetics with the conclusionthat they are quite dissimilar to former suppositions.9. Dianetics brings forth the non-germ theory of disease, complementing bio-chemistryand Pasteur’s work on the germ theory to embrace the field.10. With dianetics ends the “necessity” of destroying the brain by shock or surgery to effect“tractability” in mental patients and “adjust” them.11. A workable explanation of the physiological effects of drugs and endocrine substancesexists in dianetics and many problems posed by endocrinology are answered.12. Various educational, sociological, political, military, and other human studies areenhanced by dianetics.13. The field of cytology is aided by dianetics, as well as other fields of research.This, then, is a skeletal sketch of what would be the scope of a science of mind and of what isthe scope of dianetics.15"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIThe ClearDianetically, the optimum individual is called the clear. One will hear much of thatword, both as a noun and a verb, in this volume, so it is well to spend time here at the outsetsetting forth exactly what can be called a clear, the goal of dianetic therapy.A clear can be tested for any and all psychoses, neuroses, compulsions and repressions(all aberrations) and can be examined for any autogenic (self-generated) diseases referred to aspsycho-somatic ills. These tests confirm the clear to be entirely without such ills or aberrations.Additional tests of his intelligence indicate it to be high above the current norm. Observation ofhis activity demonstrates that he pursues existence with vigor and satisfaction.Further, these results can be obtained on a comparative basis. A neurotic individual,possessed also of psychosomatic ills, can be tested for those aberrations and illnesses,demonstrating that they exist. He can then be given dianetic therapy to the end of clearing theseneuroses and ills. Finally, he can be examined, with the above results. This, in passing, is anexperiment which has been performed many times with invariable results. It is a matter oflaboratory test that all individuals who have organically complete nervous systems respond inthis fashion to dianetic clearing.Further, the clear possesses attributes, fundamental and inherent but not alwaysavailable in an uncleared state, which have not been suspected of Man and are not included inpast discussions of his abilities and behavior.First there is the matter of perceptions. Even so-called normal people do not always seein full color, hear in full tone, or sense at the optimum with their organs of smell, taste, tactileand organic sensation.These are the main lines of communication to the finite world which most peoplerecognize as reality. It is an interesting commentary that while past observers felt that the facingof reality was an absolute necessity if the aberrated individual wished to be sane, no definitionof how this was to be done was set forth. To face reality in the present one would certainlyhave to be able to sense it along those channels of communication most commonly used byman in his affairs.Any one of Man’s perceptions can be aberrated by psychic derangements which refuseto permit the received sensations to be realized by the analytical portion of the individual’smind. In other words, while there may be nothing wrong with the mechanisms of colorreception, circuits can exist in the mind which delete color before the consciousness ispermitted to see the object. Color blindness can be discovered to be relative or in degrees insuch a way that colors appear to be less brilliant, dull or, at the maximum, entirely absent.Anyone is acquainted with persons to whom “loud” colors are detestable and with persons whofind them insufficiently “loud” to notice. This varying degree of color blindness has not beenrecognized as a psychic factor but has been nebulously assumed to be some sort of a conditionof mind when it was noticed at all.There are those persons to whom noises are quite disturbing, to whom, for instance,the insistent whine of a violin is very like having a brace and bit applied to the eardrum; andthere are those to whom fifty violins, played loudly, would be soothing; and there are thosewho, in the presence of a violin, express disinterest and boredom; and, again, there are personsto whom the sound of a violin, no matter if it be playing the most intricate melody, is amonotone. These differences of sonic (hearing) perception have, like color and other visualerrors, been attributed to inherent nature or organic deficiency or assigned no place at all.16"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"In a like manner, from person to person, smells, tactile sensations, organic perceptions,pain and gravity, vary widely and wildly. A cursory check around amongst his friends willdemonstrate to a man that there exist enormous differences of perception of identical stimuli.One smells a turkey in the oven as wonderful, one smells it with indifference, another may notsmell it at all. And somebody else may maintain that roasting turkey smells exactly like hair oil-- to be extreme.Until we obtain clears it remains obscure why such differences should exist. For in thelargest measure, such wild quality and quantity of perception is due to aberration. Because ofpleasurable experiences in the past and inherent sensitivity, there will be some differenceamongst clears, and a clear response should not be assumed automatically to be a standardized,adjusted middle ground, that pallid and obnoxious goal of past doctrines. The clear gets amaximum response compatible with his own desire for the response. Burning cordite stillsmells dangerous to him, but it does not make him ill. Roasting turkey smells good to him if heis hungry and likes turkey, at which time it smells very, very good. Violins play melodies, notmonotones, bring no pain and are enjoyed to a fine full limit if the clear likes violins as a matterof taste -- if he doesn’t, he likes kettledrums, saxophones or, indeed, suiting his mood, nomusic at all.In other words, there are two variables at work. One, the wildest, is the variable causedby aberrations. The other, and quite rational and understandable, is caused by the personality.Thus the perceptions of an aberree* (non-cleared individual) * Aberree is a neologismmeaning an aberrated person vary greatly from those of the cleared (unaberrated) individual.Now there are the differences of the actual organs of perception and the errorsoccasioned by these. Some of these errors, a minimum, are organic: punctured eardrums arenot competent sound-recording mechanisms. The majority of perceptic (sense message) errorsin the organic sphere are caused by psycho-somatic errors.Glasses are seen on noses everywhere around, even on children. The majority of thesespectacles are perched on the face in an effort to correct a condition which the body itself isfighting to uncorrect again. Eyesight, when the stage of glasses is entered (not because ofglasses), is deteriorating on the psycho-somatic principle. And this observation is about asirresponsible as a statement that when apples fall out of trees they usually obey gravity. One ofthe incidental things which happen to a clear is that his eyesight, if it had been bad as anaberree, generally improves markedly, and with some slight attention will recover optimumperception in time. (Far from an optician’s argument against dianetics, this assures rather goodbusiness, for clears have been known, at treatment’s end, to have to buy, in rapid succession,five pairs of glasses to compensate adjusting eyesight; and many aberrees, cleared late in life,settle down ocularly at a maximum a little under optimum.)The eyesight was reduced in the aberree on an organic basis by his aberrations so thatthe perceptic organ itself was reduced from optimum operating function. With the removal ofaberrations, repeated tests have proven that the body makes a valiant effort to reconstruct backto optimum.Hearing, in addition to other perceptics, varies organically over a wide range. Calciumdeposits, for instance, can make the ears “ring” incessantly. The removal of aberrations permitsthe body to readjust toward its reachable optimum, the calcium deposit disappears, and the earsstop ringing. But far and beyond this very specific case, there are great differences in hearingon the organic basis. Organically as well as aberrationally, hearing can become remarkablyextended or closely inhibited so that one person may hear footsteps a block away as a normalactivity and another would not hear a bass drum thundering on the porch.That the various perceptions differ widely from individual to individual on anaberrational and psycho-somatic basis is the least of the discoveries outlined here. Ability torecall is far more fantastic in its variation from person to person.17"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"An entirely new recall process which was inherent in the mind but which had not beennoticed came to light in the process of observing clears and aberrees. This recall process ispossible in only a small proportion of aberrees in its fullest sense. It is standard, however, in aclear. Naturally, no intimation is made here that the scholars of past ages have beenunobservant. We are dealing here with an entirely new and hitherto non-existent object ofinspection, the clear. What a clear can do easily, quite a few people have, from time to time,been partially able to do in the past.An inherent, not a taught, ability of the remembering mechanisms of the mind can betermed, as a technical word of dianetics, returning. It is used in its dictionary sense, with theaddition of the fact that the mind has it as a normal remembering function, as follows: theperson can “send” a portion of his mind to a past period on either a mental or combined mentaland physical basis and can re-experience incidents which have taken place in his past in thesame fashion and with the same sensations as before. Once upon a time an art known ashypnotism used what was called “regression” on hypnotized subjects, the hypnotist sendingthe subject back, in one of two ways, to incidents in his past. This was done with trancetechniques, drugs and considerable technology.The hypnotic subject could be sent back to a moment “entirely” so that he gave everyappearance of being the age to which he was returned with only the apparent faculties andrecollections he had at that moment: this was called “revivification” (re-living). “Regression”was a technique by which part of the individual’s self remained in the present and part wentback to the past. These abilities of the mind were supposed native only in hypnotism and wereused only in hypnotic technique. The art is very old, tracing back some thousands of years andexisting today in Asia as it has existed, apparently, from the dawn of time.Returning is substituted for “regression” here because it is not a comparable thing andbecause “regression,” as a word, has some bad meanings which would interrupt its use.Reliving is substituted for “revivification” in dianetics because, in dianetics, the principles ofhypnotism can be found explained and hypnotism is not used in dianetic therapy, as will beexplained later.The mind, then, has another ability to remember. Part of the mind can “return” evenwhen a person is wide awake and re-experience past incidents in full. If you want to test this,try it on several people until one is discovered who does it easily. Wide awake he can “return”to moments in his past. Until asked to do so he probably will not know he has such an ability.If he had it, he probably thought everybody could do it (the type of supposition which has keptso much of this data from coming to light before). He can go back to a time when he wasswimming and swim with full recall of hearing, sight, taste, smell, organic sensation, tactile,etc.A “learned” gentleman once spent some hours demonstrating to a gathering that therecall of a smell as a sensation, for instance, was quite impossible since “neurology had proventhat the olfactory nerves were not connected to the thalamus.” Two people in the gatheringdiscovered this ability to return and despite this evidence, the learned gentleman continued thedispute that olfactory recall was impossible. A check amongst the gathering on this faculty,independent of returning, brought forth the fact that one-half of those present rememberedsmell by smelling it again.Returning is the full performance of imagery recall. The entire memory is able to makethe organ areas re-sense the stimuli in a past incident. Partial recall is common, not commonenough to be normal, but certainly common enough to have merited considerable study. For itagain is a wide variable.Perception of the present would be one method of facing reality. But if one cannot facethe reality of the past then, in some part, he is not facing some portion of reality. And if it isageed that facing reality is desirable, then one would have to face yesterday’s reality as well ifhe were to be considered entirely “sane” by contemporary definition. To “face yesterday”18"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"requires a certain condition of recall to be available. One would have to be able to remember.But how many ways are there of remembering?First there is the return. That is new. It gives the advantage of examining the movingpictures and other sense perceptions recorded at the time of the event with all senses present.He can also return to his past conclusions and imaginings. It is of considerable aid in learning,in research, in ordinary living to be able to be again at the place where the data desired was firstinspected.Then there are the more usual recalls. Optimum recall is by the return method of singleor multiple senses, the individual himself remaining in present time. In other words, somepeople, when they think of a rose, see one, smell one, feel one. They see in full color, vividly-- with the “mind’s eye” to use an old colloquialism. They smell it vividly. And they can feel iteven to the thorns. They are thinking about roses by actually recalling a rose.These people, thinking about a ship, would see a specific ship, feel the motion of her ifthey thought of being aboard her, smell the pine-tar or even less savory odors and hearwhatever sounds there were about her. They would see the ship in full color motion and hear itin full tone audio.These faculties vary widely in the aberree. Some, when told to think of a rose, canmerely visualize one. Some can smell one but not see it. Some see it without color or in verypale color. When told to think of a ship some aberrees only see a flat, colorless, still picturesuch as a painting of a ship or the photograph of one. Some perceive a vessel in motionwithout color but with sound. Some hear the sound of a ship but fail to see any picturewhatever. Some merely think of a ship as a concept that ships exist and that they know aboutthem and fail to see, feel, hear, smell or otherwise sense anything on a recall basis.Some past observers have called this “imagery” but the term is so inapplicable to soundand touch, organic sensation and pain that recall is used uniformly as the technical dianeticterm. The value of recall in this business of living has occupied such scant attention that theentire concept has never been formulated previously. It is therefore detailed at some lengthhere, as above.It is quite simple to test recalls. If one will ask his fellows what their abilities are, hewill gain a remarkable idea of how widely varied this ability is from individual to individual.Some have this recall, some have that, some have none, but operate on concepts of recall only.And remember, if you make a test on those around you, that any perception is filed in thememory and therefore has a recall which is to include pain, temperature, rhythm, taste andweight with the above mentioned sight, sound, tactile, and smell.The dianetic names for these recalls are visio (sight), sonic (sound), tactile (touch),olfactory (smell), rhythmic, kinesthetic (weight and motion), somatic (pain), thermal(temperature) and organic (internal sensations and, by new definition, emotion). Then there is another set of mental activities which can be summated under the headingsof imagination and creative imagination. Here again is abundant material for testing.Imagination is the recombination of things one has sensed, thought or intellectuallycomputed into existence, which do not necessarily have existence. This is the mind’s methodof envisioning desirable goals or forecasting futures. Imagination is extremely valuable as apart of essential solutions in any mental problem and in everyday existence. That it isrecombination in no sense deprives it of its vast and wonderful complexity.A clear uses imagination in its entirety. There is an imagination impression for sight,smell, taste, sound -- in short, for each one of the possible perceptions. These aremanufacturered impressions on the basis of models in the memory banks combined byconceptual ideas and construction. New physical structures, tomorrow in terms of today, next19"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"year in terms of last year, pleasure to be gained, deeds to be done, accidents to avoid, all theseare imaginational functions.The clear has full color-visio, tone-sonic, tactile, olfactory, rhythmic, kinesthetic,thermal and organic imagination in kind. Asked to envision himself riding in a gilded coach andfour, he “sees” the equipage, moving, in full color, he “hears” all the noises which should bepresent, he “smells” the smells he thinks should be there, and he “feels” the upholstery, themotion, and the presence in the coach of himself.In addition to standard imagination there is creative imagination. This is a very wideundimensional ability, quite variable from individual to individual, possessed in enormousquantity by some. It is included here, not as a portion of the operation of the mind treated as ausual part of dianetics, but to isolate it as an existing entity. In a clear who possessed creativeimagination, even if inhibited, as an aberree, it is present and demonstrable. It is inherent. Itcan be aberrated only by prohibition of its general practice, which is to say, by aberrating thepersistence in its application or encysting the whole mind. But creative imagination, thatpossession by which works of art are done, states builded and Man enriched, can beenvisioned as a special function, independent in operation and in no way dependent for itsexistence upon an aberrated condition in the individual, since the examination of its activity inand use by a clear possessing adequately demonstrates its inherent character. It is rarely absentin any individual.Finally, there is the last but most important activity of the mind. Man is to be regardedas a sentient being. His sentience depends upon his ability to resolve problems by perceiving orcreating and understanding situations. This rationality is the primary, high echelon function ofthat part of the mind which makes him a Man, not just another animal. Remembering,perceiving, imagining, he has the signal ability of resolving conclusions and of usingconclusions resolved to resolve further conclusions. This is rational Man.Rationality, as divorced from aberration, can be studied in a cleared person only. Theaberrations of the aberree give him the appearance of irrationality. Though such irrationalitymay be given the gentler names of “eccentricity” or “human error” or even “personalidiosyncrasy,” it is, nevertheless, irrationality. The personality does not depend upon howirrationally a man may act. It is not a personality trait, for instance, to drive while drunk andkill a child on a crosswalk -- or even to risk killing a child by driving while drunk. Irrationalityis simply that -- the inability to get right answers from data.Now it is a curious thing that although “everybody knows” (and what a horribleamount of misinformation that statement lets circulate) it is “human to err,” the sentient portionof the mind which computes the answers to problems and which makes man Man is utterlyincapable of error.This was a startling discovery when it was made, but it need not have been. It couldhave been deduced some time before. For it is quite simple and easy to understand. The actualcomputing ability of Man is never in error even in a very severely aberrated person. Observingthe activity of such an aberrated person, one might thoughtlessly suppose that that person’scomputations were wrong. But that would be an observer error. Any person, aberrated orclear, computes perfectly on the data stored and perceived.Take any common calculating machine (and the mind is an exceptionally magnificentinstrument far, far superior to any machine it will invent for ages to come) and put a problemon it for solution. Multiply seven times one. It will answer, properly, seven. Now multiply sixtimes one but continue to hold down the seven. Six times one is six but the answer you will getis forty-two. Continue to hold down seven and put other problems on the machine. They arewrong, not as problems, but as answers. Now fix seven so that it stays down no matter whatkeys are touched and try to give the machine away. Nobody will want it because, obviously,the machine is crazy. It says ten times ten is seven hundred. But is the calculating portion of themachine really wrong or is it merely being fed the wrong data?20"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"In the same way the human mind, being called upon to resolve problems of amagnitude and with enough variables to confound any mere calculating machine a thousandtimes an hour, is prey to incorrect data. Incorrect data gets into the machine. The machine giveswrong answers. Incorrect data enters the human memory banks, the person reacts in an“abnormal manner.” Essentially, then, the problem of resolving aberration is the problem offinding a “held-down seven.” But of that much, much more, later. Right now we haveaccomplished our immediate ends.These are the various abilities and activities of the human mind in its constant task ofresolving and putting into solution a multitude of problems. It perceives, it recalls or returns, itimagines, it conceives and then resolves. Served by its extensions -- the perceptics and thememory banks and the imaginations -- the mind brings forth answers which are invariablyaccurate, modified only by observation, education and viewpoint.And the basic purposes of that mind and the basic nature of man, as discoverable in theclear, are constructive and good, uniformly constructive and uniformly good, the solutionsmodified only by observation, education and viewpoint.Man is good.Take away his basic aberrations and with them go the evil of which the Scholastic andthe moralist were so fond. The only detachable portion of him is the “evil” portion. And whenit is detached, his personality and vigor intensify. And he is glad to see the “evil” portion gobecause it was physical pain.Later there are experiments and proofs for these things and they can be measured withthe precision so dear to the heart of the physical scientist.The clear, then, is not an “adjusted” person, driven to activity by his repressions nowthoroughly encysted. He is an unrepressed person, operating on self-determinism. And hisabilities to perceive, recall, return, imagine, create and compute are outlined as we have seen.The clear is the goal in dianetic therapy, a goal which some patience and a little studyand work can bring about. Any person can be cleared unless he has been so unfortunate as tohave had a large portion of his brain removed or to have been born with a grossly malformednervous structure.We have seen the goal of dianetics here. Let us now inspect the goal of Man.21"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIIThe Goal of ManThe goal of Man, the lowest common denominator of all his activities, the dynamicprinciple of his existence, has long been sought. Should such an answer be discovered, it isinevitable that from it many answers would flow. It would explain all phenomena of behavior;it would lead toward a solution of Man’s major problems; and, most of all, it should beworkable.Consider all knowledge to fall above or below a line of demarcation. Everything abovethis line is not necessary to the solution of Man’s aberrations and general shortcomings and isinexactly known. Such a field of thought could be considered to embrace such things asmetaphysics and mysticism. Below this line of demarcation could be considered to lie the finiteuniverse. All things in the finite universe, whether known or as yet unknown, can be sensed,experienced or measured. The known data in the finite universe can be classified as scientifictruth when it has been sensed, experienced and measured. All factors necessary to theresolution of a science of the mind were found within the finite universe and were discovered,sensed, measured and experienced, and became scientific truth. The finite universe containsTIME, SPACE, ENERGY and LIFE. No other factors were found necessary in the equation.TIME, SPACE, ENERGY and LIFE have a single denominator in common. As ananalogy it could be considered that TIME, SPACE, ENERGY and LIFE began at some pointof origin and were commanded to continue to some nearly infinite destination. They were toldnothing but WHAT to do. They obey a single order and that order is “SURVIVE!”THE DYNAMIC PRINCIPLE OF EXISTENCE IS SURVIVAL The goal of life canbe considered to be infinite survival. Man, as a life form, can be demonstrated to obey in allhis actions and purposes the one command: “SURVIVE!”It is not a new thought that Man is surviving. It is a new thought that Man is motivatedonly by survival.That his single goal is survival does not mean that he is the optimum survivalmechanism which life has attained or will develop. The goal of the dinosaur was also survivaland the dinosaur isn’t extant any more.Obedience to this command, “SURVIVE!” does not mean that every attempt to obey isuniformly successful. Changing environment, mutation, and many other things militate againstany one organism attaining infallible survival techniques or form.Life forms change and die as new life forms develop just as surely as one lifeorganism, lacking immortality in itself, creates other life organisms, then dies as itself. Anexcellent method, should one wish to cause life to survive over a very long period, would be toestablish means by which it could assume many forms, and death itself would be necessary inorder to facilitate the survival of the life force itself, since only death and decay could clearaway older forms when new changes in the environment necessitated new forms. Life, as aforce, existing over a nearly infinite period, would need a cyclic aspect in its unit organismsand forms.What would be the optimum survival characteristics of various life forms? They wouldhave to have various fundamental characteristics, differing from one species to the next just asone environment differs from the next.This is important, since it has been but poorly considered in the past that a set ofsurvival characteristics in one species would not be survival characteristics in another.22"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The methods of survival can be summed under the headings of food, protection(defensive and offensive) and procreation. There are no existing life forms which lacksolutions to these problems. Every life form errs one way or another, by holding acharacteristic too long or developing characteristics which may lead to its extinction. But thedevelopments which bring about successfulness of form are far more striking than their errors.The naturalist and biologist are continually resolving the characteristics of this or that life formby discovering that need rather than whim govern such developments. The hinges of the clamshell, the awesome face on the wing of the butterfly, have survival value.Once survival was isolated as the only dynamic of a life form which would explain allits activities, it was necessary to study further the action of survival. In order to establishnomenclature in dianetics which would not be too complex for the purpose, words normallyconsidered as adjectives or verbs have occasionally been pressed into service as nouns. Thishas been done on the valid principle that existing terminology, meaning so many differentthings, could not be used by dianetics without making it necessary to explain away an oldmeaning to bring forth a new. To remove the step of explaining the old meaning and sayingthen that one doesn’t mean that, thus entangling our communications inextricably, and toobviate the ancient custom of compounding ponderous and thundering syllables from theGreek and Roman tongues, this principle and some others have been adopted fornomenclature. Dynamic is here used as a noun and will so continue to be used throughout thisvolume. Somatic, perceptic and some others will be noted, defined when used. It wasdiscovered that when one considered pain and pleasure, he had at hand all the necessaryingredients with which to formulate the action life takes in its effort to survive.As will be seen in the accompanying graph, a spectrum of life has been conceived tospan from the zero of death or extinction toward the infinity of potential immortality. Thisspectrum was considered to contain an infinity of lines, extending ladderlike toward thepotential of immortality. Each line as the ladder mounted was spaced a little wider than the last,in a geometric progression.The thrust of survival is away from death and toward immortality. The ultimate paincould be conceived as existing just before death and the ultimate pleasure could be conceived asimmortality.Immortality could be said to have an attractive type of force and death a repelling forcein the consideration of the unit organism or the species. But as survival rises higher and highertoward immortality wider and wider spaces are encountered until the gaps are finitelyimpossible to bridge. The urge is away from death, which has a repelling force, and towardimmortality, which has an attracting force; the attracting force is pleasure, the repelling force ispain.For the individual, the length of the arrow could be considered to be at a high potentialwithin the fourth zone. Here the survival potential would be excellent and the individual wouldenjoy existence.From left to right could be graphed the years.The urge toward pleasure is dynamic. Pleasure is the reward; and the seeking of thereward -- survival goals -- would be a pleasurable act. And to ensure that survival isaccomplished under the mandate, SURVIVE!, it seems to have been provided that reductionfrom a high potential would bring pain. Pain is provided to repel the individual from death, pleasure is provided to call himtoward optimum life. The search for and the attainment of pleasure is not less valid in survivalthan the avoidance of pain. In fact, on some observed evidence, pleasure seems to have a muchgreater value in the cosmic scheme than pain.23"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Now it would be well to define what is meant by pleasure, aside from its connectionwith immortality. The dictionary states that pleasure is “gratification; agreeable emotions,mental or physical; transient enjoyment; opposed to pain.” Pleasure can be found in so manythings and activities that a catalogue of all the things and activities Man has, does and mayconsider pleasurable alone could round out the definition.And what do we mean by pain? The dictionary states: “physical or mental suffering;penalty.”These two definitions, in passing, are demonstrative of an intuitive type of thoughtwhich runs through the language. Once one has a thing which leads to the resolution of hithertounsolved problems, even the dictionaries are found to have “always known it.”If we wished to make this graph for a life-form cycle, it would be identical except thatthe value of the years would be increased to measure eons. For there is no difference, it seems,except magnitude, in the scope of the individual and the scope of the species. This inferencecould be drawn even without such remarkable evidence as the fact that a human being, growingfrom zygote to adult, evolutes through all the forms which the whole species is supposed tohave evolved through.Now there is more in this graph than has been remarked as yet. The physical andmental state of the individual varies from hour to hour, day to day, year to year. Therefore thelevel of survival would form either a daily curve or the curve of a life on a measure of hourly oryearly position in the zones. And there would be two curves made possible by this, thephysical curve and the mental curve. When we get toward the back of the book therelationships between these two curves will be found vital and it will also be seen that,ordinarily, a sag in the mental curve will precede a sag in the physical curve.The zones, then, can apply to two things: the physical being and the mental being.Therefore these four zones can be called zones of the states of being. If a person is happymentally, the survival level can be placed in Zone 4. If the person is extremely ill physically,he might be plotted, on estimation of his illness, in Zone 1 or close to death.Very unprecise but nevertheless descriptive names have been assigned to these zones.Zone 3 is one of general happiness and well-being. Zone 2 is a level of bearable existence.Zone 1 is one of anger. Zone 0 is the zone of apathy. These zones can be used as a tone scaleby which a state of mind can be graded. Just above death, which is 0, would be the lowestmental apathy or lowest level of physical life, 0.1. A Tone 1, where the body is fightingphysical pain or illness or where the being is fighting in anger, could be graded from 1.0,which would be resentment or hostility, through Tone 1.5, which would be a screaming rage,to a 1.9 which would be merely a quarrelsome inclination. From Tone 2.0 to Tone 3.0 therewould be an increasing interest in existence, and so forth.It so happens that the state of physical being or mental being does not long remainstatic. Therefore, there are various fluctuations. In the course of a single day an aberree mayrun from 0.5 to 3.5, up and down, as a mental being. An accident or illness could cause asimilar fluctuation in a day.These are, then, figures which can be assigned to four things: the mental state on anacute basis and the mental state on a general, average basis, and the physical being on an acutebasis and the physical being on a general basis. In dianetics we do not much employ thephysical tone scale. The mental tone scale, however, is of vast and vital importance!These values of happiness, bearable existence, anger and apathy are not arbitraryvalues. They are deduced from observation of the behavior of emotional states. A clear isusually found varying around Tone 4, plus or minus in an average day. He is a general Tone 4,which is one of the inherent conditions of being clear. A norm in current society, at a wildguess, is probably around a general Tone 2.8.24"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"In this descriptive graph, which is two-dimensional, the vital data for the solution of theproblem of the life dynamic are workably combined. The horizontal lines are in terms ofgeometric progression beginning with the zero line immediately above death. There are tenlines for each zone and each zone denotes a mental or physical state of being, as noted.Geometric progression, so used, leaves ever increasing spaces between the lines. The width ofthis space is the survival potential existing at the moment the top point of the survival dynamicarrow is within that space. The further away from death the top point of the survival dynamicarrow is, the better chance the individual has of survival. Geometric progression reaches uptoward the impossible of infinity and cannot, of course, reach infinity. The organism issurviving through time from left to right. Survival optimum -- immortality -- lies in terms oftime to the right. Potential only is measured vertically.The survival dynamic actually resides within the organism as inherited from thespecies. The organism is part of the species as a railroad tie might be said to be part of arailroad as seen by an observer on a train, the observer being always in Now -- although thisanalogy is not perhaps the best.Within itself the organism possesses a repulsive force toward pain sources. The sourceof the pain is not a driving force any more than the thorn bush which tears the hand was adriving force; the organism repulses the potential pain of a thorn.At the same time the organism has at work a force which attracts it to the sources ofpleasure. Pleasure does not magnetize the organism into drawing near. It is the organism whichpossesses the attraction force.It is inherent.The repulsion of pain sources adds to the attraction for pleasure sources to operate as acombined thrust away from death and toward immortality. The thrust away from death is nomore powerful than the thrust toward immortality. In other words, in terms of the survivaldynamic, pleasure has as much validity as pain.It should not be read here that survival is always a matter of keeping an eye on thefuture. Contemplation of pleasure, pure enjoyment, contemplation of past pleasures, allcombine into harmonies which, while they operate automatically as a rise toward the survivalpotential, by their action within the organism physically, do not demand the future as an activeportion of the mental computation in such contemplation.A pleasure which reacts to injure the body physically, as in the case of debauchery,discovers at work a ratio between the physical effect (which is depressed toward pain) and themental effect of experienced pleasure. There is a consequent lowering of the survival dynamic.Averaging out, the future possibility of strain because of the act, added to the state of being atthe moment the debauchery was experienced, again depresses the survival dynamic. Becauseof this, various kinds of debauchery have been in indifferent odor with Man throughout hishistory. This is the equation of “immoral pleasures.” And any action which has brought aboutsurvival suppression or which can bring it about, when pursued as a pleasure, has beendenounced at some time or another in Man’s history. Immorality is originally hung as a labelupon some act or class of actions because they depress the level of the survival dynamic.Future enforcement of moral stigma may depend largely upon prejudice and aberration andthere is, consequently, a continuous quarrel over what is moral and what is immoral.Because certain things practiced as pleasures are actually pains -- and how easy it willbe to trace out why when you’ve finished this volume -- and because of the moral equation asabove, pleasure itself, in any aberrated society can become decried. A certain kind of thinking,of which more later, permits poor differentiation between one object and another. Confusing adishonest politician with all politicians would be an example of this. In ancient times theRoman was fond of his pleasures and some of the things he called pleasure were a triflestrenuous on other species such as Christians. When the Christian overthrew the pagan state,25"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"the ancient order of Rome was in a villain’s role. Anything, therefore, which was Roman wasvillainous. This went to such remarkable lengths that the Roman love of bathing made bathingso immoral that Europe went unwashed for some fifteen hundred years. The Roman hadbecome a pain source so general that everything Roman was evil and it stayed evil long afterRoman paganism perished. Immorality, in such a fashion, tends to become an involvedsubject. In this case it became so involved that pleasure itself was stigmatized.When half the survival potential is struck from the list of lawful things, there is aconsiderable reduction in survival indeed. Considering this graph on a racial scale, thereduction of survival potential by one-half would forecast that direful things lay in wait for therace.Actually, because Man is after all Man, no set of laws, however enforced, cancompletely wipe away the attraction of pleasure. But in this case enough was removed andbanned to occasion precisely what happened: the Dark Ages and the recession of society.Society brightened only in those periods such as the Renaissance, in which pleasure becameless unlawful.When a race or an individual drops into the second zone, as marked on the chart, andthe general tone ranges from the first zone barely into the third, a condition of insanity ensues.Insanity is irrationality. It is also a state in which non-survival has been so closely approachedcontinually that the race or the organism engages in all manner of wild solutions.In further interpretation of this descriptic graph there is the matter of the survivalsuppressor. This, it will be seen, is a thrust downward out of potential immortality at the raceor organism represented as the survival dynamic. The survival suppressor is the combined andvariable threats to the survival of the race or organism. These threats come from other species,from time, from other energies. These are also engaged in the contest of survival to potentialimmortality in terms of their own species or identities. Thus there is a conflict involved. Everyother form of life or energy could be plotted in a descriptic as the survival dynamic. If we wereto use a duck’s survival dynamic in a descriptic graph, we would see the duck seeking a highsurvival level and Man would be a part of the duck’s suppressor.The balance and nature of things do not permit the infinity of the goal of immortality tobe reached. In fluctuating balance and in almost unlimited complexity, life and energies ebb andflood, out of the nebulous, into forms and, through decay, into the nebulous once more.*Many equations could be drawn concerning this, but it is outside the sphere of our presentinterest.In terms of the zones of the descriptic it is of relative concern what the extent of theforce of the suppressor is against the survival dynamic. The dynamic is inherent in individuals,groups and races, evolved to resist the suppressor through the eons. In the case of Man, hecarries with him another level of offensive and defensive techniques, his cultures. His primarytechnology of survival is mental activity governing physical action in the sentient echelon. Butevery life form has its own technology, formed to resolve the problems of food, protection andprocreation. The degree of workability of the technology any life form develops (armor orbrains, fleetness of foot or deceptive form) is a direct index of the survival potential, therelative immortality, of that form. There have been vast upsets in the past; Man, when hedeveloped into the world’s most dangerous animal (he can and does kill or enslave any lifeform, doesn’t he?) overloaded the suppressor on many other life forms and they dwindled innumber or vanished.A great climatic change, such as the one which packed so many mammoths in Siberianice, may overload the suppressor on a life form. A long drought in the American southwest innot too ancient times wiped out the better part of an Indian civilization.26"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"A cataclysm such as an explosion of the core of the Earth, if that were possible, or theatom bomb or the sudden cessation of burning on the Sun would wipe out all life forms onEarth.And a life form can even overload the suppressor on itself. A dinosaur destroys all hisfood and so destroys the dinosaur. A bubonic plague bacillus attacks its hosts with suchthorough appetite that the whole generation of pasteurella pestis vanishes. Such things are notintended by the suicide to be suicide; the life form has run up against an equation which has anunknown variable, and the unknown variable unfortunately contained enough value to overloadthe suppressor. This is the “didn’t know the gun was loaded” equation. And if the bubonic plague bacillus overloads its own suppressor in an area and thenceases to trouble its food and shelter, the animals, then the animals consider themselvesbenefited.Reckless and clever and well-nigh indestructible, Man has led a course which is a farcry from “tooth and claw” in every sphere. And so have the redwood tree and the shark. Justas a life form, Man, like every life form, is “symbiotic.” Life is a group effort. Lichens andplankton and algae may do very well on sunlight and minerals alone, but they are the buildingblocks. Above such existence, as the forms grow more complex, a tremendousinterdependence exists.It is very well for a forester to believe that certain trees willfully kill all other varieties oftrees around them and then conclude a specious “attitude” of trees. Let him look again. Whatmade the soil? What provides the means of keeping the oxygen balance? What makes itpossible for rain to fall in other areas? These willful and murderous trees. And squirrels planttrees. And Man plants trees. And trees shelter trees of another kind. And animals fertilize trees.And trees shelter animals. And trees hold the soil so less well rooted plants can grow. Lookanywhere and everywhere and we see life as an assist for life. The multitude of thecomplexities of life as affinities for life is not dramatic. But they are the steady, practical,important reason life can continue to exist at all.A redwood tree may be first out for redwood trees and although it does an excellent jobof seeming to exist as redwood alone, a closer glance will show it has dependencies and isdepended upon.Therefore the dynamic of any life form can be seen to be assisted by many otherdynamics and combines with them against the suppressive factors. None survive alone.Necessity has been declared to be a very wonderful thing. But necessity is a wordwhich has been taken rather loosely for granted. Opportunism seems to have been read largelyinto necessity. What is necessity? Besides being the “mother of invention,” is it a dramatic,sudden thing which excuses wars and murders, which touches a man only when he is about tostarve? Or is necessity a much gentler and less dramatic quantity? “Everything,” according toLeucippus, “is driven by necessity.” This is a keynote of much theorizing down through theages. Driven, that is the key to the error. Driven, things are driven. Necessity drives. Paindrives. Necessity and pain, pain and necessity.Recalling the dramatic and overlooking the important, Man has conceived himself, fromtime to time, to be an object of chase by necessity and pain. These were two anthropomorphic(manlike) things which, in full costume, stuck spears at him. It can be said to be a wrongconcept merely because it does not work to produce more answers.Whatever there is of necessity is within him. Nothing is driving him except his originalimpetus to survive. And he carries that within himself or his group. Within him is the forcewith which he fends off pain. Within him is the force with which he attracts pleasure.27"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"It chances to be a scientific fact that Man is a self-determined organism to the outermostlimit that any form of life can be, for he still depends upon other forms of life and his generalenvironment. But he is self-determined. This is a matter which will be covered later. But righthere it is necessary to indicate that he is not inherently a determined organism in the sense thathe is driven on this wonderful stimulus-response basis which looks so neat in certain textbooks, and works so completely unworkably in the world of Man. The happy little illustrationsabout rats do not serve when we are talking about Man. The more complex the organism, theless reliably these stimulus-response equation works. And when one reaches that highestcomplexity, Man, he has reached a fine degree of variability in terms of stimulus-response.The more sentient, the more rational an organism, the more that organism is self-determined.Self-determinism, like all things, is relative. Compared to a rat, however, Man is very self-determined indeed. This is only a scientific fact because it can easily be proven.The more sentient the man, the less he is a “push-button” instrument. Aberrated andreduced he can, of course, in a limited degree, be made to perform like a marionette, but then itis understood that the more aberrated a person is, the closer he approaches the intelligencequotient of an animal.Given this self-determinism, it is interesting to observe what a man does with it. Whilehe can never escape the “didn’t know it was loaded” equation in terms of cataclysm or theunexpected gain of some other life form, he operates in a high zone level of survival potential.But here he is, self-determined, rational, his primary weapon, his mind, in excellent workingorder. What are his necessity instincts?Necessity, according to that very sentient if rapidly subject-changing article, thedictionary, is “the state of being necessary; that which is unavoidable; compulsion.” It alsoadds that necessity is “extreme poverty,” but we don’t want that. We are talking about survival.The compulsion mentioned can be re-evaluated in terms of the survival dynamic. Thatis interior in the organism and the race. And what is “necessary” to survival?We have seen and can prove clinically that there are two factors at work. The necessityof avoiding pain is a factor because, degree by degree, little things, not much in themselves,can amount to large pains which, compounded in that rapid geometric progression, bring ondeath. Pain is the sadness of being bawled out for poor work, because that may lead to beingfired, which may lead to starvation, which may lead to death. Run any equation into whichpain has entered and it can be seen that it reduces down to possible non-survival. And if thiswere all there were to surviving and if necessity were a vicious little gnome with a pitch-fork, itseems rather obvious that there would be scant reason to go on living. But there is the otherpart of the equation, pleasure. That is a more stable part than pain, Stoics to the contrary, asclinical tests in dianetics prove.There is therefore a necessity for pleasure, for working, as happiness can be defined,toward known goals over not unknowable obstacles. And the necessity for pleasure is suchthat a great deal of pain can be borne to attain it. Pleasure is the positive commodity. It isenjoyment of work, contemplation of deeds well done; it is a good book or a good friend; it istaking all the skin off one’s knees climbing the Matterhorn; it is hearing the kid first say daddy;it is a brawl on the Bund at Shanghai or the whistle of amour from a doorway; it’s adventureand hope and enthusiasm and “someday I’ll learn to paint”; it’s eating a good meal or kissing apretty girl or playing a stiff game of bluff on the stock exchange. It’s what Man does that heenjoys doing; it’s what Man does that he enjoys contemplating; it’s what Man does that heenjoys remembering; and it may be just the talk of things he knows he’ll never do.Man will endure a lot of pain to obtain a little pleasure. Out in the laboratory of theworld, it takes very little time to confirm that.And how does necessity fit this picture? There is a necessity for pleasure, a necessity aslive and quivering and vital as the human heart itself. He who said that a man who had two28"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"loaves of bread should sell one to buy white hyacinth, spoke sooth. The creative, theconstructive, the beautiful, the harmonious, the adventurous, yes, and even escape from themaw of oblivion, these things are pleasure and these things are necessity. There was a manonce who had walked a thousand miles just to see an orange tree and another who was a massof scars and poor-set bones who was eager just to get a chance to “fan another bronc.”It is very well to dwell in some Olympian height and write a book of penalties and verywell to read to find what writers said that other writers said, but it is not very practical.The pain-drive theory does not work. If some of these basics of dianetics were onlypoetry about the idyllic state of Man, they might be justified in that, but it happens that out inthe laboratory of the world, they work.Man, in affinity with Man, survives, and that survival is pleasure. 29"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IVThe Four DynamicsIn the original equations of dianetics, when the research was young, it was believedthat survival could be envisioned in personal terms alone and still answer all conditions. Atheory is only as good as it works. And it works as well as it explains observed data andpredicts flew material which will be found, in fact, to exist.Survival in personal terms was computed until the whole activity of Man could betheoretically explained in terms of self alone. The logic looked fairly valid. But then it wasapplied to the world. Something was wrong: it did not solve problems. In fact, the theory ofsurvival in personal terms alone was so unworkable that it left a majority of behaviorphenomena unexplained. But it could be computed and it still looked good.Then it was that a nearly intuitive idea occurred. Man’s understanding developed inratio to his recognition of his brotherhood with the Universe. That was high flown but ityielded results.Was Man himself a brotherhood of Man? He had evolved and become strong as agregarious being, an animal that hunted in packs. It seemed possible that all his activities couldbe computed in terms of the survival of the group. That computation was made. It lookedgood. Man survived, it was postulated, solely in terms of the survival of his group. It lookedgood but it left a majority of observed phenomena unexplained.It was attempted, then, to explain Man’s behavior in terms of Mankind alone; which isto say, it was assumed that Mankind survived for Mankind in a highly altruistic way. This wasstraight down the sylvan path of Jean Jacques Rousseau. It could be computed that Man livedalone for the survival of all Mankind. But when addressed to the laboratory -- the world -- itdid not work.Finally, it was recalled that some had thought that Man’s entire activity and all hisbehavior could be explained by assuming that he lived for sex alone. This was not an originalassumption. But some original computations were made upon it and it is true that, by a fewquick twists of the equation, his survival activity can be made to resolve on only the sexualbasis. But when this was applied to observed data, again it failed to explain everyphenomenon.An examination was made of what had been attempted. It had been assumed that Mansurvived only for himself as an individual; it had been computed that he survived only for thegroup, the pack, for society; it had been postulated that he survived only for Mankind; andfinally, it had been theorized that he lived only for sex. None worked alone.A new computation was made on the survival dynamic. Exactly for what was mansurviving? All four of these factors, self, sex, group and Mankind were entered into a newequation. And now it was found, a theory was in hand which worked. It explained allobserved phenomena and it predicted new phenomena which were discovered to exist. It was ascientific equation, therefore!From the survival dynamic, in this fashion, were evolved the four dynamics. Bysurvival dynamic was meant the basic command, SURVIVE! which underlay all activity. Bydynamic was meant one of the four purpose divisions of the entire dynamic principle. The fourdynamics were not new forces; they were sub-divisions of the primary force.DYNAMIC ONE is the urge toward ultimate survival on the part of the individual and forhimself. It includes his immediate symbiotes*, the extension of culture for his own benefit, andname immortality.30"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"DYNAMIC TWO is the urge of the individual toward ultimate survival via the sex act, thecreation of and the rearing of children. It includes their symbiotes, the extension of culture forthem, and their future provision.DYNAMIC THREE is the urge of the individual toward ultimate survival for the group. Itincludes the symbiotes of the group and the extension of its culture.DYNAMIC FOUR includes the urge of the individual toward ultimate survival for all Mankind.It includes the symbiotes of Mankind and the extension of its culture.Life, the atom and the universe and energy itself are included under the symbioticclassification.It will be seen immediately that these four dynamics are actually a spectrum withoutsharp division lines. The survival dynamic can be seen to sweep out from the individual toembrace the entire species and its symbiotes.None of these dynamics is necessarily stronger than any of the others. Each is strong.They are the four roads a man takes to survival. And the four roads are actually one road. Andthe one road is actually a spectrum of thousands of roads contained within the four. They areall in terms of past, present and future in that the present may be a sum of the past and thefuture may be the product of the past and present.All the purposes of Man can be considered to lie within this spectrum and all behaviorbecomes explained.That Man is selfish is a valid statement when one means an aberrated Man. That Man isanti-social is an equally valid statement if one adds the modifier, aberration. And other suchstatements resolve equally. * The dianetic meaning of symbiote is extended beyond thedictionary definition to mean “any or all life or energy forms which are mutually dependent forsurvival.” The atom depends on the Universe, the Universe on the atom. Now it happens that these four dynamics can be seen to compete, one with another, intheir operation within an individual or a society. There is a rational reason for this. The phrase“social competition” is a compound of aberrated behavior and sentient difficulties.Any man, group or race may be in contest with any race, group or man and even incontest with sex on an entirely rational level.The Equation of the Optimum Solution would be that a problem has been well resolvedwhich portends the maximum good for the maximum number of dynamics. That is to say thatany solution, modified by the time available to put the solution into effect, should be creative orconstructive for the greatest possible number of dynamics. The optimum solution for anyproblem would be a solution which achieved the maximum benefit in all the dynamics. Thismeans that a man, determining upon some project, would fare best if he benefited everythingconcerned in the four dynamics as his project touched them. He would then have to benefithimself as well for the solution to be optimum. In other words, the benefiting of the group andMankind dynamic but the blocking of the sex dynamic and the self dynamic would be muchpoorer than the best solution. The conduct survival pattern is built upon this equation of theoptimum solution. It is the basic equation of all rational behavior and is the equation on whicha clear functions. It is inherent in Man.In other words, the best solution to any problem is that which will bring the greatestgood to the greatest number of beings, including self, progeny, family associates, political andracial groups, and at length to all mankind. The greatest good may require, as well, somedestruction, but the solution deteriorates in a ratio to the destructiveness employed. Self-sacrifice and selfishness are alike reductive of the optimum action equation and alike have beensuspected and should be.31"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"This is entirely a matter of: does it work? Even on an unaberrated basis there are timeswhen one or another of these dynamics rave to be dropped from the computation of someactivity or other and indeed, few problems are so entirely intense that they must take intoaccountthe dynamics. But when a problem achieves such intensity and time is not an importantfactor, serious errors can follow the omission of one or another of the dynamics from thefactors considered.In the case of a Napoleon “saving France” at the expense of the remainder of Mankindin Europe, the equation of the optimum solution was so far neglected that all the revolutionarygains of the French people were lost. In the case of Caesar “saving Rome,” the equation wasso poorly done that the survival of Rome was impeded.But there are special cases when the equation of the optimum solution becomes soinvolved with time that certain dynamics must be neglected to permit other dynamics to persist.The case of a sailor giving his own life to save his ship answers the group dynamic. Such anaction is a valid solution to a problem. But it violates the optimum solution because it did notanswer for Dynamic One: self.Many examples of various kinds could be cited where one or another of the dynamicsmust, of necessity, receive priority, all on an entirely rational basis.On an aberrated basis the equation is still valid but complicated by irrationalities whichhave no part of the situation. Many solutions are bad merely because of false educational dataor no data at all. But these are still solutions. In the case of aberrated solutions, the dynamicsare actually and actively impeded, as will later be outlined in full. 32"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VSummaryThe dynamic principle of existence is survival.This survival can be graduated into four zones, each one progressively portending abetter opportunity of reaching the potential of immortality. Zone 0 borders from death andincludes apathy; Zone 1 borders from apathy and includes violent effort; Zone 2 borders fromviolence into mediocre but not entirely satisfactory success; Zone 3 borders from the mediocreto the excellent chance. These zones are each occasioned by the ratio of the suppressor to thesurvival dynamic. In apathy, Zone 0, the suppressor appears too great to be overcome. In thearea of violence, Zone I, the suppressor more or less overbalances the survival dynamic,requiring enormous effort which, when expended without result, drops the organism into theZero Zone. In the area of mediocrity, Zone 2, the suppressor and the survival dynamic aremore or less evenly balanced. In the area of Zone 3 the survival dynamic has overcome thesuppressor and, the chances of survival being excellent, is the area of high response toproblems. These four zones might be classed as the zone of no hope, the zone of violentaction, the area of balance and the area of high hope. Clinical experiment is the basis of thesezones since they follow a progress of mental or physical being as it rises from the death areainto high existence.The four dynamics are subdivisions of the survival dynamic and are, in Mankind, thethrust toward potential survival in terms of entities. They embrace all the purposes, activitiesand behavior of Mankind. They could be said to be a conduct survival pattern. The first ofthese, but not necessarily the most important nor yet the one which will receive priority invarious efforts, is the individual dynamic, DYNAMIC ONE, which includes the personalsurvival of the individual as a living person and the survival of his personal symbiotes.DYNAMIC TWO is the thrust toward potential immortality through children and includes allsexual activity as well as the symbiotes of the children. DYNAMIC THREE is survival interms of the group, which term may include such things as a club, a military company, a city, astate, a nation; this would include the symbiotes of the group. DYNAMIC FOUR is the thrusttoward potential immortality of Mankind as a species and the symbiotes of Mankind. Embracedwithin these classifications are any part of existence, any form of matter and, indeed theUniverse.Any problem or situation discoverable within the activities or purposes of Mankind isembraced within these dynamics.The equation of the optimum solution is inherent within the organism and, modified byeducation or viewpoint and modified further by time, is the operating method of unaberratedindividuals, groups or Mankind. The equation of the optimum solution is always present evenin severely aberrated individuals and is used as modified by their education, viewpoint andavailable time. The aberration does not remove activity from the dynamics of survival.Aberrated conduct is irrational survival conduct and is fully intended to lead to survival. Thatthe intent is not the act does not eradicate the intent. THESE ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL AXIOMS OF DIANETICS: The dynamicprinciple of existence -- SURVIVE! Survival, considered as the single and sole Purpose, sub-divides into four dynamics.DYNAMIC ONE is the urge of the individual toward survival for the individual and hissymbiotes. (By symbiote is meant all entities and energies which aid survival.)DYNAMIC TWO is the urge of the individual toward survival through procreation; it includesboth the sex act and the raising of progeny, the care of children and their symbiotes.33"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"DYNAMIC THREE is the urge of the individual toward survival for the group or the group forthe group and includes the symbiotes of that group.DYNAMIC FOUR is the urge of the individual toward survival for Mankind or the urgetoward survival of Mankind for Mankind as well as the group for Mankind, etc., and includesthe symbiotes of mankind.The absolute goal of survival is immortality or infinite survival. This is sought by theindividual in terms of himself as an organism, as a spirit or as a name or as his children, as agroup of which he is a member or as Mankind and the progeny and symbiotes of others as wellas his own. The reward of survival activity is pleasure.The ultimate penalty of destructive activity is death or complete non-survival, and ispain. Successes raise the survival potential toward infinite survival. Failures lower thesurvival potential toward death. The human mind is engaged upon perceiving and retaining data, composing orcomputing conclusions and posing and resolving problems related to organisms along all fourdynamics and the purpose of perception, retention, concluding and resolving problems is todirect its own organism and symbiotes and other organisms and symbiotes along the fourdynamics toward survival. Intelligence is the ability to perceive, pose and resolve problems.The dynamic is the tenacity to life and vigor and persistence in survival. Both thedynamic and intelligence are necessary to persist and accomplish and neither is a constantquantity from individual to individual, group to group.The dynamics are inhibited by engrams, which lie across them and disperse life force.Intelligence is inhibited by engams which feed false or improperly graded data into theanalyzer. Happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal and,transiently, the contemplation of or indulgence in pleasure.The analytical mind is that portion of the mind which perceives and retains experiencedata to compose and resolve problems and direct the organism along the four dynamics. Itthinks in differences and similarities.The reactive mind is that portion of the mind which files and retains physical pain andpainful emotion and seeks to direct the organism solely on a stimulus-response basis. It thinksonly in identities. The somatic mind is that mind which, directed by the analytical or reactive mind, placessolutions into effect on the physical level.A training pattern is that stimulus-response mechanism resolved by the analytical mindto care for routine activity or emergency activity. It is held in the somatic mind and can bechanged at will by the analytical mind.Habit is that stimulus-response reaction dictated by the reactive mind from the contentof engrams and put into effect by the somatic mind. It can be changed only by those thingswhich change engams.Aberrations, under which is included all deranged or irrational behavior, are caused byengams. They are stimulus-response pro- and contra-survival. Psycho-somatic ills are causedby engrams. The engram is the single source of aberrations and psycho-somatic ills. Momentsof “unconsciousness” when the analytical mind is attenuated in greater or lesser degree are theonly moments when engrams can be received. The engram is a moment of “unconsciousness”containing physical pain or painful emotion and all perceptions and is not available to theanalytical mind as experience.34"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Emotion is three things: engramic response to situations, endocrine metering of thebody to meet situations on an analytical level and the inhibition or the furtherance of life force.The potential value of an individual or a group may be expressed by the equation:(PV = ID) where I is Intelligence and D is Dynamic.The worth of an individual is computed in terms of the alignment, on any dynamic, ofhis potential value with optimum survival along that dynamic. A high PV may, by reversedvector, result in a negative worth as in some severely aberrated persons. A high PV on anydynamic assures a high worth only in the unaberrated person. 35"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Book TwoTHE SINGLE SOURCE OF ALLINORGANIC MENTAL AND ORGANICPSYCHO-SOMATIC ILLS36"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IThe Analytical Mind and the Standard Memory BanksThis chapter begins the search for human error and tells where it is not.The human mind can be considered to have three major divisions. First, there is theanalytical mind, second, there is the reactive mind, and third, there is the somatic mind.Consider the analytical mind as a computing machine. This is analogy, because theanalytical mind, while it behaves like a computing machine, is yet more fantastically capablethan any computing machine ever constructed and infinitely more elaborate. It could be calledthe “computational mind” or the “egsusheyftef.” But for our purposes, the analytical mind, as adescriptive name, will do. This mind may live in the pre-frontal lobes -- there is some hint ofthat -- but this is a problem of structure, and nobody really knows about structure. So we shallcall this computational part of the mind the “analytical mind” because it analyzes data.The monitor can be considered part of the analytical mind. The monitor could be calledthe center of awareness of the person. It, inexactly speaking, is the person. It has beenapproximated by various names for thousands of years, each one reducing down to “I.” Themonitor is in control of the analytical mind. It is not in control because it has been told to be butonly because it is, inherently. It is not a demon who lives in the skull nor a little man whovocalizes one’s thoughts. It is “I.” No matter how many aberrations a person may have, “I” isalways “I.” No matter how “clear” a person becomes, “I,” is still “I.” “I” may be submergednow and then in an aberree, but it is always present.The analytical mind shows various evidences of being an organ, but as we know in thisage so little of structure, the full structural knowledge of the analytical mind must come afterwe know what it does. And in dianetics we know precisely that for the first time. It is knownand can be proven with ease that the analytical mind, be it one organ of the body or several,behaves as you would expect any good computing machine to behave.What would you want in a computing machine? The action of the analytical mind -- oranalyzer -- is everything anyone could want from the best computer available. It can and doesdo all the tricks of a computer. And over and above that, it directs the building of computers.And it is as thoroughly right as any computer ever was. The analytical mind is not just a goodcomputer, it is a perfect computer. It never makes a mistake. It cannot err in any way so longas a human being is reasonably intact (unless something has carried away a piece of his mentalequipment).The analytical mind is incapable of error, and it is so certain that it is incapable of errorthat it works out everything on the basis that it cannot make an error. If a person says, “Icannot add,” he either means that he has never been taught to add or that he has an aberrationabout adding. It does not mean that there is anything wrong with the analytical mind.While the whole being is, in an aberrated state, grossly capable of error, still theanalytical mind is not. For a computer is just as good as the data on which it operates and nobetter. Aberration, then, arises from the nature of the data offered to the analytical mind as aproblem to be computed.The analytical mind has its standard memory banks.Just where these are locatedstructurally is again no concern of ours at this time. To operate, the analytical mind has to havepercepts (data), memory (data), and imagination (data).There are another data storage bank and another part of the human mind which containaberrations and are the source of insanities. These will be fully covered later and should not beconfused with either the analytical mind or the standard memory banks.37"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Whether or not the data contained in the standard memory banks is evaluated correctlyor not, it is all there. The various senses receive information and this information files straightinto the standard memory banks. It does not go through the analyzer first. It is filed and theanalyzer then has it from the standard banks.There are several of these standard banks and they may be duplicated in themselves sothat there are several of each kind of bank. Nature seems generous in such things. There is abank, or set of banks, for each perception. These can be considered racks of data filed in across-index system which would make an intelligence officer purple with envy. Any singlepercept is filed as a concept. The sight of a moving car, for instance, is filed in the visio-bankin color and motion, at the time seen, cross-indexed to the area in which seen, cross-indexed toall data about cars, cross-indexed to thoughts about cars, and so forth and so forth with theadditional filing of conclusions (thought stream) of the moment and thought streams of the pastwith all their conclusions. The sound of that car is similarly filed from the ears, straight intothe audio-bank, and cross-indexed multitudinously as before. The other sensations of thatmoment are also filed, in their own banks.Now it may be that the whole filing is done in one bank. It would be simpler that way.But this is not a matter of structure but mental performance. Eventually somebody will discoverjust how they are filed. Right now the function of filing is all that interests us. Every percept -- sight, sound, smell, feeling, taste, organic sensation, pain, rhythm,kinesthesia (weight and muscular motion) and emotion -- is each properly and neatly filed inthe standard banks in full. It does not matter how many aberrations a physically intact personhas or whether he thinks he can or cannot contain this data or recall it, the file is there and iscomplete.This file begins at a very early period, of which more later. It then runs consecutively,whether the individual is asleep or awake, except in moments of “unconsciousness,”* for anentire lifetime. It apparently has an infinite capacity.The numbers of these concepts (concept means that which is retained after somethinghas been perceived) would stagger an astronomer’s computer. The existence and profusion ofmemories retained were discovered and studied in a large number of cases, and they can beexamined in anyone by certain processes.Everything in this bank is correct in so far as the single action of perception isconcerned. There may be organic errors in the organs of perception, such as blindness ordeafness (when physical, not aberrational), which would leave blanks in the banks; and theremay be organic impairment such as partial organic deafness which would leave partial blanks.But these things are not error in the standard memory banks; they are simply absence of data.Like the computer, the standard memory banks are perfect, recording faithfully and reliably.Now part of the standard banks is audio-semantic, which is to say, the recordings ofwords heard. And part of the banks is visio-semantic, which is to say, the recordings of wordsread. These are special parts of the sound and sight files. A blind man who has to read with hisfingers develops a tactile-semantic file. The content of the speech files is exactly as heardwithout alteration.Another interesting part of the standard memory banks is that they apparently file theoriginal and hand forward exact copies to the analyzer. They will hand out as many exactcopies as are demanded without diminishing the actual file original. And they hand out thesecopies each in kind with color-motion sight, tone-audio, etc.The amount of material which is retained in the average standard memory banks wouldfill several libraries. But the method of retention is invariable. And the potentiality of recall isperfect.38"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The primary source of error in “rational” computation comes under the headings ofinsufficient data and erroneous data. The individual, daily facing new situations, is not alwaysin possession of all the material he requires to make a decision. And he may have been toldsomething on Good Authority which was not true and yet which did not find counter-evidencein the banks.Between the standard banks, which are perfect and reliable, and the computer, theanalytical mind, which is perfect and reliable, there is no irrational concourse. The answer isalways as right as it can be made to be in the light of data at hand, and that is all anyone can askof a computing device or a recording device.The analytical mind goes even further in its efforts to be right than one would suppose.It constantly checks and weighs new experience in the light of old experience, forms newconclusions in the light of old conclusions, changes old conclusions and generally is very busybeing right.The analytical mind might be considered to have been given a sacred post of trust by thecells to safeguard the colony, and it does everything within its power to carry out that Mission.It has correct data, as correct as possible, and it does correct computations on them, as correctas they can be made. When one considers the enormous number of factors which one handles,for instance, in the action of driving a car ten blocks, he can appreciate how very, very busy onhow very many levels that analytical mind can be.Now before we introduce the villain of this piece, the reactive mind, it is necessary tounderstand something about the relation of the analytical mind to the organism itself.The analytical mind, charged with full responsibility, is far from without authority tocarry out its actions and desires. Through the mechanisms of the life function regulator (whichhandles all the mechanical functions of living), the analytical mind can effect any function ofthe body it desires to effect.In excellent working order -- which is to say, when the organism is not aberrated -- theanalytical mind can influence the heartbeat, the endocrines (such things as calcium and sugar inthe blood, adrenalin, etc.), selective blood flow (stopping it in the limbs or starting it at will),urine, excreta, etc. All glandular, rhythm and fluid functions of the body can be at thecommand of the analytical mind. This is not to say that in a cleared person they always are.That would be very uncomfortable and bothersome. But it does say that the analytical mind caneffect changes at desire when it skills itself to do so. This is a marter of laboratory proof, veryeasy to do.People have long been intuitive about the “full power of the mind.” Well, the full powerof the mind would be the analytical mind working with the standard memory banks, the lifefunction regulator and one other thing.The last and most important thing is, of course, the organism. It is in the charge of theanalytical mind. And the analytical mind controls it in other ways than life function. Allmuscles and the remainder of the organism can be under the full command of the analyticalmind.In order to keep it and its circuits free of bric-a-brac and minor activities, the analyticalmind is provided with a learned training pattern regulator. Into this, by education, it can placethe stimulus-response patterns necessary for the performance of tasks like talking, walking,piano playing, etc. These learned patterns are not unchangeable. Because they are selected bythe analytical mind after thought and effort, there is seldom any need to change them; if newsituations arise, a new pattern is trained into the muscles. None of these are “conditionings”;they are simply training patterns which the organism can use without attention of anymagnitude from the analyzer. An uncountable number of such patterns can be laid into the39"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"organism by this method. And they are not the source of any trouble since they file by time andsituation, and a very little thought will serve to annul old ones in favor of new ones.All muscles, voluntary and “involuntary,” can be at the command of the analyticalmind.Here, then, is the composite of a sentient being. There is no chance for error beyondthe error incident to insufficient data and erroneous but accepted data (and the last will be usedby the analyzer just once if that once proves the data to be wrong), Here is the realm ofpleasure, emotion, creation and construction, and even destruction if the computation on theoptimum solution says something has to be destroyed.The dynamics underlie the activities of the analytical mind. The urge toward survivalexplains all its actions. That we can understand the fundamental simplicity of the functionalmechanism does not, however, mean that a man operating this way alone is cold or calculatingor intent on “tooth and claw.” The nearer Man approaches this optimum, in an individual or ina whole society, the quicker and warmer is that society, the more honest may be its moods andactions.Sanity depends upon rationality. Here is optimum rationality and therefore optimumsanity. And here also are all the things Man likes to think Man should be like or, for thatmatter, what he has represented his better gods to be like. This is the clear.This is sanity. This is happiness. This is survival.Where is the error? 40"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIThe Reactive MindIt is fairly well accepted in these times that life in all forms evolved from the basicbuilding blocks, the virus and the cell. Its only relevance to dianetics is that such a propositionworks -- and actually that is all we ask of dianetics. There is no point to writing here a pasttome on biology and evolution. We can add some chapters to those things, but Charles Darwindid his job well, and the fundamental principles of evolution can be found in his and otherworks.The proposition on which dianetics was originally entered was evolution. It waspostulated that the cells themselves had the urge to survive and that that urge was common tolife. It was further postulated that organisms -- individuals -- were constructed of cells andwere in fact aggregations of colonies of cells.As went the building block, so went the organism. In the finite realms and for any ofour purposes, Man could be considered to be a colonial aggregation of cells and it could beassumed that his purpose was identical with the purpose of his building blocks.The cell is a unit of life which is seeking to survive and only to Survive.Man is a structure of cells which are asking to survive, and only to survive.Man’s mind is the command post of operation and is constructed to resolve problemsand pose problems related to survival and only to survival.The action of survival, if optimum, would lead to survival. The optimum survival conduct pattern was formulated and then studied for exceptions,and there were no exceptions found.The survival conduct pattern was discovered to be far from sterile and barren but wasfull of rich and most pleasant activity.None of these postulates outlawed any concept concerning the human soul or divine orcreative imagination. It was understood perfectly that this was a study in the finite universeonly and that spheres and realms of thought and action might very well exist above this finitesphere. But it was also discovered that none of these factors were needed to resolve the entireproblem of aberration and irrational conduct.The human mind was discovered to have been most grossly maligned, for it was foundto be possessed of capabilities far in excess of any heretofore imagined much less tested.Basic human character was found to have been pilloried because Man had not been ableto distinguish between irrational conduct derived from poor data and irrational conduct derivedfrom another, far more vicious source.If there ever was a devil, he designed the reactive mind.This functional mechanism managed to bury itself from view so thoroughly that onlyinductive philosophy, traveling from effect back to cause, served to uncover it. The detectivework which was invested in the location of this arch criminal of the human psyche occupiedmany years. Its identity can now be certified by any technician in any clinic or in any group ofmen. Two hundred and seventy-three individuals have been examined and treated, representingall the various types of inorganic mental illness and the many varieties of psycho-somatic ills.41"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"In each one this reactive mind was found operating, its principles unvaried. This is a longseries of cases and will soon become longer. The reactive mind is possessed by everyone. No human being examined anywhere wasdiscovered to be without one or without aberrative content in his engram bank, the reservoir ofdata which serves the reactive mind.What does this mind do? It shuts off hearing recall. It places vocal circuits in the mind.It makes people tone-deaf. It makes people stutter. It does anything and everything that can befound in any list of mental ills: psychoses, neuroses, compulsions, repressions...What can it do? It can give a man arthritis, bursitis, asthma, allergies, sinusitis,coronary trouble, high blood pressure, and so on down the whole catalogue of psycho-somaticills, adding a few more which were never specifically classified as psycho-somatic, such as thecommon cold.And it is the only thing in the human being which can produce these effects. It is thething which uniformly brings them about.This is the mind which made Socrates think he had a “demon” that gave him answers.This is the mind that made Caligula appoint his horse to a government post. This is the mindwhich made Caesar cut the right hands from thousands of Gauls, which made Napoleon reducethe height of Frenchmen one inch.This is the mind which keeps war a thing of alarm, which makes politics irrational,which makes superior officers snarl, which makes children cry in fear of the dark. This is themind which makes a man suppress his hopes, which holds his apathies, which gives himirresolution when he should act, and kills him before he has begun to live.If there ever was a devil, he invented it.Discharge the content of this mind’s bank and the arthritis vanishes, myopia gets better,heart illness decreases, asthma disappears, stomachs function properly, and the wholecatalogue of ills goes away and stays away.Discharge the reactive engram bank and the schizophrenic faces reality at last, themanic-depressive sets forth to accomplish things, the neurotic stops clinging to books whichtell him how much he needs his neuroses and begins to live, the woman stops snapping at herchildren and the dipsomaniac can drink when he likes and stop.These are scientific facts. They compare invariably with observed experience.The reactive mind is the entire source of aberration. It can be proved and has beenrepeatedly proven that there is no other, for when that engram bank is discharged, allundesirable symptoms vanish and a man begins to operate on his optimum pattern.If one were looking for something like demons in a human mind -- such as those oneobserves in some inmates of madhouses -- he could find them easily enough. Only they arenot demons. They are by-pass circuits from the engram bank. What prayer and exhortationshave been used against these by-pass circuits!If one did not believe in demons, if one supposed that Man were good after all (as apostulate, of course), how would the evil get into him? What would be the source of theseinsane rages? What would be the source of his slips of the tongue? How would he come toknow irrational fear?Why is it that one does not like his boss although his boss has always been pleasant?Why is it that suicides smash their bodies to bits?42"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Why does Man behave destructively, irrationally, fighting wars, killing, ruining wholesections of Mankind?What is the source of all neuroses, psychoses, insanities?Let us return to a brief examination of the analytical mind. Let us examine its memorybanks. Here we find all the sense concepts on file. Or so it appears at first glance. Let us takeanother look, a look at the time factor. There is a time sense about these analytical mind banks.It is very accurate, as though the organism were equipped with a fine watch. But there issomething wrong here about time -- it has gaps in it! There are moments when nothing seemsto be filed in these standard banks. These are gaps which take place during moments of“unconsciousness,” that state of being caused by anaesthesia, drugs, injury or shock.This is the only data missing from a standard bank. If in hypnotic trance you examine apatient’s memory of an operation these incidents are the only periods in the banks you will notfind. You can find these if you care to look and don’t care what happens to your patient -- ofwhich more later. But the point is that there is something missing which has always beenconsidered by one and all in any age never to have been recorded.One and all in every age have never been able to put a finger on insanity either. Arethese two data in agreement and do they have relationship? They definitely do.There are two things which appear to be -- but are not -- recorded in the standard banks:painful emotion and physical pain.How would you go about the building of a sensitive machine upon which the life anddeath affairs of an organism depended, which was to be the chief tool of an individual? Wouldyou leave its delicate circuits prey to every overload or would you install a fuse system? If adelicate instrument is in circuit with a power line, it is protected by several sets of fuses. Anycomputer would be so safeguarded.It happens that there is some small evidence to support the electrical theory of thenervous system. In pain there are very heavy overcharges in the nerves. It may well have been-- and elsewhere some dianetic computations have been made about this -- that the brain is theabsorber for overcharges of power resulting from injury, the power itself being generated bythe injured cells in the area of injury. That is theory and has no place here save to serve as anexample. We are dealing now only with scientific fact.The action of the analytical mind during a moment of intense pain is suspended. In fact,the analytical mind behaves just as though it were an organ to which vital supply was shut offwhenever shock is present.As an example, a man struck in the side by a car is knocked “unconscious” and onregaining “consciousness” has no record of the period when he was “knocked out.” Thiswould be a non-survival circumstance. It means that there would be no volition on the part ofanyone who was injured, and this is the time when the organism most requires volition. So thisis non-survival, if the whole mind cuts out whenever pain appears. Would an organism withmore than a billion years of biological engineering behind it leave a problem like this unsolved?Indeed, the organism solved the problem. Maybe the problem is very difficult,biologically, and maybe the solution is not very good, but large provision has been made forthose moments when the organism is “unconscious.”The answer to the problem of making the organism react in moments of“unconsciousness” or near “unconsciousness” is also the answer to insanity and psycho-somatic illnesses and all the strange mental quirks to which people are liable and which gaverise to that fable “it is human to err.”43"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Clinical tests prove these statements to be scientific facts:1. The mind records on some level continuously during the entire life of the organism.2. All recordings of the lifetime are available.3. “Unconsciousness,” in which the mind is oblivious of its surroundings, is possibleonly in death and does not exist as total amnesia in life.4. All mental and physical derangements of a psychic nature come about from moments of“unconsciousness.”5. Such moments can be reached and drained of charge with the result of returning themind to optimum operating condition.“Unconsciousness” is the single source of aberration. There is no such action as“mental conditioning” except on a conscious training level (where it exists only with theconsent of the person).If you care to make the experiment you can take a man, render him “unconscious,” hurthim and give him information. By dianetic technique, no matter what information you gavehim, it can be recovered. This experiment should not be carelessly conducted because youmight also render him insane.A pale shade of this operation can be obtained by hypnosis, either by its usualtechniques or drugs. By installing “positive suggestions” in a subject, he can be made to actlike an insane person. This test is not a new one. It has been well known that compulsions orrepressions can be so introduced into the psyche. The ancient Greek was quite familiar with itand used it to produce various delusions.There is what is known as a “post-hypnotic suggestion.” An understanding of this canassist an understanding of the basic mechanism of insanity. The actions under bothcircumstances are not identical, but they are similar enough in their essence.A man is placed in a hypnotic trance by standard hypnotic technique or some hypnoticdrug. The operator then may say to him, “When you awaken there is something you must do.Whenever I touch my tie you will remove your coat. When I let go my tie, you will put on yourcoat. Now you will forget that I have told you to do this.” The subject is then awakened. He is not consciously aware of the command. If told hehad been given an order while “asleep,” he would resist the idea or shrug but he would notknow. The operator then touches his tie. The subject may make some remark about its beingtoo warm and so take his coat off. The operator then releases his tie. The subject may remarkthat he is now cold and will put his coat back on. The operator then touches his tie. The subjectmay say that his coat has been to the tailor’s and with much conversation finally explain whyhe is taking it off, perhaps to see if the back seam had been sewn properly. The operator thenreleases his tie and the subject says he is satisfied with the tailor and so replaces his coat.Theoperator may touch his tie many times and each time receive action on the part of the subject.At last the subject may become aware, from the expressions on people’s faces, thatsomething is wrong. He will not know what is wrong. He will not even know that thetouching of the tie is the signal which makes him take off his coat. He will begin to growuncomfortable. He may find fault with the operator’s appearance and begin to criticize hisclothing. He still does not know the tie is a signal. He will still react and remain in ignorancethat there is some strange reason he must take off his coat -- all he knows is that he isuncomfortable with his coat on whenever the tie is touched, uncomfortable with his coat offevery time the tie is released.44"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"These various actions are very important to an understanding of the reactive mind.Hypnotism is a laboratory tool. It is not used to any extent in dianetic therapy, but it has servedas a means of examining minds and getting their reactions. Hypnotism is a wild variable. Afew people can be hypnotized, many cannot be. Hypnotic suggestions will sometimes “take”and sometimes they won’t.Sometimes they make persons well and sometimes they make them ill -- the samesuggestion reacting differently in different people. An engineer knows how to make use of awild variable. There is something which makes it unpredictable. Finding out the basic reasonhypnotism was a variable helped to discover the source of insanity. And understanding themechanism of the post-hypnotic suggestion can aid an understanding of aberration.No matter how foolish a suggestion is given to a subject under hypnosis, he will carryit out one way or another. He can be told to remove his shoes or call someone at ten thefollowing day or to eat peas for breakfast and he will. These are direct orders and he willcomply with them. He can be told that his hats do not fit him and he will believe that they donot. Any suggestion will operate within his mind unbeknownst to his higher levels ofawareness.Very complex suggestions can be given. One such would be to the effect that he wasunable to utter the word “I.” He would omit it from his conversation, using remarkablemakeshifts without being “aware” that he was having to avoid the word. Or he could be toldthat he must never look at his hands and he will not. These are repressions. Given to thesubject when drugged or in a hypnotic sleep, these suggestions operate when he is awake. Andthey will continue to operate until released by the hypnotic operator.He can be told that he has an urge to sneeze every time he hears the word “rug” and thathe will sneeze when it is spoken. He can be told that he must jump two feet in the air everytime he sees a cat and he will jump. And he will do these things after he has been awakened.These are compulsions.He can be told that he will think very sexual thoughts about a certain girl but that whenhe thinks them he will feel his nose itch. He can be told that he has a continual urge to lie downand sleep and that every time he lies down he will feel that he cannot sleep. He will experiencethese things. These are neuroses.In further experiments he can be told, when he is in his hypnotic “sleep,” that he is thepresident of the country and that the secret service agents are trying to murder him. Or he canbe told that he is being fed poison in every restaurant in which he attempts to eat. These arepsychoses.He can be informed that he is really another person and that he owns a yacht andanswers to the name of “Sir Reginald.” Or he can be told that he is a thief, that he has a prisonrecord, and that the police are looking for him. These would be schizophrenic and paranoid-schizophrenic insanities respectively.The operator can inform the subject that the subject is the most wonderful person onearth and that everybody thinks so. Or that the subject is the object of adoration of all women.This would be a manic-type insanity.He can be convinced, while hypnotized, that when he wakes he will feel so terrible thathe will hope for nothing but death. This would be the depressive-type insanity.He can be told that all he can think about is how sick he is and that every malady ofwhich he reads becomes his. This would make him react like a hypochondriac.45"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Thus we could go down the catalogue of mental ills and by concocting positivesuggestions to create the state of mind, we could bring about, in the awakened subject, asemblance to every insanity.Understood that these are semblances. They are similar to insanity in that the subjectwould act like an insane person. He would not be an insane person. The moment thesuggestion is relieved -- the subject being informed that it was a suggestion -- the aberration(and all these insanities, etc., are grouped under the heading of aberration) theoreticallyvanishes.* * An injunction here. These are tests. They have been made on people who couldbe hypnotized and people who could not be but who were drugged. They brought forthvaluable data for dianetics. They can be duplicated only when you know dianetics unless youwant to actually drive somebody insane by accident. For these suggestions do not alwaysvanish. Hypnotism is a wild variable. It is dangerous and belongs in the parlor in the same wayyou would want an atom bomb there.The duplication of aberrations of all classes and kinds in subjects who have beenhypnotized or drugged has demonstrated that there is some portion of the mind which is not incontact with the consciousness but which contains data.It was the search for this portion of the mind which led to the resolution of the problemof insanity, psycho-somatic ills and other aberrations. It was not approached throughhypnotism, and hypnotism is just another tool, a tool which is of only occasional use in thepractice of dianetics and is, indeed, not needed at all.Here we have an individual who is acting sanely, who is given a positive suggestionand who then temporarily acts insanely. His sanity is restored by the release of the suggestioninto his consciousness, at which moment it loses its force upon him. But this is only asemblance of the mechanism involved. The actual insanity, one not laid now by somehypnotist, does not need to emerge into the consciousness to be released. There is thisdifference and others between hypnotism and the actual source of aberration; but hypnotism isa demonstration of its working parts.Review the first example of the positive suggestion. The subject was “unconscious,”which is to say, he was not in possession of complete awareness or self-determinism. He wasgiven something he must do and the something was hidden from his consciousness. Theoperator gave him a signal. When the signal occurred, the subject performed an act. Thesubject gave reasons for the act which were not the real reasons for it. The subject found faultwith the operator and the operator’s clothing but did not see that it was the tie which signaledthe action. The suggestion was released and the subject no longer felt a compulsion to performthe act. These are the parts of aberration. Once one knows exactly what parts of what areaberrations, the whole problem is very simple. It seems incredible at first glance that the sourcecould have remained so thoroughly hidden for so many thousands of years of research. But at,second glance, it becomes a wonder that the source was ever discovered. For it is hiddencunningly and well.“Unconsciousness” of the non-hypnotic variety is a little more rugged. It takes morethan a few passes of the hand to cause “unconsciousness” of the insanity-producing variety.The shock of accidents, the anaesthetics used for operations, the pain of injuries and thedeliriums of illness are the principal sources of what we call “unconsciousness.”The mechanism, in our analogue of the mind, is very simple. In comes a destructivewave of physical pain or a pervading poison such as ether and out go some or all of the fusesof the analytical mind. When it goes out, so go what we know as the standard memory banks.The periods of “unconsciousness” are blanks in the standard memory banks. Thesemissing periods make up what dianetics calls the reactive mind bank.46"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The times when the analytical mind is in full operation plus the times when the reactivemind is in operation are a continuous line of consecutive recording for the entire period of life.During the periods when the analytical mind is cut out of circuit in full or in part, thereactive mind cuts in in full or in part. In other words, if the analytical mind is unfused so thatit is half out of circuit, the reactive mind is half in circuit. No such sharp percentages areactually possible, but this is to give an approximation.When the individual is “unconscious” in full or in part, the reactive mind is cut in in fullor in part. When he is fully conscious, his analytical mind is fully in command of theorganism. When his consciousness is reduced, the reactive mind is cut into the circuit just thatmuch.The moments which contain “unconsciousness” in the individual are contra-survivalmoments, by and large. Therefore it is vital that something take over so that the individual cango through motions to save the whole organism. The fighter who fights half out on his feet, theburned man who drags himself out of the fire -- these are cases when the reactive mind isvaluable.The reactive mind is very rugged. It would have to be in order to stand up to the painwaves which knock out other sentience in the body. It is not very refined. But it is mostawesomely accurate. It possesses a low order of computing ability, an order which is sub-moron, but one would expect a low order of ability from a mind which stays in circuit whenthe body is being crushed or fried.The reactive bank does not store memories as we think of them. It stores engrams. *These engrams are a complete recording, down to the last accurate detail, of every perceptionpresent in a moment of partial or full “unconsciousness.” They are just as accurate as any otherrecording in the body. But they have their own force. They are like phonograph records ormotion pictures, if these contained all perceptions of sight, sound, smell, taste, organicsensation, etc.The difference between an engram and a memory, however, is quite distinct. Anengram can be permanently fused into any and all body circuits and behaves like an entity.In all laboratory tests on these engrams they were found to possess “inexhaustible”sources of power to command the body. No matter how many times one was reactivated in anindividual, it was still powerful. Indeed, it became even more able to exert its power inproportion to its reactivation.The only thing which could even begin to shake these engrams was the techniquewhich developed into dianetic therapy, which will be covered in full in the third section of thisvolume.This is an example of an engram: A woman is knocked down by a blow. She isrendered “unconscious.” She is kicked and told she is a faker, that she is no good, that she isalways changing her mind. A chair is overturned in the process. A faucet is running in thekitchen. A car is passing in the street outside. The engram contains a running record of all theseperceptions: sight, sound, tactile, taste, smell, organic sensation, kinetic sense, joint position,thirst record, etc. The engram would consist of the whole statement made to her when she was“unconscious”: the voice tones and emotion in the voice, the sound and feel of the original andlater blows, the tactile of the floor, the feel and sound of the chair overturning, the organicsensation of the blow, perhaps the taste of blood in her mouth or any other taste present there,the smell of the person attacking her and the smells in the room, the sound of the passing car’smotor and tires, etc.47"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"These would all be considered something on the order of a “positive suggestion.” Butthere is something else here which is new, something which is not in the standard banks exceptby context: pain and painful emotion.These things are what make the difference between the standard banks and the reactiveengram banks: physical pain and painful emotion. Physical pain and painful emotion are thedifference between an engram, which is the cause of aberration, all aberration, and a memory.** In dianetics, a memory is considered to be any concept of perceptions stored in the standardmemory banks which is potentially recallable by the “I.” A scene beheld by the eyes andperceived by the other senses becomes a record in the standard memory banks and later may berecalled by “I” for reference. We all have heard that bad experience is helpful to living and that without badexperience, man never learns. This may be very, very true. But it doesn’t embrace the engram.That isn’t experience. That is commanded action.Perhaps before Man had a large vocabulary, these engrams were of some use to him.They were survival in ways which will be developed later. But when Man acquired a fine,homonymic (words that sound the same but mean different things) language, and indeed, whenhe acquired any language, these engrams were much more a liability than a help. And now withMan well evolved, these engrams do not protect him at all but make him mad, inefficient andill.The proof of any assertion lies in its applicability. When these engrams are deletedfrom the reactive mind bank, rationality and efficiency are enormously heightened, health isgreatly increased and the individual computes rationally on the survival conduct pattern, whichis to say, he enjoys himself and the society of those around him and is constructive andcreative. He is destructive only when something actually threatens the sphere of his dynamics.These engrams, then, are entirely negative in value in this stage of Man’s development.When he was nearer the level of his animal cousins (who have, all of them, reactive minds ofthis same kind), he might have had use for the data. But language and his changed existencemake any engram a distinct liability, and no engram has any constructive value.The reactive mind was provided to secure survival. It still pretends to act in thatfashion. But its wild errors now lead only in the other direction. There are actually three kinds of engrams, all of them aberrative: First is the contra-survival engram. This contains physical pain, painful emotion, all other perceptions andmenace to the organism. A child knocked out by a rapist and abused receives this type ofengram. The contra-survival engram contains apparent or actual antagonism to the organism.The second engram type is the pro-survival engram. A child who has been abused is ill.He is told, while he is partially or wholly “unconscious,” that he will be taken care of, that heis dearly loved, etc. This engram is not taken as contra-survival but pro-survival. It seems to bein favor of survival. Of the two this last is the most aberrative since it is reinforced by the lawof affinity which is always more powerful than fear. Hypnotism preys on this characteristic ofthe reactive mind, being a sympathetic address to an artificially unconscious subject.Hypnotism is as limited as it is because it does not contain, as a factor, physical pain, andpainful emotion: things which keep an engram out of sight and moored below the level of“consciousness.”The third is the painful emotion engram which is similar to the other engrams. It iscaused by the shock of sudden loss such as the death of a loved one.The reactive mind bank is composed exclusively of these engrams. The reactive mindthinks exclusively with these engrams. And it “thinks” with them in a way which would make48"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Korzybski swear, for it thinks in terms of full identification, which is to say identities, onething identical to another.If the analytical mind did a computation on apples and worms, it could be stated,probably, as follows: some apples have worms in them, other don’t; when biting an apple oneoccasionally finds a worm unless the apple has been sprayed properly; worms in apples leavesholes.The reactive mind, however, doing a computation on apples and worms as contained inits engram bank, would calculate as follows: apples are worms are bites are holes in apples areholes in anything are apples and always are worms are apples are bites, etc.The analytical mind’s computations might embrace the most staggering summations ofcalculus, the shifty turns of symbolic logic, the computations requisite to bridge-building ordress-making. Any mathematical equation ever seen came from the analytical mind and mightbe used by the analytical mind in resolving the most routine problems.But not the reactive mind! That’s so beautifully, wonderfully simple that it can bestated, in operation, to have just one equation: A = A = A = A = A.Start any computation with the reactive mind. Start it with the data it contains, ofcourse. Any datum is just the same to it as any other datum in the same experience.An analytical computation done on the woman being kicked, as mentioned, would bethat women get themselves into situations sometimes when they get kicked and hurt and menhave been known to kick and hurt women.A reactive mind computation about his engram, as an engram, would be: the pain of thekick equals the pain of the blow equals the overturning chair equals the passing car equals thefaucet equals the fact that she is a faker equals the fact that she is no good equals the fact thatshe changes her mind equals the voice tones of the man equals the emotion equals a fakerequals a faucet running equals the pain of the kick equals organic sensation in the area of thekick equals the overturning chair equals changing one’s mind equals.... But why continue?Every single perception in this engram equals every other perception in this engram. What?That’s crazy? Precisely!Let us further examine our post-hypnotic positive suggestion of the touched tie and theremoved coat. In this we have the visible factors of how the reactive mind operates.This post-hypnotic suggestion needs only an emotional charge and physical pain tomake it a dangerous engram. Actually it is an engram of a sort. It is laid in by sympathybetween the operator and subject, which would make it a sympathy engram -- pro-survival.Now we know that the operator had only to touch his tie to make the awakened subjectremove his coat. The subject did not know what it was which caused him to remove his coatand found all manner of explanation for the action, none of which was the right one. Theengram, the post-hypnotic suggestion in this case, was actually placed in the reactive mindbank. It was below the level of consciousness, it was compulsion springing from below thelevel of consciousness. And it worked upon the muscles to make the subject remove his coat. Itwas data fused into the circuits of the body below the command level of the analytical mind andoperated not only upon the body but also upon the analytical mind itself.If this subject took off his coat every time he saw somebody touch a necktie, societywould account him slightly mad. And yet there was no power of consent about this. If he hadattempted to thwart the operator by refusing to remove the coat, the subject would haveexperienced great discomfort of one sort or another.49"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Let us now take an example of the reactive mind’s processes in a lower echelon of life:a fish swims into the shallows where the water is brackish, yellow, and tastes of iron. He hasjust taken a mouthful of shrimp when a bigger fish rushes at him and knocks against his tail.The small fish manages to get away but he has been physically hurt. Having negligibleanalytical powers, the small fish depends upon reaction for much of his choice of activity.Now he heals his tail and goes on about his affairs. But one day he is attacked by alarger fish and gets his tail bumped. This time he is not seriously hurt, merely bumped. Butsomething has happened. Something within him considers that in his choice of action he isnow being careless. Here is a second injury in the same area. The computation on the fish reactive level was: shallows equals brackish equals yellowequals iron taste equals pain in tail equals shrimp in mouth, and any one of these equals anyother.The bump in the tail on the second occasion keyed-in the engram. It demonstrated to theorganism that something like the first accident (identity thought) could happen again.Therefore, beware!The small fish, after this, swims into brackish water. This makes him slightly“nervous.” But he goes on swimming and finds himself in yellow and brackish water. Andstill he does not turn back. He begins to get a small pain in his tail. But he keeps on swimming.Suddenly he gets a taste of iron and the pain in his tail turns on heavily. And away he goes likea flash. No fish was after him. There were shrimp to be had there. But away he went anyway.Dangerous place! And if he had not turned away, he would have really gotten himself a pain inthe tail.The mechanism is survival activity of a sort. In a fish it may serve a purpose. But in aman, who takes off a coat every time somebody touches a tie, the survival mechanism has longoutlived its time. But it is there!Let us further investigate our young man and the coat. The signal for the coat removalwas very precise. The operator touched his tie. This is equivalent to any or all of theperceptions the fish received and which made the fish turn back. The touch of the tie couldhave been a dozen things. Any one of the dozen might have signaled the removal of the coat.In the case of the woman who was knocked out and kicked, any perception in theengram she received has some quality of restimulation. Running water from a faucet might nothave affected her greatly. But water running from a faucet plus a passing car might have begunsome slight reactivation of the engram, a vague discomfort in the areas where she was struckand kicked, not enough yet to cause her real pain but there all the same. To the running waterand the passing car we add the sharp falling of a chair and she experiences a shock of mildproportion. Add now the smell and voice of the man who kicked her and the pain begins togrow. The mechanism is telling her that she is in dangerous quarters, that she should leave.But she is not a fish, she is a highly sentient being, to our knowledge the most complex mentalstructure so far evolved on Earth, organism of the species, Man. There are many other factorsin the problem than this one engram. She stays. The pains in the areas where she was abusedbecome a predisposition to illness or are chronic illness in themselves, minor it is true in thecase of this one incident, but illness just the same. Her affinity with the man who beat her maybe so high that the analytical level, being assisted by a normally high general tone, may counteragainst these pains. But if that level is low, without much to assist it, then the pains canbecome major.The fish that was so struck and received an engram did not disavow shrimp. Shrimpmight have made him a little less enthusiastic afterwards, but the survival potential of shrimp-eating made shrimp equal far more pleasure than it did pain.50"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"A pleasant and hopeful life in general -- and never think we intimate that the womanstays for food alone whatever the wits say about women -- has a high survival potential, andthat can overcome a very great deal of pain. As the survival potential diminishes, however, thelevel of pain (Zone 0 and Zone 1) is more closely approached and such an engram could beginto be reactivated severely.There is another factor here, however, besides pain -- in fact, several more factors. Ifthe young man with the detachable coat had been given one of the neurotic positive suggestionsas listed a few pages back, he would have reacted to it on signal.The engram this woman has received contains a neurotic positive suggestion quite inaddition to the general restimulators such as the faucet and the car and the overturning chair.She has been told that she is a faker, that she is no good, and that she is always changing hermind. When the engram is restimulated in one of the great many ways possible, she has a“feeling” that she is no good, a faker, and she will change her mind.There are several cases to hand which peculiarly illustrate the sadness of this. One casein particular which was cleared had been beaten severely many times and told a similar thingeach time, all derogatory. The content inferred that she was very loose morally and wouldcohabit with anyone. She was brought in as a case by her father -- she had since been divorced-- who complained that she was very loose morally and had cohabited with several men in asmany weeks. She herself admitted that she was, she could not see how it could be and itworried her, but she just “could not seem to help it.” Examination of the engrams in herreactive mind bank brought forth a long series of beatings with this content. Because this was amatter of research, not treatment -- although that was given -- her former husband wascontacted. An examination, independent of her knowledge, demonstrated his ragedramatization to contain these very words. He had beaten his wife into being a morally loosewoman because he was afraid of morally loose women.All cases examined in all this research were checked, the patient’s engrams against theengrams in the donor. The contents of the incidents were verified wherever possible and werefound uniformly to agree. Every safeguard was made to prevent any other method ofcommunication between donor and patient. Everything found in the “unconscious” periods ofevery patient, when checked against other source, was found to be exact.The analogy between hypnotism and aberration bears out well. Hypnotism plants bypositive suggestion one or another form of insanity. It is usually a temporary planting, butsometimes the hypnotic suggestion will not “lift” or remove in a way desirable to the hypnotist.The danger of running experiments with hypnosis. on uncleared patients is found in anothermechanism of the reactive kind.When an engram such as our example above exists, the woman obviously was“unconscious” at the time she received the engram. She had no standard bank memory (record)of the incident beyond the knowledge that she had been knocked out by the man. The engramwas not, then, an experience as we understand the word. It could work from below to aberrateher thinking processes, it could give her strange pains -- which she attributed to something else-- in the areas injured. But it was not known to her.The key-in was necessary to activate the engram. But what, precisely, could key it in?At some later time when she was tired the man threatened to strike her again and called hernames. This was conscious level experience. It was found to be “mentally painful” by her. Andit was “mentally painful” only because there was real, live, physical pain unseen under it,which had been “keyed-in” by the conscious experience. The second experience was a lock. Itwas a memory but it had a new kind of action in the standard banks. It had too much powerand it gained that power from a past physical blow. The reactive mind is not too careful aboutits time clock. It can’t tell one year old from ninety, in fact, when a key-in begins. The actualengram moved up under the standard bank.51"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"She thinks she is worried about what he said in the lock experience. She is actuallyworried about the engram. In this way memories become “painful.” But pain doesn’t store inthe standard banks. There is no place in that bank for pain. None. There is a place for theconcept of pain and these concepts of what is painful are good enough to keep the sentientorganism called Man away from all the pain he believes is actually dangerous. In a clear thereare no pain-inducing memories because there is no physical pain record left to ruin themachinery from the reactive mind bank.The young man with the detachable coat did not know what was worrying him or whatmade him do what he did. The person with an engram does not know what is worrying him.He thinks it is the lock and the lock may be a very long way removed from anythingresembling the engram. The lock may have similar perceptic content. But it may be on anothersubject entirely.It is not very complicated to undersand what these engrams do. They are simplymoments of physical pain strong enough to throw part or all the analytical machinery out ofcircuit; they are antagonism to the survival of the organism or pretended sympathy to theorganism’s survival. That is the entire definition. Great or little “unconsciousness,” physicalpain, perceptic content and contra-survival or pro-survival data. They are handled by thereactive mind, which thinks exclusively in identities of everything equals everything. And theyenforce their commands upon the organism by wielding the whip of physical pain. If theorganism does not do exactly as they say (and believe any clear, that’s impossible!), thephysical pain turns on. They steer a person like a keeper steers a tiger -- and they can make atiger out of a man in the process without much trouble -- and give him mange into the bargain.If man had not invented language, or, as will be demonstrated, if his languages were alittle less homonymic and more specific with their personal pronouns, engrams would still besurvival data and the mechanism would work. But Man has outgrown their use. He chosebetween language and potential madness and for the vast benefits of the former he received thecurse of the latter.The engram is the single and sole source of aberration and psycho-somatic illness. An enormous quantity of data has been sifted. Not one single exception has beenfound. In “normal people,” in the neurotic and insane, the removal of these engrams wholly orin part, without other therapy, has uniformly brought about a state greatly superior to thecurrent norm. No need was found for any theory or therapy other than those given in this bookfor the treatment of all psychic or psycho-somatic ills. 52"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIIThe Cell and the OrganismThe reason the engram so long remained hidden as the single source of aberration andpsycho-somatic ills is the wide and almost infinitely complex manifestations which can derivefrom simple engrams.Several theories could be postulated as to why the human mind evolved exactly as itdid, but these are theories, and dianetics is not concerned with structure. A comment or two asa stimulation to future workers in that field might be made, however, wholly as a postulate,that there is a definite connection between any electriclike energy in the body and the energyeffusion of cells undergoing injury. A theory could be constructed along the lines that injuredcells, further injuring their neighbors by a discharge of electric-like energy, forced thedevelopment of a special cell which would act as a conduit to “bleed off” this painful charge.The conduits of cells might have become neurons and the charge might have been betterdistributed so through the body with less likelihood of local incapacitation at the point of theinjury impact. These conduits -- neurons -- might have been started in formation by impacts atthe extremity of the body toward the direction of locomotion. This would make the skull thegreatest mass of neurons. Man, walking upright, might have had another new point of impact,the forehead, and so gained his pre-frontal lobes. And maybe not. That is just theory, withonly a few data to support it which have a scientific value. And it has not been subjected toexperiment of any kind whatever.This much, however, has to be advanced as theory on structure. The cell is one of thebasic building blocks of the body. Cells, the better to survive, seem to have become colonieswhich, in turn, had the primary interest, survival. And the colonies developed or recruited intoaggregations which in turn were organisms, also with the sole purpose of survival. And theorganisms developed minds to coordinate the muscles and resolve the problems of survival.Again, this is still theory and even if it was the track of reasoning which led toward dianetics, itcan be completely wrong. It works. It can be pulled away from dianetics and dianetics willremain a science and go on working. The concept of the electronic brain was not vital but onlyuseful to dianetics and it could be swept away as well -- dianetics would still stand. A scienceis a changing affair as far as its internal theory goes. In dianetics we have our wedge into anenormous scope of research. As dianetics stands, it works and it works every time and withoutexception. The reasons why it works will undoubtedly be mulled over and changed here andthere to its betterment -- if they aren’t, an abiding faith in this generation of scientists and thefuture generations will not have been justified.Why we talk about cells will become apparent as we progress. The reason we knowthat past concepts of structure are not correct is because they don’t work as function. All ourfacts are functional and these facts are scientific facts, supported wholly and completely bylaboratory evidence. Function precedes structure. James Clerk Maxwell’s mathematics werepostulated and electricity was widely and beneficially used long before anyone had any realidea about the structure of the atom. Function always comes before structure. The astoundinglack of progress in the field of the human mind during the past thousands of years is partlyattributable to its “organ of thought” lying within a field, medicine, which was and long may bean art, not a science. Basic philosophy to explain life will have to come before that art makesmuch further progress. What the capabilities of the cell are, for instance, have been but poorly studied. Somework has been carried on in recent years to find out more, but basic philosophy was absent.The cell was being observed, not predicted.The studies of cells in Man have been largely done from dead tissue. An unknownquality is missing from dead tissue, the important quality -- life.53"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"In dianetics, on the level of laboratory observation, we discover much to ourastonishment that cells are evidently sentient in some currently inexplicable way. Unless wepostulate a human soul entering the sperm and ovum at conception, there are things which noother postulate will embrace than that these cells are in some way sentient. Entering a new fieldwith postulates which work in all directions -- and the basic philosophy of survival is a pilotwhich leads us on and on into further and further realms, explaining and predicting phenomenaon every hand -- it is inevitable that data will turn up which does not agree with past theory.When that data is as scientific as the observation that when an apple is dropped under usualconditions on Earth it falls, one cannot help but accept it. Abandoning past theories may dodamage to treasured beliefs and one’s nostalgic love of the old school tie, but a fact is a fact.The cells as thought units evidently have an influence, as cells, upon the body as athought unit and an organism. We do not have to untangle this structural problem to resolveour functional postulates. The cells evidently retain engrams of painful events. After all, theyare the things which get injured. And they evidently retain a whip hand of punishment forevery time the analyzer fails them. The story of the engram seems to be a story of a battlebetween the troops and the general every time the general gets some of the troops killed off.The less fortunate this general is in protecting these troops, the more power the troops assume.The cells evidently pushed the brain on an upward evolution toward higher sentience. Painreversed the process as though the cells were sorry they had put so much power in the hands ofa central commander.The reactive mind may very well be the combined cellular intelligence. One need notassume that it is, but it is a handy structural theory in the lack of any real work done in thisfield of structure. The reactive engram bank may be material stored in the cells themselves. Itdoes not matter whether this is credible or incredible just now. Something has to be said aboutit to give one a mental hold on what happens during moments of “unconsciousness.”The scientific fact, observed and tested, is that the organism, in the presence of physicalpain, lets the analyzer get knocked out of circuit so that there is a limited quantity or no quantityat all of personal awareness as a unit organism. It does this either to protect the analyzer or towithdraw its power in the belief that an engram is best in an emergency -- with which theanalyzer, by the way, on observed experience, does not agree.Every percept present, including physical pain, is recorded during these non-analyticalmoments. Whenever pain is present -- physical pain -- that is, the analyzer gets shut down to asmall or large extent. If the duration of the pain is only an instant, there is still an instant thereof analytical reduction. This can be proven very easily -- just try to recall the last time you wereseriously hurt and see if there isn’t at least a momentary blank period. Going to sleep underanaesthetic and waking up some time later is a more complicated sort of shut-down in that itincludes physical pain but is initially caused by a poison (and all anaesthetics are poisons,technically). Then there is the condition of suffocating, as in drowning, and this is a shut-downperiod to greater or lesser extent. And there is the condition caused by blood, for one cause oranother, leaving the area or areas which contain analytical power -- wherever they are -- andthis again causes a greater or lesser degree of analytical shutdown: such incidents include shock(in which the blood tends to lake in the center of the body), the loss of blood by surgery orinjury or anemia and the closing of the arteries leading through the throat. Natural sleep causesa reduction of analytical activity but is actually not very deep or serious; by dianetic therapy anyexperience occurring during sleep can be recovered with ease.It can now be seen that there are many ways in which analytical power can be shutdown. And it can be seen that there is greater or lesser reduction. When one burns one’s fingerwith a cigarette, there is a small instant of pain and a small amount of reduction. When oneundergoes an operation, the duration may be in terms of hours and the amount of shut-downmay be extreme. The duration and the amount of reduction are two different things, related butquite dissimilar. This is not so very important but it is mentioned.54"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"We have seen, reading in dianetics this far, that the principle of the spectrum has beenquite useful to us. And it can be seen that the amount of reduction in analytical power can bedescribed in the same way that survival potential can be described. There can be a very little bitand there can be a very great deal. Going back and taking a look at the survival potential range,one can see that there would be death at the bottom and immortality at the top. There is“infinite” survival. Whether or not there can be infinite analytical power is a matter ofmysticism. But that there is a definite relationship between individual tone and the amount ofanalytical shutdown is a scientific fact. Put it this way: with the individual well and happy andenthusiastic, analytical power can be considered to be high (Zones 3 and 4). With theindividual under the wheels of a truck, “unconscious” and in agony, the analytical power maybe considered to be ranging in Zone 0. There is a ratio between potential survival and analyticalpower. As one goes down, so does the other. There is more data to be concluded from thisthan one would think at first glance. It is a very important ratio.All the percepts are included in an engram. Two of these percepts are physical pain andpainful emotion. A third is organic sensation, which is to say, the condition of the organismduring the moment of the engram. And how was the organism when the engram was received?Greater or lesser “unconsciousness” was present. This meant that there was an organicsensation of reduced analytical power, since analytical power derives, evidently, from an organor organs in the body. If an engram is reactivated by a restimulator or restimulators -- that is tosay if the individual with an engram receives something in his environment similar to theperceptions in the engram -- the engram puts everything it contains -- its percepts such asfaucets and words -- into greater or lesser operation.There can be greater or lesser restimulation. An engram can be put into force just a littlebit by restimulators in the environment of the individual or, with many restimulators presentand the body in an already reduced state, the engram can go into a full force display (which iscovered later). But whether the engram is slightly restimulated or greatly restimulated,everything in it goes into effect one way or another.There is just one common denominator of all engrams, just one thing which everyengram has and which is possessed by every other engram. Each contains the datum that theanalyzer is more or less shut-down. There is a shut-down datum in every engram. Therefore,every time an engram is restimulated, even though physical pain has not been received by thebody, some analytical power turns off, the organ or organs which are the analyzer are fusedout of circuit in some degree. This is highly important to an understanding of the mechanics of aberration. It is ascientific fact, susceptible of proof, and it never varies. This always happens: when an engramis received, the analyzer is shut down by the physical pain and emotion; when the engram isrestimulated the analyzer shuts down as part of the commands of the engram. Actually this is avery mechanical thing. Engram is restimulated, part of the analytical power is shut down. Thisis as inevitable as turning on and off an electric light. Pull the cord and the light goes off. Thereduction of the analyzer is not that sharp -- there are grades of light -- but it is just asmechanical.Put a man under ether, hurt him in the chest. He has received an engram because hisanalytical power was turned off first by ether and then by a chest pain. While he was there onthe operating table, the reactive mind recorded the click of instruments, everything said, allsounds and smells. Let us suppose that a nurse was holding one of his feet because he waskicking. This is a complete engram.The engram will be keyed-in by something in the future, a similar incident. After this,in greater or lesser degree, whenever he hears clicks like instrument clicks he gets nervous. Ifhe pays attention to what is happening in his body at that minute, he may find that his foot feelsslightly as if it were being held. But he is not likely to give any attention to his foot because if55"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"he had any attention to give, the chest pain would be found present in some degree. But hisanalytical ability has been turned off slightly. As the foot felt it was being held, so does theanalyzer have the conception of being shut down by ether and pain. The restimulator (theclicking) tended to bring the whole engram slightly into being and part of the engram commandis a reduced analytical power.This is “push-button” in its precision. If one knew another’s main restimulators(words, voice tones, music, whatever they are -- things which are filed in the reactive mindbank as parts of engrams) one could turn another’s analytical power almost completely off,actually render him unconscious.We all know people who make us feel stupid. There can be two causes for that but bothof them are from engrams and one of them is the fact that no matter what engram is broughtinto restimulation, part of the analytical power is turned off.Engrams can, if environment is uniform, be held in chronic restimulation. This means achronic partial shutdown of analytical power. The recovery of intelligence by a clear and therise of that intelligence to such fantastic heights results in part from the relief of wordcommands in engrams that he is stupid and in a larger part from the relief of this chronic shut-down condition.This is not theory. This is scientific fact. It is strictly test-tube. The engram contains thepercept of a shutdown analyzer; when it is restimulated the engram puts that datum back intoforce in some degree.Engrams, then, being received in “unconsciousness” cause a partial “unconsciousness”to exist every time they are restimulated. The person who has an engram (any aberree) need notreceive new physical pain to have a new moment of partial “unconsciousness” take place.Feeling “dopey” or “sleepy” or “dull” results in part from a partially shut-down analyzer. Being“nervous” or in a rage or frightened also carries with it partially shutoff analytical power.The hypnotist has “success” where he does because he is able, by talking to peopleabout “sleep,” to put into restimulation some engram which contains the word sleep and shut-down analytical power. This is one of the reasons hypnotism “works.”The whole society, however, is liable to analytical shutdown in greater or lesser degreeby the restimulation of engrams. The number of engrams a person’s reactive bank contains may not, however, establishthe amount of analytical reduction to which he is subjected. A person may have engrams andthey may not have been keyed-in. And if they have been keyed-in, he might not be in anenvironment which contains any great number of restimulators. Under these conditions hissurvival zone position may be high even though he is possessed of a great many engrams. Andagain, he might have educated himself over and above these engrams to some slight degree.But a person who has keyed-in engrams and does exist in the area of manyrestimulators is liable to an enormous amount of restimulation and analytical shut-down. Thisis a normal condition. If a person has a large number of engrams and they are keyed-in and helives around many restimulators his condition can vary from normal to insane. And in a singleday -- as in the case of a man who experiences moments of rage or a woman who drops intoapathies -- the condition of a person may vary from normal to insane and back to normal. Wetake here the word “insane” to mean utter irrationality. So there is temporary or chronicinsanity.The court of law which goes through the lugubrious process of having a manpronounced sane or insane after that man has murdered somebody is itself being irrational. Ofcourse the man was insane when he committed the murder. What the court is asking now iswhether or not the man is chronically insane. This has little bearing on the matter. If a man has56"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"gone insane enough to murder once, he will go insane enough in the future to murder again.Chronic, then, means either a chronic cycle or a continuous condition. The law says sanity isthe “ability to tell right from wrong.” When Man is subject to a mechanism (and all men are)which lets him be rational one minute and restimulated the next, none in the society, ifuncleared, can be considered able to always tell right from wrong. This is completely asidefrom what the law means by “right” and what it means by “wrong.”This is an example of the roller-coaster sanity curve of the aberree. All aberrees possessengrams (the normal number is probably in the hundreds per individual). Analytically peoplehave a wide latitude of choice and they can deal even with philosophic rights and wrongs. Butin aberrated persons the engram bank is always susceptible of restimulation. The “sanest”aberree of Tuesday may be a murderer on Wednesday if the exactly right situation occurs to tripthe exact engram. A clear is not entirely predictable in any given situation -- he has such a widepower of choice. But an aberrated person transcends all predictability for the followingreasons: (1) what engrams an aberree has in his reactive engram bank none know includinghimself; (2) what situation will contain what restimulators is a matter of chance; and (3) whathis power of choice will be with the factors in the engrams on a reactive level cannot beestablished.The variety of conduct which one can evolve out of these basic mechanics is so widethat it is no wonder that Man was considered to be a rather hopeless case by somephilosophies.The cells, if the engram bank is retained on a cellular level, might be theoreticallysupposed to have made sure that the analyzer did not get too adventurous in this life and deathmatter of living. They therefore could be considered to have copied down all data contained inevery moment of physical pain and emotion resulting in or contained in “unconsciousness.”Then when any data similar to this appeared in the environment they could be wary and, with alarge number of restimulators in sight, they could be considered to shut down the analyzer andproceed on reaction. This has a crude safety factor. Obviously, if the organism survivedthrough one period of “unconsciousness,” it could be theorized by the cells that the placing ofthe data and action in effect under circumstances which threatened to be similar would resultonce more in survival. What’s good enough for grandpa is good enough for me. What wasgood enough in the bus accident is good enough in a bus.This moronic “thinking” is typical of the reactive mind. It is just the sort of thinking itdoes. It is the ultimate in conservatism. It misses the point and important data at every turn, itoverloads the body with pain, it is a whirlpool of confusion. If there were just one engram persituation, maybe it would get by. But there may be ten engrams with similar data in them (anengram lock chain) and yet the data may be so contradictory that when a new emergency ariseswhich contains the restimulators of the chain, no proper past conduct can be put forth to meetit.Obviously the x factor is language. The cells, if this is a problem in cells (for recall, thispart is theory based on data in an effort to explain what happens and a theory can be alteredwithout altering the scientific usefulness of the facts), probably do not understand languagesvery well. If they did they wouldn’t evolve such “solutions.”Take two engrams about baseball bats. In the first, the individual is hit on the head andknocked out and somebody yells, “Run! Run! Run!” In the second the individual is knockedout by the bat in the same environment and somebody yells, “Stay there! You’re safe!” Nowwhat does he do when he hears a baseball bat or smells one or sees one or hears these words?Run or stay there! He has a similar pain for each action. What actually happens? He gets aheadache. This is that thing called conflict. This is anxiety. And anxiety can become very acuteindeed on a purely mechanical level when one has ninety engrams pulling him south andeighty-nine pulling him north. Does he go north or south? Or does he have a “nervousbreakdown?”57"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The level of brilliance of the reactive mind is about the same as a phonograph. Theneedle gets put on the record and the record plays. The reactive mind merely puts on theneedle. When it tries to select several records out and play them all at once, things happen.By intentional construction or accident in design or by-pass in evolution -- where theold, useless organ is still built -- the cells managed to hide this engram bank fairly well. Man isconscious in his analytical mind. When he is “unconscious,” his analytical mind is unable tomonitor the incoming data and the data is not to be found in the thing we call, by analogue, thestandard banks. Therefore whatever came in passed by consciousness. And having passed by,consciousness cannot (without dianetic process) recall it, since there is no channel for recall.The engram enters when consciousness is absent. It thereafter operates directly into theorganism. Only by dianetic therapy can the analyzer come into possession of this data (and theremoval of it does not depend upon the analyzer contacting it at all, despite an old belief that the“realization” of something cures it: “realize” an engram and one is in quick trouble, withoutdianetic technique). The engram is received by the cellular body. The reactive mind could bethe very lowest level of analytical power, of course, but this does not alter the scientific factthat the engram acts as if it were a soldered-in connection to the life function regulator and theorganic co-ordination and the basic level of the analytical mind itself. By “soldered-in” is meant“permanent connection.” This keying-in is the hook-up of the engram as part of the operatingmachinery of the body. An analytical thought process is not permanently hooked in but can bethrown in and out of circuit at the will of the analyzer. This is not true of the engram, thus theterm, “soldered-in.”The analytical mind lays down a training pattern; on a stimulus-response basis thistraining pattern will work smoothly and well whenever it will do the organism the most good.An engram is a training pattern, all complete in a package, “permanently” hooked into thecircuits (without dianetic therapy) and it goes into operation like a training pattern without anyconsent whatever from the analyzer.Influenced itself by the engram in the several ways of reduced analytical power andpositive suggestion in the engram, the analytical mind is unable to discover any truly validreason for the conduct of the organism. It therefore makes up a reason, for its job is to makesure the organism is always right. Just as the young man with the detachable coat gave forth anumber of silly explanations as to why he was detaching his coat so does the analytical mind,observing the body engaged in irrational actions, including speech, for which there seems to beno accounting, justify the actions. The engram can dictate all the various processes incident toliving; it can dictate beliefs, opinions, thought processes or lack of them and actions of allkinds, and can establish conditions remarkable for their complexity as well as their stupidity.An engram can dictate anything it contains and engrams can contain all the combinations ofwords in the entire language. And the analytical mind is forced, in the light of irrationalbehavior or conviction, to justify the acts and conditions of the organism, as well as its ownstrange blunders. This is justified thought.There are three kinds of thought, then, of which the organism is capable: (a) analyticalthought, which is rational as modified by education and viewpoint, (b) justified thought,analytical thought attempting to explain reactions, and (c) reactive thought, which is wholly interms of everything in an engram equals everything in an engram equals all the restimulators inthe environment and all things associated with those restimulators.We have all seen somebody make a blunder and then give forth an explanation of justwhy that blunder had been made. This is justified thought. The blunder was made, unless outof education or viewpoint, by an engram. The analytical mind then had to justify the blunder tomake sure that the body was right and that its computations were right.Now there are two other conditions which can be caused by engrams. One isdramatization and the other is valence.58"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"You have seen some child come forth with a tirade, a tantrum. You have seen someman go through a whole rage action. You have seen people go through a whole irrational set ofactions. These are dramatizations. They come about when an engram is thoroughlyrestimulated, so thoroughly that its soldered-in aspect takes over the organism. It may comeinto circuit slightly or wholly, which is to say that there are degrees of dramatization. When itis in full parade, the engram is running off verbatim and the individual is like an actor, puppet-like, playing his dictated part. A person can be given new engrams which will make these oldones take secondary importance. (Society’s punishment complex is aimed squarely at givinganti-engram education.)Dramatization is survival conduct -- in the silly, reactive mind way of thinking -- basedon the premise that the organism, in a “similar” situation lived through it because these actionswere present.The woman who was knocked down and kicked would dramatize her engram,possibly, by doing and saying exactly the same things done and said to her. Her victim may beher child or another woman. It could or would be the person who gave her the engram if shewere strong enough to overcome him. Just because she has this engram does not mean she willuse it. She may have a hundred other engrams she can use. But when she dramatizes one, it isas if the engram, soldered-in, were taking over a puppet. As much analytical power as she hasleft may be devoted to altering the pattern. Therefore she can make a similar or an identicaldramatization. This aspect of dramatization is strictly “tooth and claw” survival. This is the sort ofthing which made observers think that “tooth and claw” was a primary rule.In went the engram, by-passing rationality and the standard memory banks. Now it isin the organism but the organism does not know it in the level of consciousness. It is keyed-inby a conscious level experience. Then it can be dramatized. And far from becoming milder themore it is used, the more an engram is dramatized the more solid is its hold in the circuits.Muscles, nerves, all must comply.“Tooth and claw” survival. The cells were making sure. And here we come to valence.Valens means “powerful” in Latin. It is a good term because it is the second half of ambivalent(power in two directions) and exists in any good dictionary. It is a good term because itdescribes (although the dictionary did not mean it to) the intent of the organism whendramatizing an engram. Multi-valence would mean “many powerfuls.” It would embrace thephenomena of split personality, the strange differences of personality in people in one and thenanother situation. Valence in dianetics means the personality of one of the dramatic personnel inan engram.In the case of the woman being knocked out and kicked, there were two valencespresent: herself and her husband. If another person had been present the engram would havecontained three valences, providing he took any part: herself, her husband and the third person.In an engram, let us say, of a bus accident where ten people speak or act, there would be, inthe “unconscious” person an engram containing eleven valences, the “unconscious” person andthe ten who spoke or acted.Now in the case of the woman beaten by her husband, the engram contains just twovalences. Who won? Here is the law of “tooth and claw,” the aspect of survival in engrams.Who won? The husband. Therefore it is the husband who will be dramatized. She didn’t win.She got hurt. Aha! When these restimulators are present, the thing to do is to be the winner, thehusband, to talk like him, to say what he did, to do what he did. He survived. “Be like him!”say the cells.Hence, when the woman is restimulated into this engram by some action, let us say, onthe part of her child, she dramatizes the winning valence. She knocks the child down and kickshim, tells him he is a faker, that he is no good, that he is always changing his mind.59"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"What would happen if she dramatized herself? She would have to fall down, knockingover a chair, pass out and believe she was a faker, no good and was always changing her mindand she would have to feel the pain of all blows!“Be yourself” is advice which falls on deaf reactive mind ears. Here is the scheme.Every time the organism gets punished by life, the analytical mind, according to the reactivemind, has erred. The reactive mind then cuts the analytical mind out of circuit in ratio to theamount of restimulation present (danger) and makes the body react as if it were the person whowon in the earlier but similar situation where the organism was hurt.Now what happens if “society” or the husband or some exterior force told this woman,who is dramatizing this engram, that she must face reality? That’s impossible. Reality equalsbeing herself, and herself gets hurt. What if some exterior force breaks the dramatization? Thatis to say, if society objects to the dramatization and refuses to let her kick and yell and shout!The engram is still soldered-in. The reactive mind is forcing her to be the winning valence.Now she can’t be. As punishment, the reactive mind, the closer she slides in to being herself,approximates the conditions of the other valence in the engram. After all, that valence didn’tdie. And the pain of the blows turns on and she thinks she is a faker, that she is no good andthat she always changes her mind. In other words, she is in the losing valence. Consistentbreaking of dramatization will make a person ill just as certainly as there are gloomy days.A person accumulates, with the engrams, half a hundred valences before he is ten.Which were the winning valences? You will find him using them every time an engram iskicked into restimulation. Multiple personality? Two persons? Make it fifty to a hundred. Indianetics you can see valences turn on and off in people and change with a rapidity whichwould be awesome to a quick-change artist.Observe these complexities of conduct, of behavior. If one set out to resolve theproblem of aberration by a system of cataloguing everything he observed and were unaware ofthe basic source, he would end up with as many separate insanities, neuroses, psychoses,compulsions, repressions, obsessions and disabilities as there are combinations of words in theEnglish language. Discovery of fundamentals by classification is never good research. And theunlimited complexities possible from the engrams (and the severest, most thoroughlycontrolled experiments discovered these engrams to be capable of just such behavior as is listedhere) is the whole catalogue of aberrated human conduct.There are a few other basic, fundamental things that engrams do. These will be coveredunder their own headings: parasite circuits, emotional impaction and psycho-somatic ills. Withthe few fundamentals listed here, the problem of aberration can be resolved. Thesefundamentals are simple, they have given rise to as much trouble as individuals and societieshave experienced. The institutions for the insane, the prisons for the criminals, the armamentsaccumulated by nations, yes and even the dust which was a civilization of yesterday existbecause these fundamentals were not understood.The cells evolved into an organism and in the evolution created what was once anecessary condition of mind. Man has grown up to a point where he creates now the means ofovercoming that evolutionary blunder. Examination of the clear proves he no longer needs it.He is now in a position where he can take an artificial evolutionary step on his own. The bridgehas been built across the canyon. 60"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IVThe “Demons”For a moment let us leave such scientific things as cells and consider some furtheraspects of the problem of understanding the human mind.People have been working on problems related to Man’s behavior for a good manymillenia. Hindu, Egyptian, Greek, Roman and our own philosophers and researchers of thepast few hundred years have been struggling against a superabundance of complexity.Dianetics could be evolved only by the philosophic compartmentation of the probleminto its elements and the invention of several dozen yardsticks such as The Introduction of anArbitrary, The Law of Affinity, The Dynamic, The Equation of the Optimum Solution, TheLaws of the Selection of Importances, The Science of Organizing Sciences, Nullification byComparison of Authority to Authority and so forth and so forth. All this is fine matter for atome on philosophy, but here is dianetics, which is a science. It should be mentioned,however, that one of the first steps taken was not invented but borrowed and modified: thatwas the Knowable and Unknowable of Herbert Spencer.Absolutism is a fine road to stagnation and I do not think Spencer meant to be soentirely absolute about his Knowable and Unknowable. SURVIVE! is the demarcation pointbetween those things which can be experienced by the senses (our old friends Hume andLocke) and those things which cannot necessarily be known through the senses but whichpossibly may be known but which one does not necessarily need to solve the problem. Amongst those things which one did not necessarily need to know (the dianetic versionof the Unknowable) were the realms of mysticism and metaphysics. Many things, in theevolution of dianetics, were by-passed solely because they had not yielded solution to anyoneelse. Therefore mysticism got short shrift despite the fact that the author studied it, not in thelittle understood, secondhand sources commonly used as authority by some western mentalcults, but in Asia where a mystic who can’t make his “astral self” get out and run errands forhim is strictly a second rate character indeed. Well aware that there were pieces in this jig-sawpuzzle which were orange with yellow spots and purple with carmine stripes, one found itnecessary to pick up only those pieces which were germane. Someday a large number of pieces-- about structure with the rest -- will come in and there will be answers to telepathy, prescienceand so on and on. Understand that there are a lot of pieces in the construction of a philosophicuniverse. But none of the mystic pieces were found necessary to the creation of a uniformlyapplicable and aberration-resolving science of mind. No opinion will be delivered at this stageof dianetics about ghosts or the Indian rope trick beyond the fact they are seen to bemulticolored pieces and the only ones we want are white. We have most of the white piecesand it makes a good, solid whiteness where there was blackness before.Imagine, then, the consternation one must have felt when “demons” were discovered.Socrates had a demon, you’ll remember. It told him not what to do but whether or not he hadmade the right decision. Here we had been pursuing a course in the finite universe whichwould have pleased Hume himself for its tenacity to those things which could be sensed. Andup popped “demons.”A thorough examination of a number of subjects (14) revealed that every one apparentlyhad a “demon” of some sort. They were randomly selected subjects in various conditions insociety. Therefore the “demon” aspect was most alarming. However, unlike some of the cults(or schools as they call themselves), the temptation to sail off into romantic inexplicable andconfounding labels was resisted. A bridge had to be built across a canyon and demons aredarned bad girders.61"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Out in the Pacific islands -- Borneo, the Philippines -- I had seen quite a bit ofdemonology at work. Demonology is fascinating stuff. A demon gets into a person and makeshim sick. Or it gets in and talks in lieu of him. Or he goes crazy because he has a demon in himand runs around with the demon shouting. This is demonology in a narrow sense. Theshaman, the medicine man, these people deal pretty heavily in demonology (it pays well). But,while not skeptical particularly, it had always seemed to me that demons could be explained alittle more easily than in terms of ectoplasm or some such unsensible material.To find “demons” living in one’s civilized fellow countrymen was disturbing. But therethey were. At least there were the manifestations which the shaman and medicine man had saidwere caused by demons. It was found that these “demons” could be catalogued. There were“commanding demons,” “critical demons,” ordinary “tell-you-what-to-say demons” and“demons” which stood around and yelled or “demons” which simply occluded things and keptthem out of sight. These are not all the classes, but they cover the general field of“demonology.”A few experiments with drugged subjects showed that it was possible to set these“demons” up at will. It was even possible to set up the whole analytical mind as a “demon.” Sothere was something wrong with demonology. Without proper ritual, simply by word ofmouth, one could make new demons appear in people. So there are no real demons in dianetics(that’s underscored in case some mystic runs around telling people that a new science of mindbelieves in demons).A dianetic demon is a parasitic circuit. It has an action in the mind which approximatesanother entity than self. And it is derived entirely from words contained in engrams.How this demon gets there is not very hard to understand, once you’ve inspected one,close up, papa, while baby is unconscious, yells at Mama that she’s got to listen to him andnobody else, by God. The baby gets an engram. It is keyed-in sometime between babyhoodand death. And then there’s the demon circuit at work.An electronics engineer can set up demons in a radio circuit to his heart’s content. Inhuman terms it is as if one ran a line from the standard banks toward the analyzer but before itgot there he put in a speaker and a microphone and then continued the line to the plane ofconsciousness. Between the speaker and the microphone would be a section of the analyzerwhich was an ordinary, working section but compartmented off from the remainder of theanalyzer. “I” on a conscious plane wants data. It should come straight from the standard bank,compute on a sub-level and arrive just as data. Not spoken data. Just data.With the portion of the analyzer compartmented off and the speaker-microphoneinstallation and the engram containing the above words “got to listen to me, by God” in chronicrestimulation, another thing happens. The “I” in the upper level attention units wants data. Hestarts to scan the standard banks with a sub-level. The data comes to him spoken. Like a voiceinside his head.A clear does not have any “mental voices!” He does not think vocally. He thinkswithout articulation of his thoughts and his thoughts are not in voice terms. This will come as asurprise to many people. The “listen to me” demon is common in the society, which is to saythis engram circulates widely. “Stay right there and listen to me” fixes the engram in presenttime (and fixes the individual in the time of the engram to some extent). After it is keyed-in andfrom there on, the individual thinks “out loud,” which is to say, he puts his thoughts intolanguage. This is very slow. The mind thinks out solutions (in a clear) at such speed that theword stream of consciousness would be left at the post.Proving this was very easy. In clearing every case without exception one or another ofthese demons was discovered. Some cases had three or four. Some had ten. Some had one. Itis a safe assumption that almost every aberree contains a demon circuit.62"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The type of engram which makes a critical demon is, “You are always criticizing me.”There are dozens of such statements contained in engrams, any one of which will make acritical demon, just as any combination of words resulting in a demand to listen and obeyorders will make a commanding demon.All these demons are parasitic. That is to say, they take a part of the analyzer andcompartment it off. A demon can think only as well as the person’s mind can think. There is noextra power. No benefit. All loss.It is possible to set up the whole computer (analyzer) as a demon circuit and leave “I”on a tiny and forlorn shelf. This, on the surface, is a pretty good stunt. It makes it possible forthe whole analytical mind to work out computations undisturbed and relay the answer to the“I.” But in practice it is very bad, for “I” is the will, the determining force of the organism, theawareness. And very soon “I” becomes so dependent upon this circuit that the circuit begins toabsorb him. Any such circuit, to last, would have to have pain and be chronic. It would haveto be, in short, an engram. Therefore, it would have to be reductive of the intellect and wouldvictimize the owner by eventually making him ill one way or another. Of all the engram demon circuits found and removed, those which contained aseemingly all-powerful exterior entity which would solve all problems and answer every wantwere the most dangerous. As the engram keyed-in further and further and was constantlyrestimulated, it eventually made a spineless puppet out of “I”; because other engrams existed,the sum of the reduction tended toward insanity of a serious sort. If you want a sample, justimagine what you would have to say to a hypnotized person to make him think that he was inthe hands of a powerful being who gave him orders and then imagine this as the phrase spokenwhen an individual had been knocked unconscious one way or another.There is another full class of demons, the occlusion demons, the demons who shutthings off. These are not properly demons because they don’t talk. A bona-fide demon is onewho gives thoughts voice or echoes the spoken word interiorly or who gives all sorts ofcomplicated advice like a real, live voice exteriorly. (People who hear voices have exteriorvocal demons -- circuits which have tied up their imagination circuits.) The occlusion demondoesn’t have anything to say. It is what he doesn’t permit to be said or done that makes themental derangement.An occlusion demon can exist for a single word. For instance, a child receives anengram by falling off her bicycle and losing consciousness; a policeman tries to assist her; sheis still unconscious but moving and mutters that she can’t move (an old engram at work); theofficer says, cheerfully, “Never say can’t!” Some time later she has a conscious levelexperience such as another fall but without injury. (We keep mentioning this second necessarystep, the lock, because it is the thing old time mystics thought was causing all the trouble -- it is“mental anguish.”) Now she has difficulty saying “can’t.” Dangerous in any event. What if shehad that common engram expression, “Never say no!”? Occlusion demons hide things from “I.” It is as easy for one to mask many words. Theindividual having one will then omit these words or alter them or misspell them and makemistakes with them. The demon is not the only reason words get altered but he is a specificcase. An occlusion demon can be of a much higher strength and breadth. He can be createdwith the phrase, “Don’t talk!” or “Never talk back to your elders,” or “You can’t talk here.Who said you could talk?” Any of these phrases might produce a stammerer.Other things besides speech can be occluded. Any ability of the mind can be inhibitedby a demon specifically designed to obstruct that ability. “You can’t see!” will occlude visualrecall. “You can’t hear!” will occlude audio recall. “You can’t feel!” occludes pain and tactilerecall (homonymic stuff, English).63"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Any perception can be occluded in recall. And whenever it is occluded in recall, itaffects actual perception and the organ of perception as well. “You can’t see!” may reduce notonly recall but the actual organic ability of the eyes, as in astigmatism or myopia.One can imagine, with the entire English language (or in other lands with othertongues, any language) susceptible to inclusion within engrams just how many abilities of themind’s operation can be occluded. An extremely common one is “You can’t think!”So far now “you” has been used in illustrations and examples in order to keep thesimilarity to hypnotic or drug tests. Actually sentences which contain “I”, are more destructive.“I can’t feel anything,” “I can’t think,” “I can’t remember.” These and their thousands andthousands of variations, when spoken within the hearings of an “unconscious” person, areapplicable to himself when he gets the engram keyed-in to circuit.“You” has several effects. The statement, “You are no good,” to an awake personmakes that person feel very angry perhaps when he has an engram to that effect.Within him he feels, possibly, that people think he is no good. He may have a demonthat tells him he is no good. And he will dramatize by telling other people that they are nogood. It can be sprayed off by being dramatized. A person who has an engram to the effectthat he is sexually sterile, for instance, will tell people that they are sexually sterile. (“Don’t doas I do, do as I say.”) If he has an engram that says, “You are no good, you have to eat withyour knife,” he may eat with his knife but he gets excited about people eating with their knives,and he would grow very angry if somebody said he ate with his knife.Thus, there are “compulsion demons” and “confusion demons” and so forth and so on.The engram has a command value. There is a power of choice exercised in the reactivemind about which and what engrams will be used. But any engram, strongly enoughrestimulated, will come to the surface to be dramatized. And if dramatization is blocked, it willturn on the individual either temporarily or chronically.The literalness of this reactive mind, in its interpretation of commands and theliteralness of their action within the poor, harassed analytical mind is a strange thing in itself.“It is too horrible to be borne” might be interpreted to the effect that a baby was in such badcondition that it had better not be born. There are thousands of cliches in any language which,when literally taken, mean quite the opposite from what the speaker intends.The reactive engram bank takes them, stores them with pain and emotion and“unconsciousness” and with moronic literalness, hands them forth to be LAW andCOMMAND to the analytical mind. And when the happy little moron who runs the engrambank sees it possible to use up some analytical mind circuits with some of these confoundeddemons, it is done. The analytical mind, then, can be seen to be subject to yet another form of attrition. Itscircuits, ordinarily intended for smooth, rapid computation, become tied up and overloadedwith demon lash-ups. The demons are parasites. They are pieces of analytical mindcompartmented off and denied to larger computation.Is it any wonder that, when these demons are deleted, I.Q. soars as it can be observedto do in a clear? Add the demon circuits to the shut-down aspect of restimulation, and truth canbe seen in the observation that people run on about one-twentieth of their mental power.Research and scientific tabulation indicate that with the “unconsciousness” aspect and thedemon circuits deleted from the engram bank and the data restored into the standard bank asexperience where it should be, about forty-nine fiftieths of the mind have been placed at theservice of “I” which he never could use as an aberree. 64"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VPsycho-somatic IllnessPsycho-somatic illnesses are those which have a mental origin but which arenevertheless organic. Despite the fact that there existed no precise scientific proof of this beforedianetics, an opinion as to their existence has been strong since the days of Greece, and inrecent times various drug preparations have been concocted and sold which were supposed toovercome these sicknesses. Some success was experienced, sufficient to warrant a great dealof work on the part of researchers. Peptic ulcers, for instance, have yielded to persuasion andenvironmental change. A recent drug called ACTH has had astonishing but wildlyunpredictable results. Allergies have been found to yield more or less to things whichdepressed histamine in the body.The problem of psycho-somatic illness is entirely embraced by dianetics, and bydianetic technique such illness has been eradicated entirely in every case.About seventy per cent of the physician’s current roster of diseases falls into thecategory of psycho-somatic illness. How many more can be so classified after dianetics hasbeen in practice for a few years is difficult to predict, but it is certain that more illnesses arepsycho-somatic than have been so classified to date. That all illnesses are psycho-somatic is, ofcourse, absurd, for there exist, after all, life forms called germs which have survival as theirgoals.The work of Louis Pasteur formulated the germ theory of disease. With dianetics isgained the non-germ theory of disease. These two, with bio-chemistry, complement each otherto form the whole field of pathology so far as can be determined at this time, providing ofcourse that the virus is included under the germ theory.Dianetics adds an additional leaf to the germ theory in that it includes predisposition.There are three stages of pathology: predisposition, by which is meant the factors whichprepared the body for sickness, precipitation, by which is meant the factors which cause thesickness to manifest itself, and perpetuation, by which is meant the factors which cause thesickness to continue.There are two kinds of illness: the first could be called autogenetic, which means that itoriginated within the organism and was self-generated, and exogenetic, which means that theorigin of the illness was exterior. Actually, although this is good medicine, it is not quite asprecise as dianetics could desire. Mental illness itself is actually exterior in origin. Butmedically, we consider that the body can generate its own sicknesses (autogenetic) or that thesickness can come from an exterior source such as bacteria (exogenetic). The Pasteur germtheory would be the theory of exogenetic -- exteriorly generated -- illness. Psycho-somaticillness would be autogenetic, generated by the body itself.Treatment for accidental injury, surgery for various things such as malformationinherent in the body on a genetic basis, and orthopedics, which actually can be classed underboth, remain properly outside the field of dianetics, although it can be remarked in passing thatalmost all accidents are to be traced to dramatization of engrams and that clears rarely haveaccidents.Psycho, of course, refers to mind and somatic refers to body; the term psycho-somaticmeans the mind making the body ill or illnesses which have been created physically within thebody by derangement of the mind.Naturally such diseases, when one has resolved theproblem of human aberration, become uniformly susceptible to cure. Arthritis, dermatitis, allergies, asthma, some coronary difficulties, eye trouble, bursitis,ulcers, sinusitis, etc. form a very small section of the psycho-somatic catalogue. Bizarre aches65"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"and pains in various portions of the body are generally psycho-somatic. Migraine headachesare psycho-somatic and, with the others, are uniformly cured by dianetic therapy. (And theword cured is used in its fullest sense.)Just how many physical errors are psycho-somatic depends upon how many conditionsthe body can generate out of the factors in the engrams. For example, the common cold hasbeen found to be psycho-somatic. Clears do not get colds. Just what, if any, part the virusplays in the common cold is not known, but it is known that when engrams about colds arelifted, no further colds appear -- which is a laboratory fact not so far contradicted by 270 cases.The common cold comes about, usually, from an engram which suggests it and which isconfirmed by actual mucus present in another engram. A number of germ diseases arepredisposed and perpetuated by engrams. Tuberculosis is one.The engram itself, as has been covered, follows a cycle of action. The body ispredisposed to the conduct and conditions contained in the engram when that engram is firstreceived. Then a conscious-level experience keys-in the engram and other experience or thecontent of the engram itself may make it chronic. This is predisposition, precipitation andperpetuation in the mental plane.Engrams and inherited disabilities and accidents and germs are the four ways anorganism can be reduced physically from the optimum. Many conditions which have beencalled “inherited disabilities” are actually engramic Engrams predispose people to accidents.Enengrams predispose and perpetuate bacterial infections. Therefore the catalogue of illsaffected by dianetics is very long. This is not a book listing effects but a book stating causes,and so the reader is asked to call upon his own knowledge or consult a medical text tounderstand just how many thousands and thousands of conditions result from engrams todisturb or derange the body.At the present time dianetic research is scheduled to include cancer and diabetes. Thereare a number of reasons to suppose that these may be engramic in cause, particularly malignantcancer. This is remarked so that attention may be given to the possibility; no tests of any kindhave been made on cancer or diabetic patients, and the thought is purely theory and is not to betaken as any kind of an avowal about a cancer cure. Those diseases which were cataloguedabove, however, have been thoroughly tested and have uniformly yielded to dianetic therapy.The mechanism by which the mind is able to cause a physical disability or predisposethe body to an illness and perpetuate sickness is, in its basic cause, a very simple thing. Thecomplexity arrives when one begins to combine all the factors possible; then a staggering list ofpotential illnesses can be written.A series of simple tests can be made on drugged or hypnotic patients which will proveclinically in other laboratories this basic mechanism. A series of these tests were run in theformulation of dianetics with uniform success.Let us take first something -- which is only mildly psycho-somatic and scarcely anillness at all. A patient is hypnotized. He is given the positive suggestion that he will be able tohear much more acutely. This is “extended hearing.” Controlling out other means of hisgaining data (including safeguards against telepathy between operator and subject) the hearingcan be found to be amplifiable many times over. In fact, there exist all around aberrees whohave “extended hearing.” By suggestion the power of the hearing can be tuned down or up sothat a person is nearly deaf or can hear pins fall at a great distance. When the suggestion isremoved, the subject’s hearing returns to its previous normal state.Similarly, experiments can be performed on the eyes, using light sensitivity. Thepatient’s sight is tuned up or down so that his eyes are much more or much less sensitive tolight than is normal for him. This is done entirely on the word suggestion basis such as “Thelight will appear very, very bright to you,” or “The light will appear so dim it will be hard foryou to see.” With the former suggestion the patient can be made to see almost as well as a cat,66"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"although other people around might think it impossible to see objects the patient can unerringlypoint out. In the latter suggestion the patient can be placed under light almost blinding and yetcan read through a glare with apparent comfort.The tactile sense can likewise be tuned up or down by verbal suggestion until touchbecomes painfully acute or so dull it scarcely registers.So with the various senses. Here we have simply the spoken word going into the mindand causing physical function to change.Let us now address the heart. By deep hypnosis or drugs we take a patient into amnesiatrance, a state of being wherein the “I” is not in control but the operator is the “I” (and that’s allthere is, really, to the function of hypnosis: the transfer of analytical power through the law ofaffinity from subject to operator, a thing which had a racial development and survival value inanimals which ran in packs).A caution should be observed that a patient who has a very sound heart and no heart-trouble history be chosen for this experiment, which, even above any other hypnoticexperiment, can make a patient very ill if he has a heart history. And none of these hypnotictests should be performed until one has finished this book and knows how to get rid of thesuggestions; for hypnosis, as practiced, is strictly live fuse stuff and the hypnotist who isunacquainted with dianetics has no more idea how to get rid of a suggestion he has made thanhe has of how to peel an atom. He has thought he had the answer, but dianetics has treatedmany, many former hypnotic subjects who were thoroughly, as the engineers interested indianetics say, “loused-up.” This is no criticism of hypnosis or hypnotists, who are often veryable people, but it is a comment that there is more to be known about it.The heart, by positive suggestion alone, can be speeded up, slowed down or otherwiseexcited. Here are words spoken into the deep strata of the mind which cause physical action.Further, blood flow can be inhibited in some area of the body by suggestion alone. (Thisexperiment, it is warned, particularly overloads the heart.) Blood can be denied to a hand, forinstance, so that if you were to cut a vein in that hand it would bleed slightly if at all. A fineswami trick; which most amazed the author in India, was the inhibition of blood flow by theawake individual in himself. On command a cut would bleed or not bleed. It looked fantasticand made very good press agentry that here was a swami who had so associated himself withNirvana that he was in control of all material matters. Awe faded when the author learned that,via hypnosis, he could make his own body do the same thing and no Nirvana involved. Themechanism fades out rapidly and in a few days would have to be renewed: the body has itsown optimum operation, and although such a function can be “analytically” handled, it is notan upper echelon analytical job to keep the blood going in the hand. The point here is that bloodflow can be interrupted by verbal suggestion. Words connect up with the physical being.How this can come about can be shown by an analogic explanation such as a schematicdiagram, but we are not so much interested in structure as in function at this stage of thescience of mind -- because by knowing function alone we can cure aberrations and psycho-somatic ills every time, predict new ills and conditions, and generally “work miracles,” as suchactions were once called before Man knew anything about the mind.Excreta are among the easiest things to regulate by suggestion. Constipation can becaused or cured by positive suggestion with remarkable speed and facility. The urine can alsobe so controlled. And so can the endocrine system.It is harder to make tests on some of the more poorly understood functions of theendocrines. Glandular research has not progressed very far at this time. But, by removingengrams and watching the endocrine system rebalance, it has been made obvious that theendocrine system is a part of the control mechanism with which the mind handles the body.The glands are easily influenced. These fluids and secretions -- testosterone, estrogen,adrenalin, thyroid, parathyroid, pituitrin, etc. -- are the substances the mind uses as one means67"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"of controlling the body. They form relay circuits, so to speak. Each one has its own actionwithin the body.This experiment tends to prove the fallacy of an ancient assumption that the mind wascontrolled by the glands. An aberree is given a shot of 25 mg. of testosterone in oil twice aweek. There may be some improvement in his physical status for a short time -- his voice maydeepen and he may grow more hair on his chest. Now, without suggestion, we simply deletethe engrams from his reactive bank so that they can re-form as experience in the standard bank.Before we have completed this taskhis body begins to use more of the testosterone. The dose can be markedly reduced andstill give more benefit than formerly. Finally the dose can be eliminated. This experiment hasalso been performed on people who had not been able to receive benefit from glandularsubstances such as testosterone and estrogen. And upon people who were made ill by theadministration of these hormones. The deletion of the engrams from the reactive bankuniformly brought about a condition where they could receive benefit from the hormones butwhere such artificial administration was not necessary save in cases of extreme age. What thismeans to gerontology, the study of longevity in life, cannot at this time be estimated, but it canbe predicted with confidence that the deletion of engrams from the reactive bank has a markedeffect upon the extension of life. A hundred years or so from now this data will be available,but no clears have lived that long as yet.Just now, to our purpose, it is easy to demonstrate the effect of positive suggestionupon the endocrine system and the lack of effect of artificial hormones upon aberrees.This sort of an engram has a terribly reductive effect upon testosterone manufacture:“Sex is horrible; it is nasty; I hate it.”The autonomic nervous system, which has been supposed to run without muchconnection to the mind can be shown to be influenced in its parts by the mind. There is adwindling spiral effect (note the lines on the survival potential chart) whereby the engram startsmalfunction in the life function regulator; this produces malfunction in the mind, which in turnhas further effect on the life function regulator; this again reduces physical activity, and themind, being part of the organ and, so far as we can tell, organic itself, is further reduced intone. Mental tone makes body tone go down. Body tone, then being down, makes mental tonego down. This is a matter of inverse geometric progression. A man starts to get sick and,having engrams, he gets sicker. Clears are not subject to this dwindling spiral. Indeed, soentirely superficial is this horrible stuff called psycho-somatic illness that it is the first thingwhich surrenders and can be alleviated without clearing. Now the reason why various drug preparations which seek to change psycho-somaticillness meet with such uncertain success lies in the fact that the mind, containing these engramswhich are “survival” (like a fellow needs a hole in his head), handles the life function regulatorto actively produce illnesses. Something comes to take them away (they’re “survival,” you see,and these confounded cells moronically insist upon it) and the mind has to rapidly reverse theactivity and put an illness back in place again. Try to influence the reactive mind by reason orneedles and it is not any easier to convince than a drug-crazed man bent on murderingeverybody in a bar. He’s “surviving,” too.A concoction like ACTH has a slightly different effect. It is too exclusive to have anyresearch done with it, but on reports about it, it seems to affect engrams in the time sense. Thatis to say, as will be covered under therapy, the individual’s reactive location in time is shiftedby it. ACTH and perhaps many others in its category move the individual from one chronicengram into another. This is about as reliable as changing dictators in Europe. The next onemay be twice as bad. It may even be a manic and that’s horrible despite its apparent “euphoria.”Electric shock treatment, the beatings of Bedlam and other things of their ilk, includingsurgical treatment of things psycho-somatic in origin, have another effect but one not dissimilar68"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"to drugs like ACTH in that they give another shock which transfers the engram pattern toanother part of the body (and switches around the aberrations; when these things work it isbecause the new aberration is less violent than the old one). Shocks, blows, surgery andmaybe even things like cobra venom change the effect of the engram bank on the body, notnecessarily for the worse, not necessarily for the better; they just change them. Like shootingdice: sometimes one gets a seven. Then there is the deletion of tissue treatment of psycho-somatic ills. This simplyremoves the area which is busy dramatizing in the physical line. This can be the removal of atoe or the removal of a brain. These things are quite commonly used, as this is being written.The removal of the toe is addressed to one part of the engram content, the somatic, and theremoval of parts of the brain (as in the trans-orbital leukotomy and the pre-frontal lobotomy oranything else more recent) is addressed mistakenly to “the removal of” the psycho-aberration.There is a surrender system at work in this as well: the surgeon or the patient has an aberrationabout “getting rid of it,” and so bits of the body are cut up or removed.Some patients surrender anatomy on advice or at their own insistence like old timersshed blood in a phlebotomy. There is a straight parallel between bleeding the patient to makehim well and cutting away parts of him to make him well. Both are based on a surrender (getrid of) engram and neither are effective in any way. Barber basin medicine, it is hoped, willeventually die out as did its patients.These are the five classes of psycho-somatic ills: (1) those ills resulting from mentallycaused derangement in physical fluid flow, which class subdivides into (a) inhibition of fluidflow and (b) magnification of fluid flow; (2) those ills resulting from mentally causedderangement of physical growth, which class subdivides into (a) inhibition of growth and (b)magnification of growth; (3) those ills resulting from predisposition to disease resulting from achronic psycho-somatic pain in an area; (4) those ills resulting from perpetuation of a diseaseon account of chronic pain in an area; and (5) these ills caused by the verbal command contentof the engrams.In Class 1 (a) fall such ordinary things as constipation and such extraordinary things asarthritis. Arthritis is a complex mechanism with a simple cause and a relatively simple cure.Remember that there are two things present in an engram: physical pain and verbal command.In arthritis both must be present (as in the bulk of psycho-somatic ills). There musthave been an accident to the joint or area affected, and there must have been a command duringthe “unconsciousness” which attended the injury which would make the engram susceptible tochronic restimulation. (Such commands as “It is always like this” or “It just goes right onhurting” or “I’m stuck” will produce similar results). Given this engram and given this engramkeyed-in, there is a chronic pain in the area of the injury. It may be minor, but it is a pain justthe same. (It can be a pain but not be felt if the engram contains a command which isanaesthetic such as “He’ll never feel this,” which produces a similar condition but makes one“unconscious” of the pain there.) This pain in the body probably tells the cells and the bloodthat this area is dangerous. It is therefore avoided.The command permits the mind to influence, let us say, the parathyroid, which containsthe secret of the calcium content in the blood stream. A mineral deposit then begins to be laiddown in the area. The mineral deposit is not necessarily the cause of the pain, but it is anorganic restimulator so that the more mineral, the more pain, the more the engram keys-in.This is the dwindling spiral. And this is arthritis in action. Understand that theparathyroid and the blood avoidance are theoretical cause; the scientific fact is that when anengram is picked up and deleted about an area containing arthritis, that arthritis vanishes anddoes not return and this is X-ray plate evidence; it happens every time and does not happenbecause of any suggestion or medicine; it happens because an engram is picked up and refiled.As the engram goes away, so goes the pain, so vanishes the arthritis. This forms a whole classof ills, of which arthritis is only one.69"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The mechanisms involved vary slightly. All can be headed under “physicalderangement caused by reduced body fluid flow.”Class 1 (b) of psycho-somatic ills, magnification of fluid flow, contains such things ashigh blood pressure, diarrhea, sinusitis, priapism (overactivity of the male sex glands), or anyother physical condition resulting from a superabundance of fluid.Class 2 (a) can cause such things as a withered arm, a foreshortened nose,underdeveloped genital organs or any other underdevelopment of a gland having to do withsize (which cross-classes this with 1 [a]), hairlessness (which also like the rest can be part ofthe gene pattern and therefore inherent), and in short reduction in size of any part of the body.Class 2 (b) causes such things as oversized hands, a lengthened nose, oversized ears,enlarged organs and other common physical malformations. (Cancer might possibly comeunder this heading as overhealing.)Class 3 would include tuberculosis (some cases), liver trouble, kidney trouble, rashes,common colds, etc. (cross-classing with others, as do all of these in one way or another).Class 4 would include those diseases which, arising without psycho-somatic influence,yet fix upon by accident a previously injured area and by restimulation, keep an engram keyed-in in that area so that a condition becomes chronic. Tuberculosis could be included here.Conjunctivitis, all running sores and any condition which refuses to heal, etc.This fourth class would also include all bizarre pains and sicknesses which cannot befound to have actual pathology.Class 5 includes an enormously wide catalogue of conditions, any one of which maycross-index to other classes or which arise solely out of engrams which dictate the presence ornecessity of an illness. “You always have colds,” “I have sore feet,” etc. announce a psycho-somatic illness and the mechanisms of the body can furnish one.Any disease whatever can be precipitated by engrams. The disease may be of germorigin; the individual possesses an engram to the effect that he may become sick and on thisgeneralization, becomes sick with whatever is to hand. Further and even more general, theengram reduces the physical resistance of the body to disease, and when an engram goes intorestimulation (perhaps because of a domestic quarrel, an accident or some such thing), theability of the individual to resist sickness is automatically decreased.Children, as will be explained, have many more engrams than has been supposed.Almost all childhood illnesses are preceded by psychic disturbance and if psychic disturbanceis present -- keeping an engram restimulated -- such illnesses can be far more violent than theyshould be. Measles, for instance, can be just measles or it can be measles in company withengramic restimulation, in which case it can be nearly or entirely fatal. A check of manysubjects on this matter of childhood illness being predisposed by, precipitated by andperpetuated by engrams causes one to wonder just how violent the diseases themselves reallyare: they have never been observed in a cleared child and there is reason to investigate thepossibility that childhood illnesses are in themselves extremely mild and are complicated onlyby psychic disturbance -- which is to say, the restimulation of engrams.In fact, one could ask this question of the entire field of pathology: what is the actualeffect of disease minus the mental equation? How serious are bacteria?The field of bacteriology has been without dynamic principles until now; the dynamic,survival, is applicable to all life forms and “life forms” include germs. The purpose of the germis to survive. Its problems are those of food, protection (offense and defense) and procreation.70"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"To accomplish these things the germ survives at its optimum efficiency. It mutates,alters with natural selection and changes dynamically from survival necessity (the missing stepof the evolution theory, that last) in order to accomplish the maximum survival possible. Itmakes errors by killing the hosts, but to have a purpose to survive does not mean that a formnecessarily survives.In pathology, the germ, bent on its purpose, acts as a suppressor to the survivaldynamic of the human species.How serious this suppressor is in the absence of engram suppression in the human hasnot been determined; enough data exists to indicate that a human individual with his potential inthe fourth zone is not, apparently, very subject to disease: the common cold, for instance, if itis a virus or not, passes him by; chronic infections are absent. What antibodies have to do withthis or what this factor is, is yet another question. But it remains that a clear is not easily madeill. In the aberree illness closely pursues mental depression (depression of the dynamic level).The aberration of mind and body by engrams leads, then, not only to psycho-somaticills but also to actual pathology, which has hitherto been considered more or less independentof the mental state. As has been proven by clinical research, clearing of engrams does morethan remove psycho-somatic illness, potential, acute or chronic; the clearing also tends to proofthe individual against the receipt of pathology: to what extent it is not yet known, for such awide and long term view is required to establish the actual statistics that the project will requirethousands of cases and the observations of medical doctors over a long term.The amount of aberration which a person manifests, which is to say, the position hewould occupy on a sanity scale, has little to do with psycho-somatic illness. Such illnessesrequire only one or two engrams of a specific nature to become manifest. These engrams maynot be aberrative in any other way than to predispose the individual to illness. Having apsycho-somatic illness is not the same as being “crazy” or having hypochondriacal tendencies.The hypochondriac thinks he has illnesses, a special case of Class (5) above.Derangement falls sharply into two categories: the first is the mental derangement, anyirrational condition, which in dianetics we call aberration in order to avoid constant cataloguingof the thousands, the millions of manifestations irrationality can have. The other derangementof the individual is somatic: this applies entirely to his physical being and physical ability andhealth. Both these things are present in every engram: the aberration and the somatic. But theengram can manifest itself chronically as either a somatic (a noun has been made out of anadjective here and it is commonly employed in dianetics to avoid the use of the word pain,which is not embracive and which is restimulative) or as an aberration or as both together.An engram must contain physical pain. When an engram is restimulated in everydaylife, that physical pain may appear or it may not. If it does not appear as pain but as aberration,then the individual is in another valence than his own (the “necessity to manifest hishostilities”). If he is sane enough to be in his own valence, the physical pain will be present. Indianetics we say the somatic has appeared. When any somatic appears, unless the individual isa pre-clear in therapy, some of the aberration is also appearing. In short, the aberration canappear by itself or the somatic plus some of the aberration can appear. When a persondramatizes another valence than his own, the aberration is present; when the dramatization,running off the engram phonograph-record-wise in one or another valence, is suppressed bysome other factor such as the police or a stronger person or even the individual himself (thishas been called repression -- the term is not used here because it is loaded with othermeanings), the somatic most certainly will come into view.The individual is then apparently “better off,” as the cells meant him to be, to occupythe survival role in the engram, the winning valence, for he is, at least, not ill. But how manypeople have been killed, how many banks have been robbed and how many marital partnershave been driven mad by these dramatizations?71"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"So the health of the individual would be considered by society, in its effort to protect itsmembers to be a secondary affair. In fact, “society” has not known about this mechanicalaspect. The individual who dramatizes the survival valence in his engrams may do violentthings to other people. The individual who will not permit himself such a dramatization or whois forced by society away from such dramatization will most certainly become psycho-somatically ill. “Heads I win, tails you lose.” The answer is in the alleviation or deletion of theengram. For there are many additional aspects to the problem: the man who dramatizes hisengrams, society or no society, is not apt to survive, and if he dramatizes them, he is subject towhatever slurs were leveled at the valence he is in by another valence in that same engram.The combinations of the classes and aspects of psycho-somatic illness listed anddescribed here lead to some highly complex situations. It is a scientific fact that no psycho-somatic ill exists without an aberration. And it is true that no aberration exists without apotential or actual psycho-somatic ill. One of the psycho-somatic illnesses one would leastexpect to find as a psycho-somatic affair is the illness of sexual perversion.The sexual pervert (and by this term dianetics, to be brief, includes any and all forms ofdeviation in Dynamic II such as homosexuality, lesbianism, sexual sadism, etc. and all downthe catalogue of Ellis and Krafft-Ebing) is actually quite ill physically. Perversion as an illnesshas so many manifestations that it must be spread through the entire gamut of classes from (1)to (5) above. Over-development of sexual organs, underdevelopment, seminal inhibition ormagnification, etc. are found some in one pervert, some in another. And the sum of it is thatthe pervert is always a very ill person in one way or another, whether he is conscious of it ornot. He is very far from culpable for his condition, but he is also so far from normal and soextremely dangerous to society that the tolerance of perversion is as thoroughly bad for societyas punishment for it.Lacking proper means prior to this time, society has been caught between tolerance andpunishment, and the problem of perversion has, of course, not been resolved. A bit off thesubject here, but it can be remarked about perversion that the best previous explanation for itwas something about girls becoming envious of Papa’s penis or boys becoming upset aboutthat terrible thing, the vulva, which Mama was incautious enough to show one day. It takes agreat deal more than this utter tripe to make a pervert.It is, rather, something on the order of kicking a baby’s head in, running over him witha steam roller, cutting him in half with a rusty knife, boiling him in lysol and all the while withcrazy people screaming the most horrifying and unprintable things at him. The human being isa very tough character. He is so confoundedly tough that he has whipped the whole animalkingdom and he can shake the stars. And when it comes to throwing his second dynamic out ofbalance, what that takes is straight out of Dante and Sax Rohmer combined. Hence the pervert,containing hundreds and hundreds of vicious engrams, has had little choice between beingdead and being a pervert. But with an effective science to handle the problem, a society whichwould continue to endure perversion and all its sad and sordid effects doesn’t deserve tosurvive.Perversion can have other aspects. In one society examined, these aberrations hadmultiplied so far that a principal mystic cult had sprung up which contended that all mentalillness came from sex; this, of course, gave further impetus to aberrations on the seconddynamic (sex), as such a cultic belief must have been originated by an individual who hadsevere aberrations across the second dynamic; this belief that sex was the only source of humanaberration and travail, naturally attracted as its practitioners individuals who had similaraberrative patterns. And so the cult further enforced existing aberrative factors in the society,since all their activity was leveled at making sex something ogreish and dreadful by labeling itthe society’s primary source of illness. The prophet of this god was Manichaeus, a Persian ofthe third century, who taught that all things about the body, especially sex, were evil; the cultof Manichaeus carried on well into the Dark Ages and then vanished, to trouble Man no more.72"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Any dynamic can be blocked, the personal dynamic, the sex dynamic, the groupdynamic or the Mankind dynamic. Each one has been the target at some time of one cult oranother seeking to cure all Man’s ills and save him. Dianetics is not interested in saving Man,but it can do much to prevent him from being “saved.” As an organized body of scientificknowledge dianetics can draw only the conclusion which it observes in the laboratory.It can be observed that the Church is entirely correct in doing all in its power to preventblasphemy. Blasphemy can very often be uttered during the “unconsciousness” of a personwho has been struck. This would enter sacred names and curses into engrams which, reactingwithin the individual, give him an unnatural terror and compulsion or repulsion toward God. Itis not the religion which is at fault, it is the blaspheming of the religion. Such blasphemymakes the insane zealot and the murderous atheist, both of whom the Church would verygladly do without.In the realm of psycho-somatic illness any combination of the language is as damaginga factor in an engram as any other factor. The moronic reasoning of the reactive mind, whichconsiders everything in an engram equal to everything in an engram, also considers thateverything similar to the engram in the exterior world (the restimulators) is sufficient cause toplace an engram in effect. Hence aberration and illness can come about.There is, however, a peculiarity in psycho-somatic illnesses which is chronic: theaberree’s reactive mind exercises a power of choice to the extent that only pro-survival engramsbecome chronic. It could be said, on a reactive level, that the aberree will not permit himself tosuffer illness from his engrams unless that illness has a “survival” value. This is very importantin therapy. The chronic psycho-somatic illnesses which a patient displays are those which havea sympathy (pro-survival) background.It is not possible to “spoil” a child with love and affection. Whoever postulated that itwas possible was postulating out of bad data and no observation. A child needs all the love andaffection it can possibly get. A test was run in one hospital which tended to show that babies,when left without attention, ran fevers. When given attention the fevers immediately abated.The test, while not observed personally by the author, seems to have been conducted withproper controls according to report. If this is true, it postulates a mechanism in the humanbeing which uses illness for affection on a genetic basis. There is no reason why not; therehave been enough years of engineering -- almost two billion -- to build anything into theblueprint. These babies, in several groups, were left in the hospital by their parents for the test;they uniformly became ill when not given affection. Here is the law of affinity at work, if thesetests were accurately conducted, their purpose was not to help dianetics but to show that theleaving of a baby in the hospital after his birth because he has a slight illness invariablyincreases that illness.A series of severely controlled dianetic experiments over a much longer perioddemonstrated that the law of affinity, as applicable to psycho-somatic illness, was morepowerful than fear and antagonism by a very wide margin. So great is this margin that it couldbe compared as the strength of a steel girder to a straw. It was found, as above, that chronicpsycho-somatic ills existed only when they had a sympathy engram behind them. The law ofaffinity might be interpreted as the law of cohesion; “affinity” might be defined as “love” inboth its meanings. Deprivation of or absence of affection could be considered as a violation ofthe law of affinity. Man must be in affinity with man to survive. The suicide ordinarilycommits the act on the computation that the removal of self will some way benefit other selves-- this, on the reactive mind level is a very ordinary computation, deriving exclusively fromengrams. The violent industrial chieftain with his merciless mien, when he suffers from apsycho-somatic ill, ordinarily derives it out of a sympathy engram.The sympathy engram pretends to be pro-survival. As one preclear said, a man is notvictimized by his enemies but by his friends. An engram comes about always from a greater orlesser moment of “unconsciousness.” There is no engram without “unconsciousness.” It isonly when the analyzer is out of circuit that the exterior world can come interior,73"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"unrationalized, and work from within. The second the analyzer identifies one of those engramsas such, that engram loses about twenty percent of its value to aberrate and usually a hundredpercent of its value to cause a psycho-somatic illness. Pain is extremely perishable. Pleasure isrecorded in bronze. (Not poetry here, science. Physical pain will delete with brief attention, apleasant or even a media-media experience is so solidly fixed in the mind that no treatmentknown to dianetics will shake it and a great deal of effort has been leveled at pleasurerecordings just to test them for permanence. They are permanent; physical pain is perishable.Too bad, Schopenhauer, but you were a most mistaken man.)Exposing a lock to the analyzer -- a moment of “mental anguish” -- once the engramwhich gave it power is gone causes that lock to blow away like chaff. The analyzer works onthe Doctrine of the True Datum: it has no truck with anything which it once discovers to befalse. Just exposing an engram without relieving it has some therapeutic value -- twenty percent-- and this gave rise to a belief that all one had to do was know about his ills and they wouldvanish. Nice if it were so.The most aberrative engram, then, is one which is held down by the reactive mind’s --that moron’s -- concept that it is needed in the survival of the individual. This sympathyengram is the one which comes forward and stays chronic as a psycho-somatic illness. Thereare two reasons for this: one is usually in one’s own valence when a sympathy engram isreceived; and one’s reactive mind, knowing well the value of affinity, puts forward the psycho-somatic illness to attract affinity. There is no volition here on the part of the individual’s “I”analytical self. But there is every “volition” on the part of the reactive mind.A sympathy engram would go something like this: a small boy, much victimized by hisparents, is extremely ill. His grandmother attends him and while he is delirious soothes himand tells him she will take care of him, that she will stay right there until he is well. This puts ahigh “survival” value on being sick. He does not feel safe around his parents; he wants hisgrandmother present (she is a winning valence because she orders the parents around), and henow has an engram. Minus the engram there would be no psycho-somatic illness. Sickness,“unconsciousness” and physical pain are essential to the receipt of this engram. But it is not acontra-survival engram. It is a pro-survival engram. It can be dramatized in one’s own valence.The psycho-somatic illness, in such a case as this, would be a “precious possession.”“I” doesn’t even know the computation. The analyzer was out when the engram went in. Theanalyzer cannot recall that engram with anything short of dianetic therapy. And the engram willnot clear away.Now with this engram we have a patient with sinusitis and a predisposition to lunginfections. It may be that he was luckless enough to marry a counterpart of his mother or hisgrandmother. The reactive mind cannot tell the difference between grandmother or mother andwife if they are even vaguely similar in speech, voice-tone or mannerisms. The wife is notsympathetic. In goes the engram to demand that sympathy. And even if the wife thinks thatsinusitis and lung infection are repulsive enough to lead to divorce, the reactive mind keeps thatengram keyed-in. The more hatred from the wife, the more that engram keys-in. You can kill aman that way.The above is a standard sympathy engram. When a therapist tries to get that engramaway from the patient, the reactive mind balks. The “I” doesn’t balk. The analyzer doesn’tbalk. These are hopeful that this engram will spring. But the reactive mind keeps it nailed downuntil the dianeticist puts a crowbar under it. Then it is gone. (Enough locks may be lifted, bythe way, to alleviate this condition. But the patient will dig up another engram!)Resistance to past therapies has resulted from these sympathy engrams. Yet they lieright there on the surface, fully exposed as chronic psycho-somatic illness.Feeding a patient with a psycho-somatic ill any number of drugs can result in onlytemporary relief. “I” doesn’t want the illness. The analyzer doesn’t want it. But the body has it74"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"and if anybody succeeds in curing it short of removing that engram, the body, at the commandof the reactive mind, will find something else to substitute for that ill or develop an “allergy” tothe drug or annul the effect of the drug entirely. Of course one can always rip living tissue out of the skull with knives, ice-picks orshock in wholesale quantities. This will cure a psycho-somatic ill. It also, unhappily, cures thepersonality, the intellect and all too often, life itself.In dianetics the application of technique to relieve the engrams causing these ills hasbrought the uniform relief of all patients treated without relapse. In short and in brief, psycho-somatic ills can now be cured. All of them. 75"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIEmotion and the DynamicsEmotion is a theta quantity, which is to say that it is so involved with life forces thatdianetics at this stage handles it with invariable success but does not attempt to give forth morethan a descriptive theory. Much research must be done on emotion; but so long as the therapyembraces it and releases it with success, further data can be dispensed with up to a point.Emotion would have to be divided sharply into minus emotions and plus emotions. Theminus emotion would be non-survival in character, the plus emotion would be pro-survival.The pleasant and pleasurable emotions are not of any great concern to us here. It is believedthat all emotion is the same thing but in its aspects above Zone 1 it can be by-passed asunnecessary to explain at this time for the purpose of this book.In Zones 1 and 0, emotion becomes very important to therapy. As has been coveredearlier, Zones 1 and 0 are the anger and apathy zones respectively. From death up to the borderbetween anger and fear is Zone 0. From this borderline to the beginning of boredom is anger,Zone 1.It is as if the survival dynamic, in becoming contracted into Zone 1, first began todisplay hostility, then, on further suppression toward death, anger. On further suppression,rage began to be displayed. Then fear as the next lower level, then terror and finally, just abovedeath, apathy.And as the dynamic is suppressed, the cells react forcefully to the menace, it could besaid, by resisting the menace. The analyzer resists down to the top border of Zone 1, but inever decreasing control. From here on down the cells, the actual organism, do the resisting in alast ditch effort. The reactive mind is thoroughly in command from the top border of Zone 1straight on down to death, and it is in ever increasing command of the organism as the dynamicis suppressed.Emotion seems to be inextricably connected up with the actual force of life. That thereis a life force no engineer could doubt. Man and medicine usually look at the pitcher and forgetthat the pitcher is only there to hold milk and that the milk is the important quantity. Life forceis the helium which fills the free balloon. Out goes the helium, down comes the balloon. Whenthis type of energy is located and isolated as itself -- if it is just an energy type -- then medicinecan start moving forward in strides which will make all former steps look like those of a man ina sack race. Medicine doesn’t have any spare helium, for one thing.How high this life force can go on the survival scale is not known. Above Zone 3 is thearea of question marks. A clear goes up into a level of persistence, vigor, tenacity, rationalityand happiness. Perhaps some day a clear will attain the nebulosity the author used to hear aboutin India which marked the man who was all soul.How far down it can go is definitely known. A man dies. He doesn’t move or think.He dies as an organism, then he dies as cells. There are different periods of “life after death”for the cells and biologists remark that the hair and nail cells do not die for months. So here is aspectrum of death, first the organism and then, colony by colony, the cells.That is from the bottom of Zone 0 downward. But what we are interested in is the areafrom Zone 1 down to the bottom of Zone 0. It could be postulated that the analytical mind hasits greatest bounce against the suppressor, its highest ability to care for the organism, when it isin the third zone. As the suppressor thrusts downward against it, the analyzer, within lowerZone 3 thrusts heavily back. This is necessity at work. The necessity level can rise, in thisaction, to a point which keys-out all engrams!76"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"It must be realized that the analyzer considers future suppressors and is continuallyengaged upon computations which pose problems of the future which the analyzer resolves --this is one of the functions of the imagination; it must further be realized that the analyzer isengaged upon a multitude of computations about the present: for the analytical mind is dealingcontinually with an enormous number of factors which comprise the suppressor of the presentand the suppressor of the future. It computes for instance on the alliances with friends andsymbiotes and its greatest victories are achieved by taking some of the suppressor and turningit into an alliance factor.The individual can be visualized, on the survival spectrum, as being at the tip of thesurvival dynamic. The suppressor thrusts down, or future suppressors threaten a thrust and theanalytical mind thrusts up with solutions. The level of the individual is determined by how wellthese suppressors are apparently met.We speak now of the clear and until further mention we will continue to use the clear.The clear is an unaberrated person. He is rational in that he forms the best possible solutions hecan on the data he has and from his viewpoint. He obtains the maximum pleasure for theorganism, present and future, as well as for the subjects along the other dynamics. The clearhas no engrams which can be restimulated to throw out the correctness of computation byentering hidden and false data into it. No aberration. Hence the reason we use him here as anexample.The survival dynamic is high, more than balancing the suppressor. Take this as a firstcondition. This would place the dynamic in Zone 3, Tone 3.9. Now increase the suppressor.The dynamic is pushed back to Tone 3.2. Necessity surges up. The suppressor is thrust back.The dynamic is once more at Tone 3.9. This action could be termed an enthusiastic resurgence.The individual has actually gotten “angry” -- that is to say, he has called upon his being tofurnish power for thought and action.Mentally he calls upon whatever constitutes mental energy. Physically, if thesuppression was physical, he would call upon his adrenalin. This is proper use of theendocrines, to use them for regaining position in relation to the suppressor. Any and all bodyfunction is under analytical (but not necessarily monitored) command.Now let us suppose that the suppressor surges down against the dynamic and drivesthe dynamic to 3.0. Necessity level comes up. Action is taken. The full force of the being isthrown against the suppressor. Now let us suppose that a new factor comes into the suppressorand makes it much, much stronger. The individual still attempts to resurge against it. But thesuppressor weighs heavier and heavier against him. He is beginning to exhaust his supplies ofmental or physical energy (and this suppressor can be on either a mental or physical level.)Wearying, the individual drops down to a 2.5. The suppressor again increases. Resurgence isattempted once more. The last supply of available energy or data is thrown out. And anotherfactor comes into the suppressor, increasing its weight. The individual sags down to 2.0.At exactly this point the analyzer, having failed, finally cuts out. Here is entered the topof Zone 1. Hostility sets in. The suppressor is down, pressing down against actual cellularsurvival. And it drops lower. The individual goes into anger, recruiting cellularly but notsentiently, the last forces. Again the suppressor gets new weight. The individual goes intorage. Once more the suppressor drops. The individual goes into fear, Tone 0.9. Again thesuppressor lowers, recruiting new factors. The individual is thrust down to 0.6 and here is interror. Once more the suppressor drops with new force. The individual slides into fearparalysis, 0.2.Suppose we parallel this in a very simple, dramatic example so that we do not have toconsider a thousand subtle factors.A clear, inexperienced in hunting, determines to shoot a grizzly. He has a fine rifle. Thegrizzly appears to be easy game. The man is at 3.9 or above. He feels good. He is going to get77"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"that grizzly as the grizzly has been threatening the man’s stock. High enthusiasm carries him tothe lair. He waits, he finally sees the grizzly. There is a cliff above the man which he could notordinarily climb. But to get a good shot before the grizzly vanishes, the man has to climb thecliff. Seeing he was in danger of losing the game brought the man down to 3.2. Necessitysends him up the cliff. He fires but in firing falls back down the cliff. The grizzly is wounded.He starts toward the man. Necessity surges up. The man recovers the gun and shoots again.He is at 3.0 the moment he shoots. He misses. He fires again but the miss, with the grizzlycharging, brought him down to 2.5. He shoots once more. The grizzly takes the ball and keepson coming. The man shoots again but he has suddenly realized that his rifle is not going to stopthis grizzly. His tone drops to 2.0. He begins to snarl and feverishly work his gun. His bulletsgo wild. He experiences rage at the gun, the grizzly, the world, and throws the gun away,ready to meet the grizzly, almost upon him, with bare hands. Suddenly the man knows fear.His tone is 1.2. It drops to 0.9 with a smell in his nostrils of the bear. He knows the bear willkill him. He turns and tries to claw up the cliff and get away but his efforts are frenzied. He isat Tone 0.6, stark terror. The bear strikes him and knocks him from the cliff-side. The man liesstill, breathing almost halted, heart-beat slowed to nearly nothing. The bear hits him again andthe man lies still. Then the bear decides he is dead and walks away. Shaken, the maneventually comes around, his tone gradually rising up to 2.0, the point where his analyzer shutoff. He stirs more and gets up. His tone is back to 2.5: he is analytically afraid and cautious.He recovers his gun. He begins to leave the scene. He feels a great necessity to recoup his ownself-esteem and his tone comes to 3.2. He walks away and reaches a safe area. Suddenly itoccurs to him that he can borrow a friend’s Mauser. He begins to make plans to get that bear.His enthusiasm mounts. But, completely aside from the engram received when the bearknocked him out, he acts on his experience. Three days later he kills the bear and his tone risesto 4.0 for the space of contemplation and telling the tale and then his mind occupies itself withnew matters.Life is much more complicated than the business of killing grizzlies, usually a lot lessdramatic but always full of situations which cause a fluctuation of the suppressor. The gainingof all pleasurable goals -- a bear killed, a woman kissed, a seat in the front row at the opera, afriend won, an apple stolen -- are sweeps through various levels of tone. And the individual isgenerally carrying on three or three thousand computations at once and there are thirty or thirtythousand variables in his computations. Too many unknowns, too many entrances of “didn’tknow the gun was loaded” factors, all these can throw the analyzer from a direct alignment intothe scattered dispersal of non-function. The analyzer can be considered to cut out when Tone2.0 is reached. From 2.5 down the computations it makes are not very rational -- too manyunknowns, too many unexpected factors, too many discoveries of miscalculations.This is living on a “clear” basis. When our hunter was hit by the bear he received anengram. That engram, when it keyed-in, would give him a fear, an apathy attitude, in thepresence of certain factors: every perceptic present -- the smell of that ground, twigs, bear-breath, etc. But he killed the bear. The chances of that engram keying-in are remote. Notbecause he killed the bear but because he was, after all, a grown man. And, if a clear, he couldhave thought back and cleared the whole thing himself.This is a complete cycle of emotion. Enthusiasm and high pleasure are at the extremetop. Fear and paralysis are at the bottom. Feigned death, in Man, is very close to the actualthing on the tone scale. It is a valid mechanism. But it is complete apathy.So long as the analyzer is operating, the receipt of an engram is impossible. Everythingfiles in the standard banks. As soon as the border 2.0 is passed on the way down,“unconsciousness” can be judged to have set in and anything registered, in company with painor painful emotion, is an engram. This is not a shift of definition. The analyzer cuts out, withsurgical anaesthetic, at 2.0. The anaesthetic may depress the level of awareness further. Painmay depress it even more. But depressing the level of awareness is not necessarily depressingemotion.78"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"How much conceived danger or sympathy is present in the environment? This is whatdepresses the tone scale. There can be a reactive engram which contains a Tone 4.0 or one thatcontains a 1.0 or another that contains a 0.1. This is not, then, quite two-dimensional, thisemotion.The level of depth of consciousness can be affected by painful emotion, poisons orother things which depress awareness. After that it is all engram and the engrams have theirown tone scale which runs from 4.0 down to 0.1.It can be seen now that two things are at work. First is the state of physical being. It isthis which tunes down the analyzer. Then there is the mental state of being.This is what tunes down the emotional tone scale.But remember that in engrams there is another factor present: valence. Once its ownanalyzer is out the body will assume the evaluation or emotional condition of any other analyzerpresent. Here we have affinity at work in earnest. “Unconscious” in the presence of otherbeings, an individual picks up a valence for every other being present. Some of these valencesare incidental. He will pick first that valence which is most sympathetic as a desirable futurefriend (or some similar person). And he will pick that valence which is the top valence (highestsurvival, the boss, the winner) for his dramatization. He will also take the valence of thewinning entity (winning over himself or others) for emotional tone. If the winning valence isalso the sympathetic valence, he has an engram which can be utilized to its fullest extent.Let us make this an example: a man is under nitrous oxide (the most vicious anaestheticever invented as it is actually not anaesthetic but a hypnotic) undergoing exodontistry. As usualeverybody present around the “unconscious” patient chatters and yaps about the patient, theweather, the most popular movie star, or baseball. The exodontist is a tough character, bossyto the nurse, apt to be angry about trifles; he is also very sympathetic toward the patient. Thenurse is a blue-eyed blonde who is sexually aberrated. The patient, actually in agony, receivingan engram amongst engrams which may ruin his life (terrible stuff, nitrous oxide; really handsout a fancy engram as any dianeticist can attest) is unanalytical. Everything said to him oraround him is taken literally. He takes the valence of the exodontist as both the top valencepresent and the sympathetic valence. But every phrase uttered is aberrative and will beinterpreted by that happy little moron, the reactive mind, on the order of Simple Simon whowas told he had to be careful how he stepped in the pies, so he stepped in them carefully.These people may be talking about somebody else but every “I” or “he” or “you” uttered isengramic and will be applied to others and himself by the patient in the most literal sense. “Hecan’t remember anything” says the exodontist. All right, when the engram keys-in, this patientwill have an occlusion on memory in greater or lesser degree. “He can’t see or feel it”: thismeans an occlusion on sight, pain and tactile. If the patient has his eyes watering in agony atthe moment (though completely “under”) he may get actual bad vision as well as poor visualrecall from this experience.Now they put him in the hands of this blonde nurse to let him sleep off the drug andrecover. She is an aberree amongst aberrees.She knows patients do weird things when they are still “out” so she pumps him forinformation about his life. And she knows they are hypnotic (yes, she sure does) so she giveshim some positive suggestions. Amusing herself. She says he’ll like her. That she’ll be goodto him. And stay there now for the present.So the poor patient, who has had two wisdom teeth, impacted, taken out, has a fullanger-sympathy dramatization. The general tone he takes is the tone the exodontist showed tothe others in the room. The exodontist was angry at the nurse. With his recalls all messed up,the patient a few years later meets a woman similar to this nurse. The nurse has given himcompulsions toward her.79"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The silly little moron, the reactive mind, sees in this entirely different person enoughsimilarity to create an identity between the nurse and this new woman. So the patient divorceshis wife and marries the pseudo-nurse.Only now that he has married the pseudo-nurse the dental engram begins to key-in inearnest. Physically he gets ill: the two molars adjacent to where the wisdom teeth came outdevelop large cavities and begin to rot (circulation shut down, pain in the area but can’t be feltbecause there’s a pain recall shut-off). His memory goes to pieces. His recalls become worse.He begins to develop eye trouble and a strange conjunctivitis. Further (because the dentistleaned on his chest and stomach with a sharp elbow from time to time) he has chest andstomach pains. The nitrous oxide hurt his lungs and this pain is also in chronic restimulation.But most horrible: he believes that this pseudo-nurse will take care of him and he stops to somedegree taking care of himself in any way; his energy dissipates; and analytically he knows it isall wrong and that he is not himself. For he is now fixed in the valence of the exodontist who isangry with this nurse and so he beats the pseudo-nurse because he senses that from her all evilflows. The girl he married is not and was not the nurse: she sounds something like her and is ablonde. She has her own engrams and reacts. She attempts suicide.Then, one day, since this is one engram among many, the mental hospital gets ourpatient and the doctors there decide that all he needs is a good solid series of electric shocks totear his brain up, and if that doesn’t work, a nice ice-pick into each eyeball after and duringelectric shock, the ice-pick sweeping a wide arc to tear the analytical mind to pieces. His wifeagrees. Our patient can’t defend himself: he’s insane and the insane have no rights, you know.Only the cavalry, in this one case, arrived in the form of dianetics and cleared thepatient and the wife and they are happy today. This is an actual engram and an actual casehistory. It is a sympathy engram, pro-survival on the moronic reactive mind level.This is to show the ebb and flow of emotion within this one engram. The physicalbeing is out and in agony. The mental being is given a variety of emotional tones on acontagion principle. The actual emotional tone of the patient, his own, is beaten apathy; hencehe can no longer “be himself.”In passing it should be mentioned that only absolute silence, utter silence and tomb-likesilence, should attend an operation or injury of any kind. There is nothing which can be said orgiven as a perceptic in any moment of “unconsciousness” which is beneficial to a patient.Nothing! In the light of these researches and scientific findings (which can be proven inany other laboratory or group of people in very short order), speech or sound in the vicinity ofan “unconscious” person should be punished criminally as, to anyone who knows these facts,such an act would be a willful effort to destroy the intellect or mental balance of an individual.If the patient is complimented, as in hypnosis or during an injury or operation, a manic isformed which will give him temporary euphoria and eventually plunge him into the depressivestage of the cycle.The golden rule could be altered to read: If you love your brother, keep your mouthshut when he is unconscious.Emotion can be seen then to exist in two planes, the personal plane and the extra-valence plane. It is communicable in terms of identical thinking. Rage present when a man is“unconscious” will give him a Tone 1 engram: it will contain rage. Apathy present in thevicinity of an “unconscious” person will give him a Tone 0 engram. Happiness present duringan engram is not very aberrative but will give a Tone 4 engram. And so forth. In other words,the emotion of those present around an “unconscious” person is communicated into the personas part of his engram. Any mood can be so communicated.In dramatizing an engram, the aberree always takes the winning valence and thatvalence is not, of course, himself. If only one other person is present and the other is talking in80"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"terms of apathy, then the apathy is the tone value of the engram. When an apathy engram isrestimulated, the individual, unless he wants to be hurt severely, is apathetic and this tone,being the nearest to death, is the most dangerous one to the individual. The rage emotioncommunicated to an “unconscious” person gives him a rage engram he can dramatize. This ismost harmful to the society. A merely hostile tone present around an “unconscious” persongives him a merely hostile engram (covert hostility). With two people present, each having adifferent mood, the “unconscious” person receives an engram with two valences other than hisown. When this happens he will first dramatize the winning valence with its mood and, ifforced from this, will dramatize the second valence with its mood. Driven from this in achronic engram, he goes insane.Nothing here should be construed to mean that a person only uses or dramatizessympathy engrams. This is very far from the case. The sympathy engram gives him the chronicpsycho-somatic illness. He can dramatize any engram he has when it is restimulated.Emotion, then, is communication and a personal condition. The cellular level evaluationof a situation depends upon any other analyzer present, even if that analyzer is thoroughlyhostile to it. Lacking such evaluation, the individual takes his own tone for the moment.There is another condition of emotion which is of extreme and useful interest to thetherapist since it is the first thing with which he will have to deal in opening a case. We do notmean here to start discussing therapy but to describe a necessary part of emotion.Great loss and other swift and severe suppressor action dams up emotion in an engram.Loss itself can be a shock to reduce analytical power. And an engram is received. If it is theloss of a sympathetic person on whom an individual has depended, it seems to the individual asif death itself stalks him. When such a suppressor effect occurs, it is as if a strong steel springhad been compressed within the engram. When it releases it comes with a terrible rush ofemotion (if this discharge is, indeed, emotion, though we hardly know what other name to callit).Life force apparently gets dammed up at these points in life. There may be enormousquantities of that life force available but some of it becomes suppressed into a loss engram.After that the person does not seem to possess as much fluid vitality as before. This may be notemotion but life force itself. The mind then has below it, as in a cyst, a great quantity of sorrowor despair. The more of these charges exist in such an encysted state, the less free are theemotions of the individual. This may be on a basis of suppression to a point from which thereis no swift rising. Nothing in the person’s future seems to bring him up to any plane like thosehe occupied before.The glory and color of childhood vanishes as one progresses into later years. But thestrange part of it is that this glamor and beauty and sensitivity to life are not gone. They areencysted. One of the most remarkable experiences a clear has is to find, in the process oftherapy, that he is recovering appreciation of the beauty in the world.Persons, as they live forward from childhood, suffer loss after loss, and each losstakes from them a little more of this ; Ø quantity which may be, indeed, life force itself. Boundup within them, that force is denied them and indeed, reacts against them.Only this emotional encysting can, for instance, compartment the mind of a person whois multi-valent or who cannot see or hear his past. The analytical mind, worked upon by thereactive bank, compartments and divides with loss after loss until there is no free flow left.Then a man dies.Thus we could say that emotion, or what has been called emotion, is really in twosections: first, there is the endocrine system which, handled either by the analytical mind in theupper two zones or the reactive mind in the lower two zones, brings emotional responses of81"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"fear, enthusiasm, apathy, etc.; second, there would be life force itself becomingcompartmented by engrams and being sealed up, little by little, in the reactive bank.It is possible that a therapy could be formulated which would spring out these variouslife force charges only and create thereby a full clear. Unfortunately, to date, this has not beenpossible.The odd part of emotion is that it is so ordinarily based on the word content ofengrams. If an engram says, “I am afraid,” then the aberree is afraid. If an engram says, “I amcalm,” even if the rest of the engram gives him chattering shakes, the aberree still has to be“calm.”The problem of emotion as endocrine balance and life force has another complication inthat the physical pain in an engram is often mistaken for a particular emotion named in theengram. For instance, the engram can say with verbal content that the individual is “sexuallyexcited” and have as a pain content an ache in the legs and have as an actual emotional content(the valence that says “I’m sexually excited”) anger. This, to the aberree dramatizing it is acomplex affair. When he is “sexually excited” -- he has an idea what that means as justlanguage -- he is also angry and has an ache in the legs. This is actually very amusing in manycases and has led to a standard set of clinical jokes, all of which begin with, “You know, I feellike everybody else.”Dianeticists, having discovered that people evaluate the emotions, beliefs, intelligenceand somatics of the world in terms of their own engramic reactions, delight in discovering newconcepts of “emotion.” “You know how people feel when they’re happy. Their ears burn.” “Ifeel just like anybody else when I’m happy; my feet and eyes ache.” “Of course I know howpeople feel when they’re happy; just pin prickles going all over them.” “I wonder how peoplecan stand to be passionate when it makes their noses hurt so.” “Of course I know how peoplefeel when they’re excited: they have to go to the toilet.”Probably every person on earth has his own peculiar definition for every emotionalstate in terms of engram command. The command plus the somatics and perceptics make whatthey call an “emotional state.”Actually the problem, then, should be defined in terms of the clear, who can functionwithout engramic orders from the reactive mind. So defined it breaks down in terms of theendocrine system and the varying level of life force free to resurge against the suppressor.Laughter, it should be added, is not, strictly speaking, an emotion but a relief fromemotion. The early Italians had a very definite idea, as represented by their folk tales, thatlaughter was of therapeutic value. Melancholy was the only mental illness these tales considerand laughter was its only cure. In dianetics we have a great deal to do with laughter. In therapypatients vary, in their laughter reaction, from the slight chuckle to hilarious mirth. Any engramwhich really releases may be expected to begin somewhere between tears and boredom and endwith laughter; the nearer the engram’s tone is to tears at the first contact, the more certainlylaughter will appear as it is relieved.There is a stage of therapy often reached by the preclear when his entire past life seemsto be a subject of uncontrollable mirth. This does not mean he is clear but it means that a largeproportion of the encysted charges have been tapped. A pre-clear has laughed for two daysalmost without ceasing. Hebephrenia is not the same thing as this laughter for the relief of thepre-clear on realizing the shadowy aspect and completely knowable character of his past fearsand terrors is hearty.Laughter plays a definite role in therapy. It is quite amusing to see a pre-clear, who hasbeen haunted by an engram which contained great emotional charge, suddenly relieve it, for thesituation, no matter how gruesome it was, when relieved, is in all its aspects a subject of great82"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"mirth. The laughter fades away as he becomes disinterested in it and he can be said to be “Tone3” about it.Laughter is definitely the relief of painful emotion.[The complete Tone Scale, its use in predicting the behavior of others as well as assisting inauditing, is given in the book SCIENCE OF SURVIVAL by L. Ron Hubbard, 1951, 580pages.] 83"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIIPrenatal Experience and BirthOld women less than a hundred years ago talked wisely about “prenatal influence” andhow a woman marked her child. Many such intuitive thoughts are based, actually, on observeddata. It can be observed that the child born out of wedlock is often a luckless creature (in asociety which frowns upon such bearings). These tenets have been held in the market place fora great many millenia. Just because they have been held is no reason they are true, but theymake an excellent beginning for a chapter on prenatal experience and birth.If dianetics had worked on obscure theories such as those of the old women or those ofthe mystics who believe that “childish delusions” are capable of aberrating a child, dianeticswould not be a science of mind. But it was no obscure theory which brought about thediscovery of the exact role prenatal experience and birth play in aberration and psycho-somaticills.Many schools of mental healing from the Aesculapian to the modern hypnotist werestudied after the basic philosophy of dianetics had been postulated. Much data wasaccumulated, many experiments were made. The fundamentals about engrams had beenformulated and “unconsciousness” had been discovered as being a period of actual recordingwhen the theory began to predict new phenomena not hitherto observed.There has been, in recent years, a practice called “narco-synthesis.” This was actually abranch of “hypno-analysis” and “deep analysis.” It did not produce clears and it did not evenproduce alleviation in the majority of its cases. But it was discovered to be an aberrative factorin itself. A thing which aberrates may well lead to something which removes aberrations if it isstudied scientifically. Narco-synthesis was so studied. Several cases were examined on whichnarco-synthesis had been employed. Some of these cases had experienced relief fromnarcosynthesis. Others had become a great deal worse.Working with hypno-analysis it was discovered that the technique could be varied untilit would actually remove the aberrative charge contained in locks. In treating schizophrenicswith narco-synthesis it was found that the locks (periods of mental anguish not includingphysical pain or “unconsciousness”) would sometimes spring (clear) and sometimes not.Narco-synthesis is a complicated name for a very ancient process quite well known inGreece and India. It is drug hypnotism. And it is generally employed either by thosepractitioners who do not know hypnosis or on those patients who will not succumb to ordinaryhypnotism. A shot of sodium pentothal is given intravenously to the patient and he is asked tocount backwards. Shortly he stops counting at which the injection is also stopped. The patientis now in a state of “deep sleep.” That this is not sleep seems to have missed both narco-synthesists and hypnotists. It is actually a depressant on the awareness of an individual so thatthose attention units which remain behind the curtain of his reactive bank can be reacheddirectly. These attention units are up against the standard banks. The by-pass circuits (demoncircuits) which lie between these banks and “I” have themselves been by-passed. In otherwords, a section of the analytical mind has been exposed which is not aberrated. It is not verypowerful and it is not highly intelligent, but it has the advantage of being hard up against thestandard banks. This is basic personality. The intent and purpose and persistence of these fewattention units have the same quality and direction as the whole analytical mind would have if itwere clear. It is a very nice, co-operative group of attention units and it is very useful; for basicpersonality has all recalls -- sonic, audio, tactile, smell, pain, etc. It can get at anything that isin the banks -- which is everything perceived or thought in a lifetime, minute by minute. Thesequalities of basic personality have been very poorly described in hypnotism, and it is doubtfuleven if it was generally known that sonic was part of the recall system disclosed by deephypnotism or the drug hypnotism called narco-synthesis.84"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"A study of basic personality in a multi-valent subject who had poor memory, no goodrecalls and scant imagination disclosed the information that BP (the attention units called basicpersonality) was more able to select out data than AP (aberrated personality as represented bythe awake subject). It was further discovered that AP could ordinarily return better than BP sofar as time-distance went but that when AP arrived at the earliest place it was unable to managerecall. But if AP had gone back and established a vague contact with an incident, drughypnotism or standard hypnotism used on him when he was in present time (no longerreturned would then permit BP to return. Drug hypnotism has seldom been able to force backvery early into a patient’s life. But by making the strength of AP go back and then using BP forthe recall, some very early incidents could be reached. This trick was invented to overcomesome of the difficulties which had made drug hypnosis relatively uncertain in results.Then another factor was discovered. All those patients who had been treated by narco-synthesis had become worse every time the people doing the work had crossed over but left(because “everybody knew” an “unconscious” person didn’t record) a period of“unconsciousness.” When one of these “unconscious” periods was so probed -- by the drughypnosis called narco-synthesis -- the patient usually became worse, not better. Doing a littlemore probing than had been done by the usual practitioners, dianetic research entered some ofthe late life “unconscious” periods and, with much labor, laid them bare.Now all drug hypnosis, whether it is called narco-synthesis or a visit from the godAesculapius, is still hypnosis. Whatever is said to a hypnotized subject remains as a positivesuggestion, and these positive suggestions are simply engrams with a somewhat lighter effectand a shorter duration. When a drug is present the hypnotism is complicated by the fact thathypnotic drugs are, after all, poisons; the body is then possessed of a permanent (at least untildianetics was discovered) somatic to go along with the suggestion. Drug hypnotism invariablycreates an engram. Whatever a practitioner says to a drugged subject becomes engramic insome degree. In the course of dianetic research it first was supposed, playing back the carelesschatter of practitioners out of the minds of patients they had placed under drug hypnosis, thatthis carelessness in saying so many aberrative things was responsible for some of the failure.But this was found to be true in a very limited sense. Then it was discovered that when the“unconscious” periods were reached by drug hypnosis they refused to lift even when thepatient recounted them scores of times. This was blamed on the drug character of the hypnosis.Straight hypnotism was then used to reach these late “unconscious” periods and theseperiods still failed to lift. Therefore it was adjudged safe to continue drug use on those patientswho refused hypnosis. And the AP-BP alternate trick began to be employed.It was discovered by drug hypnosis where it was necessary and straight hypnosiswhere that was possible that the “schizophrenic” (the multi-valent aberree) could be made toreach very early periods in every case. And it was further found that an early period of“unconsciousness” would often lift. Experimentation brought about a scientific axiom: Theearlier the period of “unconsciousness” the more likely it is to lift. That is a fundamental axiomof dianetic therapy.Manic-depressives who had sonic recall were worked upon, most of them by straighthypnosis, and it was discovered that they also followed this rule. But it was most dramatic inthe multi-valent aberree: for when the engram did not lift it impinged against his analytical mindwhen he was awakened and created a variation in his psychoses and brought with it psycho-somatic illnesses as well.This brought about an understanding of why the multi-valent aberree, under narco-synthesis, was made worse whenever some practitioner had glided over (but not entered, ofcourse) a late-life period of “unconsciousness.” Now came the problem of applying the axiom.It was postulated that the primary engram must in some way suppress later engrams. In viewof other data and postulates, this was an entirely reasonable assumption. The earlier a personwent in the life of a multi-valent aberree the less likelihood there was of restimulating him85"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"artificially. Often an engram at around two or three years of age would lift entirely and give hima great deal of relief.The problem of this research was very far from the same problem of those who, notknowing about the reactive mind and “unconsciousness,” tried merely to find computingfactors on a rational level or incidents of everyday life as aberrative factors in a patient.When an engram is touched, it is very resistive, particularly above the age of two years.Further, the whole reactive bank was buried deeply under foggy layers of “unconsciousness”and was further safeguarded by a mechanism of the analytical mind which tended to prohibit itfrom touching pain or painful emotion. The reactive bank was protecting itself all the waythrough the research but it was obviously the answer. The problem was how to achieve itsrelief, if it could be relieved.Having made several multi-valent personalities intensely uncomfortable, a newnecessity level was reached whereby something had to be done about the problem. But therewas this shining hope, the above axiom. A bridge between insanity and sanity had to be builtand there, in the axiom, one had at least a glimmer of a plan. The earlier one had experiencedthis fog and pain, the lighter these engrams seemed to be.Then, one day, a multi-valent patient, under drugs, went back to his birth. He sufferedthe pain -- and it was very painful with this crude technique, for dianetics had not yet smootheddown to a well-oiled piece of machinery -- and he floundered through the “unconsciousness”of the period and he fought the doctor who had tried to put drops in his eyes and he generallyresented the entire proceedings. AP had been sent down first, then later, under drugs, BP hadcontacted the incident.This seemed a remarkable day for dianetics. After twenty runs through birth the patientexperienced a recession of all somatics and “unconsciousness” and aberrative content. He hadhad asthma. It seemed that this asthma had been caused by the doctor’s enthusiasm in yankinghim off the table just when he was fighting for his first breath. He had had conjunctivitis. Thatcame from the eye-drops. He had had sinusitis. That had come from the nose swabs used bythe pretty nurse.Rejoicing was held for he seemed to be a new man. A primary psychosis about being“pushed around” had vanished. The subjective reality of this incident was intense. Objectivereality did not matter but this patient had a mother near at hand and objective reality wasestablished simply by returning her in therapy to his birth. They had not communicated about itin detail. The recording of her sequence compared word for word with his sequence, detail fordetail, name for name. Possibility, even if they had communicated, of such duplication,outside the dianetic situation, was mathematically impossible. And she had been “unconscious”during his birth and had always supposed that the affair had been quite different and the returndata collapsed her awake description of it as being so much fable.In order to make sure that this was no freak (for it is a very poor research man who willbase conclusions on a series of one) two manic-depressives were returned to their births andboth completed the experience. But one of these two birth engrams would not lift!The postulated axiom was called into play again. If one could find the earliest engram,then the others would lift each in turn. That was the hope.The manic-depressive whose birth had not lifted was returned to a period before birth inan effort to find an earlier engram.Structural theories, as fondly held for ages, had thoroughly collapsed already when“unconscious” fog and pain had been penetrated to discover the engram as an aberrative unit.Tests had held up the discovery that all data, awake, asleep and “unconscious,” from themoment of conception on was always recorded somewhere in the mind or body. The little86"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"matter of myelin sheathing, since it had already been disproven by laboratory research whichincluded the reaching of birth, was discarded. The theory that no recordings can take place inthe mind until the nerves are sheathed depends upon a theoretical postulate, has never beensubjected to scientific research, and depends for its existence upon Authority alone -- and a“science” which depends on Authority alone is a breath in the wind of truth and is therefore noscience at all. That babies cannot record until the myelin sheathing is formed has about as muchtruth, on investigation, as the fact that penis-envy is the cause of female homosexuality.Neither theory, when applied, works. For the baby, after all, is composed of cells and it isevidenced now by much research that the cell, not an organ, records the engram.Thus there was no inhibition about looking earlier than birth for what dianetics hadbegun to call basic-basic (the first engram of the first chain of engrams). And an earlier engramwas reached.It has since been discovered that a great deal of recording is done by the child in thewomb which is not engramic. For a time it was thought that the child in the womb records onthe proposition of “extended hearing,” where hearing tunes up in the presence of danger andparticularly during “unconsciousness.” But the first research discovered prenatal engrams to bemost easily reached when they contained a great deal of pain. Cells, not the individual, areevidenced to record pain. And the reactive engram bank is composed only of cells.Recourse to nature rather than recourse to Authority is the very building block ofmodern science. So long as Galen remained an Authority on blood, none but “madmen” likeDa Vinci, Shakespeare and William Harvey even thought to experiment to find out what trulywas the action of blood! So long as Aristotle remained the Authority for All, the Dark Agesreigned. Advance comes from asking free-minded questions of nature, not from quoting theworks and thinking the thoughts of by-gone years. Recourse to precedent is an assertion thatyesterday’s mentors were better informed than today’s: an assertion which fades before thetruth that knowledge is compounded of the experience of yesterdays, of which we have more,most certainly, than the best-informed mentor of yesterday itself.In that dianetics was based on a philosophy that used the cell as the basic buildingblock, the fact that recording of engrams was done by cells came with less surprise than itotherwise might have. The engram is not a memory; it is a cellular trace of recordings impingeddeeply into the very structure of the body itself. The experience of which cells themselves were capable had already been tested. It hadbeen found that a monocell divided not only its substance but gave its total experience, as amaster disc will make duplicates, to its offspring. Now this is a peculiarity of monocells: theysurvive as identities. Each is personally its fore-bearer.Cell A divides to a first generation; this generation is also Cell A; the second generation,the second division, creates an entity which is still Cell A. Lacking the necessity of suchlaborious processes as construction and birth and growth before reproduction, the monocellsimply splits. And everything it has learned could be postulated to be contained in the newgeneration. Cell A dies but through generations from it, the latest generation is still Cell A.Man’s belief that he is to live in his progeny might possibly derive from this cellular identity ofprocreation. Another interesting possibility lies in the fact that even neurons exist in embryo inthe zygote and neurons do not themselves divide but are like organisms (and may have thevirus as their basic building block).Dianetics, as a study of function and the science of mind, does not need any postulateconcerning structure, however. The only test is whether or not a fact works. If it does workand can be used, it is a scientific fact. And the prenatal engram is a scientific fact. Tested andchecked for objective reality, it still stands firm. And as for subjective reality, the acceptance ofthe prenatal engram as a working fact alone makes possible the clear.87"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"At the end of a series of 270 clears and alleviations a short series of five cases wastaken to finally settle the argument. These five cases were not permitted to admit anythingbefore birth. They were treated with everything dianetics, hypnotism and other therapeuticscould offer, and no clear was obtained. This ruled out the “personality of the operator” or“suggestion” or “faith” as factors in dianetics. These five cases had never been informed ofprenatal engrams. Each swerved in toward them but was restrained without informing him thatengrams existed that early. The five were alleviated as to some variety of psycho-somatic illsbut the ills were only alleviated, not completely cured. The aberrations remained but littlechanged. They are extremely disappointed since each had heard something of “the miraclesdianetics could perform.” Before then 270 cases had been worked and 270 cases had reachedprenatal engrams. And 270 cases had been cleared or alleviated as the dianeticist chose and timepermitted. All could have been cleared with an additional average of 100 or so hours for eachof the persons who were alleviated. In short, on random cases -- and selected cases so that atleast two of each classification of neurosis or psychosis was included in the clearing -- whenprenatal engrams and birth were taken into account and used in therapy, results were obtained.When these factors were not taken into account, results were no more favorable than thoseattained in the best successes of past schools -- which is not nearly good enough for a scienceof mind.Dianetics had prenatal and birth engrams wished off on it as facts existing in the natureof things. That past schools have been passing over these engrams and into the prenatal areawithout success does not mean that prenatals could not be found any more than it means thatthese past schools found much value in prenatal experience when they considered it at all. Theproblem is slightly more complex: the difficulty lay in finding the reactive bank which wasoccluded by “unconsciousness” which had never before been penetrated wittingly as“unconsciousness.” The discovery of this reactive bank led to the discovery of prenatalengrams, which are quite different from “prenatal memory.”After a few cases had been examined as to objective and subjective reality dianetics wasforced to accept, if it wished a clear, the fact that the cells of the foetus record. A few morecases and a little more experience discovered that the embryo cells record. And suddenly it wasdiscovered that recording begins in the cells of the zygote -- which is to say, with conception.That the body recalls conception, which is a high level survival activity, has little to do withengrams. Most patients to date sooner or later startle themselves by finding themselvesswimming up a channel or waiting to be connected with. The recording is there. And there’slittle use arguing with a pre-clear that he cannot recall being a sperm, engramic or not as thecase may be. It must be remarked because any dianeticist will encounter this.Anyone postulating that “return to the womb” was an ambition should have examinedlife in the womb a little more carefully. Even a poor scientist would have at least tried to findout if anybody could recall it before he made a statement that there was a memory of it. But lifein the womb does not seem to be the Paradise it has been poetically, if not scientifically,represented. Actuality discloses that three men and a horse in a telephone booth would have butlittle less room than an unborn baby. The womb is wet, uncomfortable and unprotected.Mama sneezes, baby gets knocked “unconscious.” Mama runs lightly and blithely intoa table and baby gets its head stoved in. Mama has constipation and baby, in the anxious effort,gets squashed. Papa becomes passionate and baby has the sensation of being put into a runningwashing machine. Mama gets hysterical, baby gets an engram. Papa hits Mama, baby gets anengram. Junior bounces on Mama’s lap, baby gets an engram. And so it goes.People have scores of prenatal engrams when they are normal. They can have morethan two hundred. And each one is aberrative. Each contains pain and “unconsciousness.”Engrams received as a zygote are potentially the most aberrative, being wholly reactive.Those received as an embryo are intensely aberrative. Those received as the foetus are enoughto send people to institutions all by themselves.88"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"Zygote, embryo, foetus, infant, child, adult: these are all the same person. Time hasbeen considered the Great Healer. That can be filed with the things “everybody knew.” On aconscious level it may be true. But on a reactive level Time is nothing. The engram, wheneverreceived, is strong in proportion to the degree it is restimulated.The mechanism of an engram has an interesting feature. It is not “reasoned” or analyzednor does it have any meaning until it has been keyed-in. A baby before speech could have anengram in restimulation but that engram must have been keyed-in by the analytical data thebaby has.The reactive mind steals meaning from the analytical mind. An engram is just so manywave-recordings until it is keyed-in, and those recordings, by such restimulation, becomeeffective upon the analytical mind. It may be that the engram never has any reason or meaningin itself but only thrusts its waves forward as unreasoned things at the body and analyzer, andthe body and analyzer, through mechanisms, give them meaning. In other words, the engramis not a sentient recording containing meanings. It is merely a series of impressions such as aneedle might make on wax. These impressions are meaningless to the body until the engramkeys-in, at which time aberrations and psycho-somatics occur.Thus it can be understood that the prenatal child has no remotest idea of what is beingsaid in terms of words, It does learn, being an organism, that certain things may mean certaindangers. But this is every bit as far as it goes with recording. The mind must become more orless fully formed before the engram can impinge into the analytical level.The prenatal child can, of course, experience terror. When the parents or theprofessional abortionist start after it and thrust it full of holes, it knows fear and pain. It has,however, this prenatal child, an advantage in its situation. Being surrounded by amniotic fluidand dependent for nutrition on its mother, being in a state of growth and easily reformedphysically, it can repair an enormous amount of damage and does. The recovery qualities of thehuman body are never higher than before birth. Damage which would maim an infant for life orwould kill a grown man can be taken in stride by the prenatal child. Not that this damage doesnot make an engram -- it certainly does, complete with all data and speech and emotion -- butthat this damage does not easily kill it is the point here.Why people try to abort children is a problem which has its answer only in aberration,for it is very difficult to abort a child. One can say that in the attempt the mother herself is inmore danger of dying than the child, no matter what method is used.A society which suppresses sex as evil and which is so aberrated that any member of itwill attempt an abortion is a society which is dooming itself to ever-rising insanity. For it is ascientific fact that abortion attempts are the most important factor in aberration. The child onwhom the abortion is attempted is condemned to live with murderers whom he reactivelyknows to be murderers through all his weak and helpless youth! He forms unreasonableattachments to grandparents, has terrified reactions to all punishments, grows ill easily andsuffers long. And there is no such thing as a guaranteed way to abort a child. Usecontraceptives, not a knitting needle or the douche bag, to hold down population. Once thechild is conceived, no matter how “shameful” the circumstances, no matter the mores, nomatter the income, that man or woman who would attempt an abortion on an unborn child isattempting a murder which will seldom succeed and is laying the foundation of a childhood ofillness and heartache. Anyone attempting an abortion is committing an act against the wholesociety and the future; any judge or doctor recommending an abortion should be instantlydeprived of position and practice, whatever his “reason.”If a person knows he has committed this crime against a child who has been born, heshould do all possible to have that child “cleared” as soon as possible after the age of eight andin the meantime should treat that child with all the decency and courtesy possible in order tokeep the engram out of restimulation. Otherwise he may send that child to an institution for theinsane.89"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"A large proportion of allegedly feeble-minded children are actually attempted abortioncases, whose engrams place them in fear paralysis or regressive palsy and which commandthem not to grow but to be where they are forever.However many billions America spends yearly on institutions for the insane and jailsfor the criminals are spent primarily because of attempted abortions done by some sex-blockedmother to whom children are a curse, not a blessing of God.Antipathy toward children means a blocked second dynamic. Physiological examinationof anyone with such blockage will demonstrate a physical derangement of the genitalia orglands. Dianetic therapy would demonstrate attempted abortion or an equally foul prenatalexistence and would clear the individual.The case of the child who, as this is read, is not yet born but upon whom abortion hasbeen attempted, is not hopeless. If he is treated with decency after he is born and if he is notrestimulated by witnessing quarrels, he will wax and grow fat until he is eight and can becleared, at which time he will probably be much startled to learn the truth But that startlementand any antagonism included in it will vanish with the finishing of the clear and his love of hisparents will be greater than before.All these things are scientific facts, tested and rechecked and tested again. And withthem can be produced a clear on whom our racial future depends. 90"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIIIContagion of AberrationDisease is contagious. Germs, traveling from one individual to another, wanderthrough an entire society, respecting none until stopped by such things as sulfa or penicillin.Aberrations are contagious. Like germs they respect none and carry forward fromindividual to individual, from parents to child, respecting none until they are stopped bydianetics.The people of yesterday supposed that genetic insanity must exist, for it could beobserved that the children of aberrated parents were often themselves aberrated. There isgenetic insanity but it is limited to the case of actually missing parts. A very small percentage ofinsanity falls into such a category and its manifestation is mental dullness or failure tocoordinate and beyond these has no aberrative quality whatever (such people receive engramswhich complicate their cases).The contagion of aberration is too simple in principle to be much labored here. Indianetics we learn that only moments of “unconsciousness,” short or long and of greater orlesser depth, can contain engrams. When a person is rendered “unconscious,” people in hisvicinity react more or less at the dictates of their engrams: in fact, the “unconsciousness” isquite ordinarily caused by somebody’s dramatization. A clear, then, could be renderedunconscious by an aberree who is dramatizing and the aberree’s dramatization of his engramwould enter as an engram into the clear.The mechanics are simple.People under stress, if aberrated, dramatize engrams. Such dramatization may involvethe injury of another person and render him more or less “unconscious.” The “unconscious”person then receives as an engram the dramatization.This is not the only way contagion of aberration gets about. People on operating tables,under anaesthetic, are subjected to the more or less aberrated conversation of those present.This conversation enters into the “unconscious” person as an engram. Similarly, at the scene ofaccidents, the emergency nature of the experience may excite people into dramatizations, and ifa person is “unconscious” because of the accident, an engram is received.Aberrated parents are certain to infect their children with engrams. The father andmother, in dramatizing their own engrams around sick or injured children, pass them along justas certainly as if those engrams were bacteria. This does not mean that the total reactive bank ofa child is composed solely of the parents’ engrams, for there are many exterior influences to thehome which can enter into the child when it is “unconscious.” And it does not mean that thechild is going to react to the same engrams the way either parent might react, for the child, afterall, is an individual with an inherent personality, a power of choice and a different experiencepattern. But it does mean that it is utterly inevitable that aberrated parents will in some wayaberrate their children.Misconceptions and poor data in a society’s culture become engrams because not all theconduct around an “unconscious” person is dramatization. If some society believed that fish-eating brought on leprosy, it is quite certain that this false datum would find its way intoengrams and sooner or later some one would develop a leprosy-like disease after having eatenfish.Primitive societies, being subject to much mauling by the elements, have many moreoccasions for injury than civilized societies. Further, such primitive societies are alive withfalse data. Further, their practice of medicine and mental healing is on a very aberrative level by91"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"itself. The number of engrams in a Zulu would be astonishing. Moved out of his restimulativearea and taught English he would escape the penalty of much of his reactive data; but in hisnative habitat the Zulu is only outside the bars of a madhouse because there are no madhousesprovided by his tribe. It is a safe estimate and one based on better experience than is generallyavailable to those who base conclusions on “modern man” by studying primitive races thatprimitives are far more aberrated than civilized peoples. Their savageness, theirunprogressiveness, their incidence of illness all stem from their reactive patterns, not from theirinherent personalities. Measuring one set of aberrees by another set of aberrees is not likely tolead to much data. And the contagion of aberration, being much greater in a primitive tribe, andthe falsity of the superstitious data in the engrams of such a tribe both lead to a conclusionwhich, observed on the scene, is carried out by actuality.Contagion of aberration is very easily studied in the process of clearing any aberreewhose parents fought. Mother, for instance, might be relatively unaberrated at the beginningof the marriage. If she is beaten by her husband who is, after all, dramatizing, she will begin topick up his aberrations as part of her own reactive pattern. This is particularly noticeable whenone is clearing a person who was conceived shortly after his parents’ marriage or before it.Papa may begin with a certain dramatization which includes beating a wife. Whatever he saysin such a dramatization will sooner or later begin to affect the wife and she may -- unlessextraordinarily well balanced -- begin to dramatize these things on her own. Eventually, whenthe child is born, she will begin to dramatize on the child, thus putting him into a continual stateof restimulation.Birth is one of the most remarkable engrams in terms of contagion. Here the motherand child both receive the same engram which differs only in the location of pain and thedepths of “unconsciousness.” Whatever the doctors, nurses and other people associated withthe delivery say to the mother during labor and birth and immediately afterwards before thechild is taken away is recorded in the reactive bank, making an identical engram in both motherand child.This engram is remarkably destructive in several ways. The mother’s voice canrestimulate the birth engram in the child and the presence of the child can restimulate the giving-birth engram in the mother. Thus they are mutually restimulative. In view of the fact that theyhave all the other restimulators also in common a later life situation can cause them each tosuffer simultaneously from the engram. If birth included a slammed window, a slammedwindow may trigger birth dramatization in both, simultaneously, with resultant hostilities orapathies.Should a doctor become angry or despairing, the emotional tone of birth can be severe.And if the doctor talks at all, the conversation takes on its full reactive literal meaning to bothmother and child.Many cases were cleared where both mother and child were available. One such casefound the mother (as heard by the child in dianetic clearing) moaning, “I’m so ashamed, I’m soashamed,” over and over. The child had a neurosis about shame. When the mother wascleared, it was found that her mother at birth was moaning, “I’m so ashamed, I’m soashamed.” One can presume that this has been going along, by contagion, since Cheops builthis tomb.In the larger sphere of society contagion of aberration is extremely dangerous andcannot but be considered as a vital factor in undermining the health of that society.The social body behaves similarly to an organism in that there are social aberrationswhich exist within the society. The society grows and may fade like an organism which haspeople, not cells, for its parts. Where pain is leveled by the head of the society at any memberin that society, a source of aberration is begun which will be contagious. The reasons againstcorporal punishment are not “humanitarian,” they are practical. A society which practicespunishment of any kind against any of its members is carrying on a contagion of aberration.92"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The society has a social engram, society size, which says punishment is necessary.Punishment is meted. The jails and institutions fill. And then one day some portion of thesociety, depressed into Zone 1 by a government’s freedom with government engrams, jumpsup and wipes the government out. And a new set of aberrations is formed from the violenceattending the destruction. Violent revolutions never win because they begin this cycle ofaberration.A society filled with aberrees may feel it necessary to punish. There has been noremedy other than punishment. The provision of a remedy for unsocial conduct by members ofthe group is of more than passing interest to a government for a continuance of its owncorporal practices; adding these to the continuing aberrations of the past seriously depresses thesurvival potential of that government and will some day cause that government to fall. Aftermany governments so fall, its people too perish from this earth.Contagion of aberration is never more apparent than in that social insanity called war.Wars never solve the need of wars. Fight to save the world for democracy or save it fromConfucianism and the fight is inevitably lost by all. War has become associated in the past withcompetition, and it has been believed, therefore, by shifty logic, that wars were necessary. Asociety which advances into a war as a solution of its problems cannot but depress its ownsurvival potential. No government was ever permitted to enter a war without costing its peoplesome of their liberties. The end product is the apathy of a ruling priesthood, where mystery andsuperstition alone can band the insane remnants of a people together. This is too easilyobserved in past histories to need much amplification. A democracy engaging in war hasalways lost some of its democratic rights. As it engages in more and more wars, it eventuallycomes under the command of a dictator (rule by a single engram). The dictator, forcing hisrule, increases the aberrations by his activity against minorities. Revolt begins to follow revolt.Priesthoods flourish. Apathy awaits. And after apathy comes death. So went Greece, so wentRome. So goes England. So goes Russia. And so goes the United States and with it goesMankind.Rule by force is a violation of the law of affinity for force begets force. Rule by forcereduces the self-determinism of the individuals in a society and therefore the self-determinismof the society itself. Contagion of aberration sweeps along like a forest fire. Engrams begetengrams. And unless the dwindling spiral is interrupted by new lands and mongrel races whichescape their aberrative environments, or by the arrival of a means to break the contagion ofaberration by clearing individuals, a race will reach downward to the end of the cycle -- Zone0.A race is as great as its individual members are self-determined.In the smaller sphere of the family, as in the national scenes, contagion of aberrationproduces an interruption of optimum survival.Self-determinism is the only possible way a computer can be built to give rationalanswers. Holding down seven in an adding machine causes it to give wrong answers.Entering fixed and not-to-be-rationalized answers into any human being will cause himto compute wrong answers. Survival depends on right answers. Engrams enter from theexterior world into the hidden recesses below rational thinking and prevent rational answersbeing reached. This is exterior-determinism. Any interference with self-determinism cannot butlead to wrong computations.In that a clear is cooperative, a society of clears would cooperate. This may be anidyllic, Utopian dream and it may not be. In a family of clears there is observable harmony andcooperation. A clear can recognize a superior computation when he sees one. He does not haveto be slugged and held down and made to obey to make him put a shoulder to the wheel. If heis made to obey, independent of his thinking, his self-determinism is interrupted to a pointwhere he cannot get right answers; the society which holds him has penalized itself his abilityto think and act rationally. The only way a clear could so be forced would be to give him93"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"engrams or turn a neuro-surgeon loose upon his brain. But a clear does not need to be forcedfor if the job is important enough to do in terms of general need, he will most certainly do itaccording to his intelligence and do it as well as possible. One never observes the forcedindividual doing a job well, just as one never observes a forced society winning against anequally prosperous free society.A family which runs on the godhead plan, where somebody must be obeyed withoutquestion, is never a happy family. Its prosperity may be present in some material aspects but itsapparent survival as a unit is superficial.Forced groups are invariably less efficient than free groups working for the commongood. But any group which contains aberrated members is likely to become entirely aberratedas a group through contagion. The effort to restrain aberrated members of a group inevitablyrestrains the group as a whole and leads to further and further restraint.Clearing one member of a family of aberrees is seldom enough to resolve the problemsof that family. If the husband has been aberrated, he will have aberrated or restimulated hiswife and children in one way or another, even when he used no physical violence upon them.The parents implant their mutual aberrations in the children and the children, being potentiallyself-determined units, revolt back to stir up the aberrations of the parents. In that so many ofthese aberrations, by contagion, have become mutual and held in common with the wholefamily, the happiness of the family is severely undermined.The corporal punishment of children is just another facet of the problem of the forcedgroup. If any one cares to argue over the necessity of punishing children, let him examine thesource of the misbehavior of the children.The child who is aberrated may not have his engrams entirely keyed-in. He may have towait until he himself is married and has children or a pregnant wife to have restimulatorsenough to cause him to become, suddenly, one of these things they call a “mature adult” blindto the beauty of the world and burdened by all its griefs. But the child is nevertheless aberratedand has many dramatizations. The child is in a very unlucky situation in that he has with himhis two most powerful restimulators -- his mother and father. These assume the power ofphysical punishment over him. And they are giants to him. He is a pygmy. And he has todepend upon them for food, clothing and shelter. One can speak very grandly about the“delusions of childhood” until he knows the engram background of most children.The child is on the unkind receiving end of all the dramatizations of his parents. Acleared child is a most remarkable thing to observe: he is human! Affinity alone can pull himthrough. The spoiled child is the child whose decisions have been interrupted continuously andwho is robbed of his independence. Affection could no more spoil a child than the sun could beput out by a bucket of gasoline.The beginning and end of “child psychology” is that a child is a human being, that he isentitled to his dignity and self-determinism. The child of aberrated parents is a problem becauseof the contagion of aberration and because he is denied any right to dramatize or counter. Thewonder is not that children are a problem but that they are sane in any action for, by contagion,punishment, and denial of self-determinism the children of today have been denied all thethings required to make a rational life. And these are the future family and the future race.This is not a dissertation on children or politics, however, but a chapter on contagion ofaberration. Dianetics covers human thought, and human thought is wide ground. When onegazes at the potentialities inherent in the mechanism of contagion, respect for the inherentstability of Man cannot but arise. No “wild animal” reacting with inherent “asocial tendencies”could have built Nineveh or Boulder Dam. Carrying the contagion mechanism like some OldMan of the Sea, we have yet come far. Now that we know it, perhaps we shall truly reach thestars. 94"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IXKeying-in the EngramThe single source of inorganic mental illness and organic psycho-somatic illness is thereactive engram bank. The reactive mind impinges these engrams upon the analytical mind andthe organism whenever they are restimulated after being keyed-in.There are many known incidents in a lifetime which apparently have a profoundinfluence upon the happiness and mental condition of the individual. The individual remembersthese and to them attributes his troubles. In a measure he is right: he is at least looking back atincidents which are held in place by engrams. He does not see the engrams. In fact, unless heis acquainted with dianetics, he does not know the engrams are there. And even then he willnot know their contents until he has undergone therapy.It can be demonstrated with ease that any moment of “conscious level” unhappinesswhich contained great stress or emotion was not guilty of the charge of causing aberration andpsycho-somatic illness. These moments, of course, played a role in the matter: they were thekey-ins.The process of keying-in an engram is not very complex. Engram 105, let us say, wasa moment of “unconsciousness” when the prenatal child was struck via Mother, by Father. Thefather, aware or not of the child, uttered the words, “God damn you, you filthy whore: you’reno good!” This engram lay where it was impressed, in the reactive bank. Now it could lie therefor seventy years and never become keyed-in. It contains a headache and a falling body and thegrating of teeth and the intestinal sounds of the mother. And any of these sounds, post-birth,may be present in large quantities without keying-in this engram.One day, however, the father becomes exasperated at the child. The child is tired andfeverish, which is to say that his analytical mind may not be at its highest level of activity. Andthe father has a certain set of engrams which he dramatizes and one of these engrams is theabove incident. And the father reaches out and slaps the child and says, “God damn you:you’re no good!” The child cries. That night he has a headache and is much worse physically.And he feels both an intense hatred and a fear of his father. The engram has keyed-in. Now thesound of a falling body or grating teeth or any trace of anger of any kind in the father’s voicewill make the child nervous. His physical health will suffer. He will begin to have headaches.If we take this child who has now become an adult and rake back over his past, weshall discover (though it may be occluded) a lock like the above key-in. And now not only thekey-in; we may discover half a hundred, half a thousand, such locks just on this one subject.One would say, unless he knew dianetics, that this child was ruined post-natally by beingbeaten by the father, and one might attempt to bring the patient’s mind back into bettercondition by removing these locks.There are literally thousands, tens of thousands of locks in the average life. To take allof these locks away would be a task for Hercules. Every engram a person has, if it has beenkeyed-in, may have its hundreds of locks.If conditioning existed as a mechanism of pain and stress, Mankind would be in verybad condition. Fortunately conditioning does not so exist. It appears to exist but theappearance is not the fact. One would think that if a child were daily thrust around and reviledhe would eventually becomed conditioned into a belief that this was the way life was and thathe had better turn against it.Conditioning does not, however, exist. Pavlov may have been able to drive dogs madby repeated experiments: this was simply bad observation on the part of the observer. The dogsmight be trained to do this or that.95"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"But it was not conditioning. The dogs went mad because they were given engrams ifand when they did go mad. A series of such experiments, properly conducted and observed,proves this contention.The boy who was daily told he was no good and who apparently went into a declinesolely because of that declined only because of the engram. This is a happy fact. The engrammay take a while to locate -- a few hours -- but when it is alleviated or refiled in the standardmemory banks, everything which had locked on to it also refiles.People trying to help others with their aberrations who did not know about engramswere, of course, operating with 2.9 strikes against any success. In the first place, the locksthemselves may vanish down into the reactive bank. Thus we get a patient who says, “Oh, myfather wasn’t so bad. He was a pretty good guy.” And we discovered, and the patientdiscovers, when an engram is sprung, that father was customarily to be found dramatizing.What the patient knows about his past before engrams are sprung is not worth cataloguing. Inanother case we may find a patient saying, “Oh, I had a terrible childhood, a terrible childhood.I was beaten seriously.” And we discover, when we get the engrams refiled, that the parents ofthis patient never laid a hand on him in punishment or wrath in his entire life.An engram may coast along without being keyed-in for decades. One of the mostremarkable types of case is one which spent an entire youth without displaying any aberration.Then suddenly, at the age of twenty-six, we discover him to be so aberrated, so suddenly, thatit appears he must have been hexed. Perhaps most of his engrams were concerned with theaction of getting married and having children. He has never been married before. The first timehe is weary or ill and realizes he has a wife on his hands, the first engram keys-in. Then thedwindling spiral begins to go to work. This one shuts down the analyzer enough so that otherscan be keyed-in. And finally we may discover him in an institution.The young girl who has been happy and carefree to the age of thirteen and thensuddenly goes into a decline has not, that moment, received an engram. She has had an engramkey-in which let another key-in. Fission reaction. This key-in may have required nothing morethan the discovery that she was bleeding from the vagina. She has an emotional engram aboutthis; she becomes frantic. The other engrams, as the days follow, may swing into position toimpinge upon her. And so she becomes ill.The first sexual experience may be one which keys-in an engram. This is so standardthat sex has gotten a rather bad name for itself here and there as being an aberrative factor all byitself. Sex is not and never has been aberrative. Physical pain and emotion which incidentallycontain sex as a subject are the aberrative factors.It may be that a patient is urgent in her insistence that her father raped her when she wasnine and that this is the cause of all her misery. Large numbers of insane patients claim this.And it is perfectly true. Father did rape her, but it happened she was only nine days beyondconception at the time. The pressure and upset of coitus is very uncomfortable to the child andnormally can be expected to give the child an engram which will have as its content the sexualact and everything that was said.Drug hypnosis is dangerous when one is trying to treat psychotics as has beenmentioned. And there are other reasons it is dangerous. Any operation under anaesthetic or anydrugging of a patient may bring about the keying-in of engrams. Here is the analyzer shutdown, there is the reactive bank open to be stirred by any comment made by the people aroundthe drugged subject.Hypnotism itself is a condition in which engrams may be keyed-in which have neverbefore been restimulated: the glassy-eyed stare of the person who has been “too oftenhypnotized,” the lack of will seen in people too often hypnotized, the dependence of the subjectupon the hypnotic operator, all these things stem from the keying-in of engrams. Any time thebody is rendered “unconscious” without physical pain, no matter how light the degree of96"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"“unconsciousness” is, even if it is only the lightness of weariness, an engram may be keyed-in.And when “unconsciousness” is complicated by new physical pain, a new engram is formedwhich may gather up with it an entire bundle of old engrams not hitherto keyed-in. Such a lateengram would be a “cross-engram” in that it crosses chains of engrams. And if such an engramresulted in a loss of sanity, it would be called a “break-engram.”There are some aspects to various drug “unconsciousnesses” which have been veryperplexing in the past. Psychotic women often maintain, after they are awakened from adrugged sleep (and sometimes a hypnotic sleep), that they have been raped. Men occasionallymaintain that the operator has tried to perform a homosexual act upon them while they weredrugged. Although it occasionally occurs that people are raped after being drugged, the largestnumber of such assertions are merely an aspect of the key-in mechanism. Almost any child hasbeen put through the prenatal discomfort of coitus. Often there was violent emotion other thanpassion present. Such an engram may stay out of circuit for years until drugged“unconsciousness” or some such thing keys it in. The patient goes to sleep without a keyed-inengram; he wakes up with one. He tries to justify the strange sensations he has (and engramsare timeless things unless they are arranged properly on the time track) and comes out with the“solution” that he must have been raped.Childhood rapes are very seldom the responsible cause in sexual aberration. They arethe key-in.One looks at the conscious-level locks and sees sadness, mental anguish andmisfortune. Some of the experience there seems to be so terrible that it must certainly causeaberration. But it does not. Man is a tough, resilient creature. These conscious-levelexperiences are at best only guide-posts leading toward the actual seat of trouble, and that is notknown in any detailed way to the individual.The engram is never “computed.” An example of this, on a lightly aberrative level, canbe found in a child’s punishment. If one examines a childhood where punishment has beencorporal and frequent, he begins to understand the utter futility of the pain-drive theory.Punishment actually and literally and emphatically does no good of any kind whatsoever butaccomplishes quite the reverse, since it occasions a reactive revolt against the punishmentsource and is likely to cause not only a disintegration of a mind but also a continualbedevilment of the punishment source. Man reacts to fight sources of pain. When he stopsfighting them he is mentally broken and of little use to anyone, much less himself.We take a case of a boy who was beaten with a hair-brush every time he was “bad.” Inresearching this case the most searching inquiry fails to reveal any vivid recall of why he waspunished but only that he was punished. The progress of the event would go something likethis: activity more or less rational, fright at threatened punishment, punishment, sorrow overpunishment, renewed activity. The mechanics of the case showed the person to have beenengaged on some activity which, whether others would consider it so or not, was neverthelesssurvival activity to him, giving him either pleasure or actual gains or even the assertion that hecould and would survive; the moment punishment is threatened old punishments go intorestimulation as minor engrams, resting usually on major engrams: this shuts down theanalytical power to some extent and the recording is now being done on a reactive level; thepunishment takes place, submerging analytical awareness so that the punishment records in theengram bank only; the sorrow following is still in the period of analytical shut-down; theanalyzer gradually turns on; full awareness returns, and then activity on an analytical plane canbe resumed. All corporal punishment runs this gamut and all other punishments are, at best,locks, following this same pattern with only the complete shut-down resulting from painmissing.If the analyzer wants this data for computation, it is not available. There is a reaction inthe reactive mind when the matter is approached. But there are five courses the reactive mindcan take with this data! And there is no guarantee and no method between land and sky ofknowing what course the reactive mind will take with the data except knowing the full engram97"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"bank -- and if that is known, the person could be cleared with a few more hours work andwould need no punishment.These five ways of handling data make corporal punishment an unstable and unreliablething. A ratio exists which can be tested and proven in any man’s experience: A man is evil inthe direct ratio that destructiveness has been leveled against him. An individual (including thoseindividuals society is liable to forget as individuals: children) reacts against the punishmentsource whether that source be parents or government. Anything which sets itself forwardagainst an individual as a punishment source will be considered in greater or lesser degree (as itis in proportion to benefits) as a target for the reactions of the individual.The little accidental milk glass upsets of children, that noise which just accidentallyoccurs on the porch where the children are playing, that little accidental ruination of Papa’s hator Mama’s rug, these are often cold, calculated reactive mind actions against pain sources. Theanalytical mind may temporize about love and affection and the need of three square meals. Thereactive mind runs off the lessons it has learned and devil take the meals.If one turned an idiot loose on an adding machine to let him audit the company booksand let him prevent the auditor from touching equipment and data which has to be his if anyanswers will be right, one would get very little in the way of correct answers. And if one keptfeeding the idiot and made him fat and powerful, the firm would sooner or later go to ruin. Thereactive mind is the idiot, the auditor is “I” and the firm is the organism. Punishment feeds theidiot.The helpless amazement of police about the “confirmed criminal” (and the police beliefin the “criminal type” and the “criminal mind”) comes about through this cycle. Police, forsome reason or other, like governments, have become identified with society. Take any one ofthese “criminals” and clear him and the society regains a rational being of which it can use all itcan get. Keep up the punishment cycle and the prisons will get more numerous and more full.The problem of the child lashing back at his parents by “negation” and the problem ofJimmie the Cob blowing a bank guard apart in an armed robbery stem both from the samemechanism. The child, examined on the “conscious-level,” is not aware of his causes but willput forth various justifications for his conduct. Jimmie the Cob, waiting for this oh so verysentient society to tie him down with straps in an electric chair and give him an electric shocktherapy which will cause him to cease and desist forever, examined for his causes, will pourforth justifications to explain his life and conduct. The human mind is a pretty wonderfulcomputing machine. The reasons it can evolve for unreasonable acts have staggered one and alland particularly social workers. Without knowing the cause and the mechanism, the chancesof drawing a correct conclusion by comparing all conducts available are as remote as winningat fantan from a Chinese. Hence, the punishments have continued as the muddled answer to avery muddled society.There are five ways in which a human being reacts toward a source of danger. Theseare also the five courses he can take on any given problem. And it might be said that this isfive-valued action.The parable of the black panther* is appropriate here. Let us suppose that a particularlyblack-tempered black panther is sitting on the stairs and that a man named Gus is sitting in theliving room. Gus wants to go to bed. But there is the black panther. The problem is to getupstairs. There are five things that Gus can do about this panther: (1) he can go attack the blackpanther; (2) he can run out of the house and flee the black panther; (3) he can use the backstairs and avoid the black panther; (4) he can neglect the black panther; and (5) he can succumbto the black panther.These are the five mechanisms: attack, flee, avoid, neglect or succumb.98"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"All actions can be seen to fall within these courses. And all actions are visible in life. Inthe case of a punishment course, the reactive mind can succumb, neglect, avoid, flee or attackit. The action is dictated by a complexity of engrams and depends upon which one comes intorestimulation. This maelstrom of reaction generally resolves itself, however, in one of the fivecourses. * In dianetics considerable slang has been developed by patients and dianeticists andthey call the “black panther mechanism” a neglect of the problem. One supposes this stemsfrom the ridiculousness of biting black panthers. If a child is punished and thereafter obeys, he can be considered to have succumbed.And the value of a child who will succumb to punishment is so slight that the Spartans wouldlong since have drowned him, for it means he has sunk into an apathy unless it so happens thathe himself has computed the idea, by-passing all reaction, that the thing for which he waspunished was not bright (he can’t be assisted in this computation if punishment is entered intothe reactive mind by the source trying to assist him). He can flee the punishment source, whichat least is not apathy but merely cowardice by popular judgment. He can neglect the matterentirely and ignore the punishment source -- and would have been called a Stoic by theancients, but might be called merely dull-witted by his friends. He can avoid the punishmentsource, which might give him the doubtful compliment of being sly or cunning or pandering.Or he can attack the punishment source either by direct action or by upsetting or fouling theperson or the possessions of the source -- in which instance he would be called, on directaction, a valiant fool, taking parental size into account, or in a less direct fashion he could becalled “covertly hostile” or could be said to be “negating”; as long as a human being will attackas a response to a valid threat, he can be said to be in fair mental condition -- “normal” -- and achild is said to be “just acting like any normal child.”Enter punishment into the computation and it no longer computes. It is entirely differentin the case of “experience.” Life has plenty of painful experience waiting for any human beingwithout other human beings complicating the score. A person who is still unblocked in hisdynamics or who has been unblocked by dianetics can absorb the most amazing amount ofhammering in the business of living. Here, even when the reactive receives engrams as a resultof some of this experience, the analytical mind can continue to cope with the situation withoutbecoming aberrated in any way. Man is a tough, resilient, competent character. But when thelaw of affinity begins to be broken and such a breaking of affinity gets into the reactive bank,human beings, as antagonistic sources of non-survival, become a punishment source. If nocontra-survival engrams involving human beings are in the earlier (before 5 years) content ofthe engram bank, pro-survival engrams are taken as a matter of course and are not severelyaberrative. In other words, it is the breaking of affinity with his fellows on an engramic levelwhich most solidly blocks the dynamics. Man’s affinity with Man is far more a scientific factthan it is a poetic and idyllic idea.The cycle, then, of life which will be “normal” (current average state) or psychotic is aneasy thing to draw. It begins with a large number of engrams before birth, it gathers more inthe dependent and rather helpless condition post-birth. Punishment of various kinds enteringnow as locks key-in the engrams. New engrams which will involve the earlier ones enter. Newlocks accumulate. Illness and aberrated action set in most certainly by the age of forty or fifty.And death ensues sometimes afterwards.Short of the optimum solution of clearing the engrams, there are several things whichcan be done about aberration and psycho-somatic ills. That these methods are uncertain and ofonly limited value does not mean that they will not occasionally meet with some astonishinglybeneficial responses.Such methods can be classified under the headings of environmental change, educationand physical treatment. Taking factors out of the environment of an aberree or taking theaberree out of the environment in which he is unhappy or ineffective can bring about someastonishingly swift recoveries: this is valid therapy; it removes the restimulators from theindividual or takes the individual away from the restimulators. It is ordinarily quite hit-or-missand more miss than hit, and it will not remove all the restimulators by nine-tenths since the99"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"individual himself carries the bulk of these around with him or is compelled to contact them.One is reminded of a case which had severe asthma. He had received it in a very severe birthengram; his frantic parents carried him to every mountain asthma resort suggested and spenttens of thousands of dollars in these jauntings. When this patient was cleared and the engramrefiled, it was discovered that the restimulator for his asthma was clean, cold air! The onlycertainty in the environment approach is that a sickly child will recover when removed fromrestimulative parents and taken where he is loved and feels safe -- for his sickness is theinevitable result of restimulation of prenatal engrams by one or the other or both his parents.Somewhere along the line there is probably a husband or a wife who has descended chronicallyinto the first two zones after marriage after having married pseudo-mother or pseudo-father orpseudo-abortionist.In the educational field, new data or enthusiasms may very well key-out engrams byoverbalancing the reactive mind in the light of a new analytical surge. If a man can simply beconvinced he has been fighting shadows or if he can be persuaded to hang his fears on someindicated cause, whether that cause is true or not, he can be benefited. Sometimes he can be“educated” into a strong faith in some deity or cult which will cause him to feel so invulnerablethat he rises above his engrams. Raising his survival potential in any way will raise his generaltone to a point where it is no longer on a par with the reactive bank. Giving him an education inengineering or music, where he can receive a higher level of respect, will often defend himfrom his restimulators. A rise to a position of esteem is actually a change of environment, but itis also educational since he is now taught he is valuable. If a man can be made busy at a hobbyor work by personal or exterior education that it is good for him, another mechanism comesinto being -- the analytical mind becomes so engrossed that it takes to itself more and moreenergy for its activity and begins to align with a new purpose.Physical treatment resulting in improved physical condition will bring about hope orchange a man’s reactions by shifting him on his time track. It may key-out engrams.These methods are valid therapy: they are also, in reverse, the things which causeaberrations to manifest themselves. There are wrong ways to act and wrong things to do andwrong ways to treat men which, in the light of what we know now, are criminal.Thrusting a man into an environment which restimulates him and making him stay thereis a slice of murder. Making him keep an associate who is restimulative is bad: making a manor a woman stay with a marriage partner who is restimulative is unworkable mores unlessdianetic therapy is used; making a child stay in a home where he is restimulated is mostcertainly inhibitive, not only of his happiness but of his mental and physical development -- achild should have many more rights about such things, more places to go.On the physical therapy level anything as violent as surgery or exodontistry in thepsycho-somatic plane is utter barbarism in the light of dianetics. “Toothache” is normallypsycho-somatic. Organic illnesses enough to fill several catalogues are psycho-somatic. Norecourse to surgery of any kind should be had until it is certain that the ailment is not psycho-somatic or that the illness will not diminish by itself if the potency of the reactive mind isreduced. Mental-physical therapy is too ridiculous, with the source of aberration now ascience, to be seriously mentioned. For no thinking doctor or psychiatrist possessed of thisinformation would touch another electrode for electric shock therapy or even glance at a scalpelor ice-pick to perform an operation on the pre-frontal lobes of the brain unless that doctor orpsychiatrist is himself so thoroughly aberrated that the act springs, not from any desire to healbut from the most utter and craven sadism to which engrams can bring a man.** Many persons investigating the treatment of the mentally ill by psychiatrists and others incharge of mental institutions are prompted, when they discover just what the pre-frontallobotomy, the trans-orbital leukotomy and electric shock actually do to patients, to revile thepsychiatrist as unworthy of trust and accuse him of using it to conduct vivisection experimentson human beings. That any possible hope of recovery via dianetics may be gone for theseunfortunate patients in the majority of cases should not be blamed upon the psychiatrist and100"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"neuro-surgeon. These people have only followed their teachings in various universities andhave practiced such actions merely because they believed the problem of the mind could not besolved by anyone. A witch-burning attitude toward these people is very far from the oneadopted by dianetics. Pointing to the fact that they have murdered minds which wouldotherwise have recovered, labeling them “mind snatchers” and making a horror story out oftheir actions is far from rational conduct. On the whole these people have been entirely sincerein their efforts to help the insane. By contagion of aberration such people have been subjectedto enormous stresses in this work, having had their own engrams in continual restimulation.They can be cleared and their experience is valuable. Legislation against them such as thatrecently mentioned by a senator who was familiar with dianetics, horror stories about them innewspapers and a general public antipathy as well as the medical doctor’s traditional distrust ofthem cannot but bring about a disorderly condition. Dianetics is a newly discovered science andis nonpartisan. 101"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XPreventive DianeticsThere are many branches in dianetics. It is actually a family of sciences covered by asingle set of axioms. There is, for instance, Educational Dianetics, which contains the body oforganized knowledge necessary to train minds to their optimum efficiency and to an optimumof skill and knowledge in the various branches of the works of Man. And there is PoliticalDianetics, which embraces the field of group activity and organization to establish the optimumconditions and processes of leadership and inter-group relations. And again there is MedicalDianetics. And there is Social Dianetics. There are many such subdivisions which are scienceswithin themselves guided by their own axioms.We are dealing in this volume, actually, with basic dianetics and dianetic therapy asapplied to the individual. This is the most immediately important and the most valuable to theindividual.But no book on dianetic therapy would be complete without a mention of a branch ofdianetics which, some say, is even more important to the race than the therapy. This isPreventive Dianetics.If one knows the cause of something, he can usually prevent the cause from going intoeffect. The discovery and proof of Ronald Ross that the malaria germ was carried by themosquito makes it possible to prevent the disease from committing the ravages it once enjoyedat the expense of Mankind. Similarly, when one knows the cause of aberration and psycho-somatic illness, he can do a great deal toward preventing them. While Preventive Dianetics is a large subject, infiltrating the fields of industry andagriculture and other specialized activities of Man, its basic principle is the scientific fact thatengrams can be held to minimal content or prevented entirely with large gains in favor ofmental health and physical well-being as well as social adjustment.The engram is actually a very simple thing: it is a moment when the analytical mind isshut down by physical pain, drugs or other means, and the reactive bank is open to the receiptof a recording. When that recording has verbal content, it becomes most severely aberrative.When it contains antagonism on an emotional level, it becomes very destructive. When it isintensely pro-survival in content it is most certainly capable of thoroughly deranging a life.The engram, amongst other things, determines fate.The engram says that a man has tofail to survive and so he contrives numerous ways to fail. The engram commands that he canonly experience pleasure amongst the members of another race and so he goes amongst themand abandons his own. It commands that he must kill to live and so he kills. And far moresubtly, the engram weaves its way from incident to incident to cause the catastrophe which itdictates.A recent case was plotted out to have actually gone to enormous lengths to break hisarm, for with a broken arm he received the sympathy without which the engram said he couldnot live. The plot covered three years and half a hundred apparently innocent incidents which,when netted together, told the story.The accident prone person is a case where the reactive mind commands accidents. He isa serious menace in any society for his accidents are reactively intentional and they include thedestruction of other people who are innocent. Drivers with several accidents on their records are generally accident prone. They haveengrams which command them to have accidents. When you have run a case, just one, youwill see how thoroughly and maliciously disposed this moronic thing, the reactive mind, can be102"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"about such things. Cleared drivers could have accidents only through two sources: (a)mechanical failure and, more important, (b) because of accident prone people. The terrible andawesome death toll taken by our automotive transport is almost all attributable to reactive minddriving rather than learned response driving. The apathy of this society is measured by the factthat it does not act severely to prevent all automotive accidents; just one broken windshield isone too many: now that an answer is to hand action can take place.The aberree in thousands of ways complicates the lives of others. Preventive Dianeticsmakes it possible to sort out the aberree who is accident prone and bar him from activitieswhich will menace others. This is one general aspect of Preventive Dianetics. That the aberreesso isolated can be cleared is another type of problem.The other general aspect of Preventive Dianetics, and the more important, is theprevention of engrams and modification of content both on the social and the individual scale.On the social scale one would delete from the society the causes of aberration in that society asif he were deleting engrams from the individual. In the same way, one can prevent the socialcauses from occurring in the first place.In the individual, the prevention of engrams is a very easy matter. Once the source ofaberration and illness is known, one can prevent the source from entering a life. If the sourcehas been known to enter, one can prevent the next step, in key-in. Of course, the final answerin all this is therapy to a clearing, but there is one aspect of the source which is not soanswered.The child cannot be safely cleared until he is at least five years of age and currentpractice is to place this figure at about eight years. Improved address to the problem mayreduce this figure, but it cannot be reduced below the age of speech unless some one in thefuture invents a catalyst which simply clears out the reactive mind without further treatment(not as wild as it may sound). But just now and probably for a long time to come the child willremain a problem to dianetics.Childhood illness is chiefly derived from engrams. It is most likely to be severe beforethe age of speech and the number of deaths within the first year of life, while medicine mayreduce them, is yet a serious thing.Preventive Dianetics addresses this problem in two phases: first the prevention ofengrams, and second, the prevention of the key-in.Taking the key-in first, there are two things which can be done to prevent it. The childcan be given a calm and harmonious atmosphere which is not restimulative or, if the childappears to be restimulated despite kindly treatment, he can be removed to another environmentwhich will be minus the two most certain sources: his father and mother, and which willcontain a source of affection. The test of whether or not a child is restimulated, pre-speech orpost-speech, is very simple. Is he susceptible to illness? Does he eat well? Is he nervous?There can be actual physical things wrong with the child, of course, but these are quicklyestablished by a doctor and they lie in the category of physical derangement.Quarrels within the hearing of a child, loud noises, frantic conduct, drooling sympathywhen he is sick or hurt, these things are some of the key-in catalogue. These make a child illphysically and aberrated mentally by keying-in his engrams. And nobody can say how manyhe has!The primary source of prevention lies in the field, oddly enough, of the regard in whichanother person is held -- his mother.It is not “biological love” which makes mother play such an enormous role in the life ofa human being. It is the simple mechanical truth that Mother is a common denominator to all thechild’s prenatals. The prenatal engram is far more serious than the post-natal. Any such engram103"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"a person has contains his mother or his mother and another person, but always his mother.Therefore her voice, the things she says, the things she does, have an enormous and vast effectupon the unborn child.It is not true that emotion gets into a child through the umbilical cord as people alwayssuppose the moment they hear of prenatals. Emotion comes on another (more electrical thanphysical) type of wave -- what type is a problem for structure. Therefore, anyone who isemotional around a pregnant woman is communicating that emotion straight into the child. Andmother’s emotion is, in the same manner, so conducted to his reactive mind.Whether or not the unborn child is “unanalytical” has no bearing on his susceptibility toengrams. The prenatal engram is just another engram. Only when the child is actually struck orhurt by high-blood pressure or orgasms or other sources of injury does he become“unconscious.” When he becomes “unconscious” he receives all the percepts and words in thearea of the mother as engrams. Analytical power has nothing to do with engrams. If the childis “unanalytical,” this does not predispose him to engrams. If the child is “unconscious” or hurtit does.The presence or absence of “analytical power” has nothing to do with whether or notengrams are received.Morning sickness, coughing, all monologuing (mother talking to herself), street noises,household noises, etc., are all communicated to the “unconscious” child when he is injured.And the child is very easily injured. He is not protected by formed bones and he has nomobility. He is there: when something strikes him or presses him, his cells and organs areinjured. A simple experiment to demonstrate how mobility influences this is to lie down in bedand place one’s head on a pillow. Then have somebody lean a hand on one’s forehead. Asthere is no mobility, the pressure of the hand is far stronger than it would be if a hand were laidon the forehead when one was standing. The tissue and the water around the child form veryslight buffers. In an injury amniotic fluid, as an incompressible medium, presses him, for itcannot compress itself. The child’s situation is far from armored.Mother’s act of tying her shoes, in the later stages of pregnancy, even may be severe onthe child. Mother’s strain when lifting heavy objects is particularly injurious. And mother’scollision with objects like a table edge might well crush a baby’s head. The repair facilities ofthe unborn child, as mentioned elsewhere, are far above anything ever before discovered. Thechild may have its head crushed but the blueprint is still there and the building materials andrepair can be made. So it is not a case of the child being “all right” just because it can livethrough almost anything. It is a case of whether or not these injuries are going to have highaberrative value as engrams.Attempted abortion is very common. And remarkably lacking in success. The mother,every time she injures the child in such a fiendish fashion, is actually penalizing herself.Morning sickness is entirely engramic, so far as can be discovered, since clears have not so farexperienced it during their own pregnancies. And the act of vomiting because of pregnancy isvia contagion of aberration. Actual illness generally results only when mother has beeninterfering with the child either by douches or knitting needles or some such thing. Suchinterference causes the mother to become ill and, from an actual physical standpoint, is muchharder on the mother than on the child. Morning sickness evidently gets into a society becauseof these interferences such as attempted abortion and, of course, injury.The cells know when pregnancy occurs. The reactive mind is acquainted with the factbefore the analyzer by process of organic sensation, since the endocrine system is altered.Hence, the mother’s discovery of pregnancy has little to do with whether or not she was sickbefore the discovery.This entire field has been a subject of considerable research in dianetics. Much moreresearch must be done. These conclusions are tentative. But the conclusion that the engram is104"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"received and that it is as violent as its content, rather than its actual pain, is a scientific fact andnot in any way a theory. It is as real a discovery as gravity.Preventing these engrams is the first consideration. Preventing them from having anycontent is the second. Women who lead peasant lives, doing heavy labor, are subject to allmanner of accident. Perhaps such accidents cannot be prevented because of the purpose thesewomen serve in the society. But when it is known that any injury to the mother can create anengram in the unborn child, it should be the concern of all those present during such an injury,including the mother, to maintain a complete and utter silence. Any remark is aberrative in anengram. Even such a statement as “You can remember this when in dianetic therapy,” madetoward an unborn child, installs an engram so that every word in this statement means aphysical pain just where he received it at the time, and in the future “dianetic therapy” will berestimulative to him.The doctor, punching around to find out if mother is pregnant, may say, “Well, it’shard to tell this early.” The patient in dianetic therapy years later will return into the vicinity ofthis incident only to draw a blank until the dianeticist suddenly guesses the content from howthe patient describes his reactions. If the doctor is very tough and says, “You had better takegood care of yourself, Mrs. Jones. If you don’t, you’ll be mighty sick!” the child,“unconscious” from the examination no matter how mild it is, will get a mild hypochondriawhen the engram keys-in and be very concerned over his health.If the husband uses language during coitus, every word of it is going to be engramic. Ifthe mother is beaten by him, that beating and everything he says and that she says will becomepart of the engram.If she does not want the child and he does, the child will later react toward him as anally and perhaps have a nervous breakdown when the father dies. If she wants the child and hedoesn’t, the ally computation is reversed.This is true when abortion is threatened or attempted providing the threat is contained inan engram.Should the mother be injured and the father be highly solicitous, the engram has this forcontent and the child has a sympathy engram. The way to survive, then, is to be pathetic wheninjured, and even see to it that one is injured.A woman who is pregnant should be given every consideration by a society which hasany feeling for its future generations. If she falls, she should be helped -- but silently. Shemust not be expected to carry heavy things. And she should not have coitus forced upon her.For every coital experience is an engram in the child during pregnancy.An astonishing number of pregnancies must take place which are never realized. Theviolence of coitus, the use of douches and jellies (used because the woman is still contraceptingand does not know she is already pregnant), straining bowel movements, falls and accidentsmust account for a large number of miscarriages which come about sometime around the firstperiod after conception. For the zygote and embryo forms of the child have a rather frail gripon existence and are very severely injured by things the mother would consider nothing. Oncepast the first missed period, the chances of miscarriage rapidly grow less and only when thechild is a genetic monstrosity or when abortion attempts are made can a miscarriage be expectedto take place. The monstrosities are so small a percentage that they are negligible as apossibility.The amniotic sac can be pierced many times and repeatedly and emptied of all waterafter the first missed period and the child can still survive. Twenty or thirty abortion attemptsare not uncommon in the aberree and in every attempt the child could have been piercedthrough the body or brain.105"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"The child before birth does not depend upon the standard senses for its perceptions.Engrams are not memories but cellular level recordings. Therefore, the child needs noeardrums to record an engram. Cases are on hand where whatever hearing mechanism theunborn child had must have been temporarily destroyed by an abortion attempt. And theengram was still recorded. The cells rebuilt the apparatus which was to be the source of soundin the standard banks and stored their own data in the reactive bank.Release of such engrams means a restoration of rationality to the individual far abovethe current norm and a stability and well-being greater than Man ever thought Man possessed.These engrams have been confirmed by taking the data from a child, from the mother and thefather, and all data checked. So we are dealing here with scientific facts which, no matter howstartling, are nevertheless true.The mother, then, should be extremely gentle on herself during pregnancy and thosearound her should be entirely informed of the necessity for silence after any jar or injury. Andin view of the fact that it is not possible to tell when a woman has become pregnant and in viewalso of the high potentiality of aberration in the zygote and embryo engrams, it is obvious thatsociety must better its ways toward women if the future health of the child is to be preserved.The woman has to some degree become considered less valuable in this society than inother societies and times. She is expected to be in competition with men. Such a thing isnonsense. A woman has as high a plane of activity as man. He cannot compete with her anymore than she can compete with him in the fields of structure and vigorous activity. Much ofthe social maelstrom now in existence has as its hub the failure to recognize the important roleof the woman as a woman and the separation of the fields of women and men.The changes which will come about in the next twenty years need no urging here. Butwith the recent discoveries in photosynthesis which should secure enough food to feed Manbetter and at less cost, the importance of birth control dwindles. The morality standards havealready changed, no matter what moralists do to try to block the change. And woman,therefore, can be freed of many of her undesirable chains.In the custody of Man is the current world and its activity and structure. In the chargeof woman is the care of the person of the human being and his children. Almost sole custodianof tomorrow’s generation, she is entitled to much more respect than her chattel-period of thepast gave her.It is not, then, any wild Utopian thought that woman can be placed above the levelhitherto occupied. And so she must be placed if the childhood of tomorrow’s generation is toreach any high standard, if homes are to be peaceful and unharassed and if society is toadvance.Preventive Dianetics, in the sphere of the home, must place emphasis on the woman inorder to safeguard the child.As any first step, a mother should be cleared, for any mother who attempts an abortionis blocked across the second dynamic and any block menaces her health as well as herhappiness. An antipathy for children has been found to accompany sexual aberration.Preventive Dianetics, then, on the level of the individual, asks for cleared parents andthen precaution against the aberrating of the child, and further precaution against the keying-inof any aberration the child might have received.To do this is very easy. Maintain silence in the presence of injury. Do what has to bedone for the injure ill and do it in silence. Maintain silence in the presence of birth to save boththe sanity of the mother and the child and safeguard the home to which they will go. And themaintaining of silence does not mean a volley of “Sh’s,” for those make stammerers.106"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"In a wider field, the maintenance of silence around any “unconscious” or injured personis second in importance only to preventing the “unconsciousness” in the first place.Say nothing and make no sound around an “unconscious” or injured person. To speak,no matter what is said, is to threaten his sanity. Say nothing while a person is being operatedupon. Say nothing when there is a street accident. Don’t talk!Say nothing around a sick child or an injured child. Smile, appear calm, but saynothing. Actions do not speak louder than words but actions are all that can be done around thesick and injured unless one has an active desire to drive them into neurosis or insanity or, atbest, to give them a future illness.And above all, say nothing around a woman who has been struck or jarred in any way.Help her. If she speaks, don’t answer. Just help her. You have no idea of whether she ispregnant or not.And it is a remarkable fact, a scientific fact, that the healthiest children come from thehappiest mothers. Birth, for one thing, in a cleared mother, is a very mild affair. Only birthengrams in the mother made it hard. A cleared mother needs no anaesthetic. And that is wellbecause the anaesthetic makes a dazed child and the engram, when it reacts, makes him appeara dull child. A happy woman has very little trouble. And even a few engrams, which arrivedespite all precautions, are nothing if the general tone of the mother is happy.Woman, you have a right and a reason to demand good treatment. 107"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Book ThreeTHERAPY108"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IThe Mind’s ProtectionThe mind is a self-protecting mechanism. Short of the use of drugs as in narco-synthesis, shock, hypnotism or surgery, no mistake can be made by an auditor* which cannotbe remedied either by himself or by another auditor. Those things which are stressed, then, inthis book, are ways to accomplish therapy as swiftly as possible with minimal errors; for errorstake time. Auditors are going to make errors, that is inevitable. If they make the same errorrepeatedly, they had better get some one to guide them through therapy.There are probably thousands of ways to get into trouble with mental healing, but allthese ways can be classed in these groups: (1) use of shock or surgery on the brain; (2) use ofstrong drugs; (3) use of hypnosis as such; and (4) trying to cross-breed dianetics with olderforms of therapy.The mind will not permit itself to be seriously overloaded so long as it can retain partialawareness of itself; it can only be overloaded when its awareness is reduced to a point where itcannot evaluate anything: it can then be thoroughly upset. Dianetic reverie leaves a patient fullyaware of everything which is taking place and with full recall of everything which hashappened. Types of therapy which do not do this are possible and useful but they must beapproached with the full knowledge that they are not foolproof. Dianetics, then, uses thereverie for the majority of its work and using the reverie an auditor cannot possibly get himselfinto any trouble from which he cannot extricate himself and the patient. He is working with analmost foolproof mechanism as long as the mind retains some awareness: a radio or a clock oran electric motor are far more susceptible to injury in the hands of a workman than the humanmind. The mind was built to be as tough as possible. It will be found that it is difficult to get itinto situations which make it uncomfortable and impossible, with the reverie, to embroil itenough to cause neurosis or insanity.In the U.S. infantry manual there is a line about decision: “Any plan, no matter howpoorly conceived, if boldly executed is better than inaction.”In dianetics, any case, no matter how serious, no matter how unskilled the auditor, isbetter opened than left closed. It is better to start therapy if it is to be interrupted after two hoursof work than not to start therapy at all. It is better to contact an engram than to leave an engramuncontacted even if the result is physical discomfort for the patient -- for that engram will notthereafter possess as much power and the discomfort will gradually abate.This is scientific fact. The mechanism dianetics uses is an ability of the brain whichMan as a whole did not know he had. It is a process of thought which everyone possessesinherently and which was evidently meant to be used in the overall process of thinking butwhich, by some strange oversight, Man has never before discovered. Once a person haslearned that he possesses just this one new faculty, he is better able to think than he wasbefore, and he can learn this faculty in ten minutes.Further, when one approaches an engram with this faculty (which, when intensified, isthe reverie) some of that engram’s sub-level connections are broken and the aberrative factorsno longer have as much force either in the physical or mental spheres. Further, the knowledgethat there is a solution to mental ills is a stabilizing factor. Approaching an engram with the reverie is very far from the same as restimulating theengram exteriorly as is done in life. The engram is a powerful and vicious character only solong as it is untapped. In place and active it can be restimulated to cause innumerable mentaland physical ills. But approaching it with reverie is approaching it on a new circuit, one thatdisarms it. The power of the engram is partly the fear of the unknown -- knowing bringsstability by itself.109"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Do not think that you will not make patients uncomfortable. That is not true. Theauditor’s work, when it taps engrams which cannot be lifted, may cause the patient to haveheadaches, various aches and pains and even mild physical illness, even when the work iscarefully done. But life has been doing this to the patient on a much grander scale for years andno matter how badly the case is mauled around, no matter how many aberrations spring intoview to plague the patient for a day or two, none are as serious as those which can beoccasioned by the environment acting upon the untapped engram.The auditor can do everything backwards, upside down and utterly wrong and thepatient will still be better, provided only that he does not try to use drugs before he has workeda few cases, that he does not use hypnotism as hypnotism and he does not try to cross dianeticswith some older therapy. He can use drugs in dianetics if he knows his dianetics and if he hasmedical concurrence. He can use all the techniques of hypnotism so long as he is thoroughlyexperienced with dianetics.And once he has used dianetics, he will not fall back to mystic efforts to heal minds. Inshort, the point which is offered here is that so long as the auditor takes a relatively simple caseat first to see how the mechanisms of the mind work and uses only the reverie he cannot getinto trouble. There will be those, certainly, who believe they are so vastly experienced in tom-tom beating or gourd rattling that they won’t give dianetics a chance to work as dianetics butwill sail in and begin to plague the patient about “penis-envy” or make him repent his sins, butthe patient who starts to get this will be smart to simply change positions from the couch to theauditor’s chair and clear up some of the aberrations of the auditor before work proceeds.Anybody who has read this book once through and procured a patient with sonic recallfor a trial effort will know more about the mind, in those actions, than he has ever knownbefore, and he will be more skilled and able to treat the mind than anyone attempting to do so,regardless of reputation, a very short while ago. This does not mean that men who have hadexperience with mental patients will not, knowing dianetics (knowing dianetics) have an edgeon those who do not realize some of the foibles of which Man in an aberrated state is capable.And on the other hand it does not mean that some engineer or lawyer or cook with a fewdianetic cases under his belt, will not be more skilled than all other practitioners of whateverbackground or kind. In this case, the sky is no limit.One could not say, offhand, that an able hypnotist or an able psychologist, ready andwilling to jettison and unlearn yesterday’s mistakes, is not better prepared to practice dianetics.In the field of psycho-somatic medicine the medical doctor, with a vast fund of experience inhealing, might very well be far and above other auditors in dianetic work. But it is notnecessarily the case, for in research it has been proven that men and women with most unlikelyprofessional backgrounds have suddenly become auditors superior in skill to those in fieldsyou might suspect were more closely allied. Engineers particularly are excellent material andmake excellent auditors. Again, dianetics is not being released to a profession, for noprofession could encompass it. It is insufficiently complicated to warrant years of study insome university. It belongs to Man and it is doubtful if anyone could manage to gain a corneron it for it does not fall within any legislation of any kind in any place and if dianetics werelegislated into a licensed profession, then it is to be feared that listening to stories and jokes andpersonal experience would also have to be legislated into a profession. Such laws would put allmen of good will who lend a sympathetic ear to a friend’s troubles inside the barbed wire.Dianetics is not psychiatry. It is not psycho-analysis. It is not psychology. It is not personalrelations. It is not hypnotism. It is a science of mind and needs about as much licensing andregulation as the application of the science of physics. Those things which are legislated againstare a matter of law because they may in some way injure individuals or society.Legislation exists about psycho-analysis in some three states in the Union, legislationagainst or about psychiatry exists everywhere. If an auditor wishes to constitute himself apsychiatrist with the power of vivisecting human brains, if he wants to constitute himself adoctor and administer drugs and medicines, if he wants to practice hypnotism and poursuggestions into a patient, then he must square it with psychiatry, medicine and the local laws110"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"about hypnotism, for he has entered other fields than dianetics. In dianetics hypnotism is notused, no brains are operated upon and no drugs are given unless the local medico is part of thestaff. Dianetics is not in any way covered by legislation anywhere for no law can prevent oneman sitting down and telling another man his troubles, and if anyone wants a monopoly ondianetics, be assured that he wants it for reasons which have to do not with dianetics but withprof it. There are not enough psychiatrists in the country to begin to staff the mentalinstitutions.Surely this generation, particularly with all the iatrogenic field is the treatment of theinsane by definition and that has nothing to do with thee and me. In psychology, dianeticsdrops into line without disturbing anything concerned with staffs or research or teaching posts,for psychology is simply the study of the psyche and now that there exists a science of thepsyche it can go ahead with a will.Thus dianetics is the enemy of none and dianetics falls utterly outside all existinglegislation, none of which anticipated or made any provision for a science of mind. 111"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIRelease or ClearThe object of dianetic therapy is to bring about a release or a clear.A release (noun) is an individual from whom major stress and anxiety have beenremoved by dianetic therapy.A clear (noun) is an individual who, as a result of dianetic therapy, has neither activenor potential psycho-somatic illness or aberration.To clear (verb) is to release all the physical pain and painful emotion from the life of anindividual or, as in Political Dianetics -- a society. The result of this will bring aboutpersistence in the four dynamics, optimum analytical ability for the individual and, with that, allrecall. The experience of his entire life is available to the clear and he has all his inherent mentalability and imagination free to use it. His physical vitality and health are markedly improvedand all psycho-somatic illnesses have vanished and will not return. He has greater resistance toactual disease. And he is adaptable to and able to change his environment. He is not “adjusted”;he is dynamic. His ethical and moral standards are high, his ability to seek and experiencepleasure is great. His personality is heightened and he is creative and constructive. It is not yetknown how much longevity is added to a life in the process of clearing, but in view of theautomatic rebalancing of the endocrine system, the lowered incidence of accident and theimprovement of general physical tone, it is most certainly raised. A release is an individual from whom have been released the current or chronic mentaland physical difficulties and painful emotion. The value of a release, when compared to a clear,may not at first thought be considered great, but when one understands that a release is usuallyin excess of the contemporary norm in mental stability, it can be seen that the condition is notwithout great value.As a standard of comparison, a clear is to the contemporary norm as the contemporarynorm is to a contemporary institutional case. The margin is wide and it would be difficult toexaggerate it. A clear, for instance, has complete recall of everything which has ever happenedto him or anything he has ever studied. He does mental computations, such as those of chess,for example, which a normal would do in a half an hour, in ten or fifteen seconds. He does notthink “vocally” but spontaneously. There are no demon circuits in his mind except those whichit might amuse him to set up -- and break down again -- to care for various approaches toliving. He is entirely self-determined. And his creative imagination is high. He can do a swiftstudy of anything within his intellectual capacity, which is inherent, and the study would be theequivalent to him of a year or two of training when he was “normal.” His vigor, persistenceand tenacity to life are very much higher than anyone has thought possible.The objection that it is dangerous to create too many clears in a society is a thoughtlessone. The clear is rational. The acts which damage a society are irrational. That a handful ofclears could probably handle any number of “normals” is within reason, but that the clearwould handle them to their detriment is unreasonable. The more clears a society possessed themore chance that society would have to prosper. That a clear is unambitious is not proven outby scientific observation, for the curve of dwindling ambition follows the curve of reducingrationality; and those who have been cleared have proven the matter by reactivating all theirskills toward goals they had once desired but had begun to consider unattainable when“norms.”* That a clear is in some degree separated from the “norm” is attributable to the gulfbetween their respective mental abilities, for he has achieved solutions and conclusions beforethe “norm” has begun to form an idea of what to conclude; this does not make a clearintolerable to the “norm,” for the clear has none of that superiority attitude which is actually aproduct of engrams. This is a quick glance at the state of being clear, but the state cannot bedescribed; it has to be experienced to be appreciated.112"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"A release is a somewhat variable quantity. Anyone well advanced on the road to clear isa release. There is no comparison between a clear and anything Man has before believedobtainable and there is no comparison between clearing and any therapy hitherto practiced. Inthe case of the release only is there a basis of comparison between dianetics and past therapiessuch as “psycho-analysis” and any other. A release can be effected in a few weeks. Theresulting condition will be at least equivalent to that following two years of “psycho-analysis”with the difference that the release has a guarantee of permanent results and no guarantee ofsuccess has ever been made by “psycho-analysis.” A release does not relapse into any patternwhich has been relieved.These are the two goals of the dianetic auditor: clear and release. It is not known at thiswriting how long is the average time to raise the institutionally insane into the neurotic level: ithas been done in two hours, it has been done in ten and in some cases it has required twohundred.*The dianetic auditor should determine beforehand in any case whether he wishes toattempt a release or a clear. He can achieve either with anyone not organically insane (missingor seared portions of the brain bringing about insanity, mainly genetic or iatrogenic andrelatively rare except in institutions). But he should make an estimate of the amount of time hecan invest in any one person and regulate his intention accordingly and announce it to hispatient. The two goals are slightly different. In a release one does not attempt entrance intophases of the case which will or may bring about a necessity of long work and gives hisattention to the location and release of emotional charge. In clearing the auditor gives hisattention to the location of the basic-basic engram, the discharge of emotion and the entireengram bank.There is a third goal which could be considered a sub-head of a release.This is an assist: it is done after injury, or illness following the injury, or illness justsustained, in order to promote more rapid recovery: to assist the body in its rehabilitation afterinjury or illness. This is specialized therapy which will probably be practiced commonlyenough but is of primary benefit to the medical doctor who, with it, can save lives and speedhealing by releasing the engram of that particular illness or injury, thus removing the variousengram conceptions which the furtherance of the injury restimulates. Any dianetic auditor canpractice this. The assist has about the same level of usefulness as a faith healing miracle whichwould work every time.Estimations of the amount of time the case will require are difficult to attain with anyaccuracy greater than 50% and it should be understood by the patient that the time in therapy isvariable. It depends in a measure upon the skill of the auditor, the number of unsuspectedengrams never hitherto reactivated, and the amount of restimulation to which the patient issubject during therapy. Therefore the auditor should not be optimistic in estimating time butshould make his patient understand that greater or lesser time may be consumed in the therapy.Any person who is intelligent and possessed of average persistency and who is willingto read this book thoroughly should be able to become a dianetic auditor. When he has clearedtwo or three cases he will have learned far more and understood far more than is contained inthis book, for there is nothing which develops an understanding of a machine like handling it inaction. This is the instruction book, the machine in question is ready to hand wherever thereare men. Contrary to superstition about the mind, it is almost impossible to permanently injurethe mechanism. It can be done with an electric shock or a scalpel or an ice-pick, but it is almostimpossible to do it with dianetic therapy. 113"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IIIThe Auditor’s RoleThe purpose of therapy and its sole target is the removal of the content of the reactiveengram bank. In a release, the majority of emotional stress is deleted from this bank. In a clear,the entire content is removed.The application of a science is an art. That is true of any science. The efficacy of itsapplication depends upon the understanding, skill and ability of whomever applies it. Thechemist has a science of chemistry and yet the profession of being a chemist is an art. Theengineer may have behind him the precision of all the physical sciences and yet the practice ofengineering is an art.Certain rules of procedure can be laid down after the basic axioms of a science areunderstood. Beyond those rules of procedure is the understanding, skill and ability necessaryto application.Dianetics is extremely simple. This does not mean that cases cannot be extremelycomplicated. To cover one case for each kind of case in this book would necessitate two billioncases and that would only encompass the current population. For each man is a great dealdifferent from every other man. His inherent personality is different. His composite ofexperience is different. And his dynamics are of different strengths. The only constant is themechanism of the reactive engram bank and that alone does not vary. The content of that bankis different from man to man both in quantity and intensity but the mechanism of operation ofthe bank and therefore the basic mechanisms of dianetics are constant from man to man, andwere in every age and will be in every future age until Man evolves into another organism.The target is the engram. It is also the target of the patient’s analytical mind and thepatient’s dynamics as he tries to live his life: it is the target of the auditor’s analytical mind andthe auditor’s dynamics. So bracketed and salvoed it gives up its store of engrams.This should be extremely plain to any auditor: the amount he relaxes from the positionof auditor and forgets the target, he garners trouble which will consume his time. The momenthe makes the error of thinking that the person, the analytical mind or the dynamics of thepatient are resisting, trying to stop therapy, or giving up, the auditor has made the fundamentaland primary error in the practice of dianetics. Almost anything that goes wrong can be tracedback to this error. It cannot be too emphatically stated that the analytical mind and the dynamicsof the patient never, never, never resist the auditor. The auditor is not there to be resisted. Hehas no concern with resistance from anything except the patient’s (and sometimes his own)engrams.The auditor is not there as the patient’s driver or adviser. He is not there to beintimidated by the patient’s engrams or be frightened by their aspects. He is there to audit andonly to audit. If he feels that he is called upon to be lordly to the patient, then the auditor hadbetter change chair for couch because he has a case of authoritarianism coming into view. Theword auditor is used, not “operator” or “therapist,” because it is a cooperative effort betweenthe auditor and the patient, and the law of affinity is at work. The patient cannot see his own aberrations. That is one of the reasons why the auditoris there. The patient needs to be bolstered to face the unknowns of his life. That is anotherreason the auditor is there. The patient would not dare address the world which has gotteninside him and turn his back upon the world that is outside him unless he has a sentry. That isanother reason the auditor is there.114"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The auditor’s job is to safeguard the person of the patient during therapy, to computethe reasons why the patient’s mind cannot reach into the engram bank, to strengthen thepatient’s nerve and to get those engrams.There is a three-way case of affinity at work this moment. I am in affinity with theauditor: I am telling him all that has been discovered and is in practice in dianetics and I wanthim to succeed. The auditor is in affinity with the patient: he wants the patient to attackengrams. The patient is in affinity with the auditor because, with minimal work, that patient isgoing to get better and with persistence lent him by the auditor, plus his own, will become arelease or a clear. There are even more affinities at work, a vast network of them. This is acooperative endeavor.The engram bank is the target, not the patient. If the patient swears and moans andweeps and pleads, those are engrams talking. After a while the engrams that make him swearand moan and weep and plead will be discharged and refiled. The patient, in whatever state,knows full well that the action taken is necessary. If the auditor is short of rationality that hemistakes this swearing or moaning as something directed at him personally, that auditor hadbetter change places with the patient and undergo therapy.The only thing which resists is the engram! When it is being restimulated it impingesagainst the patient’s analyzer, tends to reduce analytical power, and the patient exhibits amodified dramatization. Any auditor with two brain cells to click together will never be in anyslightest danger of his person at the hands of the pre-release or pre-clear. If the auditor wants touse hypnotism and try to run late physically painful engrams such as operations when earlyones are available, he may find himself targeted. But then he has done something very wrong.If the auditor suddenly gets supermoral and lectures the patient, he may get involved, but againhe has done something very wrong. If the auditor snarls and snaps at the patient, he may gettargeted, but once more a fundamental error has been made.The target is the engram bank. It is the auditor’s job to attack the pre-clear’s engrambank. It is the pre-clear’s job to attack that bank. To attack the pre-clear is to permit his engrambank to attack the pre-clear.We know that there are five methods of handling an engram. Four of them are wrong.To succumb to an engram is apathy, to neglect one is carelessness, but to avoid or flee fromone is cowardice. Attack and only attack resolves the problem. It is the duty of the auditor tomake very sure that the pre-clear keeps attacking engrams, not the auditor or the exterior world.If the auditor attacks the pre-clear, that’s bad gunnery and very poor logic.The engram bank is best attacked primarily by discharging its emotional chargeanywhere it can be contacted. After that it is best attacked by finding out what the pre-clear, inreverie, thinks would happen to him if he got well, got better, found out, etc. And then it ismost and always most important, in any way possible, to contact the primary moment of painor unconsciousness in the patient’s life. This is basic-basic. Once an auditor has basic-basic,the case will swiftly resolve. If the preclear’s reactive mind is suppressing basic-basic, then theauditor should discharge more reactive emotion, discover the computation now in force, andtry again. He will eventually get basic-basic. That’s important. And that is all that is importantin a pre-clear.In the pre-release (patient working toward release only) the task is to discharge emotionand as many early engrams as will present themselves easily. The reduction of locks may beincluded in pre-release; but only when they lead to basic-basic should locks be touched in apreclear.There are three levels of healing. The first is getting the job done efficiently. Below thatis making the patient comfortable. Below that is sympathy. In short, if you can do nothing fora man with a broken back, you can make him comfortable. If you can’t even make himcomfortable, you can sympathize with him.115"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"The second and third echelons above are entirely unwarranted in dianetics. The job canbe done efficiently. Making the patient comfortable is a waste of time. Giving him sympathymay snarl up the entire case, for his worst engrams will be sympathy engrams and sympathymay restimulate them out of place. The auditor who indulges in “hand-patting,” no matter howmuch it seems to be indicated, is wasting time and slowing down the case. Undue roughness isnot indicated. A friendly, cheerful, optimistic attitude will take care of everything. A pre-clearsometimes needs a grin. But he has already had more “hand-patting” than the analyzer has beenable to compute. His chronic psycho-somatic illness contains sympathy in its engram.The next thing the auditor should know and live is the AUDITOR’S CODE. This maysound like something from “When Knighthood Was in Flower” or the “Thirteen Rituals forHeavenly Bliss and Nirvana,” but unless it is employed by the auditor on his patients, theauditor will have some heavy slogging. This code is not for the comfort of the pre-clear; it isexclusively for the protection of the auditor. The AUDITOR’S CODE should never beviolated. Practice in dianetics has demonstrated that violation of the AUDITOR’S CODE alonecan interrupt cases.The auditor should be courteous in his treatment of all pre-clears.The auditor should be kind, not giving way to any indulgence of cruelty toward pre-clears, nor surrendering to any desire to punish.The auditor should be quiet during therapy, not given to talk beyond the absoluteessentials of dianetics during an actual session.The auditor should be trustworthy, keeping his word when given, keeping hisappointments in schedules and his commitments to work and never giving forth anycommitment of any kind which he has any slightest reason to believe he cannot keep.The auditor should be courageous, never giving ground or violating the fundamentalsof therapy because a pre-clear thinks he should. The auditor should be patient in his working,never becoming restless or annoyed by the pre-clear, no matter what the pre-clear is doing orsaying.The auditor should be thorough, never permitting his plan of work to be swayed or acharge to be avoided.The auditor should be persistent, never giving up until he has achieved results.The auditor should be uncommunicative, never giving the patient any informationwhatsoever about his case, operates more or less automatically on this code. Dianetics is aparallel to thought, since it follows the natural laws of thought. What works in dianetics worksas well in life. Various conditions ensue when any of the above are violated. All violations slowtherapy and cause the auditor more work. All violations come back to the detriment of theauditor.For instance, in the last, it is not part of the auditor’s work to inform the pre-clear ofanything. As soon as he starts doing so, the pre-clear promptly hooks the auditor into thecircuit as the source of information and so avoids engrams.The auditor will see in progress the most violent and disturbing human emotions. Hemay be moved to sympathy, but if he is, he has overlooked something and hindered therapy:whenever an emotion shows, it is an emotion which will shortly be history. Whatevergyrations the pre-clear may go through, however much he may move or wrestle around, theauditor must keep firmly in mind that every moan or gyration is one step closer to the goal. For116"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"why be frightened or waste sympathy about something which, when it has been recounted afew times will leave a pre-clear happier?If the auditor becomes frightened and pulls that error of all errors when a pre-clearbegins to shake, “Come up to present time!” he can be sure that the pre-clear will have a coupleof bad days and that the next time the auditor wants to enter that engram it will be blocked.If an auditor assumes the state of mind that he can sit and whistle while Rome burnsbefore him and be prepared to grin about it, then he will do an optimum job. The things atwhich he gazes, no matter how they look, no matter how they sound, are solid gains. It’s thequiet, orderly patient who is making few gains. This does not mean that the auditor is tryingfor nothing but violence, but it does mean that when he gets it he can be cheerful and contentthat one more engram has lost its charge. The task of auditing is rather much a shepherd’s task, herding the little sheep, theengrams, into the pen for slaughter. The pre-clear isn’t under the auditor’s orders but the pre-clear, if the case runs well, will do whatever the auditor wants with these engrams because theanalytical mind and the dynamics of the pre-clear want that job done. The mind knows howthe mind operates. 117"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IVDiagnosisOne of the most important contributions of dianetics is the resolution of the problem ofdiagnosis in the field of aberration. Hitherto there have been almost unlimited classifications;further there has been no optimum standard. As one researches in the field of psychiatric texts,he finds wide disagreement in classification and continual complaint that classification is verycomplex and lacking in usefulness. Without an optimum goal of conduct or mental state andwithout knowledge of the cause of aberration, catalogues of descriptions alone were possibleand these were so involved and contradictory that it was nearly impossible to sharply assign toa psychotic or neurotic any classification which will lead to an understanding of his case.**The main disability in this classification system was that the classification did not lead to a cure,for there was no standard treatment and there was no optimum state to indicate when treatmentwas at end; and as there was no cure for aberration or psycho-somatic illness, there could be noclassification which would indicate the direction which was to be taken or what coulduniformly be expected of a case.This is no criticism of past efforts surely, but it is a source of relief to know that theclassification of aberration is unnecessary along such complicated lines as have been used andthat the cataloguing of psycho-somatic ills, while necessary to the physician, is unimportant tothe auditor. In the evolution of the science of dianetics there were several stages ofclassification until it finally became clear that the label on a pathological condition should onlybe whatever the auditor had to overcome to achieve cure. This system, as now evolved throughpractice, makes it possible for the auditor to “diagnose” without any more knowledge than iscontained in this chapter and his own future experience.The number of aberrations possible is the number of combinations of words possible ina language as contained in engrams. In other words, if a psychotic thinks he is God, he has anengram which says he is God. If he is worried about poison in his hash, he has an engramwhich tells him he may get poison in his hash. If he is certain he may be “fired” from his jobany moment even though he is competent and well-liked, he has an engram which tells him heis about to be “fired.” If he thinks he is ugly, he has an engram about being ugly. If he is afraidof snakes or cats, he has engrams which tell him to fear snakes and cats. If he is sure he has tobuy everything he sees, despite his income, he has an engram which tells him to buyeverything he sees. And in view of the fact that anyone not released or cleared has upwards oftwo or three hundred engrams and as these engrams contain a most remarkable assortment oflanguage and as he may choose one of five ways of handling any one of these engrams, theproblem of aberration is of no importance to the auditor except where it slows therapy.Most aberrated people talk in a large measure out of their engrams. Whatever thechronic patter of the individual may be, his rage patter, his apathy patter, his general attitudetoward life, this patter is contained in engrams wherever it departs even in the slightest degreefrom complete rationality. The man who “cannot be sure,” who “does not know” and who isskeptical of everything, is talking out of engrams. The man who is certain “it cannot be true”that “it isn’t possible,” that “Authority must be contacted” is talking out of engrams. Thewoman who is so certain she needs a divorce or that her husband is going to murder her somenight is talking out of either her own or his engrams. The man who comes in and says he has abad pain in his stomach that feels “just like a #12 gauge copper wire going straight through me”has quite possibly had a #12 gauge copper wire through him in an attempted abortion or talk ofsuch a thing while he was in pain. The man who says it “has to be cut out” is talking straightout of an engram either from some operation of his own or his mother’s or from an attemptedabortion. The man who “has to get rid of it” is again possibly talking out of an attemptedabortion engram. The man who “can’t get rid of it” may be talking from the same source butfrom another valence. People, in short, especially when talking about dianetics and engrams,give forth with engram talk in steady streams. They have no awareness, ordinarily, that thethings they are saying are minor dramatizations of their engrams and suppose that they have118"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"concluded these things themselves or think these things: the supposition and explanation isonly justified thought -- the analyzer performing its duty in guaranteeing that the organism isright no matter how foolishly it is acting.The auditor can be assured, particularly when he is talking about dianetics, that he isgoing to hear in return a lot of engram content; for discussion of the reactive mind generallytakes place in language which it itself holds.Recall that the reactive mind can think only on this equation -- A = A = A, when thethree A’s may be respectively a horse, a swear-word and the verb “to spit.” Spitting is the sameas horses is the same as God. The reactive mind is a very zealous Simple Simon, carefullystepping in each pie. Thus when a man is told he has to delete the content of the reactive bank,he may say that if he did, he is sure he would lose all his ambition. Be assured -- and howeasily this proves up on therapy and how red-eared some pre-clears become -- that he has anengram which may run something like this:(Blow or bump, prenatal)FATHER: Damn it, Agnes, you’ve got to get rid of that God-Damned baby.If you don’t, we’ll starve to death. I can’t afford it.MOTHER: Oh, no, no, no, I can’t get rid of it, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t! Honest I will take careof it. I’ll work and slave and support it.Please don’t make me get rid of it. If I did I’d just die. I’d lose my mind! I wouldn’t haveanything to hope for. I’d lose all my interest in life. I’d lose my ambition. Please let me keepit!What a common one that engram is: and how sincerely and “rationally” and earnestly anaberree can be in supporting his conclusion that he has just “thought up” the “computation” thatif he “gets rid of it,” he’ll lose his mind and ambition, maybe even die!As this work is written, most of the engrams that will be found in adults come from thefirst quarter of the 20th century. This was the period of “Aha, Jack Dalton, at last I have you inmy possession!” It was the period of “Blood and Sand” and Theda Bara. It was the period ofbootleg whiskey and woman suffrage. It covered the days of “flaming youth” and the “TheYanks are Coming,” and bits of such color will be demanding action in the engram banks.Dianetic auditors have picked up whole passages of the Great Play “The Drunkard” out ofprenatal engrams, not as a piece of funny “corn” but as Mama’s sincere and passionate effort toreform Papa. Super-drama, Mellerdrammer. And not only that but also tragedy. The hangoverof the Gay Nineties, when the “business girl” had just begun to be “free” and Carrie Nationwas saving the world at the expense of bartenders will be common fare in engrams found intoday’s adults.Yesterday’s cliches and absurdities become, tragically enough, today’s engramiccommands. One very, very morose young man, for instance, was found to have as the centralmotif of his reactive mind Hamlet’s historic vacillations about whether “to be or not to be, thatis the question.” Mama (who was what these colloquially-minded auditors call a “loop”) hadgotten it by contagion from an actor-father whose failure to be a Barrymore had driven him todrink and wife beating; and our young man would sit for hours in a morose apathy wonderingabout life. To classify his psychosis required nothing more than “apathetic young fellow.”Most of engram content is merely cliches and commonplaces and emotional crashdrives by Mama or Papa. But the auditor will have his moments. And when he suddenly learnsabout them, the pre-clear will have his laughs.119"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"In other words, aberration can be any combination of words contained in an engram.Thus, to classity by aberration is not only utterly impossible but completely unnecessary. Afteran auditor has run one case, he will be far more able to appreciate this.As for psycho-somatic ills, as classified in an earlier chapter, these depend also uponaccidental or intentional word combinations and all the variety of injury and unbalanced fluidand growth possible. It is very well to call an obscure pain “tendonitis” but more probably andmore accurately, it is a fall or injury before birth. Asthma comes fairly constantly from birth,as do conjunctivitis and sinusitis, but when these can occur in birth, there is generally prenatalbackground. Thus it can be said that wherever a man or woman aches is of minor importanceto the auditor beyond using the patient’s chronic illness to locate the chain of sympathyengrams, and all the auditor needs to know of that illness is that some area of the body hurtsthe patient. That, for the auditor, is enough for psycho-somatic diagnosis.It happens that the extent of aberration and the extent of psycho-somatic illness are notthe regulating factors which establish how long a case may take. A patient may be a screaminglunatic and yet require only a hundred hours to clear. Another may be a “well-balanced” andmoderately successful person and yet take five hundred hours to clear. Therefore, in the lightof the fact that the extent of aberration and illness has only a minor influence on what theauditor is interested in -- therapy -- classification by these is so much wasted time.Oh, there are such things as a man being too sick from heart trouble to be worked veryhard and such things as a patient worrying so continuously as a manifestation of his usual lifethat the auditor finds his work difficult, but these are rarities and again have little bearing on theclassification of a case.The rule in diagnosis is that whatever the individual offers the auditor as a detrimentalreaction to therapy is engramic and will prove so in the process. Whatever impedes the auditorin his work is identical to whatever is impeding the patient in his thinking and living. Think ofit this way: the auditor is an analytical mind (his own) confronted with a reactive mind (the pre-clear’s). Therapy is a process of thinking. Whatever troubles the patient will also trouble theauditor; whatever troubles the auditor has also troubled the patient’s analytical mind. The patient is not a whole analytical mind: the auditor will find himself occasionallywith a patient who does nothing but swear at him and yet when the appointment time arrives,there that patient is, anxious to continue therapy; or the auditor may find a patient who tells himhow useless the entire procedure is and how she hates to be worked upon and yet if he were totell her, “All right, we’ll stop work,” she would go into a prompt decline.The analytical mind of the patient wants to do the same thing the auditor is trying to do,fight down into the reactive bank; therefore, the auditor, when he encounters opposition,adverse theory about dianetics, personal criticism, etc., is not listening to analytical data butreactive engrams and he should calmly proceed, secure in that knowledge, for the patient’sdynamics, all that can be brought to bear, will help him so long as the auditor is an ally againstthe pre-clear’s reactive mind, rather than a critic or attacker of the pre-clear’s analytical mind.This is an example:(In reverie -- pre-natal basic area)PRE-CLEAR:(Believing he means dianetics) I don’t know. I don’t know. I just can’tremember. It won’t work. I know it won’t work.AUDITOR:(repeater technique, described later) Go over that. Say, “It won’t work.”PRE-CLEAR:“It won’t work. It won’t work. It won’t work... etc. etc.” Ouch, my stomachhurts! “It won’t work. It won’t work. It won’t work ...” (Laughter of relief.) That’s mymother. Talking to herself.120"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"AUDITOR:All right, let’s pick up the entire engram. Begin at the beginning.PRE-CLEAR:(Quoting recall with somatics [pains]) “I don’t know how to do it. I just can’tremember what Becky told me. I just can’t remember it. Oh, I am so discouraged. It won’twork this way. It just won’t work. I wish I knew what Becky told me but I can’t remember.Oh I wish...” Hey, what’s she got in here? Why, God damn her, that’s beginning to burn! It’sa douche. Say! Let me out of here! Bring me up to present time! That really burns!AUDITOR:Go back to the beginning and go over it again. Pick up whatever additional datayou can contact.PRE-CLEAR:Repeats engram, finding all the old phrases and some new ones plus somesounds. Recounts four more times, “re-experiencing” everything. Begins to yawn, almost fallsasleep (“unconsciousness” coming off), revives and repeats engram twice more. Then beginsto chuckle over it. Somatic is gone. Suddenly engram is “gone” (refiled and he cannot discoverit again. He is much pleased.)AUDITOR:Go to the next earliest moment of pain or discomfort.PRE-CLEAR:Uh. Mmmmm. I can’t get in there. Say, I can’t get in there! I mean it. I wonderwhere...AUDITOR:Go over the line, “Can’t get in there.”PRE-CLEAR:“Can’t get in there. Can’t...” My legs feel funny. There’s a sharp pain. Say,what the hell is she doing? Why damn her! Boy, I’d like to get my hands on her just once. Justonce!AUDITOR:Begin at the beginning and recount it.PRE-CLEAR:(Recounts engram several times, yawns off “unconsciousness,” chuckles whenhe can’t find the engram any more. Feels better.) Oh, well, I guess she had her troubles.AUDITOR:(Carefully refraining from agreeing that Mama had her troubles, since thatwould make him an ally of Mama) Go to the next moment of pain or discomfort.PRE-CLEAR:(Uncomfortable) I can’t. I’m not moving on the time track. I’m stuck. Oh, allright. “I’m stuck, I’m stuck.” No. “It’s stuck. It’s stuck that time.” No. “I stuck it that time.”Why damn her! That’s my coronary trouble! That’s it! That’s the sharp pain I get!AUDITOR:Begin at the beginning of the engram and recount, etc.Each time, it can be seen in this example, that the patient in reverie encounteredanalytically the engram in near proximity, the engram command impinged itself upon thepatient himself, who gave it forth as an analytical opinion to the auditor. A pre-clear in reverieis close up against the source material of his aberrations. An aberree wide awake may begiving forth highly complex opinions which he will battle to the death to defend as his own butwhich are, in reality, only his aberrations impinging against his analytical mind. Patients willgo right on declaring that they know the auditor is dangerous, that he shouldn’t ever havestarted them in therapy, etc., and still keep working well and efficiently. That’s one of thereasons why the auditor’s code is so important: the patient is just as eager to relieve himself ofhis engrams as could be wished, but the engrams give the appearance of being a long way fromanxious to be relieved.It will also be seen in the above example that the auditor is not making any positivesuggestion. If the phrase is not engramic, the patient will very rapidly tell him so in nouncertain terms and although it still may be, the auditor has no great influence over the pre-clearin reverie beyond helping him to attack engrams. If the pre-clear contradicted any of the above,121"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"it means that the engram containing the words suggested is not ready to be relieved and anotherparaphrase is in order.Diagnosis, then, is something which takes care of itself on the aberration and psycho-somatic plane. The auditor could have guessed -- and kept it to himself -- that a series ofattempted abortions were coming up in the above example before he entered the area. He mighthave guessed that the indecisiveness of the patient was from his mother. The auditor, however,does not communicate his guesses. This would be suggestion and might be seized upon by thepatient. It is up to the pre-clear to find out. The auditor, for instance, could not have knownwhere on the time track the pre-clear’s “coronary pain” was nor the nature of the injury.Chasing up and down looking for a specific pain would be just so much wasted time. All suchthings will surrender in the course of therapy. The only interest in them is whether or not theaberrations and illnesses go to return no more. At the end of therapy they will be gone. At thebeginning they are only complication.Diagnosis of aberration and psycho-somatic illness, then, is not an essential part ofdianetic diagnosis.What we are interested in is the mechanical operation of the mind. That is the sphere ofdiagnosis. What are the working mechanics of the analytical mind?1. Perception. Sight, hearing, tactile and pain, etc.2. Recall. Visio-color, tone-sonic, tactile, etc.3. Imagination. Visio-color, tone-sonic, tactile, etc.These are the mechanical processes. Diagnosis deals primarily with these factors andwith these factors can establish the length of time a case should take, how difficult the case willbe, etc. And we need only a few of these.This further simplifies into a code:1. Perception, over or under optimum.(a) Sight(b) Sound2. Recall: Under(a) Sonic(b) Visio3. Imagination: Over(a) Sonic (b) VisioIn other words, when we examine a patient before we make him a pre-clear (by startinghim into therapy) we are interested in three things only: too much or too little perception, toolittle recall, too much imagination.122"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"In Perception we mean how well or how poorly he can hear, see and feel.In Recall, we want to know if he can recall by sonic (hearing), visio (seeing) andsomatic (feeling).In Imagination we want to know if he (recalls) sonics, visions or somatics too much.Let us make this extremely clear: it is very simple, it is not complex, and it requires nogreat examination. But it is important and establishes the length of time in therapy.There is nothing wrong with an active imagination so long as the person knows he isimagining. The kind of imagination we are interested in is that used for unknowing “dub-in”and in that kind only. An active imagination which the patient knows to be imagination is anextremely valuable asset to him. An imagination which substitutes itself for recall is very tryingin therapy.“Hysterical” blindness and deafness or extended sight or hearing are useful indiagnosis. The first, “hysterical” blindness, means the patient is afraid to see; “hysterical”deafness means he is afraid to hear. These will require considerable therapy. Likewise,extended sight and extended hearing, while not as bad as blindness and deafness, are an indexof how frightened the patient really is and is often a straight index of the prenatal content interms of violence.If the patient is afraid to see with his eyes or hear with his ears in present time, beassured there is much in his background to make him afraid, for these actual perceptions do not“turn-off” easily.If the patient jumps at sounds and is startled by sights or is very disturbed by thesethings, his perceptions can be said to be extended, which means the reactive bank has a greatdeal in it labeled “death.”The recalls in which we are interested in diagnosis are those which are less thanoptimum only. When they are “over optimum” they are actually imagination “dubbed in” forrecall. Recall (under) and imagination (over) are actually, then, one group, but for simplicityand clarity we keep them apart.If the patient cannot “hear” sounds or voices in past incidents he does not have sonic. Ifhe does not “see” scenes of past experiences in motion color pictures, he does not have visio.If the patient hears voices which have not existed or sees scenes which have not existedand yet supposes that these voices really spoke and these scenes were real, we have “overimagination.” In dianetics imaginary sound recall would be hyper-sonic, sight recall -- hyper-visio (hyper= over).Let us take specific examples of each one of these three classes and demonstrate howthey become fundamental in therapy and how their presence or absence can make a casedifficult.A patient with a mild case of “hysterical” deafness is one who has difficulty in hearing.The deafness can be organic but if organic it will not vary from time to time. This patient has something he is afraid to hear. He plays the radio very loudly, makespeople repeat continually and misses pieces of the conversation. Do not go to an institution tofind this degree of “hysterical” deafness. Men and women are “hysterically” deaf without anyconscious knowledge of it. Their “hearing just isn’t so good.” In dianetics this is being calledhypo-hearing (hypo = under).123"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The patient who is always losing something when it lies in fair view before him, whomisses signposts, theater bills and people who are in plain sight is “hysterically” blind to somedegree. He is afraid he will see something. In dianetics this is being called, since the word“hysterical” is a very inadequate and overly dramatic one, hypo-sight.Then there is the case of over-perception. This is not necessarily imagination, but it cango to the length of seeing and hearing things which are not there at all, which happens to be acommon insanity. We are interested in a less dramatic grade in standard operation.A girl, for instance, who sees something or thinks she sees something but knows shedoesn’t and is very startled, who jumps in fright when anyone silently comes into a room andcan be so startled rather habitually, is suffering from extended sight. She is afraid she willencounter something, but instead of being blind to it she is too alive to it. This is hyper-sight.A person who is much alarmed by noises, by sounds in general, by certain voices, whogets a headache or gets angry when the people around are “noisy” or the door slams or thedishes rattle, is a victim of extended hearing. She hears sounds far louder than they actuallyare. This is hyper-hearing.The actual quality of the seeing and hearing does not need to be good. The actualorgans of sight and sound can be in poor condition. The only fact of importance is the“nervousness” about reception. This disposes of the two perceptions in which we are interested in dianetics. As theauditor talks to people around him and gets their reactions to sights and sounds, he will findwide variety in quality of response.Recall is the most directly important to therapy, for it is not a symptom, it is an actualtool of work. There are many ways to use recall. The clear has vivid and accurate recall forevery one of the senses. Few aberrees have. The auditor is not interested in other senses thansight and sound because the others will be cared for in the usual course of therapy. But if hehas a patient who has no sonic, watch out. And if he has a patient with neither sonic nor visio,beware! This is the multi-valent personality, the schizophrenic, the paranoid of psychiatry withsymptoms not acute enough to be so classified in normal life. This does not mean, emphaticallydoes not mean, that people without sight and sound recall are insane, but it does mean an aboveaverage case and it means a case which will take some time. It does not mean the case is“incurable” for nothing can be further from the truth: but such cases sometimes take fivehundred hours. It simply means that such a case isn’t any stroll through the park: there isdrammer back there in that reactive mind, drammer which says, “Don’t see! Don’t hear!” Someof the engrams in this case demand reduced or no recall. The organs of sight and sound may behighly extended in their reception. This does not mean that anything need be wrong with theway this person perceives sound or light waves and records them. But it does mean that afterhe has recorded them, he cannot easily get them back out of the standard bank because thereactive engram bank has set up circuits (occlusion demon circuits) to keep him from findingout about his past. There are, of course, greater or lesser degrees of recall.The test is simple. Tell the patient wide awake to go back to the time he was enteringthe room. Ask him what was being said. If he can “hear” it wide awake, he has sonic recall.The auditor knows very well what was said, for if he means to use this test, he utters a certainset of words and notes the actual sounds present. Therefore, if the patient falls into thefollowing category, the “dub-in,” the auditor will be apprised of that.The sight recall test is equally simple. Show the patient a book with an illustration.After a time interval, ask him to “go back” while he is wide awake and look at that book “in hismind” and see if he can see it. If he can’t, this is hypo-visio.More tests similar to this will clearly establish whether or not our patient is recall blindand deaf or whether he falls into the next group:124"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The over-active imagination which enthusiastically “dubs-in” sight and sound for thepatient without knowledge is something which is definitely a hindrance to fast therapy. Thereare many demon circuits which snarl up thinking, but these particular “dub-in” demons meanthat the operator is going to get a most awful cargo of what the auditors colloquially call“garbage.” There is, as they further use some of the doubtlessly disgraceful terminologywhich, despite anything one can do, keeps rising up in this field, something at work in thebrain which is a “lie factory.”The patient asked to recount the conversation as he entered the door by “hearing it”again may confidently start in to give forth all manner of speech which was entirely paraphraseor utterly fictitious. Asked to tell about the picture and page he is shown, he will “see” vividly alot more than was there or something entirely different. If he is doubtful about it, that is ahealthy sign.If he is certain, beware, for it is a demon circuit “dubbing in” without his analyticalknowledge and the auditor will have to listen to more incidents which never happened than hecould begin to catalogue and will have to sort out and pick his way through this “garbage”continually to get his pre-clear to a point where the data is reliable. (And it isn’t a matter ofgrading “garbage” by its improbability -- truth is always stranger than fiction; it is a matter oftrying to reduce engrams which are not present or by-pass engrams which are present and soon in a tangled hash.)The optimum pre-clear would be one who had average response to noises and sights,who had accurate sonic and visio and who could imagine and know that he was imagining, incolor-visio and tone-sonic. This person, understand clearly, may have aberrations which makehim climb every chimney in town, drink every drop in every bar every night (or try it anyway),beat his wife, drown his children and suppose himself to be a jub-jub bird. In the psycho-somatic line he may have arthritis, gall-bladder trouble, dermatitis, migraine headaches and flatfeet. Or he may have that much more horrible aberration -- pride in being average and“adjusted.” He is still a relatively easy case to clear.In the case which has sonic and visio shut-off without “dub-in” we are dealing withengrams which have shut down some of the primary working mechanisms of the mind. Theauditor will have to slog through hours and hours and hours of trying to contact engrams whenthe patient cannot hear them or see them. A case which merely has a shut-down sonic recall stillmeans that the auditor is going to do a lot more work than on an average case. This case isvery, very far from impossible to resolve. That is not the idea here, to frighten off any attempton such a case. But this case will only be resolved after a great deal of persistent effort. Such aperson may be apparently very successful. He may be enormously intelligent. He may havefew or no psycho-somatic ills. Yet he will prove to have a crammed engram bank, any part ofwhich may come into restimulation at any time and swamp him. Usually, however, this type ofcase is quite worried and anxious about many things, and such worry and anxiety may put alittle more time on the worksheet.In the case of the “dub-in” who doesn’t know it, where circuits are giving him backaltered recall, we have a case which may very likely prove to be very long and require artfultreatment. For there is a “lie factory” somewhere in that engram bank. This case may be thesoul of truthfulness in his everyday life. But when he starts tackling his engrams, they havecontent which makes him give out material which is not there.Sharply and clearly, then, without further reservation or condition, this is dianeticdiagnosis: The aberration is the engram content; the psycho-somatic illness is the former injury.The perceptions of sight and sound, under-optimum recall, over-optimum imagination regulatethe length of the case.If the auditor wants to be fancy, he can list the general tone scale position of theindividual mentally and physically. The woman who is dull and apathetic is, of course, aroundTone 0.5, in the Zone Zero part of the dynamic scale earlier in the book. If the man is angry or125"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"hostile, the auditor can mark him down as a 1.5 or somewhere generally in the Zone One rangeof the survival scale. These markings would apply to the probable average tone of theaggregate engrams in the reactive mind. This is interesting because it means that a Zone Zeroperson is far more likely to be ill and is a slightly harder case than a Zone One person: And, astherapy raises tone to Zone Four, the 1.5 is closer to the goal.It is difficult to estimate time in therapy. As mentioned before, it has several variablessuch as auditor skill, restimulative elements in the patient’s environment and sheer volume ofengrams.The auditor is advised, in his first case, to seek out some member of the family or afriend who is as close as possible to the optimum pre-clear, which is to say, a person withvisio and sonic recall and average perceptions. In clearing this one case he will learn at firsthand much of what can be expected in the engram banks of any mind; and he will see clearlyhow engrams behave. If the auditor himself falls into one of the harder brackets and if hemeans to work with somebody in one of these brackets, that poses no great difficulty, eithercase can be released in a hundredth the time of any former mental healing technique and theycan be cleared, if any skill at all is used, in five hundred hours of work per case. But if twocases are particularly difficult, before they work on each other each would be wise to find andclear a nearly optimum pre-clear. That way each will be a competent operator when therougher cases are approached.Thus, diagnosis. The other perceptions, recalls and imaginations are interesting but notvital in measuring case time. I.Q., unless it falls down into the feeble-minded level, is no greatfactor. And even then the I.Q. of any patient goes up like a skyrocket with clearing and rises allthe while during the work.There are organic insanities. Iatrogenic psychoses (caused by doctors) are equivocal indianetics, for a part of the machinery may have been wrecked. Nevertheless, with manyorganic psychoses a case can be improved by dianetics even if an optimum cannot be reached.And so all an auditor can do is try. Insanities caused by missing parts of the nervous systemhave not been extensively investigated by auditors at this time: the reviving of corpses is not theend of dianetics: the bringing about an optimum mind in the normal or merely neurotic personhas had the main emphasis. Dianetics can be otherwise used, is being and will be. But with somany potentially valuable people who can be made highly valuable to themselves and society,emphasis has been placed on inorganic aberrations and organic psycho-somatic illnesses.Cases which have been subjected to pre-frontal lobotomy (which saws a section out ofthe analytical mind), the topectomy (which removes pieces of brain somewhat as an apple corercores apples), the trans-orbital leukotomy which, while the patient is being electricallyshocked, thrusts an ordinary dime store ice-pick into each eye and reaches up to rip theanalyzer apart), and electric shock “therapy” which sears the brain with 110 volts, as well asinsulin shock and other treatments, are considered by dianetics to be equivocal. There areordinary organic insanities such as paresis, but most of these, even so, can be benefited bydianetics. 126"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VReturning, the File Clerk, and the Time TrackThere is a method of “thinking” which Man did not know he had.If you would like an illustration of this, ask a small child if she would like to go sleighriding in memory. She will try to remember the last time she rode her sleigh. She will frownand pucker her brows perhaps. Now tell her to go back to the last time she was sleigh riding.Coaxed she will suddenly come forth with a complete experience and, unless she is badlyaberrated, will be able to tell you about the snow getting down her collar and so forth. She isright back there sleigh riding, swimming or whatever you choose.Man, when and if he thought about this at all, must have mistaken it for imagination.But it is not imagination. Anyone, unless he is very severely aberrated indeed, can be “sentback” wide awake to an experience of the past. In initial tests one should use experiences notlong gone and experiences which are pleasant.This is not memory in the way one “remembers something.” It is returning.Remembering is a far more complicated process than returning. Just why people go aroundseeking to remember some specific or complex datum when they can return is something of amystery when one considers lost articles, things read, conversations had and so forth.Remembering, of course, has a very definite role and is an automatic process which provides“I” with conclusions and data in a never-ending stream. But when one wishes a very precise,specific bit of information or when one seeks a past pleasure to contemplate it, returning ismore to the point.The hypnotist, with much mumbo-jumbo and hand passes et al., has something whichhe calls “regression.” This is a very complicated business which requires being hypnotized.True enough, regression has research value since, by hypnosis, it by-passes occlusions whichare not otherwise easy to get around. And regression served dianetics well when the authorwas checking his data on memory banks. But it evidently had occurred to none that regressionis an artificial use of a natural process.Undoubtedly some people use returning for some of their mental work, and thesepeople probably think that “everybody else” does likewise, which is far from true. But eventhose people who return naturally seldom understand that this is a distinct process, muchdifferent from remembering.People also relive without being hypnotized or drugged; this is a rarer thing. If a personsits in contemplation ot some past glory for a while he will begin to relive instead of simplyreturn.In dianetics we have had much to do with “spectrums.” The spectrum of gradations is amuch better mechanism for philosophy than Aristotle’s pendulum which swung from oneextreme to the other. We have the spectrum of the dynamics. We call them four dynamics,through which the command: SURVIVE! is expressed, and the four are actually a great numberof gradations from the cells of “I” through “I,” through family and children, through club andcity and state, through nation and race and hemisphere and finally all Mankind. That is aspectrum: gradations of something which are really the same thing but which have wider andwider scope or range.In much the same way as the spectrum of SURVIVE! we have a spectrum of memoryat work. First there is memory in its most precise, present time sense. Then there is memory ofthe past. Then there is more memory of the past. And so we move into a part of the spectrumwhich has been overlooked: part of the “I” returns into the past, then a greater part of “I”returns into the past (at which point we have return) and finally, at the extreme all of “I” is back127"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"in the past. First there is remembering. This is the furthest from exact data (except in a clear).Then there is returning in which part of the “I” is actually in the past and records appear to beperceptions he is actually experiencing. Then there is reliving where a man is so thoroughly inthe past for the moment that, while he was recalling an infant experience, if startled he wouldreact just as he would have when a baby.There is a lot of aberrated notion in this present society about the evils of living in thepast. These stem partially from an unwillingness of aberrated people to face and understandyesterday.One of the prime sources of “bad memory” is Mother. Often enough Mother has beensufficiently panic-stricken at the thought of Junior’s recalling just what she did to Junior that aMankind-wide aberration seems to have sprung up. The standard attempted abortion casenearly always has an infanthood and childhood full of Mama assuring him that he cannotremember anything when he was a baby. She doesn’t want him to recall how handy she was,if unsuccessful, in her efforts with various instruments. Possibly prenatal memory itself wouldbe just ordinary memory and in full recall to the whole race if this guilty conscience in Motherhad not been rolling along lo! these millennia. In the normal course of work the auditor willhave his hands full of Mama screaming objections about her grown son’s or daughter’sentering into therapy because of what they might find out: Mama has been known, by auditors,to go into a complete nervous collapse at the thought of her child’s recalling prenatal incidents.Not all of this, by the way, is based on attempted abortion. Mama often has had a couple ofmore men than Papa that Papa never knew about; and Mama would very often rather condemnher child to illness or insanity or merely unhappiness than let a child pursue the course of thepre-clear even though Mother avowedly has no recollection whatever of anything bad everhappening to the child. Under therapy herself, she usually volunteers the truth.Here is the source of why good memory is discouraged in a society and infant andprenatal memory overlooked, to say nothing of the ability to return and relive.The index system of the standard bank is a wonderful thing to behold. Everything isthere, filed by subject, filed by time and filed by conclusions. All perceptions are present.With the time file system we have what is called in dianetics a time track. Going backalong this track with part of “I” is returning. It is definitely present for both conscious and“unconscious” data. The time track is of vast and interesting concern to the auditor.The mind is a well-built computer and it has various services. Auditors, backing offfrom Latin and complexity, call the source of one of these services, the file clerk. This is not avery dignified name and it is certainly anthropomorphic. There is no small man or woman inthere with a green eye-shade. But the action which takes place is a close approximation to whatwould happen if such an entity did dwell within the mind.The file clerk is the bank monitor. “He” monitors for both the reactive engram bank andthe standard banks. When he is asked for a datum by the auditor or “I,” he will hand out adatum to the auditor via “I.” He is a trifle moronic when he handles the reactive engram bank, acontagion from the reactive mind, and he will at times hand out puns and crazy dreams whenhe should be delivering serious data. The file clerk, if the auditor asks the pre-clear for the last time he saw a movie, willhand out the movie, the date it was seen, the age and physical being of the person, allperceptics, the plot of the movie, the weather -- in short, he hands out everything that waspresent and connected with the movie.In ordinary living the file clerk feeds memory to “I” at a rapid rate. A good memorygets its data in split seconds. If the file clerk has to shove the memory around various reactiveocclusions, it may take minutes or days for the data to arrive.128"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"If we had a big computing machine of the most modern design, it would have a“memory bank” of punched cards or some such thing and it would have to have a selector andfeeder device to thrust out the data the machine wants. The brain has one of these -- it could notoperate without it. This is the bank monitor -- the file clerk.Keep in mind these two parts of the mind: the time track and the file clerk and keep inmemory this mechanism of returning. These are the three things we use, with the reactive andstandard banks, in the dianetic reverie.The file clerk is a very obliging fellow. If he has been having trouble getting to the “I”around the reactive occlusions and circuits in general, he is particularly obliging. He cooperateswith the auditor.The monitor system could be considered on the basis of attention units where a mancould be supposed to have a thousand. Thus a thousand possible attention units would beavailable to a clear’s “I.” In the aberree, probably fifty are available to “I,” five or six hundredabsorbed in the reactive engrams, and the remainder variously used besides composing thismechanism we call the bank monitor, the file clerk.It seems as if the file clerk in an aberree would rather work with the auditor than withthe aberree. That may appear an astonishing fact, but it is a scientific fact. The file clerk worksbest, then, when he is selecting data out of a pre-clear’s banks to present to the auditor. This isan aspect of the law affinity. “I’s” file clerk and the auditor are a team: and they work veryoften in close harmony without enough consent from the pre-clear’s analyzer to notice.The return is most easily effected, in the aberree, by the auditor’s addressing the fileclerk, not the patient. This can actually be done with the patient wide awake. The auditor askshim for information, tells him to go back to it. “I” is suddenly in possession of the whole file.Something inside the mind, then, works in close harmony with the auditor and works better forthe auditor than it does for the person in whose mind it is. That is the file clerk.The object of the auditor is to take what the file clerk hands forth and to keep the fileclerk from getting swamped by reactive data. Once the data has been given out by the file clerk,it is the business of the auditor to see that the pre-clear goes over it enough times to take thecharge out of it. The mechanism of doing this is extremely simple. In order to help matters andkeep the pre-clear from being distracted, the auditor goes through a routine with every sessionwhich disposes the patient to let the file clerk work.The patient sits in a comfortable chair, with arms, or lies on a couch in a quite roomwhere perceptic distractions are minimal. The auditor tells him to look at the ceiling. Theauditor says: “When I count from one to seven your eyes will close.” The auditor then countsfrom one to seven and keeps counting quietly and pleasantly until the patient closes his eyes. Atremble of the lashes will be noticed in optimum reverie.This is the entire routine. Consider it more a signal that proceedings are to begin and ameans of concentrating the patient on his own concerns and the auditor than anything else. Thisis not hypnotism. It is vastly different. In the first place the patient knows everything which isgoing on around him. He is not “asleep,” and can bring himself out of it any time he likes. Heis free to move about, but, because it distracts the patient, the auditor does not usually permithim to smoke.The auditor makes very sure that the patient is not hypnotized by telling him, before hebegins to count, “You will know everything which goes on. You will be able to remembereverything that happens. You can exercise your own control. If you do not like what ishappening, you can instantly pull out of it. Now, one, two, three, four,” etc.To make doubly sure, for we want no hypnotism, even by accident, the auditor installsa canceller. This is an extremely important step and should not be omitted even when you may129"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"be entirely certain that he is in no way influenced by your words. The auditor mayinadvertently use restimulative language which will key-in an engram: he may, when he isespecially new in dianetics, use such a thing as a holder or a denyer, telling the pre-clear to“stay there” when he is returned on the track or telling him, worst of all things, to “forget it,”one of a class of phrases of the forgetter mechanism which is most severe in its aberrativeeffect, denying the data entirely to the analyzer. To prevent such things from happening, thecanceller is vital. It is a contract with the patient that whatever the auditor says will not becomeliterally interpreted by the patient or used by him in any way. It is installed immediately afterthe condition of reverie is established. A canceller is worded more or less as follows: “In thefuture, when I utter the word Cancelled, everything which I have said to you while you are in atherapy session will be cancelled and will have no force with you. Any suggestion I have madeto you will be without force when I say the word Cancelled. Do you understand?”The word cancelled is then said to the patient immediately before he is permitted to openhis eyes at the end of the session. It is not further amplified. The single word is used.The canceller is vital. It prevents accidental positive suggestion. The patient may besuggestible or even in a permanent light hypnotic trance (many people go through life in such atrance). An engram is actually a hypnotic suggestion. It could be said that the purpose oftherapy is to awaken a person in every period of his life when he has been forced into“unconsciousness.” Dianetics wakes people up. It is not hypnotism, which puts people tosleep. Dianetic therapy wakes them up. Hypnotism puts them to sleep. Can you ask for awider difference in polarity? Dianetic therapy removes engrams. Hypnotism installs engrams.Further, dianetics is a science, an organized body of knowledge -- hypnotism is a tool and anart and is such a wild variable that Man has suspected it as a dangerous thing for centuries andcenturies, use it though he did.The auditor will inevitably get cases into his hands which will drop into a hypnoticsleep for all he can do to prevent it. Such cases have engrams which make them do this, just asothers have engrams which make them stay awake. The auditor then mentions neither “sleep”nor “wake.” He takes his cases wherever they drop into their own inversion level and worksthem from there. Patients will plead to be drugged or put into a trance. Let them plead! Thereverie has a clear at its end -- drugs and hypnotism have dependency on the auditor and manyother undesirable aspects. A case takes longer in amnesia trance than in reverie. The gains inreverie are certain. The patient gets more and more well. When amnesia trance or hypnotismare used instead of reverie, no matter how easily the data seems to come up, the usual run ofcases so treated experience little relief until the case is nearly completed, when the patient solong uncomfortable gets suddenly well. Hypnotism carries with it transference, enormousoperator responsibility, and other impedimenta with which dianetics, in long practice, has donewithout. Hypnotism was used for research, then abandoned.Hence, install the canceller every time. Never neglect to install it in every session. Thepatient may be trancing, which is something we don’t want, but something which we cannotalways avoid, and which we cannot always detect. Just install the canceller at the beginning ofthe session, then before you bring the patient to present time, use the canceller word.This is a rehearsal, then, of the entire routine:Auditor: Look at the ceiling. When I count from one to seven your eyes will close. Youwill remain aware of everything which goes on. You will be able to remember everything thathappens here. You can pull yourself out of anything which you get into if you don’t like it. Allright (slowly, soothingly): One, two, three, four, five, six, seven*. One, two, three, four,five, six, seven. One, two, three (patient’s eyes close and eyelids flicker), four, five, six,seven. (Auditor pauses; installs canceller.) All right, let us go back to your fifth birthday...(work continues until the auditor has worked the patient enough for the period)... Come topresent time. Are you in present time? (Yes.) (Use canceller word.) When I count from five toone and snap my fingers you will feel alert. Five, four, three, two, one. (Snap.)130"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"As it can be seen in this example, when work for the day is concluded, the pre-clear,who may have been returned into his past for two hours, must be brought back to present timeand startled with a finger snap to restore his awareness of his age and condition. Sometimes heis unable easily to come back to present, for which there is quick remedy, which we will coverlater, so the auditor must always assure himself that the patient feels he actually is in presenttime.This is the reverie. This is all one needs to know about its actual mechanics. Experiencewill show him a great deal. But these are the basic processes:1. Assure patient he will know everything that happens.2. Count until he closes his eyes.3. Install canceller.4. Return him to a period in the past.5. Work with file clerk to get data.6. Reduce all engrams contacted so that no charge remains.7. Bring patient to present time.8. Be sure he is in present time.9. Give him canceller word.10. Restore full awareness of his surroundings.The patient’s time track, in the lowest level of attention units, is always in excellentcondition. It can be depended upon to reach any date and hour of his life and all the data in it.In the higher levels of awareness, this time track may appear to be in very foul condition. Thereactive mind engram circuits stand between these lower levels -- right up against the banks --and the higher levels which contain “I.” The lower levels contain only a shadow of the force of“I” and appear to be another “I” in a case of multi-valent personality.You can draw this on a piece of scratch paper and it would be helpful if you would doso. Draw a tall rectangle (the standard banks) to the left of the page. Draw half a dozen circlesup against the right side of this rectangle for a representation of the file clerk -- the bankmonitor units. Now draw, about the center of the sheet, a large rectangle. Black it in. This isthe area of the reactive engram circuits. It is not the reactive bank. It is the circuit pattern fromthe reactive engram bank, which borrows from the analyzer to make demons, vocal thinking,etc. Now, to the right of the page, draw a white rectangle. This is the portion of the analyzerwhich is “consciousness” and “I.”The whole task of therapy is to get that black rectangle, the reactive engram bankcircuits, deleted so that from the standard bank to the left of the sheet to the analyzer portion tothe right of the sheet is all analyzer. It can’t be done with a knife as some people havesupposed, evaluating the situation from their own engrams, for that black area you have drawnis all analyzer rendered useless by engrams and when therapy is done, it will all be available forthinking. This increases I.Q. to an enormous extent.Now suppose that the bottom of your picture is conception and the top is present time.The vertical route up and down, then, is the time track. In this graph it can be supposed thatpresent time just keeps adding up higher and higher, further and further from conception in theform of new construction (an analogy). For “I” to get data from the standard banks to the left,“I” would have to work through this black rectangle, the reactive mind circuits. To a large131"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"extent “I” manages to get data from around this black area. But to a much larger extent itdoesn’t.Now suppose that we draw a vertical line at the right of the picture. This line is“awareness.” Consider that it can be moved, still vertical, to the left. As the line passes towardthe left, we get deeper and deeper “trance.” As the line moves into the reactive mind area, itbecomes hypnotic trance. Now as it moves even further left and into the circles we are calling“file clerk,” it becomes the amnesia trance of hypnotism. Thus, anywhere we place this line weestablish a “depth of trance.” We want to work over to the right of the reactive bank, nearestthe awake level, so that we can keep “I” in contact with his surroundings and keep unwanteddata from coming through which will make the patient chronically uncomfortable. If the patientinstantly slides from the right all the way to the left so that the attention units, the circles, of thefile clerk itself are present, and does so the instant you count from one to seven, he is ahypnotic subject. He may not be aware, when he wakens, of what has taken place, for “I” wasout of contact. Work him there, for he will have full sonic, etc., but be very, very careful towork very early in his prenatal area. He might not be able to recall what has taken place and alate engram which, if tapped, will not reduce, may have its full force opened up on “I” whenthe patient regains possession of himself. Further, you might give him positive suggestion byaccident. Work by preference with trance depth well to the right of the reactive bank.The characteristics of the units we label “file clerk” are similar in desires to those of thebasic individual when he is cleared. Thus, in any patient, the basic personality can be reachedfor here is a sample of it. But the auditor should be content to know it is there; as the clearinggoes forward, he will see more and more of it. The individual is himself, his personality doesnot alter, it simply becomes what he wanted it to be all the time at his optimum moments.The units up against the standard banks can be considered the file clerk. But the fileclerk has more than just the standard bank which he can tap. He also has the entire engrambank from which he can pull forth data.The time track may have several aspects to the preclear. There is actually no track thereexcept time and time is invisible: but the awareness, the “I,” can return along it. The track isalways there, stretched out. But ideas of it continually occur and recur in the same patient. Itmay get all bunched up. It may be very long. It may be that he cannot get on it at all (here’s theschizophrenic -- he is off his time track). But it is there. It is the filing system by time and “I”can be returned back along time by the simple request that he do so. If he does not, he is stuckin the present or an engram, which is easy to resolve. And so forth.Now let us consider the engram bank. It was drawn as a black rectangle in the abovesketch. Let us alter that a trifle and draw all this again, with the rectangles represented astriangles with all their points downwards and together but all else as before -- the standardbanks, the analyzer (consciousness), and “I.” This is a working model now, an analogy, ofwhat the auditor is trying to contact. It is as if the engram bank itself existed in that blacktriangle. Actually it doesn’t, only its circuits, but all we need to visualize is that it does.Therefore, there is a thin point at the bottom. “I” and the file clerk can get together here. This isthe bottom of the time track. This is immediately after conception. A little higher up, let’s saytwo-and-one-half months after conception, it is a little harder for “I” and the file clerk toachieve contact. There is more reactive circuit between them. At seven months after conceptionit is more difficult. And at twenty years of age it has approached impossibility in most caseswithout dianetic technique.Hence, the auditor will find it expedient to work in the prenatal area and as early in thatas possible. If he can clear the time from conception to birth, including birth, his task is nine-tenths complete. To clear the entire reactive bank is his goal.The reactive bank is like a pyramid which is fairly well armored everywhere but justunder the point, and which becomes unarmored when the point is contacted. This is taking thereactive bank in an exposed sector. The effort is to get into the basic area, contact early132"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"engrams, erase the basic-basic engram by recountings and then progress upwards, erasingengrams. These engrams apparently vanish. Actually it takes a hard search to discove once theyare really gone. They exist as memory in the standard bank, but that memory is sounimportant, having been integrated now as experience, that it cannot aberrate. Nothing in thestandard bank can aberrate. Only the contents of the reactive bank can aberrate -- moments of“unconsciousness” and what was recorded within them -- and locks. The auditor, in his work,considers an engram erased when it vanishes, when the pre-clear can no longer contact any partof it, but only after the pre-clear has thoroughly re-experienced it, complete with somatics.*This inverted pyramid, in its upper reaches, is affect. In the lower reaches, it is theprimary cause of aberration. The cement that holds this inverted pyramid together is physicalpain and painful emotion. All the physical pain ever recorded by the organism and all thepainful emotion are parts of this inverted pyramid.The auditor first discharges the painful emotion from later life as it was displayed in“conscious moments.” He runs these periods as true engrams until the pre-clear is no longeraffected by them. Then he tries to contact basic-basic, that first engram. He reduces all engramshe contacts en route to that primary goal. In every session he tries to reach basic-basic until heis certain he has it.Basic-basic is the bottom point. Once it has been gained, an erasure is begun duringwhich engram after engram is “re-experienced” with all somatics until it is gone. Before basic-basic had been reached, the auditor may have had to run engrams twenty times before theyreduced. Later he may have found they reduced in five runs. Then he contacts and erases basic-basic. If the patient has sonic by this time -- or if he has had it all along -- the engrams starterasing with one or two recountings.The file clerk is smart. The auditor who does not credit the ability of these attentionunits will involve the case beyond necessity and will lengthen it. The file clerk may hand thingsout by phrases, by somatics, by time. Whatever he hands out ordinarily will reduce onrecountings. By working with, not trying to command, the file clerk, the auditor will find hiscase steadily improving until it is released or fully cleared. The only time the auditor disregardsthis is when he uses the repeater system, which will be described.We have “I” in a reverie; we return him to a period in his life along his time track; thefile clerk gives incidents forth which the pre-clear re-experiences; the auditor makes the pre-clear recount the engram until it is relieved or has “vanished”* (all engrams will eventually“vanish” after basic-basic is erased); anything new the file clerk offers, even during therecounting, is addressed by the auditor to make the pre-clear re-experience it. That is the totalsum of activity in dianetics. There are, as accessories, the repeater technique and a few short-cuts. This is therapy. Amplification is needed, of course, and will be found in the ensuingpages to give the auditor all the data he needs. But this is the entire outline of dianetic therapy.* The words “vanished” or “erased,” when applied to an engram which has been treated meanthat the engram has disappeared from the engram bank. It cannot be found afterwards exceptby search of the standard memory. 133"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIThe Laws of ReturningThe engram has the aspect of -- and is not -- a live entity which protects itself in variousways. Any and all phrases in it can be considered commands. These commands react on theanalytical mind in such a way as to cause the analytical mind to behave erratically.Dianetic therapy is parallel to the methods of thought and thinking itself. Anythingwhich reacts against dianetics and the auditor can uniformly and without exception be found toreact in just that way on the patient’s analytical mind. Conversely, the patient’s problems ofthinking in his usual activities are the auditor’s problems in therapy.The bulk of these “commands” the engrams contain are not computable in any way,since they are contradictory or demand unreasonable acts. It is the impossibility of computingthem and reconciling them to thought and existence which makes the patient aberrated. Let ustake an engram which comes from one of Mother’s bowel movements. She is straining, whichcauses compression, which brings about “unconsciousness” in the unborn child. Then, if shehabitually talks to herself (a monologist) as an enormous number of aberrated women do, shemay say, “Oh, this is hell. I am all jammed up inside. I feel so stuffy I can’t think. This is tooterrible to be borne.”This may be in the basic area. The dream mechanism of the mind (which thinks in punsmostly, symbologists to the contrary) may bring forth a dream about hell-fire as the engram isapproached. The pre-clear may be sure that he is going to descend into fire if he goes on histime track toward this engram. Further, he may think his time track is all jammed up. This willmean, perhaps, that the incidents are all in one place on it. So much for “This is hell,” and “alljammed up inside.” Now let us take a look at what happens with “I’m so stuffy, I can’t think.”The pre-clear sniffles because he thinks this means a cold in his nose. And as for “This is tooterrible to be borne,” he is filled with an emotion of terror at the thought of touching theengram, for this command says it is too painful to bear. Additionally, engrams being literal intheir action, he may think that he was too terrible to be born.The emotional reaction to hell, from some other place on the track -- as contained insome other engram -- may say that “going to hell” is loud sobbing. Hence he does not “want”to recount this engram. Further, he is terrified of it because it is “too terrible to be borne.” ThatMother was only discussing with her ambivalent self the necessity of laxatives is never enteredinto the computation. For the reactive mind does not reason, it thinks in identities, seeking tocommand the analytical mind.There is only as much data as is in the engram and the analytical reaction to thisunthinking thing is utterly literal.Let us look at another. This is a coitus experience. It has, as its somatic, varyingpressure. It is not painful and, by the way, no matter how painful these engrams may be inpresent time when restimulated, no matter how forceful, when they are actually contacted, theirreexperienced pain is very mild, no matter what it was when received. So this is a shaking upof the unborn child, that is all. But it says, “Oh, darling, I’m afraid you’ll come in me. I’ll justdie if you come in me. Oh please don’t come in me!”What does the analytical mind do with this? Does it think about coitus? Does it worryabout pregnancy? No, emphatically not. The engram that would make one think about coituswould say, “Think about coitus!” and the engram that contained a worry about pregnancywould say, “I am worried about pregnancy.” The pain is not severe in this coitus experiencebut it specifically states that the engram is not to be entered. “Do not come in me!” He woulddie if he did, wouldn’t he? It says so right there. And the patient finds himself wanderingaround the track until the auditor uses repeater technique (as will be covered).134"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"How about another type of engram? Let us suppose that our poor patient has beenunlucky enough to get a Junior tagged on him. Let us suppose his name is Ralph and hisfather’s name is Ralph. (Be careful of these Junior cases, they are unusually complexsometimes.) Mother (see the Kinsey report, if you’ve any doubts) is having a quiet affair onthe side with Jim. This coitus somatic is no more painful than being gently sat upon, but thepatient has a terrible time with it. Mother: “Oh, honey, you are so wonderful. I wish Ralphwere more like you but he isn’t. He just doesn’t seem to be able to excite a girl at all.” Lover:“Oh, Ralph isn’t so bad. I like him.” Mother: “You don’t know his pride. If Ralph found outabout this, it would kill him. He would just die, I know.” Lover: “Don’t worry, Ralph’ll neverhear.”This little gem of an engram is more common than one would suppose before he beginsto get an embryo-eye view of Mother. This won’t compute in the analyzer as data. Therefore itis a worry. (A worry is contradictory engram commands which cannot be computed.) Ralph,Junior, finds that he is very shy sexually. That is the aberrative pattern. Approaching it intherapy we find we have a sympathy computation with the lover. After all, he said Ralphwasn’t so bad, that he liked Ralph. Well, the only Ralph is, of course, to the reactive mind,Junior. This keeps our patient from approaching this engram because he thinks he will lose afriend if he touches it.Further, on the aberrative side, Junior has always worried about people’s pride. As wecontact this in therapy, he shies violently from it. After all, if he found out about it it would“kill him dead right where he lies.” And there is another thing here, a sonic shut-off. It saysright there that Ralph will never hear. This is survival stuff. That is what the cells believe.Therefore Ralph never hears in recall. There will be more sonic shut-offs; Mother ispromiscuous and that generally means blockage on the second dynamic. Blockage on thesecond dynamic often means she dislikes children. In short, this would be an attemptedabortion case which stabbed Junior full of enough holes to supply a cheese factory for sometime.Junior, now a man, may have extended hearing because he is frightened in general of“life.” But his sonic recall is zero. This engram, then, would have to be sorted out through thedemon circuits as “impressions” which come to the mind. The auditor, taking what the patientsays about this, may very soon guess its content and explode it by repeater technique.Now take the case of the mother who, a soul of propriety if a little on the whiny side,discovers she is pregnant and goes to the doctor. Mother: “I think I’m pregnant. I’m afraid Iam.” Doctor punches her around for a while, knocking the unborn child, who is our pre-clearthirty years later, into an “unconscious” state. Doctor: “I don’t think so.” Mother: “I’m reallyafraid I am. I’m sure I’m caught. I just know it.” Doctor (more punching): “Well, it’s hard totell this early.”It says right there that this man patient of ours is pregnant. If we look, we’ll see he hasa paunch. That’s good survival, that is. And in therapy we find he is afraid he exists: I amafraid I am. And suddenly he isn’t moving on the time track. Why? He’s caught. That doesn’tmean he’s pregnant, that means he is caught. Further, he won’t be able to recount it. Why?Because it is hard to tell this early. Consequently he doesn’t speak about it. We free him on thetrack with repeater technique.Oh, this language of ours which says everything it doesn’t mean! Put into the hands ofthe moronic reactive mind, what havoc it wreaks! Literal interpretation of everything! Part ofthe aberrative pattern of the person who had the above engram was great cautiousness aboutadvancing any opinion. After all, it was hard to tell, this early.Now let us take an engram from a girl patient whose father was badly aberrated. Hestrikes Mother because he is afraid Mother is pregnant and Father is blocked on Dynamics One,Two, Three and Four. Father: “Get out! Get out! I know you haven’t been true to me! You135"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"were no virgin when I married you. I should have killed you long ago! Now you’re pregnant.Get out!”The girl, some five weeks after conception, is knocked “unconscious” by the blow toMother’s abdomen. She has a severe engram here because it has painful emotional value whichshe will never be able to dramatize satisfactorily. The aberrative pattern here demonstrates itselfin hysterics whenever a man might accuse her of not being true. She was a virgin when shewas married twenty-one years after this engram was received, but she was sure she was not.She has had a “childhood delusion” that her father was likely to kill her. And she is alwaysafraid of being pregnant because it says now she is pregnant, which means always, since timeis a march of “nows.” In therapy we try to get near this engram. We return the patient to basicarea and suddenly find her talking about something which happened when she was five yearsof age. We return her again and now she is talking about something which happened when shewas ten years of age. The auditor, observing any such reaction as this, knows he is handling abouncer. It says, “Get out!” and the patient gets out. The auditor recognizes what is wrong,uses repeater technique, and reduces or erases the engram.Always and invariably, the analytical mind reacts to these engrams as thoughcommanded. It performs on the track as these engrams state. And it computes about the case orabout life as these engrams dictate. Healthy things to have around, engrams! Real, goodsurvival! Survival good enough to lay any man in his grave.The auditor is not much worried by the phrases which assist therapy. An engramreceived from Father beating Mother which says: “Take that! Take it, I tell you. You’ve got totake it!” means that our patient has possibly had tendencies as a kleptomaniac. (Such things arethe whole source of the impulses of a thief, the test being that when an auditor erases all suchengrams in a patient, the patient no longer steals.) The auditor will find it eagerly recountedbecause its content offers it to the analytical mind.The whole species of engrams which say, “Come back here! Now stay here!” asFathers are so fond of saying, account for a snap back to an engram when therapy is entered.The patient goes straight back to it the moment it is exposed. When recounted the command isno longer effective. But while that engram existed, unentered, it was fully capable of sendingpeople to an institution to lie in a foetal position. Anyone left in institutions who has not beengiven shocks or pre-frontal lobotomy and who suffers from this type of insanity can bereleased from such an engram and restored to present time simply by use of repeater technique.It sometimes takes only half an hour.Traveling on the track, then, and wandering through the computations the analyzer iscompelled by these engrams to attempt is something like playing a child’s game which has anumber of squares and along which one is supposed to move a “man.” A game could actuallybe composed on the basis of this time track and engram commands. It would be similar toparchesi. Move so many squares, land on one which says, “Get out!” which means one wouldgo back to present time or toward it. Move so many squares and then lose a move because thissquare on which we now land says, “Stay here!” and the “man” would stay until the auditor lethim out by technique (but because this is struck by therapy, it would have no power to holdlong). Then move so many squares to one which said, “Go to sleep,” at which the “man”would have to go to sleep. Move so many squares until one was hit which said, “Nobody mustfind out,” and so there would be no square. Move so many until one was reached which said,“I’m afraid,” at which the “man” would be afraid. Move again to a square which said, “I mustgo away,” so the “man” would go away. Move once more to a square which says, “I’m nothere,” and the square would be missing. And so forth and so forth.The classes of commands which particularly trouble the auditor are only a few. Becausethe mind actually does some part of its thinking, especially when remembering, by return, evenwhen the individual is not returning, all these commands also impede the thought processes ofthe mind. In therapy they are particularly irksome and are the constant target of attention of theauditor.136"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"First is the patient-ejector species of command. These are colloquially called“bouncers.” They include such things as “Get out!” “Don’t ever come back,” “I’ve got to stayaway,” etc. etc., including any combination of words which literally mean ejection.Second is the patient-holder species of command. These include such things as “Stayhere,” “Sit right there and think about it,” “Come back and sit down,” “I can’t go,” “I mustn’tleave,” etc.Third is the engram-denyer species of command which, literally translated, means thatthe engram doesn’t exist: “I’m not here,” “This is getting nowhere,” “I must not talk about it,”“I can’t remember,” etc.Fourth is the engram-grouper species of command which, literally translated, meansthat all incidents are in one place on the time track: “I’m jammed up,” “Everything happens atonce,” “Everything comes in on me at once,” “I’ll get even with you,” etc.Fifth is the patient-misdirector which sends the pre-clear in the wrong direction, makeshim go earlier when he should be going later, go later when he should go earlier, etc. “Youcan’t go back at this point,” “You’re turned around,” etc.The bouncer sends the pre-clear soaring back toward present time. The holder keepshim right where he is. The denyer makes him feel that there is no incident present. The fourth,the grouper, foreshortens his time track so that there is no time track. The misdirector reversesthe necessary direction of travel.Contacting any engram causes the pre-clear to react “analytically.” Just as in the case ofan engram being restimulated, the commands are impinged upon his analyzer, and although theanalyzer may firmly believe it has just computed the reaction all of its own accord, it is actuallyspeaking straight out of the content of an engram or engrams.This is the method of repeater technique.As he goes back along the track contacting engrams, the pre-clear runs into areas of“unconsciousness” which are occluded by “unconsciousness” or emotion. In most earlyengrams the pre-clear can be expected to yawn and yawn. It is not the command “to sleep”which is responsible for this: the “unconsciousness” is releasing (boiling off, the auditors callit). A pre-clear may, for a space of two hours, fumble around, drop off into“unconsciousness,” appear doped, start to go to sleep, without any such command beingpresent.Part of the engram bundle of data is the analyzer shut-off. When he is returned and anengram is contacted, the pre-clear then experiences an analyzer attenuation, which means he ismuch less able to think in the area. Boiling-off “unconsciousness” is a process very necessary to therapy, for this“unconsciousness” could be restimulated in the everyday life of the individual and, whenrestimulated, make his wits shut off just a little or a very great deal, slowing down his thoughtprocesses.The aspect of “unconsciousness,” then, reduces the pre-clear’s awareness whenever itis contacted. He has dreams, he mumbles foolish things, he flounders. His analyzer ispenetrating the veil which kept him from the engram. But it is also highly susceptible, when inthis state, to an engram command.When urged by the auditor to go through the engram and recount it (although theauditor knows it may take minutes for this “unconsciousness” to boil off enough to let thepatient through) the pre-clear may complain that “I can’t go back at this point.” The auditorpromptly takes note of this. It is an engram command coming through. He does not apprise the137"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"patient of this knowledge; the patient usually doesn’t know what he’s saying. If the patientthen continues to have trouble, the auditor tells him, “Say, ‘I can’t go back at this point.’” Thepatient then repeats this, the auditor making him go over it and over it. Suddenly the somaticturns on and the engram is contacted.In interviewing a patient, the auditor notes carefully without appearing to do so, whatphrases the patient chooses and repeats about his ills or about dianetics. After he has placed thepatient in reverie, if he discovers the patient, for instance, insists he “can’t go any place,” theauditor makes him repeat the phrase.Repetition of such a phrase, over and over, sucks the patient back down the track andinto contact with an engram which contains it. It may happen that this engram will not release --having too many before it -- but it will not release only in case it has that same phrase in anearlier engram. So the repeater technique is continued with the auditor making the patient goearlier and earlier fur it. If all goes on schedule the patient will very often let out a chuckle or alaugh of relief. The phrase has been sprung. The engram has not been erased, but that much ofit will not thereafter influence therapy.Anything the patient does about engrams and any words he uses to describe the actionare contained, usually, in those engrams. Repeater technique takes the charge off the phrasesso that the engrams can be approached.This technique, of course, can very occasionally land the patient in trouble, but the kindof trouble into which one can get in dianetics is not very severe. The engram, restimulated ineveryday life, can be and is violent. Murders, rapes and arsons, attempted abortions,backwardness in school, -- any aberrated aspect of life -- stems from these engrams. But theact of approaching them in dianetic therapy goes on another channel, a channel closer to thesource of the engram. Ordinarily, acting on an unsuspecting individual, the engram hasenormous motor and speech power, ties up great numbers of circuits in the mind which shouldbe used for rationality, and generally effects havoc: its contacts are “soldered-in” and cannot bethrown out by the analyzer. In therapy the patient is headed toward the engram: that act alonebegins to disconnect some of its “permanent leads.” A patient can be gotten into an engramwhich, unless approached on the therapy route, might have made him curl up like a foetus andget shipped off to the nearest institution. On the therapy route, which is a return down the timetrack, the most powerful holder has its force limited: a patient can get into a holder which innormal life might be a psychosis: his only manifestation, perhaps, is that when he is told to“Come up to present time,” he simply opens his eyes without actually traversing the interval upthe track to present time. He does not suspect he is in a holder until the auditor, watchful forsuch a manifestation, feeds him repeater technique. AUDITOR: Are you in present time? PRE-CLEAR: Sure. AUDITOR: How do you feel? PRE-CLEAR: Oh, I’ve got a slight headache. AUDITOR: Close your eyes. Now say: “Stay here.” PRE-CLEAR: All right. Stay here. Stay here. Stay here. (Several times) AUDITOR: Are you moving? PRE-CLEAR: No. AUDITOR: Say “I’m caught. I’m caught.” 138"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"PRE-CLEAR: I’m caught. (Several times) AUDITOR: Are you moving on the track? PRE-CLEAR: Nope. AUDITOR: Say, “I’m trapped.” PRE-CLEAR: I’m trapped. I -- Ouch, my head! AUDITOR: Keep going over it. PRE-CLEAR: I’m trapped. I’m trapped. I’m trapped, Ouch! That’s worse! (His somatic isgetting stronger as he approaches the engram holding him on the other side of the“unconsciousness” veil) AUDITOR: Keep going over it. PRE-CLEAR: I’m trapped -- “Oh, God, I’m trapped. I’ll never get out of this place. I’ll neverget out. I’m trapped!” AUDITOR: Contact it closely. Make sure there is nothing more in it. (A trick to keep the pre-clear from replaying what he himself has just said and keep running the engram) PRE-CLEAR: My head hurts! Let me come up to present time! AUDITOR: Go through it again. (If the pre-clear comes up with this much charge, he’ll beunhappy and the incident may be hard to enter next time) PRE-CLEAR: “Oh, God, I’m trapped. I’m afraid I’m trapped (new word showed up). I’llnever get out of this place as long as I live. I’m trapped. I’ll never get out. I’m trapped.”(aside) She’s crying. “Oh, why did I ever have to marry such a man!” AUDITOR: How’s your head?

If he replays rather than re-experiences, the engram won’t lift) PRE-CLEAR: (Does so, getting some new words and several sounds including the thud of theblows on her abdomen and an auto horn (bulb type) in the street outside) Don’t tell me I haveto run this thing again. AUDITOR: Recount it, please. PRE-CLEAR: Well, so this dame tries to bust my head in and get rid of me. And so I jumpedout and beat hell out of her. AUDITOR: Please re-experience the engram. PRE-CLEAR: (Starts to do so, suddenly finds out that like a piece of string with a loop in it,this engram has straightened out and contains more data where the loops were). “I’ve got tothink of something to tell Harry. He’ll jump all over me.” ( This was the source of his joking --“jumped out, etc.”) AUDITOR: Please go over it again. There may be more in it. 139"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"PRE-CLEAR: (Does so, old parts of it reduce, two new sounds appear, her footsteps andrunning water. Then he is happy laughs at it. This engram is released because it may not haveentirely vanished. Such an engram is in this shape only when it is contacted prior to basic-basic.)This is both repeater technique and an engram talked into recession. This engram mayappear again with a very faint additional charge after basic-basic is contacted, but it has lost allpower to aberrate or give out a psycho-somatic headache or other illness. Yet this engram, notcontacted by therapy, was quite enough to make this patient, when a boy, scream with terrorevery time he found he could not get out of some closed space (claustrophobia).The repeater technique is the one particular phase of dianetics which requires clevernessfrom the auditor. Given persistency and patience, any auditor can succeed in the other phasesof the science with minimal intelligence. In the repeater technique he must learn how to think --for therapy purposes -- like an engram. And he will have to observe how the subject isconducting himself along the time track. And he will have to observe the type of reaction thesubject has and draw from this the conclusion as to what sort of command is troubling thesubject when the subject himself either does not cooperate or does not know.This is not to say that the repeater technique is hard: it is not. But the ability of theauditor to use it is the principal reason why a case takes longer with one auditor than another. Itis a definite ability. It is playing the game mentioned earlier with cleverness. Where is the pre-clear stuck and with what command? Why has the pre-clear suddenly stopped cooperating?Where is the emotional charge which is holding up the case? With the repeater technique theauditor can resolve all these problems and a clever auditor resolves them much faster than anunclever one.How does one think like an engram? Ronald Ross, discovering that insects carriedgerms, considered it necessary to think like a mosquito. Here is a similar menace, the engram.One has to learn to think, for therapy purposes, like an engram.The auditor could not and does not have to be able to look into a patient’s eyes andguess why the patient won’t eat anything but cauliflower on Wednesdays. That is an aberrationand the auditor does not have to guess at either aberrations or psycho-somatic illness sources;they all come out in time and he will learn much about them as he goes. But the auditor must beable to keep his patient straightened out on the track, moving earlier into the basic area, movingupwards from there for a reduction. The current answer to this is the repeater technique.Understand that a whole new art of practice, or many arts of practice, could be evolved fordianetics: one would be unhappy with his fellow man if such evolution and betterment did nottake place. Just now the best that has come forward -- and the criterion of best is that it worksuniformly in all cases -- is the repeater technique. The auditor must be able to use it if heexpects anything like results from a case at this time. When the auditor -- or some auditor -- hasrun a few cases and knows the nature of this beast, the engram, he may -- and better had --come forward with improved techniques of his own. The real drawback which repeatertechnique has is that it requires the auditor to be clever.Being clever does not mean talking a lot. In dianetics, when one is auditing, that isbeing very unclever. Indeed auditors, when they begin to work cases, almost invariably solove the sound of their own voices and the feel of their skill that the poor pre-clear hardly gets achance to get a word in reactive-wise -- and it is the pre-clear who is to be cleared, who has theonly accurate information, who can make the only evaluations.Being clever in the sense of the repeater technique is being able to pick out, from thesubject’s conversation or action, just what the engrams contain which will prevent his reachingthem, progressing through them and so forth. The repeater technique is addressed only toaction, not to aberration.140"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Here is a case, for instance, which was so “sealed-in” that thirty hours of almostcontinual repeater technique were necessary to break the walls between the analytical mind andthe engrams. It is important to know that an engram would not be an engram if the pre-clearcould contact it easily. Any engram which can be easily contacted and has no emotional chargeis about as aberrative as a glass of soda water.A young girl, with sonic recall, but with extended hearing and such a completeimbalance of the endocrine system that she had become an old woman at twenty-two, wasworked for seventy-five hours before she contacted anything in the basic area. This is almostincredible but it happened. In a patient with sonic shut-off and off his time track, seventy-fivehours of work would just about get the wheels greased. But this girl, having sonic recall,should have been well on the road to being clear and she had yet to touch basic-basic.By repeater technique and repeater alone the case was finally resolved. It containedpractically no holders or bouncers. It simply appeared that the whole prenatal area was a blank.Now it happens that an engram, being not a memory with reason in it, is just a set ofwaves or some other type of recording which impinges itself on the analytical mind and thesomatic mind and runs the voice and muscles and other parts of the body. The analytical mind,to justify what it finds going forward, and cut down by the engram in dramatization, may beinterjecting data to make this action seem reasonable -- to justity it. But this does not make anengram sentient. When an engram is first approached in therapy it appears to be absent entirely.It may be that three sessions will be required to “develop” this engram. As many are worked,this does not mean three blank sessions, but it means that the “I,” in returning, must pass overan engram a few times for the engram to “develop.” This is important to know. Just as you askthe mind for a datum one week and don’t find it (in an aberree) and ask it again the next weekand find it, so with engrams. A cardinal principle in therapy is that if you keep asking for it,you will eventually get the engram. Returning over and over the prenatal area will, of itselfalone, eventually develop the engrams in it so that the analytical mind can attack them andreduce them. This is slow freight. The repeater technique -- although the engram is still in needof development by several sessions -- speeds the process immensely.In the case of this young girl it probably would have taken another fifty or sixty hoursof work to contact the engrams unless a technique like repeater had been used.Repeater technique resolved it when the auditor noted that she kept saying, “I’m surethere’s a good reason why I feel bad up in my childhood. After all, my brother raped me whenI was five. I’m sure it’s up in my childhood, much later. My mother was terribly jealous ofme. I’m sure it’s later.”This young lady, as might be imagined, had studied some school of mental healing incollege which thought sex or eating vitamins caused aberrations of the mind and she had oftenheld forth on the fact that while she was not averse to what she called “analysis” she did think itdull to expect a foetus to hear anything. She would go into the area before birth and declare shewas quite comfortable. But birth was not in sight. That is important. The basic engram orengrams in the basic area -- around the embryo period -- cannot vanish and will not vanishshort of therapy, and when birth cannot even be contacted by so much as one somatic, it iscertain that something lies before it. If birth were the first engram, everybody could be clearedin five hours. Birth can even be in sight and there may still remain half a hundred severeprenatal experiences. In her case, nothing was in sight. Her educational pattern had slowed thecase: she was always trying to sit in present time and “remember” with a memory so full ofocclusions that she couldn’t have recalled her mother’s right name. (She had acquired this frombeing in the hands of mental practitioners for ten years who had asked her to do nothing but“remember.”) As has been said, she was quite comfortable before birth, sensed the amnioticfluid and was certain that life in the womb was a joyous life for all. The incongruity that shecould experience the sensations of this amniotic fluid and floating comfort and warmth and acontinued belief that there was no prenatal memory escaped her utterly. The auditor made no141"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"slightest effort to convince her. Knowing his business, he merely kept sending her back andforth, trying this mechanism or that.She finally wanted to know if there had to be prenatal experience and was told that whatwas there was there, that if there was no prenatal memory then she wouldn’t recall any but thatif there was, she might. This is a good, equivocal attitude for an auditor. Dianetics, after all, asone auditor put it, “just shows the yard goods” and makes no sales effort at all.The auditor had been using repeater technique on varieties of phrases. She was movingon the track so there must be a denyer present. And he had utterly run out of ideas when herealized, suddenly, that she was very handy with that phrase, “much later.”AUDITOR: Say “Much later” and return into the prenatal area.GIRL: “Much later. Much later,” etc. (very bored and uncooperative).AUDITOR: Continue please. (Never say “Go ahead” for that means to do just that. Say“Continue” when you want them to keep on progressing along an engram or repeating and“Return over it” when re-running an engram already run once.)GIRL: “Much later. Much...” I have a somatic in my face! It feels like I am being pushed.(This was good news for the auditor knew she had a mid-prenatal pain shut-off whichprevented later somatics from appearing.)AUDITOR: Contact it more closely and continue to repeat.GIRL: “Much later. Much later.” It’s getting stronger. (Naturally. On repeater technique, thesomatic gets stronger until the phrase appears, exactly right. On a non-sonic case it impingesitself indirectly on “I”; in a sonic, the sound comes through as sound.)AUDITOR: Continue.GIRL: “Much...” I hear a voice! There. That’s it. Why, that’s my father’s voice!AUDITOR: Listen to the words and repeat them, please.GIRL: He’s talking to my mother. Say, this face pressure is uncomfortable. It keeps going upand down on me. It hurts!AUDITOR: Repeat his words please.GIRL: He’s saying: “Oh honey, I won’t come in you now. It’s better to wait until much laterto have one.” And there’s my mother’s voice. Say, this pressure is hurting me. No, it’s easedup considerably. Funny, the minute I contacted his voice, it got less.AUDITOR: What is your mother saying, please, if you hear her?GIRL: She’s saying: “I don’t want you in there at all then!” She’s mad! Say, the somaticstopped. (Coitus had ended at this point.) AUDITOR: Please return to the start of this and recount.GIRL: (Regains the beginning, somatic returns) I wonder what they’re doing? (then a pause) Ihear a squishing sound! (then a pause and embarrassment) Oh!AUDITOR: Recount the engram please.142"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"GIRL: There’s a sort of a faint rhythm at first and then it gets faster. I can hear breathing.Now it’s beginning to bear down harder but a lot less than it did the first time. Then it eases upand I hear my father’s voice: “Oh, honey I won’t come in you now. It’s better to wait untilmuch later to have one. I’m not too sure I like children that well. Besides, my job ...” And mymother must shove at him because there’s a sharper somatic here. “I don’t want you in there atall then. You cold fish!”AUDITOR: Return to the beginning and recount it again, please.GIRL: (Recounts it several times, somatic finally vanishes. She feels quite cheerful about itbut doesn’t think to mention that she doubted prenatals existed.)This is repeater technique at work. This particular case had had about two hundredphrases thrown at her for repeater technique without finding one of them that would fit. In thefirst place, there were only a few lower engrams which the file clerk was willing to give outand the auditor was guessing at the whole gamut of deniers. A later incident might havecontained -- and did but no somatic appeared -- numbers of the phrases he used. But the fileclerk was willing to settle for this one for it was early and could be erased.The file clerk rarely hands out something in a badly occluded case which cannot bereduced to recession. And an auditor never leaves an engram so offered until he has madeevery effort with many recountings to reduce it. The file clerk, in this case, by the bye, wouldhave let down the auditor by putting forth such an engram as birth, which would not have liftedand which would have caused a lot of lost work and given the patient a headache for a fewdays. The auditor would have let the file clerk down if he had not reduced the engram offeredby making the girl go over it several times until the somatic was gone and the voice faded out.The reason this engram stayed hidden was because its content said so. Actually it was acoitus. As an engram it seemed to say that the incidents would be found later on in life.Further, as an engram, it said that it was not to be entered.Repeater technique will sometimes embroil a patient in trouble of a minor sort bygetting him “sucked into” incidents which will not lift. This is not common but the file clerkoccasionally hands out a late incident, rather than an early one. However, this is not an error onthe part of the file clerk. Remember, he has these engrams filed by subject, somatic and time,and the auditor can use any one of these. When the file clerk responds and hands out a somaticon a repeater phrase the auditor has gleaned from the pre-clear’s chatter or has guessed himselfand yet that somatic will not lift or no voice appears with it (in a sonic case, or merely won’t liftwith a non-sonic), the file clerk had to unstack a pile of material. Therefore, the auditor,realizing this, finding that a voice does not appear or that the somatic will not lift, has the pre-clear repeat the same phrase and tells him to go earlier and earlier. Another somatic may turn upin a different place in the body. The file clerk has gotten an even earlier one loose, now that asmall amount of trouble has been taken from what he could first get. Now this earlier one isaddressed similarly. It may get mediumly strong as a somatic, the pre-clear repeating the phraseall the while, and still no voice may appear. The auditor then sends the pre-clear earlier. Thefile clerk again has managed to get out an even earlier one, now that something has been takenfrom the second. This time again, an even earlier somatic turns on, probably down around thebasic area in a case which has not previously contacted this area, and this time a voice can beheard. The engram reduces. The file clerk, in short, was willing to risk trouble in order to getseveral somatics unstacked and let the auditor get a basic incident.There are variations on this sort of thing. As the filing system is by subject, somaticand time, the auditor can use other things than phrases. He can send a pre-clear to the “highestintensity of a somatic,” and often results may be obtained, though this is not as reliable as bysubject nor as foolproof. The pre-clear, incidentally, does not mind going to any “highestintensity” of somatic because somatics are about a thousandth part as strong as the originalagony, though they are quite strong enough. In present time with the pre-clear not in therapy,the intensity of one of these somatics can be a drastic affair as witness the migraine headache.143"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Taking the migraine, a pre-clear can be returned to the very moment of its reception when onewould think its intensity would be the highest and yet find a mild, dull ache such as one wouldget with a hangover. This is part of the principle that any entrance of a case is better than a casenot entered at all. For by return with standard reverie technique the source is approached, and ifthe source is contacted at all, the power of the engram to aberrate has become reduced instrength no matter how many mistakes the auditor makes.Returning to “maximum intensity” of a somatic, then, is nothing very painful. Actualmaximum intensity is when the pre-clear is awake before the contact with the incident is made.But in returning to “maximum intensity” the incident may often be contacted and reduced. If“maximum intensity” however, contains in its engram the phrases, “I can’t stand it!” “It’skilling me,” or “I’m terrified,” then expect our pre-clear to respond to it in some such way. Ifhe does not respond, then he has an emotional shut-off, which is another problem which willbe taken up later.Similarly, the auditor can handle his pre-clear in time. There exists a very accurateclock in the mind. The file clerk is very well acquainted with this clock and wherever possiblewill comply. The auditor who wants the patient to go “six minutes before this phrase is uttered”will generally find that his pre-clear is now six minutes before it, even though the incident isprenatal. The auditor can bring his pre-clear forward, then, minute by minute as he desires. Hecan take a pre-clear straight through an incident by announcing, “It is one minute later, it is twominutes later. Three minutes have gone by,” and so forth. The auditor does not have to wait forthose minutes to elapse; he just announces them. He can make a pre-clear go through time atfive minute intervals or hour intervals or day intervals, and unless there is engramic materialwhich holds him or otherwise affects the operation, the auditor can move the pre-clear on thetime track at will. It would be very nice if the auditor could send the pre-clear to conception andthen tell him it is one hour later, two hours later and so forth to pick up the first engram.However, there are more factors involved than time, and the plan, though pretty, is notfeasible. The time shift is generally used when the auditor is trying to get the pre-clear ahead ofan incident to make sure that he really has a beginning. By returning the pre-clear by five or tenminute intervals, the auditor may sometimes discover that he is running backwards into a verylong and complicated incident and that the headache he has been seeking to alleviate on the pre-clear was received, actually, hours before the period in which he thought it had initially beenreceived. In such a case there is a second engram appended to an earlier engram and theauditor cannot lift the second one until he has the first one.Actually time shift is of limited use. The auditor who tries to go chasing backwardsthrough time will find that he will have on his hands an artificially restimulated case and that thework is much impeded. Repeater technique works best and is most easily handled by the fileclerk. The auditor uses a time shift to get the pre-clear as close to basic area (early prenatal) aspossible and then generally, if the file clerk doesn’t simply go to work handing out engramswhich can be washed, one after the other, the auditor uses repeater technique. Time shift and“running down a somatic” have some limited use. Some experimentation will show about howmuch use they have.The laws of regression are these:(1) A returned patient reacts more, theoretically, to those commands which are earlier thanhe is on the time track and less to those commands which are later than his point intime.(2) A pre-clear reacts to those engramic commands which are: (a) in chronic restimulation,or (b) to which he is nearest on the time track. Thus, if an engram says, “I’m afraid,”he is. If it says, “I’d rather die than face this,” he would. If the command to which he isnear says, “I’m sleepy,” he will be. If it says, “Forget it,” he will. Commands inchronic restimulation give a false color to the personality: “I can never be sure ofanything,” “I don’t know,” “I can’t hear anything” are all possibly in chronic144"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"restimulation. If the file clerk won’t give them up, then keep working the case anywayaround these. They will give up after a while.(3) The action of the pre-clear on the time track and the condition of the track are regulatedexclusively by engramic commands classifiable as bouncers, holders, denyers andgroupers and misdirectors. (These conditions, it is repeated, are quite variable, asvariable as language: “I don’t know whether I am coming or going,” for instance in anengram makes it very confusing. “I can’t go back at this point” makes the pre-clearkeep progressing later and later.)(4) The engramic command manifests itself either in the awake speech of the pre-clear aftera session of therapy or is inadvertently announced as a supposedly “analytical” thoughtwhen he nears the vicinity of the command.(5) The engram is not a sentient, rationalized memory but a collection of unanalyzedperceptions, and it will develop into contact simply by the process of returning throughit, to it, over it or asking for it.(6) The file clerk will give the auditor whatever can be extracted from the engram bank.The auditor must aid the file clerk by reducing in charge or severity everything the fileclerk offers. This is done by making the patient recount it. (Otherwise the file clerk getsso much material piled around that, with this in restimulation, he can no longer get atthe files. The auditor who bucks the file clerk is not rare. The file clerk who will buckan auditor except by withholding data which will not reduce has yet to be found.)The techniques available to the auditor are as follows:1. Returning, in which the pre-clear is sent as early as possible on his track before therapyitself is engaged upon.2. Repeater technique, by which the file clerk is asked for data on certain subjects,particularly those affecting the return and travel on the time track, and which aid theability of the pre-clear to contact engrams.3. Time shift, by which a pre-clear can be moved short or long distances on the track byspecific announcement of the amount of time forward the pre-clear is to go or timebackwards, or return or progression through intervals of time. (It is also useful to findout if the pre-clear is moving or which direction he is moving on the time track in orderto discover the action some engram may be having upon him.)4. Somatic location, by which the moment of reception of the somatic is located, in aneffort to discover whether it is received in this engram or to find an engram containingit.145"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIIEmotion and the Life ForceOne of the largest roles in therapy is played by Emotion. In the second book wecovered this subject and divided it tentatively as a theory only into three divisions: (a) theemotions contained in the command of engrams whereby physical pain became confused withemotions; (b) the emotions contained as endocrine reactions subject to the analytical mind of theclear and the analytical mind and reactive mind of the aberree; and (c) the emotions contained inengrams which bound up free units of Life force.Further work and research on emotion will undoubtedly bring about an even closerunderstanding of it. But we have a workable knowledge of emotion now. We can use what weknow and produce results with it. When we know more, we shall be able to produce muchbetter results but just now we can produce the release and the clear. If we treat emotion asbound up life force and if we follow these general precepts to release it, we shall obtain a verylarge gain in any pre-clear; indeed, we shall produce our largest single gains by so releasingemotion.In an engineering science like dianetics, we can work on a push-button basis. We knowthat throwing a switch will stop a motor, that closing it again will start it and that no matter howmany times we open or close that switch our motor will stop or start. We are using here a forcewhich is still as mysterious to us as electricity was to James Clerk Maxwell. Much earlierBenjamin Franklin had observed that electricity existed and had done some interesting thingswith it: but he had not used it much and he could not control it. A philosopher like Bergsonselected out a thing he called elan vital, a life force. Man is alive, there must be a force or flowof something which keeps him alive; when Man is dead there is no force or flow. This is lifeforce in the Benjamin Franklin stage. As he considered electricity, so did Bergson consider lifeforce. Now we are up, in dianetics, to the James Clerk Maxwell stage, or very nearly. Weknow that certain equations can be made about life force and we can use those equations. Andwe can theorize that “life force” and what has been called a certain kind of “emotion” are eithersimilar or the same thing. We may have the wrong theory, but so might James Clerk Maxwell.Indeed, Maxwell’s theories may still be wrong: at least we have electric lights. In dianetics weare pretty certain that the majority of tenets are parallels of natural law: these are the bigcomputations. We are not certain that we have emotion properly bracketed, but then we shallnot be sure until we have actually taken a dead man and pumped him up with life force again.Short of this extreme, we are on solid ground with emotion as life force.We can, for instance, take a girl, examine something of her background with, let ussay, an electro-encephalograph (an instrument for measuring nervous impulses and reactions)and then proceed on the basis of the information so obtained to do one or two things. The firstis inhuman and would not be done, ot course, but she could be made sick or insane merely byusing this data, so obtained. (If the data is obtained in therapy, it is obtained by actual contactwith engrams and an engram contacted in reverie has lost its power to aberrate: dianetictherapy thus makes such an eventuality utterly impossible.) The second and far more importantfact to us is that she can be made to recover, with this same data, all the force, interest,persistence and tenacity to life and all the physical and mental well-being possible. If it couldnot be made to work both ways, we would not have the answer, at least in workable form.(Some fiction writer, by the way, if tempted to horrorize on the first fact, must please recall thatthe data was obtained with apparatus which would have staggered Doctor Frankenstein forintricacy and skill in use and that dianetic therapy contacts the data at source: the apparatus isnecessary to keep from touching the source for the instant the source is touched by therapy itspower vanishes like yesterday’s headlines: so let’s have no “Gaslight” plays about dianetics,please: they’d be technically inaccurate.)This is not as simple as electricity in that the switch cannot be turned off and on. So faras dianetics is concerned, it can only be turned on. We have a rheostat, then, which will not146"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"drop back but which, when pressed forward, releases more and more dynamic force into theindividual and gives him more and more control over its use.Man is intended to be a self-determined organism. That is to say that as long as he canmake evaluations of his data without artificial compulsions or repressions (held down 7’s in anadding machine) he can operate to maximum efficiency. When man becomes exteriorly-determined, which is to say compelled to do or repressed from doing without his own rationalconsent, he becomes a push-button animal. This push-button factor is so sharply defined thatan auditor, in therapy, who discovers a key phrase in an engram (and does not release it) canuse that phrase for a little while to make a patient cough or laugh or stop coughing or stoplaughing at the auditor’s will. In the case of the auditor, because he got the data at source --contacted the engram itself, which robbed it of some power, the push-button will not last verylong, certainly less than two or three hundred pushes. The whole pain-drive effort at handlinghuman beings and most of the data accumulated in the past by various schools has been,unwittingly, this push-button material. If the engram is not touched at source it is good forendless use, its power never diminishing. Touched at source, however, the original recordinghas been reached and so it loses its power. The “handling of human beings” and what peoplehave been calling, roughly, “psychology” have been actually push-button handling of aperson’s aberrational phrases and sounds. Children discover them in their parents and use themwith a vengeance. The clerk discovers that his boss can’t stand a full waste basket and soalways has one full. The bosun on a ship finds out one of his sailors cringes every time hehears the phrase, “fancy-pants” and so uses the word to intimidate the man. This is push-button warfare amongst aberrees. Wives may find that certain words make the husband winceor make him angry or make him refrain from doing something and so they use these “push-buttons.” And husbands find their wives’ push-buttons and keep them from buying clothes orusing the car. This defensive and offensive dueling amongst aberrees is occasioned by push-button reacting against push-buttons.Whole populaces are handled by their push-button responses. Advertising learns aboutpush-buttons and uses them in such things as “body-odor” or constipation. And in theentertainment field and the song-writing field push-buttons are pushed in whole racks andbatteries to produce aberrated responses. Pornography appeals to people who havepornographic push-buttons. Corn-and-games government appeals to people who have “care forme” push-buttons and others. It might be said that there is no necessity to appeal to reasonwhen there are so many push-buttons around.These same push-buttons, because they are 7’s held down by pain and emotion (falsedata forced into the computer by engrams -- and every society has its own special patterns ofengrams), also happen to drive people insane, make them ill and generally raise havoc. Theonly push-button the clear has is whatever his own computer, evaluating on his experiencewhich itself has been evaluated by the computer, tells him is survival conduct along his fourdynamics. And so, being no marionette in the hands of careless or designing people, heremains well and sane.It is not true, however, that a clear is not emotional, that his reason is cold, and that heis a self-conscious puppet to his own computations. His computer works so rapidly and on somany levels with so many of his computations going on simultaneously but out of the sight of“I” (though “I” can examine any one of them he chooses) that his inversion or acute awarenessof self is minimal. Inversion is the condition of the aberree whose poor computer is wrestlingwith heavy imponderables and held down 7’s in his engrams such as “I must do it. I just haveto do it. But no, I’d better change my mind.”The computational difference between the clear and the aberree is very wide. But thereis a much grander difference: life force. The dynamics have, evidently, so much potentialforce. This force manifests itself as tenacity to life, persistence in endeavor, vigor of thoughtand act and ability to experience pleasure. The dynamics in a man’s cells may be no strongerthan those in a cat’s cells. But the dynamics in the whole man are easily greater than those inany other animal. Assign this as one will, the man is basically more alive in that he has a more147"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"volatile response. By more alive is meant that his sentient-emotional urge to live is greater thanthose found in other life forms. If this were not true, he would not now command the otherkingdoms. Regardless of what a shark or a beaver does when threatened with final extinction,the shark and the beaver get short shrift when they encounter the dynamics of Man: the sharkgets worn as leather or eaten as vitamins and the beaver decks a lady’s back.The fundamental aspect of this is seen in a single reaction. Animals are content tosurvive in their environments and seek to adjust themselves to those environments. That verydangerous animal -- or god -- Man has a slightly different idea. Ancient schools were fond oftelling the poor demented aberree that he must face reality. This was optimum conduct: facingreality. Only it isn’t Man’s optimum conduct. Just as these schools made the fundamental errorof supposing that the aberree was unwilling to face his environment when he was actually,because of engrams, unable to face it, they supposed that the mere facing of reality would leadto sanity. Perhaps it does, but it does not lead to a victory of Man over the elements and otherforms. Man has something more: some people call it creative imagination, some call it this orsome call it that: but whatever it is called, it adds up to the interesting fact that Man is notcontent merely to “face reality” as most other life forms are. Man makes reality face him.Propaganda about “the necessity of facing reality,” like propaganda to the effect that a mancould be driven mad by a “childhood delusion” (whatever that is) does not face the reality thatwhere the beaver down his ages of evolution built mud dams and keeps on building mud damsMan graduates in half a century from a stone and wood dam to make a mill wheel pond tostructures like Grand Coulee Dam, and changes the whole and entire aspect of a respectableportion of Nature’s real estate from a desert to productive soil, from a flow of water tolightning bolts. It may not be as poetic as Rousseau desired, it may not be as pretty as some“nature lover” would desire, but it’s a new reality. Two thousand years ago the Chinese built awall which would have been visible from the Moon had anybody been up there to look; threethousand years ago he had North Africa green and fertile; ten thousand years ago he wasengaged upon some other project; but always he has been shaping things up pretty well to suitMan.There’s an extra quality at work or perhaps just more of it, so much more of it that itlooks like a new thing entirely.Now all this is not any great digression from therapy; it is stated here as an aspect oflife force. Where the individual finds himself “possessed of less and less life force,” he islosing some of the free units somewhere.And the free units of this life force, in a society or an individual, are the extra surge thatis needed to tame North Africa, divide an atom, or reach the stars.The mechanical theory here -- and recall it is but theory and dianetics can stand withoutit -- is that there are so many units of force per individual. These units may be held in commonby a group and may build to higher and higher numbers as “enthusiasm” increases; but for ourpurposes, we can consider that Man, as an individual or a society -- both are organisms -- has aready number to hand for use in any given hour or day. He may manufacture these life units asrequired and he may simply have a given supply: that is beside the point.What is to the point is that he can be considered, at any hour or day, as just so muchalive. Consider this as his dynamic potential as we can see on our descriptic earlier.What happens, then, to this dynamic potential in the aberree? He has a large quantity ofengrams in his bank.We know that these engrams can sleep for his entire life without being“keyed-in,” and we know that any or all of them can be keyed-in and thereafter wait forrestimulators in the environment to set them into action. We know that his necessity level cansuddenly rise and surmount all these keyed-in engrams, and we know that a high survivalactivity can bring him such a chance of pleasure that the engrams can stay unrestimulated,though keyed-in. And we can suppose that these engrams, from one period of life to another,148"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"can actually key-out again and stay out because of some vast change of environment or survivalchances.The usual case, however, is that a few engrams stay keyed-in continually and arerestimulated rather chronically by the environment of the individual, and that if he changesenvironment the old may key out but eventually new ones will key-in.Most aberrees are in a state of chronic restimulation which, on the average, starts thespiral dwindling down rather rapidly.As this pertains to life force, the mechanical action of an engram on being keyed-in, isto capture so many of these units of life force. Sudden and sweeping restimulation of theengram permits it to capture a great many more units of life force. In the average case, everyrestimulation captures a greater residue of life force and holds it. When enthusiasm or impetusaligns the purpose of the individual toward a true survival goal (as opposed to a pseudo-goal inthe engrams) he recaptures some of these units. But the spiral is dwindling: he cannot captureback, except in very unusual circumstances, as many as he has lost into the engram bank.Thus it can be said, for purposes of this theory of life force action, that more and morelife force units out of an individual’s supply are captured and held in the engram bank. Herethey are perverted in use to counterfeit themselves as dynamic (as in the manic and the higheuphoria case) and force action upon the somatic and analytical mind. In this engram bank, thelife force units are not available as free feeling or for free action but are used against theindividual from within.An observation here tends to demonstrate this action: the more restimulated an aberreeis, the less free feeling he may possess. If caught in a manic (highly complimentary pro-survival engram), his life force is channeling straight through the engram and his behavior, nomatter how enthusiastic or euphoric, is actually very aberrated: if he has this much life force tobe so channeled, then he can be shown to have even more life force, sentiently directed, whenclear. (This has been done.)We have demonstrated the parasitic quality of the “demon circuits” which use pieces ofthe analytical mind and its processes. This parasitic quality is common to engrams in otherways. If a man has, arbitrarily, a thousand units of life force, he has an ability to channel them,when clear, into highly zestful existence: in a manic state, with a pro-survival engram in fullrestimulation, the life force is directed through an aberrated command and gives him, let ussay, five hundred units of pseudo-dynamic thrust.In other words, the power is out of the same battery: such an engram has at best lesspower than the whole organism, cleared, would have. (This aspect of the manic or super-personality neurotic has misled some of the old schools of mental healing into the thoroughlyaberrated and poorly observed belief that insanities alone were responsible for Man’s ability tosurvive, a concept which can be disproven in the laboratory simply by clearing one of thesemanics or any other aberree.)The engram uses the same current but perverts it just as it uses the same analytical mindbut usurps it. Not only does the engram have no life of its own, but it is wasteful as are somany parasites, of the life force of the host. It is thoroughly inefficient. If a comparable devicewere fitted into an electronic circuit it would merely lead off and make “unalterable” some ofthe functions of the equipment which should be left variable and would, in addition, consume,simply by lengthened leads and bad condensers and tubes, power supply vital to the machine.In the human mind, the engram assumes its most forceful “assist” aspect in the manic,channeling and commanding the organism into some activity of wild violence and monomanicconcentration.149"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"The “super-salesman,” the violently buoyant “glad-hander,” the fanatical and apparentlyunkillable religious zealot are classifiable as manics. The abundance of “power” in thesepeople, even when it is as grim as Torquemada’s or as destructive as Genghis Khan’s, is anobject of admiration in many quarters. The manic, as will be later covered, is a “pro-survival,”“assist” command in an engram which yet fixes the individual on some certain course. But anengram is capable only of as much “power” as is present in the host, just as it is capable oftying up only as much analyzer as is present.Let us take a forceful manic who is displaying and functioning on 500 arbitrary units oflife force. Let us assume that the entire being is possessed of 1000 arbitrary units of life force.Suppose we have here an Alexander. The dynamics of the average person are unassisted bymanics in most cases but are dispersed as a stream of electrons might be dispersed by a blockbefore them.Here are scattered activity, scattered thoughts, uncomputable problems, lack ofalignment. In such a person, with 1000 units present, 950 of those units could be so capturedin the engram banks and yet so thoroughly counteractive that the person displays a functioningcapacity of only 50 units. In the case of Alexander, it could be assumed, the manic must havebeen an alignment in a general direction of his own basic purposes. His basic purpose is astrong regulator: the manic happens to align with it: a person of great ability and personalprowess becomes possessed of 500 units via a manic engram, believes he is a god and goesout and conquers the known world. He was educated to believe he was a god, his manicengram said he was a god and had a holder in it.Alexander conquered the world and died at 33. He could hold in his manic only so longas it could be obeyed: when it could no longer be obeyed, it changed his valence, became nomore a manic and drove him, with pain, into dispersed activities. The engram, received fromhis mother, Olympia, can almost be read even at this late date. It must have said he would be ajoyous god who would conquer all the world and must keep on conquering, that he mustalways strive to rise higher and higher. It was probably a ritual chant of some sort from hismother, who was a high priestess of Lesbos and who must have received some injury justbefore the ritual. She hated her husband, Phillip. A son who would conquer all was theanswer. Alexander may well have had fifty or a hundred such “assist” engrams, the violentpraying of a woman aberrated enough to murder. Thus he could be assumed to have conquereduntil he could no longer stretch a line of supply for conquering, at which time he, of course,would no longer be able to obey the engram and its force of pain would turn on him. Theengrams dictated attack to conquer, and they enforced the command with pain: once conqueringcould not longer be accomplished, the pain attacked Alexander. He realized one day he wasdying: within the week he was dead: and at the height of his power. Such, on a very largescale, is a manic phrase in an engram at work.Now let us suppose that Alexander, with only education to turn him against his father,with only prayers to ask him to conquer the world, not engrams, had been cleared. Answer:given a sufficient and rational reason, he would most certainly have been able to conquer theworld and at eighty might well have been alive to enjoy it.How can we assume this?The manic with 500 units of directed purpose has been cleared. He now has 1000 unitsof sentiently directed purpose. He is exactly twice as forceful as he was when he was in aforceful manic and his basic purpose may be similar but now can be realized and will not turnon him the moment he has reached a goal or failed.This is clinical, the theory behind life force. It was formulated in an effort to explainobserved phenomena.The theory may be wrong, the observed data is not. But the theory must be somewhereclose to right because with it could be predicted considerable phenomena which had not been150"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"known to exist before: in other words, it is a profitable theory. It followed after dianetics waswell formulated, for a strange fact, vital to the therapist, turned up: the pre-clear advanced intherapy in exact ratio to the amount of emotional charge released from his reactive bank.The purpose and persistency of the aberree was hindered in ratio to the amount ofemotional charge within his engram bank. His recovery of survival potential increased in ratioto the amount of energy freed from the engram bank.His health increased in ratio to the amount of energy feed from the engram bank.The engrams which contained the greatest discharge were those which centered aroundloss of imagined survival factors.Hence, this theory of life force was formulated. Any manic cleared seemed todemonstrate far more actual power and energy than before he was cleared. And any “normal”cleared increased in accessible life force units to compare with any manic cleared.Undoubtedly further work and observation will refine this theory. At the presentmoment, however, it serves. It is one of those “scientific theories” thrown in to explain anoperation or a long series of observations. In this case it happens to be squarely aligned withthe basic tenets of dianetics, for it predicts data which can then be found and does not throwout former data predicted by the basic mathematics and philosophy of dianetics.Here we are speaking, actually, not of this slippery term, emotion, but, we believe, lifeforce. This life force is considerably enhanced by success and pleasure in general and is,according to this theory, augmented in terms of arbitrary units, by pleasure. In other words,pleasure is a thing which recharges the batteries or permits them to be recharged and in a clear,far from leading to softness, leads to renewed activity since indolence is engramic.Pleasure is a vitally important factor: creative and constructive endeavor, theovercoming of not unknowable obstacles toward some goal, the contemplation of past goalsreached all combine to recharge life force. The person, for instance, who has been anenormous success and then loses that success and so becomes ill is following no rational cyclebut an engramic command cycle. In a way he has disobeyed an engramic command and havingdisobeyed, suffers pain. The “child wonder” who early “burns out” is actually, via therapy,about as burned out as a banked furnace. Any “child wonder” is a forced affair: think of thedreams mama must have poured through his engrams. She’s hurt: “Oh, I’ll never forgivemyself! If I have ruined my child, I will never forgive myself. My child, that’s to be theworld’s greatest violinist!” or “Oh, you brute! You have struck me! You have injured ourchild. I’ll show you. I’ll make him the greatest child pianist in all Brooklyn! He’s to be abeautiful child, a wonder child! And you’ve struck him, you brute. Oh, I am going to sit righthere until you go away!” (Actual engrams.) The last computes that the way to get even withpapa is to be the greatest pianist in all Brooklyn. The child is a great success -- musical ear,practice and great “purpose.” He gets this engram restimulated constantly by his mother. Butthen, one day he loses a contest, he knows suddenly he is no longer a child, that he has failed.His purpose wavers. He gets headaches (papa’s blow) and is at last “neurotic” and “burnedout.” Cleared he went back to being a pianist, not as an “adjusted” person but one of the bestpaid concert pianists in Hollywood. Music aligned with basic purpose.Again, in another manic example, a patient who had been some time in therapy -- notthe first to do this by far -- raved that he had been “turned-on” by dianetics. He was walkingabout a foot off the earth, chest punched out and so forth. His glasses suddenly would not fithim, his eyes were too good. He was a beaming, powerful case of euphoria.Artificial restimulation had touched a manic engram, had brought it into key for the firsttime in his life. He felt wonderful. The auditor knew that he was due for a complete comedown within thirty-six hours to three days (the usual time) because an artificial restimulation,by therapy, had tapped the engram. It happened that his grandmother had told her daughter that151"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"she must not abort the child because someday it might become a “fine upstanding man orbeautiful woman.” He was upstanding all right: it almost strained his back muscles. Anotherglance at the engram in therapy and the manic phase was gone.This manic, then, as in the case of the boy wonder, can be assumed to have gathered upavailable life force and suddenly channeled it along basic purpose lines, making a high level ofconcentration of life force. In the case of the pianist his cleared force was well above the manicforce. In the other case, currently in process, a level has been reached which is approaching theformer level and will surpass it by far.In the same way an enthusiasm for a project will channel life force along some purposeline and necessity will suddenly rob back from engrams enough power to carry an individualfar, although he has no active manics whatever.Now we come to the heart of this matter: the pro-survival engram. It is pseudo-survivallike all engramic “assist,” a mirage which dissolves and leaves burning sands.Formerly we spoke mainly of contra-survival engrams. These lie across the dynamicsof the individual and his basic purpose.The contra-survival engram is, to the dynamics, like a log jam which dams a necessaryriver. The dynamic is blocked in some degree. Any blockage to any one of the four dynamics(or any section of that spectrum) causes a dispersal of the flow. It does not make less dynamic,particularly, but it does misdirect it in the same order that the river, blocked in its natural flow,might become five streams going in various directions or flood a fertile pasture it should merelyhave watered.The pro-survival engram alleges to assist (but does not actually assist) the dynamic onits way. It pretends it is the dynamic. In the analogy of the river, the pro-survival engramwould be a canal which took the river’s force and sent it off in some unintended direction. Thepro-survival engram is not a manic; it can and does contain at times manic phrases.A contra-survival engram says, “He’s worthless, damn him, let’s kill him.”The pro-survival engram says: “I am saving him.” If it added: “He is a darling and avery wonder with the ladies,” it would then be a pro-survival with a manic.In terms of the descriptic which defines the survival dynamic and the suppressor earlierin this book, the contra-survival engram would be part of the suppressor (an aberrated part)and the pro-survival engram would be part of the dynamic thrust (an aberrated part).Neither one of these things is actually a sentient and computable portion of survivaldynamic or suppressor.The engram (delirium from illness, perhaps) which says, “I will stay with you, darling,so long as you are sick” is an apparent but wholly shadow-stuff part of the survival dynamic.But the reactive mind has no sense of time when restimulated and this engram, keyed-in andconstantly restimulated by some concept in it such as an odor or a person’s voice who may ormay not be the original person, demands that the person who has it be ill just as he was illwhen it was said. This way, according to our moron, the reactive mind, lies survival: “I hadsome one taking care of me when I was ill. I need some one to take care of me. I must be ill.”Here is the basic pattern of all sympathy engrams. Here is the basic pattern of the engramwhich will contain the chronic psycho-somatic illness in any patient. The variety is, of course,very large but all insist that the individual who has them be ill in order to survive.The suppressor-type engram, always contra-survival, can be cut into restimulation inexactly the same way as the pro-survival engram. An engram is an engram and all themechanics are the same. The fact that the analytical mind cannot time the engram can make anyengram seem omnipresent. Time can “heal” the experiences of the analytical mind, perhaps, but152"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"not the reactive mind which has no time, a fact which makes time not the Great Healer but theGreat Charlatan. There may be no actuality at all in this suppressor data. It is false data. Suchengrams let an individual, for instance, see a butterfly and then tell him it is dangerous: he thencomes to detest spring because that is the time he sees butterflies. This engram may say:“You’re all against me. You’re against everything I do,” which was actually Mama making astand against her husband and mother-in-law. It contains a concept, a recording of the sound ofa sewing machine as well. The individual possessing this engram hears a sewing machine (ifthis engram has at some time been keyed-in) at a moment when he is weary and dull and,looking toward the machine (he never identifies the actual sound:these engrams protectthemselves), sees his wife. She is the associative restimulator, something his analytical mind,told to scent danger, picks up as the cause. So he searches around and finds something he isangry about (something almost “rational”) and begins to tell her she is against him. Or it can bean engram of such low emotional tone that it is an apathy, and so he sits down and weeps andmoans that she is against him. If, during “unconsciousness” at birth, the doctor said he’d haveto spank him, the individual possessing this engram howls and gets headaches when he isspanked and when grown spanks his children as the strongest suppressor he can think of.There is a difference, then, between the pro- and contra-engrams, particularly the realsympathy pro-engram and the contra-engram. And it is a difference, even if we have been longon the road in this chapter, which is of vital interest to the auditor.All the real reluctance he will see in pre-clears during therapy will come from thesesympathy pro-survival engrams. These add up into some very weird computations. They tellthe patient that he had better not “get rid of it” and so the patient struggles to retain his engrams.Such an engram is very common. A typical case is Mama pushing off Papa, who insists hecannot afford a child: the struggle injures the child and in the “unconsciousness” he receives, ofcourse, an engram: Mama is refusing to get rid of it. Mama is on baby’s side, therefore babyhad better do exactly as Mama says and “not get rid of it.” This aligns with purpose, thedeepest purpose, to survive. If he gets rid of his engrams, he will die because getting rid of itmeans death, for Mama said she would die if she got rid of it. Further, on up through life,Mama may have the nasty habit of telling him when he is ill that she will “take care of her babyand protect him from his father,” and this makes a new force in the old computation.Thus we come to the ally computation. This will be the chief and number one struggleof the auditor, the thing which will most elusively resist him, the thing which lies down closeto the core of a person.The ally computation is severe enough that an auditor once said that a man is notvictimized by his enemies, he is murdered by his friends. Engramically speaking, that is quitetrue.The only aberration and psycho-somatic ill the patient will continually hold to is a pro-survival engram which is part of an ally computation. That could be written fifty times herewithout being stressed enough. It is most important, it is the first thing which the auditor isgoing to buck when he enters a case, the first thing he must discharge if he wishes therapy togo swiftly. He may have to touch and reduce many contra-survival engrams, for the comeswiftly enough when called, before he can even get an idea of what the ally computation is. Butwhen he gets an ally computation he had better run it out and discharge all its emotion or thecase will hang fire.The ally computation is the reactive mind level moronism that survival depends onGrandma or Aunt Sue or some serving maid thirty years dead. The attendants of the individualwhen he was ill, the people who begged his pregnant mother to stop trying to abort him, or fedhim or otherwise tried to keep him from being hurt: these are the allies.The reactive mind operates wholly on two-valued logic. Things are life or they aredeath, they are right or they are wrong, just as the engram wording states. And the personnelof engrams are friends or enemies. The friends, the allies, mean Life! The enemies mean153"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Death! There is no middle ground. Any restimulator or associated restimulator for the pro-survival engram means Life: and any restimulator or associated restimulator for a contra-survival engram means Death!The auditor, of course, may be a really restimulative person (one who is a pseudo-father, a pseudo-lover of mother before birth, etc.) but he is always an associative restimulator,the person who may take away these terribly, horribly vital things, the pro-survival engrams.The contra-survival engrams outbalance this factor and, of course, the analytical mind of thepre-clear is always all for the auditor and the therapy.The trouble comes when the analytical mind is shut down by restimulation and theauditor is seeking the ally computation. Then the pre-clear’s reactive mind dodges and avoids.The ally computation, however, is simple to trace. And it is very vital to trace it, for thiscomputation may contain the bulk of all the emotional discharge of the case. Freeing thecomplete ally computation wholly before basic-basic is reached is wholly impossible. But asmuch life force as possible must be restored to the pre-clear to make the case work well.For the ally computation, above all things, encysts the life force of the individual. Hereis caught and held the free feeling, the very heartbeat of life itself. A pre-clear is only placed inapathy by ally computations. The body can be almost dead in the presence of antagonism andstill rally and fight. But it cannot fight its friends. The law of affinity has been aberrated into anentrance into the reactive engram bank. And that law, even when twisted with the murkyshadows of unreason in the reactive mind, still works. It is a good law. It is too good when theauditor is trying to find and reduce engrams which are making the pre-clear ache with arthritisor bleed internally with stomach ulcers.Why can’t he “get rid of” his arthritis? Mama said, when she gracefully fell over a pig,“Oh, I can’t get up! Oh, my poor, poor baby. Oh, my baby! I wonder if I hurt my poor, poorbaby. Oh, I hope my baby is still alive! Please God let him live. Please God let me keep mybaby. Please!”Only the God to which she prayed was the Reactive Mind, which makes one of its idiotcomputations on the basis of everything is equal to everything. A holder, a prayer for life, athoroughly bruised baby’s spine, Mama’s sympathy, a pig grunt, a prayer to God, all thesethings are equal to the reactive mind and so we have a fine case of arthritis, particularly sinceour patient sought “survival” by marrying a girl with a voice just like Mama’s sounded whenhe was in the womb. Ask him to get rid of his arthritis? The reactive mind says “NO!” Arthritisis a baby is a pig grunt is a prayer to God is wife’s sympathy is being poor is Mama’s voiceand all these things are desirable.He’s kept himself poor and he’s kept his arthritis and he married a wife who wouldmake a harlot blush and this is pro-survival: wonderful stuff, survival, when the reactive mindcomputes it! And in the case of the ulcers, here was baby poked full of holes (Mama is havinga terrible time trying to abort him so she can pretend a miscarriage, and she uses assortedhousehold instruments thrust into the cervix to do it) and some of the holes are through andthrough his baby’s abdomen and stomach: he will live because he is surrounded by proteinand has a food supply and because the sac is like one of these puncture-proof inner tubes thatseals up every hole. (Nature has been smart about attempted abortion for a long, long time.)It so happens that Mama in this case was not a monologist, although most of Mama’sactivity on this line is a dramatization and has conversation with it; but it also so happens thatGrandma lives next door and she comes over unexpectedly, shortly after the latest effort tomake baby meet oblivion.Grandma may have been an attempted abortionist in her day but now she is old andhighly moral and besides, this baby is not giving her any morning sickness: she therefore findsmuch to censure when she sees a bloody orangewood stick in the bathroom. Baby is still154"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"“unconscious.” Grandma berates Mama: “Any daughter of mine who would do such a horriblething should be punished by the vengeance of God (the principle of, don’t do as I do, do as Isay, for who gave Mama this dramatization in the first place?) and driven through the streets.Your baby has a perfect right to live: if you don’t think you can take care of him, I certainlywill. Now you go right on through with your pregnancy, Eloisia, and when that baby is born,if you don’t want him, you bring him to me! The idea of trying to hurt that poor thing!” Andso, when our bleeding ulcer case gets born, there is Grandma and there is security and safety.Grandma is here the ally (and she can become an ally in a thousand different ways, any of thembased on the principle that she talks sympathetically to baby when he is out like a flounder, andfights Mama in his favor when he is “unconscious”), and when he grows to boyhood he can befound placing a large dependency on Grandma, much to the parental wonder (for they neverdid anything to little Roger, not they). And Roger will, when Grandma is dead, developbleeding ulcers to get her back.Whoever is a friend is to be clasped to the bosom with bonds of steel, says this greatgenius, the reactive mind, even though it kills the organism.The ally computation is a little more than the mere idiot calculation that anyone who is afriend can be kept a friend only by approximating the conditions wherein the friendship wasrealized. It is a computation on the basis that one can only be safe in the vicinity of certainpeople and that one can only be in the vicinity of certain people by being sick or crazy or poorand generally disabled.Show an auditor a child who was easily frightened by punishment, who was not at easearound home and who had allies who seemed more important to him than the parents(grandparents, aunts, boarders, doctors, nurses, etc.) and who was sickly, and the auditor canusually spring into view an attempted abortion background because, more often than not, it isthere. Show an auditor a child who showed enormous attachment for one parent anddetestation for the other and the auditor can bring out a background wherein one person wantedto get rid of or hurt the child and the other parent did not.The ally computation, then, is important. And it is also very secret. Trying to get thereal allies in a case is often a great struggle. It may be that a patient had eight or ten of theseallies in some cases and tried desperately to hold to them, and when he could not, searched andfound mates and friends who were approximations of his allies. A wife, around whom A iscontinually ill but whom he will not leave under any circumstances, is usually a pseudo-ally,which is to say she approximates some mannerism of the actual ally, has a similar voice oreven a similar first name. B, who will not leave a job and yet who is working far below hisability level in life, may be there because his boss is a pseudo-ally; further, he may be workingat this job because an ally had a similar station in life and he is being the ally.Anything which can so far corrupt a person’s life is naturally going to be difficult tosome degree in therapy, for when he is asked to get rid of his ally computation, it is as likelythat he will give any clue to it as it is that he would have spit in his ally’s face.These pro-survival engrams containing the ally computation can be described as thosewhich contain personnel who defended the patient’s existence in moments when the patientconceived that his existence was under attack. This need not be an actual, rational defense: itmay only be that the content of the engram seems to indictate it; but it can safely be assumedthat the worst ally computations are those when the life of the patient was defended againstattackers by the ally. Most ally computations have their genesis in the prenatal area.The ally computation is sought as the first action in any case and new ally computationsare sought throughout a case.These sympathy pro-survival engrams, which make up the ally computations, varyonly in intensity from the standard pro-survival engram. A standard pro-survival engram is badonly because someone has expressed friendship for the patient or another person when he was“unconscious”: it is difficult to discover and clear even when it actually has been entirely155"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"misread -- which is to say that the pro-survival content was intended for another person thanthe patient but is only misconstrued by the patient. If the patient is “unconscious” andsomebody says “he is a good guy,” actually meaning another person entirely, the egocentricreactive mind takes the phrase to have been meant for oneself.In the sympathy pro-survival engram (the ally computation is composed only of these)there is an actual defense of the person from danger by some ally: this can vary from a dramaticscene wherein somebody has been bent on killing the patient and the ally has arrived, like thecavalry, in the nick of time, to the incident wherein the patient was simply saved (or assumedhe was being saved) from destruction such as drowning, being run over, etc. And thesympathy pro-survival engram is only as good as its content in words, for it does notrationalize the action. Engrams have been discovered where the patient was actually beingmurdered but the content was such that he was convinced he was being saved: such a casewould include what auditors call a “mutual AA” -- a father and mother together attempting anabortion, AA meaning “attempted abortion” -- wherein Mama was in utter agreement anddisposed herself for the operation but became frightened and began to scream about “herprecious baby” in an effort to save herself from being injured: patients with this sort ofsympathy pro-survival engram can get pretty confused about mother.The insidious aspects of the sympathy pro-survival engrams are several. (1) They arealigned with the fundamental dynamic of survival in the most literal sense and are thereforealigned with the purpose of the individual; (2) they are like cysts round which contra-survivalengrams serve as the outer shell; (3) they most sharply affect the health of the individual andare always the basic factor beneath the psycho-somatic illness which the individual displays;(4) they cause the reactive mind (but not the analytical mind) to resist therapy; and (5) they arethe largest drain upon the life force units.In (3) above, the pro-survival sympathy engram does more than just carry forward theinjury which becomes the psycho-somatic illness. Any engram is a bundle of data whichincludes not only all perceptics and speech present but also metering for emotion and state ofphysical being.The last, the state of physical being, would be serious enough. Thismetering says that structure was so and such at the moment this sympathy pro-survival engramwas received: in the case of an embryo engram, then, the reactive mind, in forcing the engramback into action, may also force the structural pattern back upon the body: this occasionallyresults in retarded development, embryo-like skin, embryo-type back curvature, and so forth.The glands themselves, being physical organs, are also sometimes so suppressed in thereactive mind’s effort to approximate all conditions. The underdeveloped gonads, the sub-levelthyroid, the wasted limb, all these things often come from sympathy pro-survival engrams.This is so observably the case that when an individual is being cleared, growth process beginsto bring the body up to genetic blueprint even before the case is completed: the change whichtakes place in the physical being of the patient is sometimes so remarkable and so marked that itis far more startling than the mere disappearance of a catalogue of psycho-somatic ills such ascoronary, ulcers, arthritis, allergies, and so on.It would be supposed that anything powerful enough to twist the physical blueprint andkeep the body from developing or make it keep on growing where it should have stoppedwould resist any therapy. This is true only in a most limited sense. Once one is aware of whatsuppresses a case, one can go about vanquishing the suppressors because a pro-survivalengram, unlike a contra-survival engram, has an Achilles heel.The most workable answer now known to dianetics lies in the principle of life forceunits and a technique for throwing them back into circulation. The pro-survival engram collectsand holds such units, according to this theory, and collapses when its power to hold units isbroken.Entering a case, then, where one has a chronic psycho-somatic illness (and what casedoesn’t have, even though it is as slight as an occasional fit of sneezing or hiccoughs), theauditor first scouts it, going through a returning routine to find out how early he can get for156"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"material, how the state of the sonic recall is, how occluded is the youth of the person, and soforth. When he has made this survey, he begins to make his computation on the case: first, wasthe child happy with both father and mother, and if not, where was the child happiest (therewill be where the allies live). Was either parent an unreasonably powerful factor in shaping thethinking powers of the child: here again may be an ally, even if a poor one. Did the patient havegrandparents or other relatives; how did he feel toward them? All this data will be more or lessoccluded and warped by demon circuits and is about as reliable as the data this patient willinevitably try to get from “loopy” parents or relatives, who not only do not know whathappened to him but might be most anxious not to have anything discovered.What really did happen? Don’t let patients ask relatives or parents anything if you canhelp it, for these are restimulators in the extreme and never have any data you can use; thepatient is just trying to use them as by-pass circuits to avoid the pain of recalling thingshimself. When the case is finished he will no longer want to hound these people and if youwant a check for research reasons, get one of the relatives and put him through therapy.The auditor now has some slight idea of who the allies may be. And here comes theAchilles heel of the ally computation:Any ally computation may have included the loss of the ally. And the loss of the allymay be the trigger which will start chain fission. For what we are going to try to do is blow offor discharge as many life force units as possible from the reactive engram bank and weaken it.Every charge we get from the bank will reinforce the ability of the patient to carry on inexistence and will aid his analytical mind to get into the engram bank. Hence, discharging thesefrozen units is a vital and important part of therapy and the condition of the case will improve indirect ratio to the number of these units so discharged.Consider these life units as free life energy: an engram capturing them can set itself up,for all intent, as a life force. It is then an entity and only then. The demon circuits, the valencewalls (which compartment the analyzer, so to speak, and bring about multi-valence), the forceand power of the engram itself are all dependent, according to theory and as observed inpractice, upon usurped life units.To free these units is the primary task of therapy: to relieve pain from the engrams is thesecondary task; to make the patient comfortable during therapy does not even rank, thoughthere is no need he should be uncomfortable. The dual character of therapy, then, is actuallytwo sections of the same thing: relieving engrams. There is this dual nature in engrams,however, that they have painful emotion (where that means usurped life force) and physicalpain (where that means pain of injury, illness, etc.).To get as early as possible as fast as possible and find basic-basic is the direction andintent of therapy in its first stages: to accomplish this (when it cannot be done immediatelymerely by returning and finding basic-basic which can and always should be tried) one relievesthe case and robs the engram bank by releasing life units (painful emotion captured them) fromthe ally computations.In brief, the entire intent and act of therapy is to find the earliest engram and erase it andthen proceed to erase all other engrams as engrams so they can no longer be discovered (theyrefile in the standard bank but it takes a genius to find them there and a search of hours andhours: hence, to the auditor they can be said to have “erased” for they are no longer engramsand are now experience). The first, last and only job of the auditor is to find the earliestengrams available and erase them. That cannot be said too often or too strongly.The various ways to accomplish this are the techniques and arts of therapy. Anythingwhich brings about this erasure of engrams in place and their refiling as experience is usefuland legitimate whatever it includes. An engineer intends to remove a mountain which is in theway of a river: his intent and all his effort is directed toward moving that mountain; the ways157"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"and means employed by him to move that mountain, by steam shovel, hydraulic rams ordynamite are the art and techniques applied to do the job.There are three degrees of knowledge in our task: (1) In dianetics we know the goal: weknow the results which come about when that goal is attained; (2) We know the character of theobstructions between us and the goal but of the exact character of the obstruction we can neverlearn too much; (3) The art and technique of removing the obstruction between us and the goalare legitimate only by the test of whether or not they remove the obstruction.The method of attack on the problem can always be improved by learning more aboutthe character of the factors in the problem, and by learning new arts and techniques which canbe applied to the problem, and by studying to improve our skill in practicing existing arts andtechniques. The currently existing art and technique is not to be considered optimum merelybecause it does the job. The time and ease of work could be shortened by new techniques oradvancing skills for old techniques.All this is interjected so that dianetics, unlike Aristotelian logic and natural history, willbe recognized as an advancing, changing science. It is interjected at this place because noauditor should just sit back with this routine and never try to improve the routine.Very well: this is the routine: it works but it can never be made to work too quickly ortoo well:(1) Place the patient in reverie and scout into the prenatal area to see if engrams areavailable for lifting without further work. If they are there and can be found, take thecharge out of them and erase them if possible. Do not try to erase anything as remotefrom basic-basic as birth unless the file clerk insists on presenting birth. In otherwords, get the subject into the prenatal area and look for the earliest engrams. Do notask for specific instances, particularly for something like birth, just take whatever ispresented. If you can’t get back early, take step two.(2) Scout the patient’s life, while he is in reverie (do this in any event sooner or later if thecase slows down but only if it slows down to a point where early engrams are eithernot reducing or are without any emotion). Establish in this scout whomever may havebeen depended upon by the patient and be suspicious always that he has not told youthe really important allies, but do not tell him you are suspicious.(3) Find out when the patient lost any ally through death or departure. Approach thismoment and one way or another, by getting earlier material and this incident or gettingjust this incident, discharge the sorrow of loss out of the incidents. Treat any incident inwhich the ally departs or the patient is separated from the ally as an engram and erase itaccordingly or run it until it has no “charge” of sorrow on it. If the “charge” holds,suspect an early moment of sorrow about this ally and find that and treat it as anengram.(4) First, last and always, the job is to get basic-basic and then ever afterwards thecurrently existing earliest moment of pain or sorrow, and to erase every incident as it isadvanced by the file clerk or found by repeater technique.(5) Any incident that hangs fire always has a similar incident earlier, and the patient shouldbe taken earlier for the prior incident when an engram will not “reduce” on recounting.(6) At any time the engrams start to become emotionless in tone, even though they reduce,suspect another ally computation and, early or late in the patient’s life, get it and reduceit at least until the emotional discharge is gone. Do not get everything in a caserestimulated by changing from an unreduced incident to something which looks morefruitful, but reduce everything in view before you go looking for a new sorrow charge.158"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"(7) It is better to reduce an emotionless early engram than it is to upset the case byhounding him for an ally computation when a cunning search fails to reveal none insight. Erasing early emotionless engrams will eventually bring a new ally computationinto sight if you occasionally look for it.(8) Consider that any hold-up on a case, any unwillingness to cooperate, stems from allycomputation.(9) Treat all demon circuits as things held in place by life force units absorbed into the bankand address the problem of demon circuits by releasing charges of sorrow.(10) Consider that loss by death or departure of an ally is identical with a death of some partof the patient and that the reduction of a death or departure of an ally will restore thatmuch life back to the patient. And remember that great sorrow charges are not alwaysdeath or departure but merely may be a sudden reversal of stand by the ally.Always keep in mind that that person who most nearly identifies himself with theperson of the patient, such as a sympathetic mother or father or grandparent or relative orfriend, is considered by the reactive mind to be a part of the person himself and that anythinghappening to this sympathetic character can be considered to have happened to the patient. Insuch a case, where an ally has been found to have died of cancer, you may occasionally findthe patient to have a sore or scaly place where he supposed the ally’s cancer to have been.The reactive mind thinks in identities only. The sympathetic pro-survival engramidentifies the patient with another individual. The death or loss (by departure or denial) of theother individual is therefore a reactive mind conviction that the patient has suffered someportion of death.Emotional charges may be contained in any engram: the emotion communicates, in thesame tone level, from the personnel around the “unconscious” person into his reactive mind.Anger goes into an engram as anger, apathy as apathy, shame as shame. Whatever people havefelt emotionally around an “unconscious” person should be found in the engram which resultedfrom the incident. When the emotional tone of personnel in an engram is obviously angry orapathetic from the word content and yet the patient, recounting, does not feel it, there issomething somewhere which has a valence wall between the patient and the emotional tone,and that valence wall is nearly always broken down by the discovery of an engram with asorrow charge sometime earlier or later in a patient’s life.The only legitimate reason for entering later portions of a person’s life before theprenatal area has been well exhausted is search for sorrow discharges occasioned by the death,loss or denial by an ally. And by “denial,” we mean that the ally turned into an active enemy(real or imaginary) of the patient. The counterpart of the ally, the pseudo-ally, is a personwhom the reactive mind has confused with the real ally. The death, loss or denial by a pseudo-ally can contain a sorrow charge.According to theory, the only thing which can lock up life units is this emotion of loss.If some method existed of doing nothing but freeing all life units, the physical pain could beneglected.A release is brought about, one way or another, by freeing as many life units aspossible from periods of loss with minimal address to actual engrams.The loss of an ally or pseudo-ally need contain no other physical pain or“unconsciousness” than the loss itself occasions. This is serious enough. It makes an engram.Any person who is suddenly discovered to be occluded in a patient’s life can, withsome reliability, be considered an ally or pseudo-ally. If, either while remembering orreturning, large sections of a patient’s association with another person are missing, that person159"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"can be called an occluded person. It is a better guarantee of ally status if the occlusionsurrounds the death of the person or a departure from or a denial by that person. It is possiblefor occlusion to take place, also, for punishment reasons; which is to say, the occluded personmay also be an arch enemy: in such a case, however, any memory present will concern thedeath or defeat or illness of the occluded person. Occlusion of a person’s funeral in thememory of a patient would theoretically label that person an ally or pseudo-ally. Recollection ofthe funeral of a person but occlusion of pleasant association might tend to mean that the personwas an enemy. Such rules are tentative. But it is certain that any occlusion means that a personhad a vast and unrevealed significance in a patient’s life which should be explained.It may be remarked at this point that the recovery of the patient will depend in largemeasure on the life units freed from his reactive bank. This is a discharge of sorrow and maybe quite violent. The usual practice is to “forget” such things and the “sooner forgotten, thesooner healed.” Unfortunately this does not work: it would be a happy thing if it did. Anythingforgotten is a festering sore when it has despair connected with it. The auditor will find thatevery time he locates that arch denyer, “forget it,” he will get the engram it suppressed; whenhe can’t locate the engram and yet has found a somatic, a “forget it” or “don’t think about it” or“can’t remember it” or “don’t remember it” or some other denyer will be sitting there in thecontext of the engram. Forgetting is such unhealthy business that when a thing has been “putout of mind,” it has been put straight into the reactive engram bank and in there it can absorblife units.This “loopy” computation, that forgetting things makes them bearable, is incredible inview of the fact that the hypnotist, for instance, gets results with a positive suggestion when heputs one of these denyers on the end of it. That has been known now for a great many eons: itwas one of the first things the author was taught when he studied Asiatic practices; from Indiait long ago filtered to Greece and Rome and it has come to us via Anton Mesmer: it is afundamental principle in several mystic arts: its mechanics were known even to the Siouxmedicine man. Yet people at large, hitherto unguided about it, and perhaps because they lackedany real remedy, believed that the thing to do with sorrow was to “forget it.”Even Hippocrates remarks that the whole of an operation is not finished until the patienthas recounted the incident to all of his friends in turn, and while this is inadequate therapy, ithas been, like the Confessional, a part of popular knowledge for lo, these many ages: yetpeople persist in suppressing sorrow.The auditor will many times in his activity be begged by a patient “not to talk to meabout so-and-so’s death.” If he is foolish enough to heed this tearful plea when the patient is inreverie, then the auditor is actively blocking a release. That is the first incident he should get!Perhaps it would be bad, without dianetic technique, to approach such things; but withour art it is easy not only to enter the actual moment of the incident but to then recount it untilthe tears and wailings are but echoes in the case book. Treating that loss like an engram,recounting it until it is no longer painful emotionally, is to give back to the patient vitality hehas not had since the incident took place. And if the incident does not ease on a dozenrecountings, slide back down its sorrow track, just as you would with any other engram, andfind earlier and earlier moments. A patient starting to discharge sorrow at the age of fifty mayfind himself, two hours later, down in the basic area recounting the primary moment ofsorrow, at the moment when the lost ally first became an ally. If the auditor can get the wholechain on any one ally, exhausting sorrow from it from later to earlier, taking all the sorrow hecan get from every incident and stripping the entire series of engrams of their charge, he may,in a few hours work, rid the case of enough emotional charge to then begin an orderly erasure.Please observe this difference: the Achilles heel of the ally computation can beconsidered late on the chain of incidents which concern that ally, which is to say that we have afunnel here, upright in time, which can be entered late and followed early: the Achilles heel ofthe contra-survival engram chain is in the earliest incidents, exactly the reverse of theemotionally painful engrams.160"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"To regain out of the engram bank life units so that enough free emotion is available torelease or clear a case, start with late ally or pseudo ally losses and work back earlier.To release the physical pain of the individual from the engram bank, start early (as closeto conception as you can get) and work through to late. Physical pain in the contra-survivalchain can suppress painful emotion in the pro-survival chain.Painful emotion in the pro-survival chain can suppress physical pain in the contra-survival engrams.If you were to draw a picture of the prenatal area of the reactive engram bank, it wouldappear somewhat as follows: a long line drawn horizontally, representing time, would havedark blots on it representing engrams; one end of the line would represent conception, the otherend birth: above this line would lie a dark area, like a heavy mist, extending from one end ofthe line to the other and dropping down almost to it: above this dark mist would lie anotherhorizontal line, the apparent time track along which the patient returns. The first long line is theactual time track; the mist is painful emotion; the uppermost dark line is what the patientmistakes and uses for his time track.The painful emotion is, of course, occasionally tapped in the prenatal area itself, and theopportunity of dispersing it by so discovering prenatal emotional charges should never beoverlooked by the auditor: indeed, once much of the later life painful emotion is discharged, agreat deal of painful emotion can be found amongst the early engrams. The better part of thismist, and the first part the auditor often contacts, is in late life: although it originates, as charge,in late life, it can be said to lie on this prenatal area.Moments of loss, the loss by death or departure of any of the patient’s allies, and theloss of an ally because he turns against the patient, trap these emotional charges and intervenethem between the patient and actuality. Although the moment of loss was post-birth, ininfanthood, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, it was retroactive in suppressing earlyengrams.This aspect of painful emotion is a key-in of the early incidents by the moment of loss.In other words, a moment of great loss suppresses the individual on the tone scale to a pointwhere he approximates the level of early engrams and these, keyed-in, hold the units of chargethereafter.Life units so seized are held and are the life of engrams. As in electricity, a positivecharge glances away from a positive charge: like charges repel each other. The analyzer,operating, it can be said for analogy, on the same kind of charge as that contained in theengram, glances away from the engram, which remains thereby unknown and intact.As the individual returns into the area of the early engrams -- which are held keyed-inby virtue of the seized charges from late incidents -- he can quite comfortably pass byenormous quantities of aberrative material without even suspecting it is present. However,when the late moments of painful emotion are released, the auditor can go immediately into theearly area and find engrams of physical pain which he had not hitherto been able to uncover.Actually the late moments and the early moments are both engrams: the news orobservation of loss shuts down the analyzer and everything which then enters it is engramicand is filed in the reactive mind. Because of sight and a memory of activity which is connectedto the present, all of which serves to keep an individual oriented, a person can often recall themoment of loss, whereas he cannot recall prenatal material, for he lacked in that area anyconnection with orienting factors which would impinge themselves on the analyzer. While theprenatal infant definitely, especially in the late stages, has an analyzer, experience and memoryare not coordinated and the existence of engrams is not then suspected by the analytical mind.This is not true of the later periods of life, particularly those after speech has been learned andis being used. The fact of the matter is that this later-life ability to recall surrounding161"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"circumstances without feeling any extremity of pain also serves to hide here the existence of anactual engram: a person feels that he knows all about such a moment of loss analytically:actually he has no contact with the engram itself, which contains a moment of“unconsciousness” of a lesser depth than that, for instance, of the anesthetic variety. Childhoodlosses of allies, however, can be so entirely occluded that the allies themselves are notremembered.The auditor will find very late engrams easy to contact. And he will also discoversomething else. The patient may not be, as he is returning to such a moment of loss, occupyinghis own body. This “phenomenon” has been known for several thousand years and even thelatest mention of it merely said that it was “interesting” without making any further effort tofind out why a person, returned to an area in hypnotic regression, sometimes could be foundwithin himself (which is to say, seeing things as though he were himself) and sometimes sawthings there and himself included as part of the scenery (as though he had a detached view).Because we have discovered that a natural function of the mind is to return in an awake state topast incidents does not alter the fact that we encounter aspects hitherto known as mysterious“phenomena” of drug dreams and hypnotism. We are not by any means practicing hypnotism;so this means that hypnotism and dianetics use similar abilities of the mind -- it does not meanthat such abilities belong in the field of hypnotism. And one of the various aspects of the returnis that it occasionally -- or, in some patients, continually -- encounters areas where the patient is“outside” his body. These exteriorized views of self have two explanations. One of them isvalence, whereby the patient has taken unto himself the identity of another person and sees thescene through that other person’s eyes; the other is exteriorization, in which painful emotion ispresent in such quantity that the patient cannot occupy himself. That painful emotion may sternfrom past or future incidents to the moment when the patient is witnessing a scene to which hehas been dianetically returned. On several recountings of the scene, the patient will come nearerand nearer to an occupation of his body until at last he sees the scene from within his body. Attimes no emotional discharge (tears, etc.) takes place until the patient has gone over the incidentseveral times and until he is within his own body. It is as though, returned, he had to scout theground to find out if it was safe to occupy himself. If, after a few recountings, no dischargesuch as tears takes place, then the emotion is suspended elsewhere, earlier or later but usuallymuch later. Exteriorization because of emotion is the same as exteriorization because ofphysical pain to all intents and purposes of the auditor. When he encounters a case which, allthe way up and down the track, is continually exterior, he should address his skill to the releaseof moments of painful emotion.All patients seem to have the idea that time heals and that some incident of ten or twentyyears ago no longer has any effect upon them. Time is a Great Charlatan, not a great healer, ashas been remarked. Time by the processes of growth and decay alters, and environmentintroduces new faces and activities and thus alters the restimulators: a moment of painfulemotion in the past has, like any other engram, its own restimulators and is, in addition,holding keyed-in all the early engrams which relate to it so that their restimulators also work:every restimulator has a set of restimulators which are associated to it by the analytical mind,which cannot see the real restimulator. All this makes a complex pattern but complex in therapyonly if one does not know the source of aberration. If the auditor returns the patient to anymoment of painful emotion in the past and runs it as an engram, he will discover that all itsoriginal charge is present and will discharge.He will usually find the patient shying away from any thought of going into the actualengram: the pre-clear may attempt to detail all manner of bric-a-brac, his own thoughts, thereasons why it no longer is painful to him, and so forth. These thoughts and data before thefact or after it are about as much use in running an engram as a dissertation about “childhoodillusions” was to the problem of removing aberrations from the human mind. The auditor whowill listen to these “reasons” and “I remembers” in lieu of running the engram itself will not gethis patient well and will waste valuable hours of therapy. An auditor who will do this belongsto the hand-patting school of thought which believes sympathy has value. He does not belongin an auditor’s chair. It is wasted time, wasted valuable time, to listen to anything the patientthought or said or did or believed when the patient should be going into the engram and162"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"running it as an engram. Certainly there is a necessity to find out, from the patient’s talk, wherethat engram is, but once it is located, all else is dross.Take a moment when a child is notified of his parents’ deaths. The auditor learns thatthe parents died when the child was two years of age. He can then deduce, without furthertrouble or questions, that somebody must have told his patient about the death of the parents,that there was a precise moment when the patient, then an infant, learned about that death.Recounting the matter in present time -- without being returned, the patient is using all theintervening years as buffers against the painful emotion. The auditor returns the patient,without further preamble than the usual routine of putting the patient into reverie, to themoment when the patient learned of the death of the parents. The patient may do a littlefumbling to orient himself in the past, but shortly he will have a contact with the instantsomebody informed him. Be assured, if that child loved his parents at all, that an engram existshere. The engram starts at the first moment the child is informed, when the analyzer can beexpected to have shut down. The end of the engram is a moment, an hour, a day or even aweek later when the analyzer again turned on.Between the first moment of analytical attenuation and a regain of analytical power isthe engram. The first minutes of it are the most severe. Running an hour of it (an hour ofincident, not of therapy) should be more than ample. Most auditors run only the first fewminutes several times to get a test of whether or not there is going to be any emotionaldischarge. Run such a period of loss which must contain painful emotion exactly as you wouldrun a period of physical pain and “unconsciousness” with another source. For the period ofpainful emotion is an “unconscious” period just as certainly as if the patient had been struckwith a club. If the emotion in this period can be contacted with four or five recountings (eachtime starting at the beginning, making sure the patient is returned and in contact with allperceptics of the incident, and running it for what it is, an engram) then the engram should berecounted until the emotion in it is gone, until the patient is bored with it or even cheerful aboutit. If, after four or five recountings the patient is still well exteriorized, still has not contactedany emotion, then the charge is suspended elsewhere, either earlier or later, and tries should bemade in terms of other losses, no matter how many years from the unyielding incident, to get adischarge.After a discharge is blown off elsewhere the incident first addressed, as in the case ofthe two-year-old who lost his parents, may discharge. It is certain that sooner or later such anincident will discharge and it is also certain that the case will not make much progress in gettingany bulk of physically painful engrams until such a severe incident is well discharged.Discharges are contacted, often, in very unlikely places. Somewhere they contact thesurface enough so that a touch by the returned patient will permit the units to free, permitengrams to key-out and come into view on the time track in their proper places.The engram bank becomes severely distorted by painful emotion and the areas ofpainful emotion become severely distorted by physical pain elsewhere. The filing system of thereactive mind is bad. The file clerk is able to recover and deliver to the auditor only so manypainful emotion engrams or physical pain engrams at a time.They may be disordered in their positions on the track, which is to say, the auditor maycontact an early physically painful engram (always his most important job) then contact one inmid-prenatal, then one post-birth, and thereafter no other engrams of the physical pain varietyseem to be present (engrams of the physical variety which contain knock-outs by accidents,illnesses, surgery or injury). This does not mean that the case is stalemated or that the patient iscleared. It more likely means that there are incidents of the other engram variety (painfulemotion, stemming from loss by death, departure or reversal of allies) which can now becontacted.The auditor then looks for and exhausts the emotional discharge from the loss engrams,usually later in life.163"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"These, with the units freed back in circulation, allow earlier physical pain engrams toappear and the auditor reduces each one of these he can contact. As soon as he can no longerfind physically painful engrams, he goes back to a search for painful emotion engrams and soforth alternately as necessary. The mind, being a self-protecting mechanism, will sooner orlater block the patient from physical pain engrams if painful emotion engrams are ready; and itwill block him from painful emotion engrams as soon as physical pain engrams are ready.Start late to get painful emotion and work back early.Start early to get physical pain engrams and work toward late. And whenever anyengram is contacted, run it until it is no longer troublesome in any way to the patient or isentirely gone (refiled, but gone for all the auditor and patient will be able to tell at the moment).If an incident, after many recountings, shows no signs of lightening (somatic decreasing oremotion either not expressed or not decreasing), only then should the auditor seek anotherincident. In a painful emotion engram the charge is often later, in a physical pain engram thesuspension is invariably caused by the existence of the same phrase in an earlier physical painengram which can be contacted, and in such case the auditor should go back over the phraseswhich brought him to the somatic until he finds a contact and a lift of the engram.It should be extremely clear by this time that rationalization about action or conduct orconditions does not advance therapy and is of no use beyond occasional aid in locatingengrams. It should be equally clear that no amount of explanation or hand-patting or evaluationby the auditor is going to advance the erasure of the engrams themselves. It should be plain thatwhat a person thought at the time of the incident was not aberrative. It should be clear thatpainful emotion puts the compartments and demon-circuits into the mind and that the physicalengrams hold the aberration and physical pain in the body.This entire operation is mechanical. It has nothing to do with justified thought or shameor reasons. It has only to do with exhausting the engram bank. When the bulk of painfulemotion is gone, the person is released; when the engram bank is exhausted of content, theperson is cleared.The mind is like a fine piece of equipment: as itself and as a mechanism it is almostimpossible to destroy except by removing some of its parts: engrams do not remove parts ofthe mind, they add unnecessary things to it. Envision a beautiful, stream-lined machine,operating perfectly -- that would be the mind without the additions of pain and painful emotion.Now envision this beautiful machine in the hands of a crew of moronic mechanics: they startto work around it and do not know that what they do affects the machine at all. Now they seethat something is wrong with the machine and are all unwitting that they have placed variousassorted monkey-wrenches, hatpins, old cigar butts and yesterday’s garbage into it and aroundit. Their first thought is to put something new on or in the machine to correct its operation andthey add arbitrary gadgets to it in order to patch up the machine’s operation. Some of thesegadgets appear to help the machine (sympathy engrams) and can be used, in the presence of theremaining bric-a-brac, by the machine itself to help its stability. The morons interrupt the fuelsupply (painful emotional engrams) or, like the Japanese captain who beat the car with a switchwhen it would not go, try to goad the machine (punishment drive) and so add more trouble. Atlast this machine appears to be a hopeless wreck, being almost hidden beneath everythingadded to it and thrust into it, and the moron mechanics shake their heads and say, “Let’s putsomething else on it or it will stop!” They do and the machine appears to stop (goes insane).In dianetics, a workmanlike job of clearing away the debris in and around the machineis performed. It is not done by adding any more debris. The moron mechanics (the content ofthe reactive mind) seem dismayed at this action, but the machine itself, suddenly aware thatsomething is being done for it which will actually bring it into good running operation again,begins to help. The more debris which is cleared, the better it runs and the less force the moronmechanics have. The course of improvement should be and is rapid. We can stop when themachine is running at least as well as the “normal” machine (a release) or we can stop when wehave all the debris out of the machine (a clear). When we have effected a clear, we behold164"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"something which has never been beheld before because it never before existed in a debris-freestate: a perfect machine, stream-lined, powerful, shining, able to adjust and care for all its ownoperations without further therapeutic assistance of any kind.165"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIIISome Types of EngramsTwo examples of each kind of engram are given, so that the auditor can clearlyunderstand their differences:CONTRA-SURVIVAL ENGRAMThis is any kind of engram which lies across the dynamics and has no alignment withpurpose: Fight between mother and father shortly after conception. Father strikes mother instomach. She screams (first percepts are pain, pressure, sound of blow and scream) and hesays, “God damn you, I hate you! You are no good. I’m going to kill you!” Mother says,“Please don’t hit me again. Please don’t. I’m hurt. I’m hurt. I’m frantic with pain!” Fathersays, “Lie there and rot, damn you! Good-bye!”In this engram we have a severe aberrative situation, first, because it is early; second,because its content says the person who has it is hurt and frantic; third, because it has a holderand is therefore apt to become chronic (“Lie there”); fourth, because it can produce disease(“and rot”); fifth, because it has religious connotation about God and being damned; sixth,because it gives the individual a feeling other people are no good (“you” applies to otherpeople, ordinarily); seventh, because it has an emotional tone, by content, of hostility (“I hateyou”) and eighth, because the individual, post-birth, has to live with these restimulativepersons, his father and mother. It has other additional effects, giving, like all engrams, twoadditional and unnecessary valences to the individual, one of which, the mother’s, is a cowardvalence and the other, the father’s, a bully valence. The individual may dramatize this in severalways: if he does not dramatize it, he feels the pain (as he would then be in his own valence)whenever it is restimulated; if he dramatizes the mother, he will feel the pain she received,which is a blow in the stomach (whereas his own was on his head and heart); if he dramatizesthe father, he will be in trouble with society, to say nothing of his own wife and children.There is no winning with any engram of any kind but so long as a person has engrams, somekinds, the sympathy engram particularly, serve to hold away antagonistic engrams.The second contra-survival example is a morning sickness engram where the mother isvomiting so violently that the compression on the child is severe and renders it “unconscious.”The mother is vomiting and gasping and saying to herself between spasms, “Oh, why was Iever born! I knew I shouldn’t have let him come in me. I knew it, I knew it. It was wrong buthe had to do it anyway. Ugh, how nasty. Sex is nasty. It’s horrible. I hate sex. I hate men. Ihate them. Oh, ugh, it won’t come up, it won’t come up. I am so sick at my stomach and itwon’t come up.”In this engram we have something a woman might dramatize if she were pregnant butwhich a man could never dramatize as pregnancy but only by being sick at his stomach. Muchmorning sickness seems to be an aberration stemming from engrams: somewhere back in timesome mother may have vomited from food poisoning and started the whole thing -- perhaps inthe days when Man was still in trees. Now note that the mother is throwing up, that the contentof her stomach is being regurgitated: the engram, however, says that it won’t come up: whenthis is dramatized with the individual in his own valence, he experiences pressure on him and“unconsciousness” and thus such a dramatization is impossible; when this is dramatized it mustbe dramatized as the mother but the action is not dramatized so much as the command and weget a condition where the individual with such an engram, when he is sick, cannot vomit. Thecommand of the engram is more important than the action people take in it. On a reactive levelthere is no rationality. If this were on a conscious level, where it would not be aberrative, ofcourse, the action could be mimicked and then would contain actual vomiting, the action on theconscious level being more important than the word content.166"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"In therapy, when we encounter this engram, we may have difficulty entering it becauseit says that “I shouldn’t have let him come in me,” which is a denyer. We also find, with the “Itwon’t come up,” a holder. The engram will most certainly lift the moment these words and thesomatic lift, and these words could not interrupt the engram. If the engram does not lift, it isbecause there is a previous engram with much the same content (the aberree has a pattern ofdramatization which he repeats over and over and over, giving people around him manyincidents which are more or less alike except in their point in time). This could be restimulatedin the environment (but not in therapy) to a point where it would cause madness, for “it” mayalso refer to the child, who identifying himself with the word “it,” then cannot rise to presenttime. In therapy the engram is somewhat drained of power just by being touched with thereturned analytical mind; further, the auditor discovers the patient is not moving on the trackand a scout of the situation soon discovers the holder, for the patient will sooner or later say he“can’t come up” even if the auditor has not guessed it.In the aberrative sphere, this engram would probably put a heavy block across thesecond dynamic and we would find the person in whose reactive mind it was being frigid,prudish and sharp with children (all of which go together in various combinations). Further,we would find an apprehension that “he” was going to have to do something when he foundout it was wrong.In the psycho-somatic sphere it might cause headaches during or because of coitus or atendency to nausea whenever coitus was performed. Any of the phrases of this engram, likeany other phrases in any other engram, would tend to give him both the somatic and theaberration, providing, of course, the individual was in a state of low analytical power as foundin weariness or slight illness. Thus, this one is waiting until somebody says during a future“unconsciousness” period, preferably in a voice like the mother’s would sound through thewalls of the abdomen and womb, “Ugh, how nasty!” or some other phrase to key it in.“Nastier,” by the way, would not key it in: “ugly” despite a similar syllable to “Ugh” wouldnot key it in. The sound of vomiting itself probably would key it in. PRO-SURVIVAL ENGRAMThis could be any engram which, by content only, not by any real aid to the individualcontaining it, pretended to assist survival. Let us take a coitus engram: mother and father areengaged in intercourse which, by pressure, is painful to the unborn child and which rendershim “unconscious” (common occurrence, like morning sickness, usually present in any engrambank). Mother is saying, “Oh, I can’t live without it. It’s wonderful. It’s wonderful. Oh, hownice. Oh, do it again!” and father is saying, “Come! Come! Oh, you’re so good. You’re sowonderful! Ahhh!” Mother’s orgasm puts the finishing touch on the “unconsciousness” in thechild. Mother says, “It’s beautiful.” Father, finished now, says, “Get up,” meaning she shouldtake a douche (they do not know she is pregnant) and then begins to snore.Obviously this is a valuable incident because one “cannot live without it.” Furthermore,“it’s beautiful,” also, “it’s wonderful.” But it is also extremely painful.It cannot be followed because it has first something which beckons part of the mindback, “Come!” and then, later, tells it to “Get up.” Things that are “beautiful” and “wonderful”can cause our patient, not in therapy, to have an orgasm when she looks at beautiful andwonderful things, providing they have been so labeled.Dramatization of this can be in either the father valence or the mother valence: todramatize it in the personal valence would mean physical pain. Thus, the individual holdingthis, will be found, varied only by his other coitus engrams, to be, as father, disgusted after theact and telling his partner to “Get up.” The emotion is contained in how the words, “Get up,”were spoken: this is a telegraphed emotion out of voice tones, not word content: engramsalways contain both.167"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"In therapy, we find the reactive mind very chary of letting this one come to viewbecause, after all, one “cannot live without it.” There are whole classes of these favorableevaluation phrases in engrams and wherever he comes upon one the auditor will find the pre-clear’s reactive mind holding out on him. “I don’t want to lose you,” “Hold on to this,” “I can’tlet go of this, I’d fall,” and so forth. But this is, after all, just another engram and “pleasant” ornot is aberrative.Masochistic and sadistic impulses often stem from coital engrams which contain thosespecific things, so the auditor is not to infer that merely because this coitus is painful to thechild, it will make the child a masochist or a sadist. If masochism or sadism is present in thepatient it is caused by engrams which contain rapes, beating for sexual gratification, enjoymentof pain, etc., and engrams which homonymically seem to state that sex and pain are alike suchas a “normal” coitus which says, “It hurts so good! Hurt me again, Bill. Hurt me again! Oh,shove it in me, way up! Make it hurt so I can come.” Dramatized by a boy, this might very wellbring about sodomy because the engram is not an observed action but a series of commands,literally taken.Thus our pro-survival coitus engram, as the first example of one here, is relativelyinnocent in a person’s aberrative pattern. But by an accident of words, it could be verydifferent in its aberrative effect.The second pro-survival example concerns another prenatal engram. (One auditorcommented, while he was being cleared, that he “had thought of my life B.D. -- beforedianetics -- as a graph of years, in which the time from conception to birth occupied one-fiftiethof the linear distance between conception and present time, but now think of the prenatal periodas occupying two-thirds of the distance between the beginning and now.” The prenatal area,cleared, at last went back to being one-fiftieth.)The mother, subject to high blood pressure, continually brought about a condition ofgreat pain in the unborn infant, particularly when she was agitated. (This is a prime source ofmigraine headache.) Whatever it was which agitated her into high blood pressure at the momentthis engram was received was unknown -- and much of the “plot” of prenatal life may remainunknown for the explanatory data may come before the pain and the engram and a completerecording only happens after the instant of pain when some degree of “unconsciousness”comes about. The mother, at the beginning of the engram, when pressure began to build upand stiffen out the unborn child, was weeping. She was by herself. “Oh, how am I ever goingto get out of it. Everything looks so drab and colorless to me. Oh, why did I ever start it; Ican’t possibly go through with it. But I have to, I have to.I would be sick if I didn’t. Oh,Lord, everything comes in on me at once. I am utterly trapped. But there, I will go throughwith it, I’ll feel better. I’ll be brave and do it. I’ve got to be brave. I am brave. I am the bravestperson in the world. I have to be and I am.” The pressure receded.Exactly what this was about will remain a mystery to the auditor who reduced it, thepatient who had it, the auditor and the reader: such is often the case with an engram. They areconceived in misunderstanding and they aren’t to be understood, save mechanically, and onlydeleted from the engram bank.This is a particularly dangerous engram to have for it contains a manic in the words,“bravest person in the world.” “I,” of course, is ordinarily used by the unborn child to behimself, when the engram is at last able to affect an analyzer in which there is speech. Beforethat moment, of course, there is just a recording without word meaning, although even beforethe words are given meaning, the engram can be aberrative. This is further dangerous becauseit says, “I’m trapped,” and because it says, “Everything comes in on me at once.” “Trapped” isour enemy, the holder. But “everything comes in on me at once” is a grouper. Further, theremainder of the content, as an engram, will not compute in the analyzer. It says one “must gothrough with it,” but that one “cannot go through with it,” that one “would get sick if I didn’tgo through with it” but that “it is impossible.” Everything being equal to everything, as our168"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"moronic enemy, the reactive mind computes, this engram both repels and attracts therapy: itbrings about a condition of indecision in the analytical mind which is insufferable.The individual holding this engram might find himself -- as it acted as aberration -- firstin the manic portion of being the bravest person in the world and then, regressed a trifle by aslight change of restimulators such as his migraine headache getting bad, find himself utterlyundecided about any course of action and with the telegraphed emotion, contained in the tears,of being very depressed. But this is pro-survival because it apparently dictates a way out of asituation. As an additional factor, it brings, with its phrase about “everything being drab andcolorless” color blindness at least in recall so that the recalled images of the past are “seen” inthe mind as having no color. It can bring about, if added to by enough subsequentdramatizations, actual perceptic color blindness. The whole engram is very likely, whencombined with other factors, to place the individual in an institution with all of his somaticturned on (migraine) and, because of the grouper, all other pain he felt in his life turned on aswell. This grouper bunches the track of the engram bank all into one place and then puts theindividual squarely in that place.In therapy, when this was contacted, a case which had been classified as “insane” cameinto a release state of “normal.” The patient had been institutionalized, was in the foetal positionand had regressed physically. That she kept screaming these exact words and weeping hadbeen placed on her record as the manifestation of a childhood delusion. The case was openedby repeater technique, using the words she kept screaming, after she had had her attentionfixed upon the auditor by loud, monotonous noise. There were some former incidentscontaining these words which had to be reached before the incident in dramatization wouldease. However, engrams like this are commonly contacted in more or less “normal” people andare relieved as routine. A very high degree of restimulation had been experienced by this patientand several severe “loss” engrams had occurred which had kept earlier content keyed-in.It might also be remarked in re all these “trapped,” “caught,” “can’t get out of it” cases(which is to say where there are several holders and also a high quantity of painful emotion)that certain foetal aspects are visible even when the case is “normal.” A shiny skin, a spinalcurvature, only partial development of the gonads, all are common and one or many such signsmay be present.SYMPATHY ENGRAMThe first example is an illness suffered by a patient when he was a small boy. At twoyears and a half he was taken ill with pneumonia. He had a considerable background ofattempted abortion and the usual engram cargo received from aberrated parents. He wasextremely worried about the quarrels and upsets od his own home; numbers of his engramshad been keyed-in and amongst them was his pneumonia. His grandmother came and took himto her home because, whenever he was ill, his mother would go away and leave him. Theincident was extremely occluded and was only reached after several late life painful emotionengrams had been discharged and after almost a hundred prenatal physical pain engrams hadbeen released. The grandmother, when he was crying in delirium, mistook his activity asdemonstrating that he was “conscious,” which he was not, and she sought to reason with him.She said, “Those people don’t really mean to be so bad to you, honey. I know they have goodhearts really. You just do what they say and believe what they tell you and you’ll be all right.Now promise you’ll do that, won’t you, honey.” The child, in the last depths of reaction,responded and promised her he would believe them and do what they said. “I love you verymuch,” the grandmother continued, “and I will take care of you. Now don’t worry, honey.Forget it now. Just get a little rest.”The phrases contained in this engram, because they were on a trance level and becausethey could be held in place by his fever and pain, produced a very profound effect on the child.He had to believe whatever was said. This means literal belief and cost him, for one thing,much of his sense of humor. Because he wanted to be all right, he had to believe what his169"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"parents said; the things they had said, prenatally, contained every kind of a bad datum possibleabout who was the boss and how much fun it was to beat the mother and so forth. All this,then, was made into “true data” which, because his sympathy engram said so, he had tobelieve. No more horrible curse could ever be laid on anyone than those in sympathy engramswhich say “Believe what is said,” “Believe what is read,” “Believe people,” because thatengram means literally that the poor old analyzer will now never be able to evaluate its owndata unless, by utter rebellion, the individual negates against the whole world, which canoccasionally be done. Let this individual, however, as this one did, marry a woman who hascharacteristics similar to his grandmother’s (a pseudo-grandmother) and he becomes prey to:(a) the pain and illness, chronic, which he experienced in his grandmother sympathy engrams(necessary to get and keep her sympathy); and (b) all his prenatals, since the pseudo-grandmother throws him into his own valence: This makes him quarrel, which makes his wifefight back, and suddenly this woman is not pseudo-grandmother but pseudo-mother. Exitsanity.In therapy, when we encounter this sympathy engram at last, it is discovered to havebeen buried in two ways: (a) it was aligned with purpose; and (b) it had a forgetter mechanismon it.Because of (a) the self-protection of the mind permitted it to give up the engram onlywhen enough tension was taken off the case to permit the mind to get along without thisengram.In (b) we have a device which is common in engrams. Whenever we try to run anengram which has somatics enough even to make the pre-clear roll around on the couch butwhich contains no word content, we suspect a forgetter mechanism. There are evidently peoplein this world who think that the panacea for all mental discomfort is to forget: “Put it out of mymind,” “If I remembered it I would go mad,” “Junior, you never remember a thing I tell you,”“Nobody can remember anything,” “Can’t remember,” and just plain “I don’t know,” as wellas the master of the family of phrases, “Forget it!” all bar information from the analyzer. Awhole case, freshly opened, may keep answering everything with one of these denyers (thereare many other kinds of denyers, if you recall). Repeater technique will eventually begin torelease the phrase from various engrams and begin to show up incidents. To have agrandmother who says, “Forget it” continually every time a child gets hurt is to be cursedbeyond Macbeth. A forgetter, used by an ally, all by itself and with practically no pain oremotion present will submerge data which, in recall, would not be aberrative but which, soburied -- by a forgetter -- makes things said just before it aberrative and literal.Hence this engram remained utterly out of sight until the case was almost finished andas soon as it was contacted, the already de-intensified reactive bank collapsed and the patientwas cleared.The second example of the sympathy engram concerns a childhood experience of apatient who, at the beginning of therapy, was a remarkably confused individual. Here is anexample of sympathy engram which is not uncommon. (It will not be primary in any allycomputation but because it is often repeated in the same case, becomes aberrative.) Thisincident occurred when the child had been badly hurt in an accident. He had received afractured skull and concussion and was for many days in a coma. He had never learned thatsuch an incident happened to him although examination afterwards disclosed evidence of thefracture and disclosed also that while he had known there was a ridge in his skull he had neverwondered about it for an instant. His father and mother were, at the time, on the verge ofdivorce and, in the presence of the only partly conscious child, quarreled several times in thesefew days, evidently upset by his accident and recriminative as to whose fault it was. The firstpart of the series of engrams within this one large engram are unimportant as an example savethat they brought about a condition where the mother put herself forward as a defender of thechild who was not under attack by the father. The mother’s conversation aberrativelyindictated that the father was attacking the child, and the words in an engram rather than theaction are important as aberrative factors. Finally the father left the house and home. The170"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"mother sat down by the boy’s trundle bed and, weeping, told him she would keep him fromdying, that she would “work and slave and wear her fingers to the bone” to keep him alive and“I am the only reason you are alive. I have defended you against that beast and monster. If itwere not for me, you would have died long ago and I am going to care for you and protectyou. So don’t pay any attention to anything people tell you. I am a good mother. I have alwaysbeen a good mother. Don’t listen to them. Please, baby, stay here and get well, please!”This remarkable piece of nonsense came, of course, straight out of her reactive mind.She did not feel guilty about the way she was taking care of the baby, though she had done hercyclic worst for this child since conception. (There is no such thing as guilt nor a guilt complexthat is not straight out of an engram that says, “I am guilty” or some such similar phrase.)Here is ambivalence at work. By ambivalent is meant power on two sides. It had betterbe called multivalence, for it is demonstrable that people have many valences, twenty or thirtynot being unusual for a “normal.” This mother, with her wild pleas and her mawkishsentimentality, shifted around in valences like a whirling dervish. She was capable of beingviciously cruel, torturing her child with, as the Navy calls them, “capricious and unusualpunishments”: yet one of these valences which, unfortunately for the patient, only turned onwhen he was ill, was one of savage protection for the child and assurances to him that sheloved him and would never leave him to starve, etc. She formed, in this child, because of herown reactive pattern and her inabilities, close to a thousand engrams before he was ten. Thisparticular specimen given was fairly standard.The aberrative aspect of this engram was a “conviction” that if one’s mother were notaround and if one were not on good terms with her, one would starve, die or suffer generally.Also it meant, because of the time it was given, having a bad headache if one wanted to live.The whole series of these engrams made a highly complex pattern of psycho-somatic illsincluding sinusitis, a chronic rash, allergies and numerous other actual physical ills, despite thefact that the patient had always tried to be as forthright in his physical being as possible andwas not in any way a hypochondriac.In therapy the entire chain of fights in this area, much of the prenatal area and most latelife painful emotion engrams were relieved before this sympathy engram displayed itself.As a note on the subject of sympathy engrams, these are in nowise exclusively found inchildhood: they exist prenatally and postnatally -- and sometimes late in life. Any persons whodefend the child against further abortion attempts become part of the sympathy engram chainsand, of course, they are allies whose loss is something to be dreaded. Late sympathy engramshave been discovered at fifty years of age. One, discovered at thirty, consisted of anymphomaniac nurse who, during the period when the patient was still under ether and still inpain, talked to him obscenely, played with his genitals and still managed, by the content of herremarks, to plant a sympathy engram which produced a very serious psychic condition in thepatient. (It is in nowise true that many cases of sexual play exist while the patient is underanesthetic or drugged but because this is a standard psychotic reaction of delusion is no reasonto rule that the incident cannot occasionally happen.)The sympathy engram only has to sound like a sympathy engram to become one: thereis no evaluation of actual intent by the reactive mind.PAINFUL EMOTION ENGRAMThree of these are given to illustrate a type of each. They can happen at any period,including prenatally, but are most easily tapped in more recent life, when they will then leadback to early incidents of physical pain, sympathy engrams and the like. The first example is acase of loss by death of an ally. A girl, at the age of eighteen, was given a painful emotionengram by being told by her parents that her aunt was dead. The aunt was a prime ally. Thepatient, treated at the age of thirty-one, recalled the death of her aunt but attributed her sorrow171"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"to other things such as a restimulation of what she called her own “death instinct” (which was,in reality, engramic chatter by mother about wanting to die and get it all over with). Actually theaunt had been a large factor in dissuading the mother from “getting rid of” the child and hadmade the mother promise that she would not. The aunt had also tended the child, postnatally,through illnesses and was, in fact, the only refuge for the girl when a termagant mother and areligiously bigoted father would converge on her, for neither had wanted her and there hadbeen a number of efforts to terminate the pregnancy pre-term.Her father communicated the information to the girl with a sonorous voice andappropriately long face. “I want you to be very respectful at the funeral, Agatha.” (“Whatfuneral?”) “Your aunt just passed to the great beyond.” (“She’s dead?”) “Yes, death must cometo us all and we must all be prepared some day to meet the fate which waits for us at the end ofthe road. For it is a long path, life, and God and flaming hell wait at its other end and somedaywe all must die. Be sure you are very respectful at the funeral.” She had begun to pale at theword “funeral,” she was to all purposes “unconscious” when she heard the first mention of“death” and she remained “unconscious,” if moving about, for two whole days. The case hadbeen very slow until this engram was discovered and run. An enormous discharge of grieftook place, which had never before manifested itself. It was reduced to boredom in eightrecountings, at which the first moment of the aunt’s intervention in the abortion attempts wasautomatically contacted and released.Thereafter the case made progress in the prenatal area, prohibition against “getting ridof it” having been removed and (according to theory, free units being available), the charge hadcome off the prenatal area. There were five other allies in this case, the girl, with parents whohad been so wicked to her, having attached herself to anyone who would show her interest andrefuge. As lower physical pain came into view, more allies showed up and more painfulemotion engrams were discharged, permitting new physically painful engrams to displaythemselves.The next example is an engram from a patient who had all his life been reared and caredfor by “moneyed parents.” He had a very severe prenatal area which yet would not lift to view.It was discovered at length that his nurses had been his only source of love and affection andthat his mother, being a woman who liked to unsettle the household as often as possible,would discharge a nurse every time she found the child had grown fond of her, even thoughthe mother herself made it plain that she considered the child “nasty.” The engram: the boy seeshis nurse coming out of the house with her suitcase in her hand: he stops playing in the yardand runs to her to “scare her”: she is quite angry from the scene she has just had -- an Irish girl-- and yet she smooths her face and kneels down beside him. “I am leaving, Buddy. I can’tstay here any more. No, I can’t be your nurse now. But there, there, you’ll have another one.Don’t cry. It’s not good for little boys to cry. Good-bye, Buddy. I love you.” And she goesoff out of sight.He was stunned from the first instant she said she was leaving. The prohibition againstcrying was from an ally: whatever an ally says must be good and must be believed becauseallies are survival and one must survive: allies therefore must be believed. He had not criedexcept on rare occasions of enormous sorrow in all the years thereafter. Eight of thesedepartures were touched without result but with this one, they all loosened and discharged, oneafter the other.Any departure of or from an ally contains an emotional charge which, if it will notdisplay itself, is elsewhere suppressed.The third example of the painful emotion engram is the third type, loss of an ally byreversal. A wife loved her husband very dearly. They had gotten along well together until hisparents came into the vicinity and began to malign his wife. He was furious with them for itand quarreled with them. His wife was a pseudo-ally and unfortunately that ally had told thechild to believe his parents. (This is fairly chronic with allies -- if they would give the childcorrect data when he is emotionally disturbed or ill, there would be less trouble. A remark such172"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"as, “Well, you’ll grow up some day and be able to care for yourself,” is much better than a hatfull of Emersonian platitudes.) This brought about a tragic reversal. The reactive mind,restimulated at the sight of his wife (the husband was emotionally disturbed, very restimulatedalready by his parents) threw in the data that one must believe one’s parents. This made hiswife no good, as per their aberrative chatter. He went into his father’s valence to escape thisimponderable situation and that valence beat women. He struck his wife repeatedly,dramatizing one of his father’s engrams: “I hate you. You are no good. I should have listenedto them sooner. You’re no good.”The wife was in therapy. This charge suppressed itself, not out of shame for herhusband’s actions but for the mechanical reason that the early area had to be relieved before thisone would discharge (smart file clerk). Her case had slowed down to a point where the boardlooked entirely clear although somatics (which she attributed to natural causes) and aberrations(which she said were reasonable reactions) still manifested themselves. Suddenly this incidentappeared when repeater technique was used on the auditor’s random guess: “I hate you,” for itwas known that she said this now and then to her husband. Three recountings discharged thispainful emotion despite its violence (it made her weep until she almost choked). Immediatelytwelve prenatals, all fights between her mother and father (an ally, of which her husband wasthe pseudo-ally) wherein the mother beat her abdomen and cursed the child, appeared and wereerased and the case progressed to clear.Loss of dogs, dolls, money, position, even the threat of a loss, anything may bringabout a painful emotion engram so long as it is loss. It may be loss by death, loss by departure,loss by reversal. Anything connected with the life of the patient and associated by him with hisown survival seems to be capable of locking up life units when lost. A condition of suchpainful emotion is that it has early physically painful engrams upon which to append. Thephysically painful engram is still the villain but it has an accomplice in the painful emotionengram.173"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IXPART ONEMechanisms and Aspects of TherapyTHE CASE ENTRANCEEvery case presents a new problem of entrance. No two human beings are exactly alikeand no two cases will follow the exact pattern. However, this presents no problem to dianeticssince the mechanics are always the same.There are three case classifications: the sonic-recall, the non-sonic recall and theimaginary recall (what auditors call a “dub-in” recall).In the sonic recall case, the entrance is very easy. But in all cases the basic procedure isthe same. Put the patient in reverie (and don’t worry too much if he doesn’t go into a very deepreverie because reverie only serves to fix his attention on himself and the auditor and you can atleast accomplish that). Install a canceller. Return him to childhood to pick up a pleasant incidentand then find a minor pain incident such as a slap in the face. Run him through this a few timesjust to let him get the idea. If he doesn’t respond well, put him into yesterday and let him rideto work and ask him about sounds and sights, then send him to childhood again.The object of finding a minor incident such as a slapped face is to find out if the patienthas a pain shutoff. A pain shut-off is not particularly difficult in dianetics. You can get backbefore the command which installed the anesthesia, but it is interesting to know about itbecause you want to look for it early in the case. See then if the patient has an emotional shut-off. This again is not particularly embarrassing but again is data you want to find eventually.Test now to find out if the patient is within himself or if he is outside himself, watchinghimself. If he is exteriorized, you are working a case which has considerable walled upemotion in it which must be discharged.Now make a try to basic-basic. You might surprise yourself and get it. And you mightwork fifty hours for it, releasing the case the while. Get whatever the file clerk will give you inthe prenatal area and what you get, reduce.Whether basic-basic is contacted or not, locate as many prenatals as will presentthemselves without much coaxing and reduce each one.If you find no prenatals, bring the patient up to present time but remind him to keep hiseyes closed. Now ask him a few questions about his family, his grandparents, his wife or, ifthe pre-clear is a woman, her husband. Ask about any former husbands or wives. Ask aboutchildren. And ask particularly about death. You are looking for a painful emotion engram, aninstant of loss which will discharge.Finding out about one, even if it is just the death of a favorite dog, return the pre-clearto it and run it from the first moment he hears the news of it and for the ensuing few minutes ofit. Then start it again. Reduce the moment as an engram. You want an emotional discharge.Run it several times. If you don’t get a discharge, find some other moment of loss, somefailure, something, anything which will discharge: but do it all quietly as if with sympathy.Lacking any success, start in repeater technique, never for a moment giving any intelligencethat you are anything but calmly concerned for his welfare (even if some of his gyrations worryyou). Try such phrases as “Poor little -- “ using his or her childhood name.When the pre-clear has repeated this several times (the auditor at the same time statingthat somatic strip will return to any incident containing the phrase to assist the “suck down”),he may find himself in a high tension incident which will discharge. If nothing discharges yet,174"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"keep calm (all this work will pay dividends in the next session or the next or next), keepsearching, keep observing. There is emotional charge here somewhere which will discharge.Try other combinations of words such as those which would be said to a sick and worriedchild, make the pre-clear repeat them.If you have had no success as yet, make another test, without saying it is a test, to seeif the pre-clear is actually leaving present time. Don’t let him “try to remember” -- you wanthim to return and that is another process, although it is just as natural to the brain. If he is stuckin present time, start him on repeater technique again, suggesting bouncers: “Get out and nevercome back!” “You can’t ever return!” etc., which would account for his being still in presenttime. If he is not returning after some of this, start in with holder phrases: “I’m stuck!” “Don’tmove!” and so forth.Stay calm, never appear anxious. If you get neither a discharge nor an engram withrepeater technique in this first session and if you get no motion on the track, read this manualagain and try your patient not later than three days after this first session. At that time some ofthe data you have asked for may be available.Ordinarily, however, you will receive either a prenatal or a discharge and if you get adischarge, then ask the somatic strip to go back for the prenatal it was sitting on. Reduceeverything you can find. If birth turns up and seems to be in full recall, try to reduce that but doso in the knowledge that it probably will not lift very far and in the knowledge that you hadbetter run it over and over and over to de-intensity it all you can.Sometimes the pre-clear will go into a deeper reverie than you wish. But do not try towake him into a higher level. Work him where he is. But if he seems to be in somethingapproaching hypnotic trance, be very careful of your language. Never tell him, for instance, togo back there and stay there until he finds something. That’s a holder. Don’t use holders andbouncers and groupers et al. on anyone in dianetics. “Will you please return to the prenatalarea?” “Let’s see if the somatic strip can locate an early moment of pain or discomfort.” “Pleasepick up the somatic at the beginning and roll the engram.” “What do you hear, please?”“Continue” (when you want him to keep on going from the point of the engram where he is tothe later end of the engram). “Recount that again, please.”There’s nothing to be nervous about. If you get nervous, then he’ll get nervous.Sometimes you run into a pain shut-off. This has a tendency to put the pain into themuscles and the muscles will jump and quiver and the patient may sense this and still feelnothing more. Once in a great while a patient will have such a thorough pain shut-off that hebounces about, all unconscious of the action, and almost falls from couch to floor. If you runinto this, do not be alarmed: the pain is locked in somehow. Get early enough and you’ll locatea somatic he can feel, or go late and find an emotional charge.Don’t be misled if he tells you, with regard to emotion, that he has worked it all out inpsycho-analysis or some such thing. He may have walled in the death of his wife or sweetheartor child, but the whole engram is still there, crammed with captured units, ready to be runexactly as an engram.If you run into a heavy emotional charge, simply let the patient weep, keep him at thebusiness of running the engram in a soft, sympathetic voice, have it recounted until there is nocharge left in any of it and then run him early into the prenatal area or early childhood to get aphysical pain engram that must have been below that emotional charge and held it in place.The extravagance of emotional discharge is nothing to be alarmed about. Bringing thepatient out of it and to present time suddenly would cause him unhappiness about it. Runningthe painful emotion engram will discharge, in a few recountings, sorrow which society hasbelieved could never be countered or relieved except by repression. Get the moment he firstheard the news or observed the thing which made him feel so bad. Run it far enough from its175"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"beginning to make sure that you have the initial shock -- a few minutes of engram time will do-- and then get him to recount it again. He may observe himself to be far outside himself whenyou start. The moment may not discharge until you have run it several times. Remember, he isreturned to the incident, he is not running it as a memory, a thing which would do no goodwhatever.Do not let him replay anything, ever. Repay is a bad habit some pre-clears have ofplaying over what they remember they said the last time instead of progressing through theengram freshly on each recounting and contacting what is contained in the engram itself. Tellthe pre-clear there may be some more in it, ask him what color the bed in the room he isreturned to is, keep his attention, by any quiet mechanism, upon the scene. And do not let himreplay ever, not on any engram at any time: he could replay forever without therapeutic value,each time saying what he remembered he said the last time. There is a difference between thisand the repeated re-experiencing of the engram to gather additional data and to get rid of thecharge.Discharge emotion, reduce incidents of physical pain as early prenatally as possible. Ifyou can’t get into the prenatal area at first, it has many bouncers in it and repeater techniquewill take you there.If the patient keeps saying such a thing as “I can’t remember,” be patient -- alwaysfollow the code. Have him start running that phrase as repeater technique. If he gets a somaticbut contacts nothing else, send him earlier. If he gets another and still can’t contact on “I can’tremember,” send him earlier, his whole engram bank must be strewn with them -- poor fellow.Somebody really didn’t want him to know what had happened to him. Eventually you will getback to an engram which will release a phrase. When he has gone over the phrase a few moretimes, he will smile or chuckle or perhaps merely feel relieved. Now you can either run theengram in which you found the earliest phrase, which is best, or you can come back towardpresent time, lifting the phrase as it later appeared. Or you can start on something else whichmay block the case.The goal and the whole goal is to place the standard bank in entire conscious reach ofthe individual by deleting (a) early and subsequently all physical pain engrams; (b) all demoncircuits (which are merely contained in engrams and come up more or less automatically); and(c) all painful emotion engrams.The process of work is to get as early as you can, preferably prenatal and very early inthat, and try to find and reduce an engram, complete with all somatics (pain) and perceptics(words and other sensations). If you fail in this, you go late, any time from birth forward topresent time, and find a moment of loss or threatened loss from which you can get anemotional charge. Then you go back early, early, early and find the engram on which it rested.You try always, until you are certain you have it, to get basic-basic, the earliest engram. Youreduce as many early engrams as you can find, using the file clerk and repeater system, andwhen you seem to run out of material, you go later into life and try to find another emotionalcharge.The physically painful engrams cover up later emotional charges. Emotional chargescover up physically painful engrams. Back and forth, back and forth. Run as much as you canget early: when it seems to be running out or getting too unemotional, get some later material.This is the way you work a case. No matter what kind of a case it is, no matter what thestate of its recall, no matter if the case is normal, psychotic or neurotic or what, this is the way.These are the tools:(1) Reverie or fixed attention if you cannot get reverie.(2) Return.176"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"(3) Repeater technique.(4) A knowledge of bouncers, holders, groupers, misdirectors, denyers.(5) A knowledge of the painful emotion engram.(6) The reduction or the erasure.(7) The flash answer.(8) The valence shift.This is all you need to do:(1) Keep the patient mobile, able to move on the track.(2) Reduce or erase everything you get your hands on.(3) Deduce from the remarks of the patient, in or out of therapy, what must be hisbouncers, holders, groupers, misdirectors, denyers.(4) Keep it solidly in mind that the number one goal is basic-basic, the earliest moment ofpain and “unconsciousness.”(5) Keep in mind that the patient may have “computations” which make his illness or hisaberrated state “valuable” to him and discover whence those “computations” come byflash answer to your questions.(6) Keep the case progressing, gaining, work only for progress and gain, not for sudden,soaring results.

Goahead.”(11) Wife, son, whatever you may be to the pre-clear, you are the auditor when you areauditing. He cannot compute his own engrams to find them -- if he could they wouldnot be engrams. You can compute them. Do what you think a good auditor would do,never what the patient says save only when he accidentally concurs in his opinion that agood auditor would do that. Be the auditor, not a recording device. You and the fileclerk in his mind are running the case: what his engrams and his analytical mind believeshould have no force in any of your computations. You and his file clerk know. He, as“I” doesn’t know.(12) Be surprised at nothing. Audit.These are the things you must not do:177"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"(1) Dilute dianetics with some practice or belief of yesteryear; you will only slow orsidetrack a case. Analyzing data received on any other basis than getting more engramsleads to delay and confusion for the pre-clear. It is a temptation to use this material forother reasons than getting engrams if one has been trained in another field thandianetics. Yielding to that temptation before one knows how dianetics works is a veryunfair test of dianetics, completely aside from the way it snarls a case. The temptation isgreat because, with dianetics, you get such a wealth of data.(2) Do not bully the patient. If the case is not progressing, then the fault lies with theauditor. Do not surrender to an old practice of getting mad at a patient just because hedoesn’t get well. You may be sure the engram you have just reduced out of his reactiveengram bank is the reason he won’t take baths, but if he still refuses to bathe, be certainthere is an earlier reason.(3) Don’t assume grandly that you have a “different” case just because it doesn’t resolveswiftly.

Every time you find a patient talking in past tense instead ofpresent tense he is not returned to an incident. Unless he is returned, the engram willnot lift.(8) Do not suppose that because a patient does not feel bad today about a sorrow ofyesterday that a despair charge is not located back on his track when he received theimpact of that despair.

Now and then the time track is found to be in good condition and the engramsavailable, but this is not ordinary.No case can be said to be more difficult than another except in the matter of recalls,“dub-ins” and shut-offs. But the case which seems to be “stuck in present time” and on whomno repeater phrase works is very often quite puzzling to an auditor. The pre-clear will notreturn to engrams. Ordinarily there may be pain and emotional shut-offs and the painfulemotion cannot be quickly discharged. Sometimes somatics will turn on but no content can begained. Sometimes there is no somatic but content. The situations are quite various.There are several things an auditor can do. The first of them is to use his wits. The nextis to indoctrinate the patient into returning. This indoctrination is quite simple. The auditortakes the patient back a few hours and has the patient tell what he sees. The sonic and visiomay be occluded but the patient may have some idea of what is taking place. The auditor thentakes him back a few days, then a few months and finally several years, each time getting thepatient to describe his “surroundings” as best he can. The patient now has the idea of returning.He can travel at least along portions of his life which are not occluded by engrams.When the patient is returned to some early moment in his life, begin to use repeatertechnique on him, aiming toward obvious things such as feeling shut-offs (going over theword “feel”) or forgetter mechanisms (such as “forget”). An engram may then be contacted andreduced.If repeater technique still does not work and still does not get data, diagnose by hisbehavior in therapy and his statements what must be troubling him or occluding his recalls andagain use these guesses as repeater. For instance he may have no recollection of some memberof his family. Have him repeat the familiar name. Or have him repeat his own childhoodnickname until an incident is contacted.Should this still fail, then find some light locks, incidents which contain minimal pain,and run those. Such things as falls from a tricycle, getting sent from the table, getting spankedor scolded, being kept after school and so forth will serve. After he has reduced several locks,again try to find an engram.The running of locks will not bring about any great recovery, and there are thousandsand thousands of locks in any case, most of which will vanish without assistance from theauditor once the severe engrams are located. But locks may be used to indoctrinate the patientinto returning and therapy in general and may even bring about an improved condition in himby demonstrating to him that he can face his past.The foremost things to do in any case at the beginning are to (1) attempt to locate anderase basic-basic, and (2) discharge painful emotion. The sooner emotion can be released, thebetter, and there is always emotion on a case just as there are always a plenty of prenatalincidents.But when a case is stuck in present time either when it is opened or during progress, itis highly charged with occluded emotion and it is obeying a restimulated engram to the effectthat it must go all the way to now and stay there. The wording of this engram will generally beexpressed by the patient himself in complaining of his trouble. Repeater technique is used withthis clue. That failing, indoctrinate the patient by taking him back to what he can contact andwhen indoctrination is done, as above, start using repeater technique again.There is one motto which applies to all therapy, “If you keep asking for it, you’ll getit.” Any and all engrams surrender on the basis of returning the patient to the area time andagain, session after session. The engram bank may be balky but enough asking will bring forthany data in it sooner or later. Just keep asking, keep the routine of therapy running. Even a179"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"“stuck in present time” case will eventually begin to return on the sole principle of repeatertechnique.There are certain things that the auditor may be doing which are wrong. He may betrying to work the case on data taken from parents or relatives, which is usually fruitless inview of the fact that it undermines the preclear’s faith in his own data (all the data will checkwith the relatives; just don’t worry about checking it until the case is finished). Or he may betrying to work the case in the presence of other people. Or he may be violating the auditor’scode. A list of these deterrents to progress is to be found elsewhere in this volume.BASIC-BASICThe first goal of the auditor is basic-basic and after that always the earliest moment ofpain or discomfort which he can reach. He may have to go late for emotional charges and thesethemselves may be physically painful. Emotion may bar the patient from basic-basic. Butalways that first turn-off of the analyzer is important and when it is gained, subsequentengrams are much more easily reduced.Basic-basic is the vital target for two reasons: (1) It contains an analyzer shut-off whichitself is restimulated every time a new engram is received. The common denominator of allengrams is analyzer shut-off. Turn it on the first time it was shut off and a vast improvementtakes place in the case, for thereafter analyzer shut-off is not as deep. (2) An “erasure” (whichis to say an apparent removal of the engram from the files of the engram bank and refiling inthe standard bank as memory) of basic-basic widens the track beyond it markedly and bringsmany new engrams into view.Basic-basic is occasionally found weeks before mother’s first missed period, whichwould place it much earlier than any examination for pregnancy or an attempted abortion.Sometimes in a non-sonic case sonic is discoverable in basic-basic but far from always.Considerable material may be “erased” before basic-basic appears.Sometimes basic-basic gets “erased” without either the auditor or the pre-clear knowingthat it has been reached, basic-basic being merely another engram in the basic area. Sometimesmuch painful emotion must be discharged in the later life areas before basic-basic disclosesitself.Always, however, basic-basic is the target and until he has a good idea that he hasreached it, the auditor, once every session, makes an effort to get it. Thereafter he tries to getthe earliest moment of pain or discomfort he can reach every session. If he can reach nothingearly, he seeks to discharge a late emotional engram -- when it is completely discharged,“reduced” or “erased” as an engram -- then he goes down into the earliest material the file clerkwill give him.Whatever comes up, the auditor seeks to take all the charge out of it, whether thatcharge is pain or emotion, before he proceeds on his way to new material. This is done merelyby returning the patient back over the incident many times until it no longer affects him eitherpainfully or emotionally, or until it seems to vanish.THE REDUCTION AND THE ERASUREThese two terms are highly colloquial. Serious effort has been made to deter their useand substitute for them something sonorous and wonderfully Latin, but no progress has beenmade to date. Auditors insist on using colloquial terms such as “AA” for attempted abortion,“louse up” for engrams which seriously aberrate, “aberree” for a person not released orcleared, “zombie” for an electric shock or neuro-surgical case and so forth. It is feared that a180"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"tendency exists in them to be disrespectful to the hallowed and sacred tomes of yesteryear, tothe dignity of past Authorities which labeled much and did little. However this may be,“reduction” and “erasure” are in such common use that to change them is hardly necessary.To reduce means to take all the charge or pain out of an incident. This means to havethe pre-clear recount the incident from beginning to end (while returned to it in reverie) overand over again, picking up all the somatics and perceptions present just as though the incidentwere happening at that moment. To reduce means, technically, to render free of aberrativematerial as far as possible to make the case progress.To “erase” an engram means to recount it until it has vanished entirely. There is adistinct difference between a reduction and an “erasure.” The difference depends more uponwhat the engram is going to do than upon what the auditor wants it to do. If the engram isearly, if it has no material earlier which will suspend it, that engram will “erase.” The patient,trying to find it again for a second or sixth recounting, will suddenly find out he has no faintestidea what was in it. He may ask the auditor who, of course, will give him no informationwhatever. (The auditor who prompts is slowing down therapy by making himself the patient’smemory.) Going through it and trying to find it may cause the patient some amusement whenhe cannot. Or it may make him puzzled for here was something which had, on first contact, apainful somatic and a highly aberrative content which now no longer seems to exist. That is an“erasure.” Technically the engram is not erased. If the auditor cares to spend some time, solelyfor purposes of research, he will find that engram in the standard banks now, labeled “formerlyaberrative: rather amusing: information which may be useful analytically.” Such a search is notgermane to therapy. If the incident had a somatic, was recounted a few times and then, whenits last new material was found, vanished, it is erased so far as the engram bank is concerned.It will no longer be “soldered” into the motor circuits, will no longer be dramatized, it nolonger blocks a dynamic and is no longer an engram but a memory.The “reduction” has some interesting aspects. Let us take a childhood incident (age offour, let us say) which had to do with a scalding. This is contacted while much data remains inthe basic area. It has many things below it which will hold it in place. Nevertheless, it hasemotional charge and therapy is slowed by that charge. The file clerk hands out the scalding.Now it will not erase, but it will reduce. Here is a job which will take more time than anerasure. And there may be several aspects to that job.The somatic is contacted, the incident is begun as close to the beginning as the auditorcan get, and is then recounted. This scalding, let us say, has apathy as its emotional tone (Tone0.5). The pre-clear slogs through it apathetically, well exteriorized, watching himself bescalded. Then suddenly, perhaps, an emotional discharge may come off, but not necessarily.The pre-clear returns to the beginning and recounts (re-experiences) the whole thing oncemore. Then again and again. Soon he begins to get angry at the people involved in the incidentfor being so careless or so heartless. He has come up to anger (Tone 1.5). The auditor,although the patient would like to tell how vicious his parents are or how he thinks laws oughtto be passed about scalding children, patiently puts the pre-clear through the incident again.Now the pre-clear ceases to be angry and finds that he is bored with the material. He has risenup to boredom on the tone scale (Tone 2.5). He may protest to the auditor that this is a waste oftime. The auditor puts him back through the incident again. New data may show up. Thesomatic may or may not be still present at this period but the emotional tone is still low. Theauditor puts the pre-clear through the incident again and the pre-clear may, but not always,begin to be sarcastic or facetious. The incident is again recounted. Suddenly the pre-clear maybe amused about it (but not always) and the incident, when it obviously has reached a hightone, may be left. It will probably sag in a few days, but that is a matter of no great importancefor it will be erased wholly on the return from basic-basic. In any case it will never be asaberrative as it was before the reduction.A reduction will sometimes result in the whole engram’s apparently disappearing. But itis obvious when this will occur. Without much lifting in the tone scale, the incident, byrepetition, simply goes out of sight. This is reducing to recession. In a few days that incident181"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"will be back in force again, almost as strong as ever. There is material before it and emotionalcharge after it which make it unwieldy.Several things can happen, then, to an engram in the process of work. It can reduce,which is to say, discharge emotionally and somatically and be of no great aberrative powerthereafter. It can reduce to recession, which is to say it merely goes out of sight after severalrecountings. It can erase, which is to say, vanish and cease to be thereafter so far as the engrambank is concerned.A little experience will tell an auditor what engrams are going to do after he hascontacted them. Erasure takes place, ordinarily, only after basic-basic has been reached or, forthat matter, when the basic area is being worked. The reduction occurs with an emotionaldischarge. The reduction to recession happens when there is too much in the engram banksuppressing the incident.Every now and then even the best auditor will get hold of an engram and decide togrind it out now that it has been contacted. It is a sorry job. Perhaps it is better to grind it outthan to merely restimulate it and let the patient be irritated by it for a couple of days. Perhapsnot. But in any case that engram which reduces only to recession was better not contacted inthe first place.New auditors are forever charging at birth as an obvious target. Everybody has a birth:in most patients it can be located rather easily. But it is a painful incident and until the basic areahas been thoroughly worked and until late life painful emotion has been discharged and untilthe file clerk is ready to hand up birth, the incident is better left in place. It will usually reduceto recession and afterwards keep popping up to plague the auditor. The patient gets obscureheadaches, gets sniffles, feels uncomfortable afterwards unless birth is taken on the return(from the basic area). The auditor is wasting time, of course, by trying to remove theseheadaches and sniffles because birth, with the whole prenatal life before it, will not properlyreduce or erase but only recede. It is too often the case that birth, if prematurely contacted, willgive the patient a headache and a cold. These discomforts are minor and of no greatimportance, but the work the auditor may have invested in working an incident which will onlyreduce to recession is lost work.True, the file clerk occasionally hands out birth: if he does, there is an emotional chargeon it which will discharge and the incident will reduce properly. The auditor by all meansshould take it. True, a case sometimes stalls down and the auditor runs birth anyway just to seeif he can speed things up. But merely going back to birth to put one’s hands on an engrambecause he knows it is there will bring about discomfort and lost time. Go prenatal as far asyou can and see what the file clerk will hand forth. Try repeater technique in the basic area.You may get incidents which will erase. If there is nothing there, find out about apainful emotion engram in late life, the death of a friend, the loss of an ally, a failure of abusiness, something. Blow a charge from it and reduce it as an engram and then go backprenatally as early as possible and see what has turned up. If the file clerk thinks you needbirth, he’ll give it out. But do not ask for birth just to have an engram to work, because it mayprove to be a thoroughly uncomfortable and fruitless endeavor. Birth will come up when it willcome up and the file clerk knows his business.Charging into any late period of “unconsciousness” such as surgical anesthetic, wherephysical pain is present in large quantities, can bring about this needless restimulation. Youcan, of course, fare better with such things in reverie than in hypnosis or narco-synthesiswhere such a restimulation might bring about severe results. In reverie the effect is light.HANDLING THE SOMATIC STRIP182"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"There are two little men on each side of the brain, a set for each lobe, hanging by theirheels. The outer one is the “motor strip,” the inner one, the “sensory strip.” If you wish toknow more about the structure of these pairs dianetic research will have the answer in a fewmore years. Currently there is something known about them, a description. To an engineerwho knows dianetics the current description which will be found in the library is not entirelyreasonable. These are, possibly, switchboards of some sort. Readings can be taken in thevicinity of them -- just aft of the temples -- if you have a very sensitive galvanometer, agalvanometer more sensitive than any on the public market today. Those readings showemanations of a field of some sort. When we have established the precise type of energyflowing here, we can probably measure it with better precision. When we know exactly wherethe thinking is done in the body we will know more about these strips. All dianetic research hasestablished to date is that, beneath a welter of labels, nothing is actually known which is worthrecounting about these structures beyond the fact that they have something to do withcoordination of various parts of the body. We do, however, refer to them for lack of somethingbetter, in the course of therapy. Now that we know something about function, further researchcertainly cannot help but yield precision answers about structure.The auditor can turn somatics on and off in a patient like an engineer handles switches.More aptly, he can turn them on and off in the body like a conductor runs a street car along atrack. Here we have the game referred to previously when we talked about the time track.In a patient who is working well, the “somatic strip” can be commanded to go to anypart of the time track. Day by day, hour by hour, in normal life the somatic strip ranges up anddown this track as engrams are restimulated. The auditor, working a patient, may find his ownsomatic strip obeying his own commands and some of his own somatics turning on and off, afact which is at worst mildly uncomfortable. The whole body, the cells, whatever it is that ismoving we do not really know. But we can handle it and we can assume that it at least passesthrough the switchboard of the little men who hang by their heels.“The somatic strip will now go to birth,” says the auditor.The patient in reverie begins to feel the pressure of contractions thrusting him down thebirth canal.“The somatic strip will now go to the last time you injured yourself,” says the auditor.The pre-clear feels a mild reproduction of the pain of, perhaps, a bumped knee. If hehas sonic and visio recall, he will see where he is and suddenly realize that it was in the office:he will hear the clerks and typewriters and the car noises outside.“The somatic strip will now go into the prenatal area,” says the auditor.And the patient finds himself in the area, probably floating along, not uncomfortable.“The somatic strip will now go to the first moment of pain or discomfort which cannow be reached,” says the auditor.The patient drifts around a moment and suddenly feels a pain in his chest. He begins tocough and feels depression all over him. Mama is coughing (often source of chronic coughs).“Roll the cough,” says the auditor.The patient finds himself at the beginning of the engram and begins to run it. “Cough,cough, cough,” says the patient. He then yawns. “‘It hurts and I can’t stop,’” he quotes hismother. “Go to the beginning and roll it again,” says the auditor. “Cough, cough, cough,”begins the patient, but he is not coughing as badly now. He yawns more deeply. “‘Ouch. Ithurts, it hurts, and I can’t seem to stop,’” quotes the pre-clear, listening directly if he hassonic, getting impressions of what’s said if he does not have. He has picked up words nowthat were suppressed in it by “unconsciousness.” “Unconsciousness” is beginning to come off183"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"with the yawns. “Roll it again,” says the auditor. “‘I can’t stop,’” says the pre-clear, quotingall that he finds this time. The somatic is gone. He yawns again. The engram is erased.“The somatic strip will now go to the next moment of pain or discomfort,” says theauditor.The somatic does not turn on. The patient goes into a strange sleep. He mutters about adream. Suddenly the somatic gets stronger. The patient begins to shiver. “What occurs?” saysthe auditor. “I hear water running,” says the pre-clear. “Somatic strip will go to the beginningof the incident,” says the auditor. “Roll it.” “I keep on hearing water,” says the pre-clear. (Hemust be stuck, the somatics did not move. This is a holder.) “Somatic strip will go to whateverit is that is holding,” says the auditor. “‘I’ll hold it in there awhile and see if it does somegood,’” quotes the pre-clear. “Pick up the beginning of the incident now and roll it,” says theauditor. “I feel myself being jostled,” says the pre-clear. “Ouch, something bumped me.” “Pickup the beginning and roll it,” says the auditor. “‘I’m sure I must be pregnant,’” quotes the pre-clear. “‘I’ll hold it in there awhile and see if it does some good.’” “Is there anything earlier?”says the auditor. The pre-clear’s strip goes to the earlier moment where he feels pressure as shetries to get something into the cervix. Then he rolls the engram and it erases.This is handling of the somatic strip. It can be sent anywhere. It will pick up thesomatic first, usually, and then pick up the content. Using repeater technique, the somatic is“sucked down” to the incident and the somatics turn on. Then the incident is run. If it does notlift, find an earlier incident simply by telling the somatic strip to go to the earlier incident.If the somatic strip does not move, which is to say, if somatics (physical sensations) donot turn on and off, then the patient is stuck somewhere on the track. He can be stuck inpresent time, which would mean he has a bouncer thrusting him all the way up the track. Userepeater technique or merely try to send the somatic strip back. If it won’t go, get variousbouncer phrases like “Can’t go back,” “Run a mile,” etc. and with them suck the somatic stripdown to the incident and run it.The somatic strip may move through an incident with full sensation and yet, returningover the same ground several times will not bring out data. Time after time this can be donewithout result in some engrams: the somatics remain almost the same, undulating through theincident each time but with no other content. Then the auditor is “bucking” a denyer, a phrasesuch as “This is a secret,” “Don’t let him know,” “Forget it,” etc. In such a case he sends thesomatic strip to the phrase which denies the data: “Go to the moment a phrase is uttereddenying this data,” says the auditor. After a moment, “‘If he found out about this, it would killhim,’” quotes the pre-clear, either from sonic or from impressions. Then the auditor sends thesomatic strip back to the start of the incident and it goes on through it, this time with otherperceptic content. The somatics, unless the incident is very late prenatal with basic area full ofmaterial, undulate (fluctuate according to the action of the engram) and diminish to eitherreduction or erasure on consecutive recountings.The auditor tells the somatic strip to go earlier, sometimes it goes later. This is amisdirector. “Can’t tell which way I am going,” “Going backwards,” “Do just the opposite,”these are the type of phrases of the misdirector. The auditor recognizes that he has one in thepre-clear, guesses it or discovers it from the pre-clear’s wording of the complaint about theaction, and by repeater or direct command of the strip, picks up the phrase and the engram,reduces or erases it and continues.If the somatic strip does not respond according to command, then a bouncer, a holder,a misdirector, or a grouper has been restimulated and should be discharged. The somatic stripwill be where the command is which forbids it to function as desired.There are good and bad conductors of this somatic strip. The good conductor worksclosely with the file clerk, using such broad orders as “The somatic strip will pick up theearliest moment of pain or discomfort which can be reached,” or “The somatic strip will go to184"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"the highest intensity of the somatic you now have” (when a somatic is bothering the patient).The bad conductor picks out specific incidents which he thinks might be aberrative, bullies thesomatic strip into them and somehow beats them down. There are moments when it isnecessary to be quite persuasive with the strip and moments when it is necessary to pick outincidents of physical pain, but the auditor is the best judge of what should take place. As longas the strip will work smoothly, finding new incidents and running over them, he should nottamper with it beyond making sure that he reduces everything the strip contacts.A very fine way to thoroughly wreck a case is to put the somatic strip into an incident,decide something else is more important and go rushing off to it, get that half lifted and go offto something else. By the time three or four incidents have been so touched but not reduced,the strip stalls down, the track starts to bunch up and the auditor has a snarl which may takehim many hours of therapy or a week or two of rebalancing (letting the case settle) to bringback to a workable state.The patient will sometimes want a somatic turned off. It has been bothering him. Thatmeans that the strip is somehow hung up in some incident which therapy or the patient’senvironment has restimulated. Ordinarily it is not worth the time and trouble to locate theincident. It will settle out of its own accord in a day or two and it may be an incident whichcannot be reduced because of the earlier engrams.The somatic strip is handled in a late incident just as it is sent to an earlier one. Despaircharges are contacted in the same way.If you want a test to see if the strip is moving, or to test recall, send it back a few hoursand find out what you get. While the prenatal area is easier to reach than yesterday in manycases, some idea will be gained of how the patient is working.PRESENT TIMEThe beginning is conception. Your patients sometimes have a feeling that they aresperms or ovums at the beginning of the track: in dianetics this is called the sperm dream. It isnot of any great value so far as we know at this time. But it is very interesting. It does not haveto be suggested to the pre-clear. All one has to do is send him to the beginning of the track andhear what he has to say. Sometimes he has an early engram mixed up with conception.At the late end of the track is, of course, now. This is present time. It happens now andthen that patients are not getting back to present time because they have struck holders en route.Repeater technique with holders will generally free the strip and get it to present time.A patient may get a trifle groggy with all the things which have been happening to himin the course of a therapy session. And he may have reduced resistance to engrams as he comesback up the track and may thus trip a holder. The auditor should be very sure the patient is upin present time. Occasionally the patient will be so thoroughly stuck and the hour so advancedthat the effort to bring him all the way up is not feasible at the time. A period of sleep willgenerally accomplish it.There is a test whereby the auditor can tell if the pre-clear is up to present time. Hesnaps a question at the pre-clear, “How old are you?” The pre-clear gives him a “flashanswer.” If it is the pre-clear’s right age, the pre-clear is in present time. If it is an earlier age,there is a holder there, and the patient is not in present time. There are other methods ofdetermining this but it is not very important, by and large, if the patient does fail to make it.Snapping questions at people, asking how old they are, elicits some surprisinganswers. Being stuck on the track is so common in “normal” people that a day or two or aweek or two of failure to reach present time in a pre-clear is far from alarming.185"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Anyone who has a chronic psycho-somatic illness is definitely stuck somewhere on thetime track. Snap questions about it get, “Three,” or “Ten years,” or some such answer quiteordinarily even when asked of people who suppose they are in good health. Reverie reveals tothem where they are on the track. Sometimes, in the first session, a pre-clear shuts his eyes inreverie to find himself in a dentist’s chair at the age of three. He has been there for the lastthirty years or so because the dentist and his mother both told him to “stay there” while he wasshocky with pain and gas -- so he did, and the chronic tooth trouble he had all his life is thatsomatic.This doesn’t happen very often, but you can find someone you know, it is certain, whowould flash answer “Ten years” and, being put in reverie, would find himself, as soon as theengram came to view, lying flat on his back in a ball park or some such situation, withsomebody telling him not to move until the ambulance came: that’s his arthritis!Try it on somebody.THE FLASH ANSWERA device in common use in therapy is the flash answer. This is done in two ways. Thefirst mentioned here is the least used. “When I count to five,” says the auditor, “a phrase willflash into your mind to describe where you are on the track. One, two, three, four, five!” “Lateprenatal,” says the pre-clear, or “yesterday” or whatever occurs to him.The flash answer is the first thing which comes into a person’s head when a question isasked him. It will come from the engram bank, usually, and will be useful. It may be “demontalk” but it is generally right. The auditor merely asks a question, such as what is holding thepatient, what denies him knowledge, etc., prefacing the question with the remark, “I want aflash answer to this.”“I want a flash answer to this,” says the auditor. “What would happen if you becamesane?” “Die,” says the patient. “What would happen if you die,” says the auditor. “I’d getwell,” says the patient. And with this data they then make an estimate of the currentcomputation on allies or some such thing. In this case, the ally said to the pre-clear when hewas ill, “I’d die, just die if you didn’t get well. If you’re sick much longer I’ll go insane.” Anda former engram said the pre-clear had to be sick. And this is, after all, just an engram. Sorepeater technique is used on the word “die” and an ally is uncovered that the pre-clear neverknew existed and a charge is blown.Much valuable data can be recovered by clever use of the flash answer. If there is noanswer at all, it means that the answer is occluded and that is almost as good a reply as actualdata since it means some kind of a cover-up.DREAMSDreams have been used considerably by various schools of mental healing. Their“symbology” is a mystic foible forwarded to explain something which the mystics did notknow anything about. Dreams are crazy house mirrors by which the analyzer looks down intothe engram bank.Dreams are puns on words and situations in the engram bank.Dreams are not much help, being puns.Dreams are not much used in dianetics.186"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"You will hear dreams from patients. Patients are hard to shut off when they start tellingdreams. If you want to waste your time, you will listen.VALENCE SHIFTA mechanism used in dianetics is the valence shift.We know the way a patient gets into valences when he dramatizes his engrams in life.He becomes a winning valence and he says and does rather much what the person in thewinning valence did in that engram.The theory behind it is this: returned to a time the patient may consider too painful toenter, he can be shifted into a valence which felt no pain. A dull way to persuade him is to tellhim he does not have to feel the pain or the emotion and let him go through it. This is very baddianetics because it is a positive suggestion and every safeguard must be taken to keep fromgiving suggestions to the patient, for he may be very suggestible even when he pretends not tobe. But there is the valence shift and this permits the patient to escape the pain and still remainin the engram until he can recount it.Example, father beating mother, unborn child knocked “unconscious.” The data isavailable in the father valence with no pain, in the mother valence with her pain, in the child’svalence with his pain.The way to handle this, if the patient positively refuses to enter it although he hassomatics, is to shift him in valence. The auditor says, “Go into your father’s valence and beyour father for the moment.” After some persuasion the patient does so. “Bawl your motherout,” says the auditor. “Give her a fine talking to.” The patient is now on that circuit whichcontains no “unconsciousness” and approximates the emotion and the words his father used tohis mother. The auditor lets him do this a couple or three times until the charge is somewhat offthe engram. Then he turns the patient’s valence into the mother: “Be your mother for themoment now and talk back to your father,” says the auditor. The patient shifts valence and ishis mother and repeats his mother’s phrases. “Now be yourself,” says the auditor, “andrecount the entire incident with all somatics and emotion please.” The patient is able to re-experience the incident as himself.This works very well when one is trying to get at an ally. “Shift valence,” says theauditor to the returned patient, “and plead with your mother not to kill the baby.” “Now be anurse,” says the auditor, with the pre-clear returned to some incident he seems very fearfulabout entering, “and plead with a little boy to get well.” The patient will correct the auditor’sconcept of the script and usually will proceed.The patient will often refuse to go into a valence because he hates it. This means theremust be considerable charge in the person he refuses to be.This mechanism is rarely used but is handy when a case is stalling. The father did notobey the holders or commands, he uttered them. The nurse would not obey her owncommands. And so forth. Thus many holders and denyers can be flushed to view. It is usefulin the beginning of a case.Valence shift is seldom used except where an engram is suspected which will nototherwise be approached by the patient. He will often approach the engram with valence shiftwhen he will not approach it as himself. Valence shift is somewhat undesirable when employedon a suggestible subject since it violates the dianetic rule that no positive suggestion be usedbeyond those absolutely necessary in returning and recounting and uncovering data. Thereforevalence shift is seldom employed and rarely on a suggestible person.187"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"TYPE OF CHAINSEngrams, particularly in the prenatal area, are in chains. That is to say there is a seriesof incidents of similar types. This is useful classification because it leads to some solutions.The chains one can most easily contact in a pre-clear are the least charged.

The first actually happened, so did thesecond. But the patient should not have his mother’s somatics. If he does, if he is foundcomplaining of headaches whenever his mother has a headache, there is an engram, very early,which says he must have whatever she has: “The baby is part of me,” “I want him to suffer as Isuffer,” etc. Or the phrase may be some entirely misunderstood thing literally taken. However,all this “comes out in the wash” and should be no great concern of the auditor’s.“UNCONSCIOUSNESS”While “unconsciousness” has been covered elsewhere in various ways, in therapy ithas two special manifestations. The yawn and the “boil-off.”The engram of physical pain contains deep “unconsciousness” and if it is going to lift,particularly in the basic area, it comes off in yawns. After a first or second recounting, thepatient starts to yawn. These yawns are turning on his analyzer.In a very extreme engram -- a prenatal electric shock which mother received -- fivehours of “unconsciousness” “boil-off” have taken place during therapy. The shock lasted forless than a minute but so close did it bring the individual to death that when the incident wasfirst contacted in therapy, he swam and floundered and had strange dreams, muttered andmumbled for five hours. That is a record. Forty-five minutes of this “boil-off” is rare. Five orten minutes of it are not uncommon.The auditor will take a patient into an area. No somatic turns on. But the patient beginsto drowse into a strange kind of sleep. He rouses from this from time to time, mutterssomething, usually idiotic, rouses again with a dream and generally makes no progress to allappearances. But progress is being made. A period when he was almost dead is coming up tothe surface. Soon a somatic will turn on and the patient will run an engram a few times oncommand, will yawn a little and then brighten up. Such a quantity of “unconsciousness” was,of course, sufficient to keep his analyzer about nine-tenths shut off when he was awake for, if190"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"it was near basic, it was part of every other engram. Such an engram, with such deep“unconsciousness,” when released, produces a marked improvement in a case, as much as apainful emotion engram at times.It is up to the auditor to sit it through no matter how long it takes. It may make anuncleared auditor very sleepy to watch all this but it should be done. He will rarely strike onethat lasts an hour but every case has such a period lasting from ten minutes to a half hour.He should stir the patient up once in a while and try to make him go through theengram. There is a very special way to stir a patient into life: don’t touch his body for it may behighly restimulative and make him very upset. Touch only the bottoms of his feet with yourhand or your own feet and touch them just enough to jog him into attention for a moment. Thatkeeps the “boil-off” in progress and does not permit the patient to sag into ordinary sleep.The “boil-off” can be confused, by an inexperienced auditor, with an engram commandto sleep. However, if the auditor will observe the patient closely, he will find that in the “boil-off” the patient gives every appearance of being drugged while in a sleep command, he simplygoes to sleep and does it very smoothly. The “boil-off” is a trifle restless, full of mutteringsand flounderings and dreams. The sleep is smooth.An engramic command to go to sleep, acting on the returned pre-clear, is broken bysending the somatic strip to the moment when the sleep command is given. If the pre-clearcontacts it and goes over it, he will quickly awaken on the track and continue with therapy.The “boil-off” may be full of yawns, mutterings or grunts. Sleep is usually quiet andgentle.Just why this is called a “boil-off” and just why auditors are fond of the term isobscure. It was originally and sedately named “comatic reduction” but such erudition has beenoutvoted by the fact that it has never been used.If you are fond of listening to dreams, you will find them in plenty in the “boil-off.” Asimages on the desert are distorted by the glass snakes of heat waves, so are the engramiccommands distorted to the analyzer through the veil of “unconsciousness.”LOCKSIt is one of the blessings of nature that the lock is something which needs minorattention. A lock is an incident which, with or without charge, is in conscious recall and whichseems to be the reason the aberree is aberrated. Perhaps this was another way the bankprotected itself. A lock is a moment of mental discomfort containing no physical pain and nogreat loss. A scolding, a social disgrace: such things are locks. Any case has thousands andthousands of locks. The auditor will discover them in plenty if he cares to waste time lookingfor them. The treatment of these locks was the main goal of an old art known as “hypno-analysis.” Most of them can be reduced.The key-in of an engram takes place at some future date from the time the engram wasactually received. The key-in moment contains analytical reduction from weariness or slightillness. A situation similar to the engram, which contained “unconsciousness,” came about andkeyed-in the engram. This is a primary lock. Breaking it, if it can be found, produces the effectof keying out the engram. But it can be considered a waste of time even if it has sometherapeutic value and was used, without understanding, by some past schools.If an auditor wants to know how the case was reacting to life, he can find some of thesethousands and thousands of locks and look them over. But that is probably all the interest hehas in them, for locks discharge. They discharge automatically the moment the engram holdingthem is erased. A whole life rebalances itself when the engrams are gone and the locks need no191"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"treatment. Neither does the pre-clear now cleared need education as to how to think: like theblowing of locks, this is an automatic process.These locks lie down amongst the engrams sometimes. The pre-clear may be deep inthe prenatal area and suddenly think about a time when he was twenty or, as is common intherapy, think about an engram he heard from somebody else. This is a good clue. Pay nofurther heed to the lock: find the engram to which it attached itself, for there is an engramimmediately with it. In dreams these locks in distorted form, come swimming up out of thebank, complicating the dream.THE JUNIOR CASEDo not take on a Junior for your first case if you can avoid it. If father was namedGeorge and the patient is called George, beware of trouble. The engram bank takes George tomean George and that is identity thought de luxe.Mother says, “I hate George!” “That means Junior,” says the engram though mothermeant father. “George is thoughtless.” “George must not know.” “Oh, George, I wish you hadsome sex appeal, but you haven’t.” And so go the engrams. A Junior case is seldom easy.It is customary to shudder, in dianetics, at the thought of taking on a Junior case. Anauditor can be expected to slave his hardest when he has a case with non-sonic, which is offthe time track, and which is named after father or mother. Such cases resolve, of course, but ifparents knew what they did to children by giving them any name which might appear in theengram bank, such as that of parents or grandparents or friends, it is certain the custom wouldvanish instanter.RESTIMULATING THE ENGRAM“Ask often enough and you will receive,” is always true when working the engrambank. Simply by returning into an area enough times engrams will appear. If it is not theretoday, it will be there tomorrow. But if it is not there tomorrow, it will be there the day afterand so forth. Emotional discharges are most certainly located by asking for them time aftertime, returning the patient over the part of the track where the charge is expected to lie. Whatrepeater technique will fail to do can be done by returning the patient, session after session, to aportion of his life. Sooner or later it will come into view.OCCLUDED LIFE PERIODS AND PEOPLEWhole areas of the time track will be found occluded. These contain suppressors byway of engram command, ally computations and painful emotion. Persons can vanish utterlyfrom sight for these reasons. They come to view after a few engrams have been lifted in basicor the area has been developed as above.ANIMOSITY TOWARD PARENTSIt always happens, when one clears a child or adult, that the pre-clear goes throughstages of improvement which bring him up the tone scale and cause him, of course, to passthrough the second zone, anger. A pre-clear may become furious with his parents and otheroffenders in the engram bank. Such a situation is to be expected. It is a natural by-product oftherapy and it cannot be avoided.As the case progresses the tone scale, of course, rises and places the pre-clear in a stateof boredom toward the villains who have wronged him. At last he reaches Tone 4, which is the192"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"tone of the clear. At this time he is very cheerful and willing to be friends with people whetherthey have wronged him or not: of course he has the data about what to expect of them, but henurses no animosity.If a parent feels that the child, knowing all, would turn against him, then the parent ismistaken. The child has already, as an aberree, turned very thoroughly against the parentwhether his analyzer knows all or not and the most uncertain and unlovely conduct may resultfrom further hiding of the evidence.It is a matter of continual observation that the good release and the clear feel noanimosity whatever toward their parents or others who had caused their aberrations and indeedstop negating, defending and fighting so irrationally. The clear will fight, certainly, for a goodcause and he will be the most dangerous opponent possible, but he does not fight for irrationalreasons like an animal and his understanding of people is very much enlarged and his affectioncan at last be deep. If a parent wishes love and cooperation from a child, no matter what he hasdone to that child, permit therapy and achieve that love and cooperation with the child self-determined and no longer secretly in apathy or rage. After all, the clear has learned the sourceof his parents’ aberrations as well as his own; he recognizes that they had engram banks beforehe did.PROPITIATIONIn the process of work a stage will be passed, in the upper range of apathy, ofpropitiation. This conciliation is an effort to feed or sacrifice to an all destructive force. It is astate wherein the patient, in deep fear of another, offers expensive presents and soft words,turns the other cheek, offers himself as a doormat and generally makes a fool out of himself.Many, many marriages, for instance, are marriages not of love but of that shabbysubstitute, propitiation. People have a habit of marrying people who have similar reactiveminds. This is unfortunate for such marriages are destructive to both partners. She has a certainset of aberrations: they match his. She is pseudo-mother, he is pseudo-father. She had tomarry him because father tried to murder her before she was born. He had to marry herbecause mother beat him when he was a child. Incredible as it may seem, these marriages arevery common: one or the other partner becomes mentally ill, or both may deteriorate. He isunhappy, his enthusiasms crushed; she is miserable. Either with another partner might be ahappy person yet, out of fear, they cannot break apart. They must propitiate each other.The auditor who finds a marriage in this condition and attempts to treat one of thepartners, had better treat both simultaneously. Or such partners had better treat each other andsoon. Tolerance and understanding are almost always fostered by mutual help.Propitiation is mentioned here because it has a diagnostic value. People who startbringing the auditor expensive gifts are propitiating him, and it probably means that they have acomputation which tells them, engramically, that they will die or go crazy if they become sane.The auditor may enjoy the gifts, but he had better start looking for a sympathy engram not yetsuspected or tapped.LOVEProbably no single subject in the concerns of Man has received as much attention asLove.It is not untrue that where one finds the greatest controversy, there he will also find theleast comprehension. And where the facts are least precise there one can also find the greatestarguments. And so it is with Love.193"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Without doubt Love has ruined more lives than war and made more happiness than allthe dreams of Paradise.Entangled with a thousand songs a year and submerged beneath a solid tonnage of poorliterature, Love should have a proper chance to be defined.It has been discovered that there are three kinds of Love between woman and man: thefirst is covered under the law of affinity and is the affection with which Mankind holdsMankind; the second is sexual selection and is a true magnetism between partners; the third iscompulsive “Love” dictated by nothing more reasonable than aberration.Perhaps in the hero and heroine legends there have been cases of the second kind, andsurely as one looks about him in this society he can discover numbers of happy partnershipsbased on a natural and strongly affectionate admiration. The third kind we find in plenty:tabloid literature is devoted to it and its travails; it crams the courts with urgent pleas fordivorce, with criminal acts and civil suits; it sends children weeping into the corner away fromquarrels and it launches from its broken homes broken young women and men.Dianetics classifies this third kind of love as “reactive mind partnership.” Here is ameeting of minds -- but the minds are on the lowest computational level possessed by man.Driven together by compulsion, men and women mate who will find in that mating nothing butsorrow and reduction of their hopes.He is pseudo-brother who beat her regularly or he is pseudo-father whom she had tomind. Maybe he is even pseudo-mother who screamed ceaselessly at her but whom she had toplacate, and he might be the doctor who hurt her so savagely. She may be his pseudo-mother,his pseudo-grandmother whom he had to love despite the way she undermined his decision;she may be a pseudo-nurse in some operation long gone or the pseudo-teacher who kept himafter school to whet her sadism upon him.Before the marriage takes place they only know there is a compulsion that they must betogether, a feeling that each must be extremely nice to the other. And then the marriage takesplace and more and more restimulation of ancient pain is felt until at last each is ill and life,complicated now perhaps by unhappy children, is an unhappy ruin.The mechanism of propitiation carries with it covert hostility. Gifts given without causeand beyond the ability to expend, self-sacrifices which seem so noble at the time composepropitiation. Propitiation is an apathy effort to hold away a dangerous “source” of pain.Mistaken identity is one of the minor errors of the reactive mind. To buy off, to nullify thepossible anger of a person perhaps long since dead but living now again in the partner, is thehope of propitiation. But a man is dead who will not sometimes fight. The hostility may bemasked, it may be entirely “unknown” to the individual who indulges it. Certainly it is alwaysjustified in the mind of the person who exerts it and is supposed to be a natural consequence ofsome entirely obvious offense.The wife who makes inadvertent blunders before the guests and by them accidentlygives away the truth of her husband’s favorite myth, the wife who forgets the little favors hehas asked, the wife who suddenly stabs him with a “logical” pin in the region of his hopes:these are wives who live with partners whom they must, out of some wrong done years beforethe courtship and by some other man, propitiate, and these are wives who, propitiating, numbthe hopes and misunderstand the sorrows of their mates.The husband who sleeps with another woman and “accidentally” leaves the lipstick onhis tie, the husband who finds her excellent cooking bad and idleness in her days, the husbandwho forgets her letters he must mail, the husband who finds her opinions silly, these arehusbands who live with partners whom they must propitiate.194"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"A soaring, roller-coaster curve of peace and war in the home, failures to understand,mutual curtailment of liberty and self-determinism, unhappy lives, unhappy children anddivorce are caused by reactive mind marriages. Compelled by an unknown threat to marry,repelled by fear of pain from trust, this “meeting of minds” is the primary cause of all maritaldisaster.The law lacked definition and so invoked great difficulty in the path of those involvedin such marriages. The track of it is the dwindling spiral of misery which accompanies allchronic restimulation and leads only down to failure and to death. Someday there will,perhaps, exist a much more sentient law that only the unaberrated can marry and bear children.The present law only provides that marriages must be at best most difficult to part. Such a lawis like a prison sentence for the husband, the wife and the children -- all and every one.A marriage can be saved by clearing its partners of their aberrations. An optimumsolution would include this in any case since it is most difficult for a wife or a husband to rise,even when divorced, to any future plane of happiness: and where there are children, if clearingis not effected, a great injustice has been done.It is usually discovered that when both partners in a reactive mind marriage are clearedof aberration, life becomes considerably more than tolerable; for human beings often have anatural liking even when no sexual selection has been present. The restoration of a marriage byclearing the partners may not bring about one of the great loves that poets strummed about butit will at least bring a high level of respect and cooperation toward the common goal of makinglife worthwhile. And in many marriages so cleared it was discovered that the partners, beneaththe dirty cloth of aberration, loved each other well.A major gain to such a clearing is for the children’s sake. Nearly all marital discontenthas as its major factor aberration on the second dynamic, sex. And any such aberrationincludes a nervous disposition toward children.Where there are children, divorce does not answer, clearing does. And with clearingcomes a fresh new page of life on which happiness can be written.In the case of the reactive mind marriage, turn-about clearing is often complicated bythe concealed hostilities which lie below the propitiative mechanism. It is wise for the partnersto look outside the home, each interesting a friend in a therapy turn-about. If such mutualclearing is begun, with the partners working on each other, much restraint of anger andexertion of patience must be practiced, and the auditor’s code must be most severely followed.It requires a saintly detachment to bear the Tone One of the partner who, returned to a quarrel,seasons the recountings with further recrimination. If it must be done, it can be done but, whenmany quarrels and travails have beset a couple, it is easier if they each look without the homefor a therapy partner.Additionally, there is a kind of “rapport” established between any auditor and pre-clearand after the therapy session is done, a strengthening of the natural affinity is such that a smalldeed or word may be taken as a savage attack with the result of a quarrel and the inhibition oftherapy.Men can be considered to be best audited by men and women by women. Thiscondition is changed when one deals with a woman who has such severe aberrations aboutwomen that she is in fear around them or when one is auditing a man who has deep fear ofmen.The dynamics of men and women are somehow different and a wife, particularly ifthere have ever been quarrels of any magnitude, sometimes finds it difficult at times to besufficiently insistent to audit her husband. The husband may audit, in the usual case, withoutgreat difficulty but when in therapy himself, his feeling that he must rise superior to thesituation forces him to attempt auto-control, a thing which is impossible.195"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"THE ERASURESooner or later -- if you keep trying -- you will get basic-basic, the earliest moment of“unconsciousness” and physical pain. You will know when you have it, perhaps, only becausethings start to erase rather than reduce. If the patient still has a sonic shut-off, you can stillerase: sooner or later that sonic will turn on, perhaps not even until the case is almost finished.You will reach basic-basic sooner or later.The erasure, then, is more or less the same procedure as the entrance. You erase all theearly engrams, always the earliest you can find, and you keep discharging painful emotionengrams either in the basic area or in the later periods after birth and later in life. You erase asmuch as you can find in the early part of the case, then you release all the emotion you can findlater in the case (erase everything in each engram you touch) and then you come back and findearly material.The reactive engram bank is a hurrah’s nest. The file clerk must have a great deal oftrouble with it. For things are keyed-in early and late, sometimes all he can get is material undercertain topics, sometimes all he can get is material under certain somatics (all teeth, forinstance), sometimes he can go in an orderly parade forward in time and give consecutiveincidents: this last is the most important proceeding.Not until you have worked out every moment of physical pain and discharged all themoments of painful emotion will the case be cleared. There will be times when you are surethat you are almost to the goal only to discover, going into the prenatal area again, a new seriesof material uncovered by the later life painful emotion you have released.One day you will find a case which will not have any occlusions anywhere on the track,which will no longer be interested in engrams (apathy cases aren’t interested at the start; clears,at the top level, are not interested either, making a cycle, though the clear is a long way fromapathetic), which will have all recalls, which will compute accurately and make no errors(within the limitations of the data available) and which, in short, has an exhausted engrambank. But do not be too optimistic, ever. Keep looking until you are sure. Observe the case tomake certain no aberrations are displayed about anything, that dynamics are high in it and thatlife is good. If this person now feels he can solve all the problems of life, lick the world withone hand tied behind him and feel a friend to all men, you have a clear.The only way you can go wrong is to compute with the idea that human beings are fullof error and evil and sin and that if you have made a person less unhappy and above normal heis to bejudged a clear. This is a release.In gold panning, it is true that every tenderfoot mistakes iron pyrites -- fool’s gold --for gold. The tenderfoot will crow with delight over a bright bit of something in his pan which,actually, is worth a few dollars a ton. And then he sees real gold! The moment he sees real goldin that pan, he knows what gold really looks like. It cannot be mistaken.Aside from the fact that psychometry would show a clear phenomenally intelligent,would show his aptitude and versatility wide, there is another quality, the human quality of afreed man. You take a release through psychometry and show him to be above normal, too.But a clear is a clear and when you see it you will know it with no further mistake.That a clear is no longer interested in his extinct engrams does not mean he is notinterested in the troubles of others. That a person is not interested in his own engrams does notnecessarily argue a clear but may well be another mechanism, the apathy of neglect. To haveengrams and neglect them is a common aberration with the reactive mind on a tone scale ofapathy. To have no engrams and neglect them is another thing. Every apathy case, neglectinghis engrams as an answer to his woe, insisting he is happy, insisting, as he racks himself topieces, that there is nothing wrong with him, will, in work, particularly after basic-basic islifted, become interested in his engrams and more interested in life. It is easy to tell the apathy196"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"case from the clear for the two are at opposite ends of the spectrum of life: the clear has soaredup toward victory and triumph, the apathy case knows victory and triumph are not for him andexplains they are not worth it.What the life span of a clear is cannot be answered now; ask in a hundred years.How can you tell a clear? How close does the man measure to optimum for Man? Canhe adjust to his environment smoothly? And far more important, can he adjust that environmentto him?Sixty days and again six months after a clear has apparently been effected, the auditorshould again make a search for any neglected material. He should question the possible clearcarefully as to the events of the past interval. In such a way he can learn of any worries,concerns or illnesses which may have taken place and attempt to trace these to engrams. If hecannot then find engrams, the clear is definitely and without question, cleared. And he will staythat way.If a case merely stalls, however, and while aberration seems to be present, engramscannot be found, the cause probably lies with thoroughly masked despair charges -- painfulemotional engrams. These are not necessarily postnatal, they can be within the prenatal periodand involve circumstances which are very secret -- or so the engrams announce. Also, somecases have stalled and proven “impenetrable” because of a current or immediately pastcircumstance the patient has not revealed.There are two reasons which can delay a case:(a) the person may be so aberratedly ashamed of his past or so certain of retribution if hereveals it that he does nothing but avoid;and(b) the person may be in fear because of some existing circumstance or threat.The auditor is not interested in what the patient does. Or in what the patient has done.Dianetics treats of what has been done to the person exclusively in therapy. What has beendone by a patient is of no concern. The auditor who would make it any concern is practicingsomething other than dianetics. However, a patient, because of his engrams, may becomeobsessed with the idea that he must hide something in his life from the auditor. general classesabove cover the general conditions.These active reasons, as under (a), may be such a thing as a prison sentence, a murderhitherto unknown (although many people think they have done murder who have not eventhreatened it to anyone), abnormal sexual practices, or some such circumstance. The auditorshould promise not to reveal any confidential matter, purely as a matter of routine and explainthe principle of “done to. not done by.” And no auditor would taunt or revile a patient forhaving been victimized by his engrams. As under (b) there may exist some person, even thewife or husband, who has cowed the patient into secrecy. One case is at hand where noadvance was made although there were many incidents contacted: the incidents would notreduce or erase no matter where they were. It was discovered that this case, a woman, hadbeen beaten savagely and often by her husband and that she had been threatened with death ifshe told the auditor a word of these acts; and yet these acts contained the whole despair chargesof the case and had to be released. Seeing this, finally suspecting, the auditor was able to gainher confidence and locate the despair charges. Even if he had not gained her confidence, byconstant restimulation of late life areas he would have provoked her tears. In another case, thatof a small child, “dub-in” recall was so obvious and lie factories were so busy that the auditorat last realized that he was attempting to penetrate not just the secrecy on an engram but thesecrecy imposed upon a child by some one at hand. The mother, in this case, out of the ideathat she would be apprehended, had furiously threatened the child to say nothing about his197"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"treatment at home. There was more than this behind the case, there were eighty-one attemptedabortions, an incredible number.Anything is the business of an auditor if it has become an engram. If society has jailed aman, if all is not well in the home, these are things done to a person. What the person did to“deserve” this treatment is of no concern.THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE CASENow and again an auditor will encounter a strange sort of hold-up in a case. He will beunable to get anything to clear or make sense in the prenatal area and sometimes in childhood aswell as the prenatal area. He may be encountering a “foreign language case.” Occasionally thechild did not know he was born to other parents (who may have spoken a foreign tongue) thanthose he has known as his parents. This is a special sort of mix-up of its own which is rathereasily resolved simply by running engrams. It is always possible for the patient to forget thathis parents spoke some other tongue in the home. Another tongue than the one the patient isusing or other than that of the country in which the patient resides is, in one way, an asset: itgives a prenatal area which is very difficult to restimulate although it may still be acting uponthe patient’s mind. But it is no asset to the auditor, who must now deal with a patient who doesnot know the language, who may not have sonic recall and yet has an engram bank full of datawhich once had meaning and really is his basic language.The best remedy for such a case is to get an auditor who knows both the language usedin the prenatal area and the present tongue. Another remedy is to take a dictionary to the caseand figure out the bouncers et al. from the dictionary. Another way is to regress the patientoften enough into the infant period that he begins to pick up the language again (making the filedrawer of it come forth) and then ask the patient for phrases which, in the foreign tongue,would mean this or that. Gradually he may recover the language and so exhaust the bank. Thisis an extremely difficult case only when there was no childhood use of the other tongue. Givenchildhood use of that tongue, the auditor simply keeps returning the patient to childhood whenhe knew the tongue and then returning him into the prenatal area: the patient can translate whatis happening. The cliches of other tongues than that the auditor speaks are often quiteproductive of other literal meanings than comparable cliches in the auditor’s tongue. Thisdifference of cliche is a very responsible agent in the social aberrations of one nation as theydiffer from those of another. “I have hot,” says the Spaniard. “I am hot,” says the Englishman.Engramically, they mean different things, even if they mean the same to the analyzer.198"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"CHAPTER IXPART TWOMechanisms and Aspects of TherapyEXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTIONEvery time the auditor has a case with dub-in recall or which is highly charged withemotion, the case may return into the prenatal area and start describing scenery. This is the aweand wonder of some beholders. There is the patient in the womb and yet he can “see” outside.The patient tells about father and mother and where they are sitting and what the bedroom lookslike, and yet there he is in the womb. Some pretty theories can be advanced for this: one ofthem is that the tortured foetus develops extra-sensory perception in order to see what iscoming next. ESP is an excellent theory and some observation may confirm it but not in thefoetus.One must recall that the foetus, even if it has highly developed and clever cells, is yetnot a truly rational organism. The presence of the engram does not necessarily mean that thefoetus could think. The engram became most severely aberrative when the child finally learnedspeech. The engram is not a memory but a recording of pain and percepts.Returning a grown man or a child into the prenatal area returns there an experiencedmind which, connecting with these engrams, forms conclusions. To listen to some pre-clearsone would think they read Keats and drank lemonade every afternoon at four throughout theprenatal period.To return reason and analytical power back into a period when neither reason noranalytical power existed, of course, impinges upon the returned individual many ideas. All heis supposed to run are the engrams and their contents. He may additionally, by dreammechanisms and current computation, try to fashion in a whole technicolor picture of thescenery.This prenatal ESP does not in fact exist. It has been proven, after considerable test, thatwhenever the returned pre-clear thinks he sees something, the scenery itself is mentioned in theengrams and gives him an imaginary picture of it. There is no prenatal ESP, in other words.There are only descriptions and actions which suggest scenery and these suggestions,operating now upon the imagination, bring about the supposed visio.This is most chronic with patients who have high powered lie factories. When theauditor sees this he begins to form a notion of the case he is engaged upon, he knows “dub-insonic” may be used and he should find and discharge all painful emotion he can reach for it isthis painful emotion which so disposes a case to avoid. He can find, then, the lie factory itself,not the lie factory of the lie factory which produces lie factories, but the actual engram whichcauses all this delusion.However, never bring a pre-clear up short on this material. Don’t tell him it isimaginary, you’ll drive the lie factory into higher effort. For there are sympathy computationshere, despairful losses, great prenatal pain and childhood neglect. And it would take little toshatter what self-confidence this patient has managed to assemble. Therefore walk softly, lookfor despair charges, allies, sympathy engrams and get the lie factory. Then the case will settledown and progress to clear.ELECTRIC SHOCK199"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"It has been found important, in entering a case to locate and relieve all engrams causedby electric shock of whatever kind. These seem to produce a grouping of engrams, whetherthey are received prenatally (as some have been), accidentally, or at the hands of psychiatrists.Any electric shock seems to have more than usual force in the engram bank andapparently deranges the memory files of both past and future events surrounding the shockarea. Further, electric shock injury contains a great depth of “unconsciousness” whichthereafter holds the analytical mind in a reduced state.TACIT CONSENTIn the case of two pre-clears working on each other, each one assuming in his turn theauditor’s role, a condition can arise where each prevents the other from contacting certainengrams.For example, pre-clear A has an ally computation concerning a dog. He unknowinglyseeks to protect this “pro-survival” engram within himself although, of course, failure torelease it will hinder therapy. As he audits pre-clear B he has a tendency to project his ownproblems into pre-clear B, which is to say he has some slight confusion of identity. If pre-clearB is known to have some “pro-survival” engram about a dog, then pre-clear A, auditing, willactually avoid making pre-clear B contact B’s own engram. This is a mistaken idea that byletting B keep his dog engram, A can retain his dog engram. This is “tacit consent.” It might besummed as a bargain: “If you don’t make me get well, I won’t make you get well.” Thisshould be guarded against: once known that such a condition exists and that such reluctance toclear the other is manifested, “tacit consent” ceases.It may also happen that a husband and wife may have a mutual period of quarrels orunhappiness. Engaged upon clearing each other, working alternately as auditor, they avoid,unknowingly but by reactive computation, the mutual period, thus leaving in place painfullyemotional engrams.Tacit Consent is not easily recognized by the individuals so involved, and pre-clears,alternating as auditors, should be very wary of it for it cannot do other than slow a case.EMOTION AND PAIN SHUT-OFFSA case which manifests no emotion or cannot feel pain when emotion and pain shouldbe present in some incident is suffering from a “feeling” shut-off: this most likely will be foundin the prenatal area. The word “feeling” means both pain and emotion: thus the phrase, “I can’tfeel anything,” may be an anesthetic for both.If an exteriorized view of the incident (where the patient sees himself and is not inhimself) or what pretends to be prenatal “ESP” is present, the emotional shut-off probablystems from painful emotion engrams in late life or at least post-birth. If there is no exteriorizedview and the patient is within himself, and yet no sharpness of pain or emotion manifests itselfwhile he is running through an engram, an early emotional shut-off or an early pain shut-offshould be suspected and should be located by repeater technique. Run the words “No emotion”until a paraphrase is obtained: run the words “I can’t feel,” or some other phrase meaning thesame thing and the patient, if the engrams are available and are not suppressed by others, willeventually respond.It may happen that a case may “work” very well, which is to say that engrams presentthemselves and can be run and reduced, without emotion manifesting itself as part of thecontent and with somatics which are dull and not so much pain as simply pressure. If the painand emotion shut-offs do not yield at first to repeater technique, many engrams may have to be200"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"run in the basic area without pain or emotion but only with pressure and word content. In sucha case pain and emotion can eventually be contacted, after which therapy is more beneficial.EXTERIORIZED VIEWSWhenever you find a patient, returned, outside himself and seeing himself, that patientis off the track. He should not be told so but the despair charges, which is to say, the painfulemotion engrams, should be found as soon as possible and discharged. This is something ofthe same mechanism as the ESP described above.TELEPATHYEvery few cases some pre-clear may try to palm off telepathy as an aberrative factor.This is more rainbow chasing. There may be telepathy but so far as research has shown thefoetus doesn’t receive any and even if he receives it, it is not aberrative in any way.Exhaustive tests were made on telepathy and ESP and in every case an explanation wasfound which did not need to go into mind reading or radar sight.When a patient tries to tell the auditor that he is reciting mother’s thoughts receivedprenatally, be certain that somewhere around there is an engram in which she says these exactwords aloud. Mothers, especially when aberrated severely and especially when aberratedseverely enough to attempt abortion, have many engrams they dramatize. The power of thedramatization commonly manifests itself as monologues. Some mothers have a very great dealto say to themselves when alone. All of this speech is, of course, transmitted to the child whenhe is injured, and he may be injured without mother being injured as in an attempted abortion.For considerable time after such an injury the child is usually “unconscious” and in pain; hetherefore records in engrams these monologues (and often the voice is quite loud). He doesn’thear it: it is simply cellularly recorded. All such monologuing is aberrative, of course, andproduces some remarkable patterns of insanity and neurosis.But of telepathy, there is none that is aberrative so far as we know at this time. So theauditor should not accept telepathy any more than he would accept ESP.PRENATAL LIVING CONDITIONSIt is very noisy in the womb. A person may think he has sonic and yet hear no “womb”sounds, which means that he does not have sonic but only “dub-in.” Intestinal squeaks andgroans, flowing water, belches, flatulation and other body activities of the mother produce acontinual sound.It is also very tight in later prenatal life.In a high blood pressure case, it is extremely horrible in the womb.When mother takes quinine a high ringing noise may come into being in the foetal earsas well as her own -- a ringing which will carry through a person’s whole life.Mother gets morning sickness, has hiccoughs and gets colds, coughs and sneezes.This is prenatal life.The only reason anybody “wanted” to “return to the womb” was because somebody hitmother and yelled “Come back here!” so the person does.201"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"THE ENGRAM FILING SYSTEMEngrams are not filed in the orderly fashion managed by a cleared standard bank.Engrams are filed in a way which would defy Alexander. Hence, it is difficult to know whenthe proper consecutive item will appear.Time, topic, value, somatic and emotion are the methods of filing.The return from basic-basic may be an apparent orderly progress into late life.Suddenly a despair charge is triggered and discharged. The auditor looks back at the prenatalarea and finds a whole new series of incidents in view. Progress is then begun back to presenttime, step by step, another discharge is triggered and another series of prenatals come intosight. These are erased and progress is made back toward present time when still anotherdespair charge is released and still more prenatals come to view. These are erased and so forthand so on.The engram filing system gives out data by somatic, time, topic, value or emotion.Usually the file clerk hands out material on the basis of time and topic.Emotion in thebank keeps the file clerk from getting at a certain series of incidents; when the emotion isdischarged, the incidents become available and incidents are brought out until anotheremotional charge stops the file clerk. The wit of the auditor is most used, not in gettingprenatals, but in finding these later life emotional charges and discharging them.All in all the engram filing system is very poor, unlike the standard bank. But it is alsovery vulnerable now that we understand it.The engram filing system data can be erased. Standard bank data cannot be erased.Pain is perishable -- pleasure endures.ALLEVIATIONThe psycho-analyst or general counselor in human relations is occasionally faced with atype of problem which dianetics, applied in small quantity, can resolve easily.It is possible, when a person has been too disturbed by an event of the day to addresshimself to the problem at hand to alleviate his disturbance with a few minutes of work.A sudden change in the aspect of a patient, a sudden deterioration of his serenity,generally stems from some incident which has caused him mental anguish. Although thischange of mind has its source in the restimulation of an engram, the moment of restimulation,which is a lock, may be addressed and alleviated with success.Using reverie or merely asking the patient to close his eyes, the analyst can request himto return and be in the instant wherein he was disturbed. That instant may be in the same day orthe same week as the office call. A moment of analytical shut-down will be discovered whereinsome restimulative person or circumstance upset the equilibrium of the patient. This moment isa lock. It can be recounted, ordinarily, as an engram and the latest source of tension will relieveso that work can be continued. The engram itself, upon which the lock depended, may not beaccessible without a full dianetic address to the problem.The auditor, finding a patient much disturbed, can often save time by relieving the lockwhich caused the immediate disturbance of the pre-clear.Locating locks on a wholesale basis is unremunerative from a dianetic viewpoint sincethere are thousands and thousands of them in every case. Locating the last lock, which ishindering work, may be of benefit.202"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"THE TONE SCALE AND REDUCTION OF ENGRAMSBecause it is very important, the mechanism of the reduction of a late painful emotionengram must be specifically detailed.The uses of reduction on late engrams are wide and various. When the auditor gets intotrouble with his pre-clear by some violation of the auditor’s code, he can treat the violation as apainful emotion engram and reduce it, at which moment the effect of his blunder will be gonein the pre-clear. The auditor merely returns the pre-clear back to the blunder and runs the erroritself as an engram. When the husband has quarreled with his wife or she has found out someunpleasant thing about his activities, he can treat the quarrel or the discovery as a painfulemotion engram and release it with the result of no further worry about it by his wife. Whenthe little boy’s dog has just been run over, the incident can be treated as a painful emotionengram and released. When the pre-clear’s wife has just left him, treat the leaving as a painfulemotion engram and release it. Whatever the shock or upset, it can be reduced in an individualby regular reduction technique and the individual will cease to be troubled by it in the painfulemotion sense. It does not matter whether the engram occurred two hours or ten years ago,painful emotion can be reduced from it. It is run exactly like any other engram, beginning at thebeginning of the first shock with the patient returning to it and continuing far enough along it toadequately embrace its first impact.The aspect of this reduction is a pattern which does not much vary. If the news struckthe individual into apathy, then, as he recounts, he will, unless there is a severe emotional shut-off elsewhere, progress through the incident a time or two, perhaps, before he contacts itproperly. Then there will come the tears and despair of apathy. Another two or three runsshould bring up anger. Then further recounting (always from beginning to end as re-experience) brings the tone up into boredom. Further recounting should bring it to Tone 3 or4, release or, most favorably, laughter.This progress of the tones is the clue which led to the establishment of the tone scalefrom 0 to 4. A Tone 4 is laughter.There is sometimes a stage in the Tone 2 area where the patient begins to be offhandand flippant. This is not Tone 4, it denotes more data present. He may resist recounting at thispoint, saying the incident is released. The auditor must insist on further recounting wheneverhe finds the pre-clear unwilling to recount again, for here is data being suppressed and morecharge is present. The flippancy is generally found to be an escape mechanism and issometimes uttered in the very words which are yet concealed. More recounting (without theauditor insisting any certain words be found) is then done until the patient reaches Tone 4.Here we have, in vignette, the behavior of the whole engram bank in the process oftherapy. The entire bank rises from its initial tone level eventually up to Tone 4, higher andhigher as more and more engrams are erased or reduced. The bank’s rise is not, however, asmooth upward curve for new engrams will be contacted with apathy in them and some havemanics in them. The painful emotion engram, however, does a rather smooth rise. If it is goingto release at all it will rise up the scale. If it does not rise up the scale -- apathy to anger, angerto boredom, boredom to cheerfulness or at least no concern -- then it is suppressed by anincident with similar content.An engram may begin at Tone 1 -- anger -- and rise from there. If it is found to be inTone 2 at the start -- boredom -- it is hardly an engram.It may, however, be in a false Tone 2 and suppressed by other data so that the patientmerely appears bored and careless about it. A few recountings may bring about release of it, atwhich moment it will sag instantly to apathy -- Tone 0 -- and then come on up the scale of thetones. Or another engram may have to be contacted.203"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"The whole physical being follows this tone scale throughout a course of therapy. Themental being follows this tone scale. And painful emotion engrams follow it.On an erasure down in the basic area or when returning from basic-basic, two or threeruns will erase an engram of whatever kind unless it is the basic on a new chain of similarincidents. But engrams which show no emotion anywhere on the track are suppressed byemotional or feeling shut-offs, late painful emotion or early engrams which simply shut off thepain or emotion in so many words.A case should be kept “live.” There must be variability of emotion. A monotonerecounting, which is to say, one which does not vary the engramic tone but merely reduces, isnecessary in the basic area at times, but anytime a patient becomes orderly and “well-drilled”and expresses no concern over his engrams as he recounts them, there is late painful emotion tobe tapped or early emotional shut-off. Conversely, if the patient is too continuously emotionalabout all and anything, if he weeps awhile and then laughs hysterically, therapy is being donebut one should be alert for something engramic in the prenatal area which says he has to be“too emotional” -- which is to say, he has engrams which make him emotional by theircommand content.The tone scale is very useful and is a good guide. It will be most prominent in reducingpost-speech engrams, but will also appear earlier.Any painful emotion engram can be run. If it is properly reducing and not suppressedelsewhere, it follows the tone scale upwards to Tone 4.IF THE PATIENT DOES NOT WORK WELLON REPEATER TECHNIQUEIf, when the patient repeats a line the auditor has given him, the patient does not moveto an incident, three things can be wrong: first, the patient cannot move on the track; second,the phrase may be sensibly withheld by the file clerk until such time as it can be cleared; orthird, the phrase does not exist as engramic material.The patient may also have strong “control yourself” engrams which manifestthemselves by his snatching control from the auditor, being very bossy or simply refusingcooperation. Repeater technique, when directed at “control yourself” and “I’ve got to operate”and allied phrases, can then work.The usual reason repeater technique does not work is that the patient is in a holder. If heis returned but does not shift on the track when repeater technique is given him, use repeatertechnique on the holders.Remember that a “feeling” shut-off can deny all somatics so that the patient does notfeel them. If the patient seems insensible to trouble on the track, be sure that he has a feelingshut-off.A large emotional charge may also inhibit repeater technique.The somatic strip does not go well into emotional charges -- painful emotion engrams --and repeater technique is therefore indictated.If repeater technique “the worst thing that could happen to a baby” and so forth andfrom his conversation may be garnered new phrases for repeater work which will take thepatient into an engram.SINGLE WORD TECHNIQUE204"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Words as well as engrams exist in chains. There is always a first time for the recordingof each word in a person’s life. The whole common language may lie within the engram bank.The possible combinations of that common language may well approach infinity. The waysvarious denyers, bouncers et al., can be phrased are always beyond count.Two “happy” facts exist, however, to reduce the auditor’s labors. First, the dramatispersonae of his engrams are at this date aberrated. Each aberree has standard dramatizationswhich he repeats over and over in restimulative situations. The reaction, for instance, of thefather to the mother is repetitious: if he utters a set of phrases in one engramic situation, he willutter it in subsequent similar situations. If the mother, for example, has an accusative attitudetoward the father, then that attitude will be expressed in certain terms and these terms willappear in engram after engram. The second fact is that where the father or mother is abusive tothe other, the other will eventually begin to suffer contagion of aberration and will repeat theother’s phrases. In a first-born child, where parental brutality is present, one can observe theparents through the engrams of the patient and see one or the other gradually take up the other’sphrases either to worry about themselves or to redeliver them. All this tends to make theengrams appear in chains of incidents, each incident much like the next. When one has thebasic on each type of chain, the subsequent incidents on that chain are sufficiently similar topermit many incidents to be reduced or erased immediately after the first is found. The firstincident on the chain, the basic for that chain, holds the others more or less in place and out ofsight; therefore, the basic of the chain is the goal.Each word in the bank can be discovered to have been delivered to the bank for the firsttime. Words also reduce in chains with the virtue that each subsequent appearance of the wordin the bank locates automatically a new engram, which, of course, is reduced or erased as soonas it is contacted or as soon as its basic can be located.Single word technique is very valuable and useful. It is a special kind of repeatertechnique. On most patients, the repetition by themselves of one word will cause the associatedwords to suggest themselves. Thus, one asks the patient to repeat and return on the wordForget. He starts repeating the word Forget and shortly has an associated set of words, makinga phrase, such as “You can never forget me.” Here we have a phrase in an engram and theremainder of the engram can then be run.When a late engram has had to be contacted to progress a case and yet will not relieve,it is possible to take each word or phrase of that late engram and run it back with repeatertechnique. Thus the earlier engrams which hold this late engram in place can be located andreduced, and eventually one will have reduced the late engram itself. This, by the way, is acommon and useful practice.There is a law about this: When any phrase or word in an engram will not reduce, thesame phrase or word occurs in an earlier engram. One may have to discharge late emotion toget the earlier phrase, but ordinarily single word repeater or phrase repeater will attain it.There are only a few dozens of words necessary to get almost any engram. Thesewould be the key single word repeaters. They are such words as these: forget, remember,memory, blind, deaf, dumb, see, feel, hear, emotion, pain, fear, terror, afraid, bear, stand, lie,get, come, time, difference, imagination, right, dark, black, deep, up, down, words, corpse,dead, rotten, death, book, reed, soul, hell, god, scared, miserable, horrible, past, look,everything, everybody, always, never, everywhere, all, believe, listen, matter, seek, original,present, back, early, beginning, secret, tell, die, found, sympathy mad, crazy, insane, rid,fight, fist, chest, teeth, jaw, stomach, ache, misery, head, sex, Anglo-Saxon four letter wordsof sex and profanity, skin, baby, it, curtain, shell, barrier, wall, think, thought, slippery,confused, mixed, smart, poor, little, sick, life, father, mother, familiar names of parents andany others of household during prenatal and childhood period, money, food, tears, no, world,excuse, stop, laugh, hate, jealous, shame, ashamed, coward, etc.205"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"Bouncers, denyers, holders, groupers, misdirectors et al., each have their commonsingle words and these are few. The bouncer would contain: out, up, return, go, late, later, etc.The holder would contain: catch, caught, trap, trapped, stop, lie, sit, stay, can’t, stuck,fixed, hold, let, lock, locked, come, etc.The grouper would contain: time, together, once, difference, etc.The single word technique shines nowhere brighter than in the Junior Case -- where thepatient carries the name of one or another parent or grandparent. By clearing out the patient’sname from the prenatal engrams (where it is applied to another person but misinterpreted by thepatient as himself) the patient can regain his own definition and valence. Always use thepatient’s first name and last name (separately) as repeater, Junior or not.If the engram bank is blank on a phrase, it probably is not blank on a common word.Any small dictionary will provide an ample fund for single word technique. Use also any list offamiliar first names, male and female, and you may discover allies or lovers not otherwisecontactable.The painful emotion engram sometimes yields slowly by simply directing the somaticstrip to it. Sometimes the patient finds it difficult to approach an overcharged area. Single wordtechnique using the name of the ally, if known, or words of sympathy, endearment, death,rejection or farewell and the love name of the patient as a child in particular will often yieldswift results.By the way, in using repeater technique, word or phrase, the auditor must not stir thecase up too much.Get what shows and reduce that. Reduce the somatic the personmanifests when he goes into reverie and always try to find it for a while, even if you don’tsucceed. If you stir up something en route down a chain which won’t reduce, mark it to bereduced when you have the basic.Using single word technique one often obtains phrases which would otherwise remainhidden but which come into view when the key word is tapped. Using “hear” as a single word,for instance, the following phrases came to light which had thoroughly impeded the progressof the case. No effort was being made to contact such an engram in the prenatal area. Indeed,the “fight” chain had never been suspected since the patient had never dramatized it and becausesuch a violent prenatal fight chain existed the fact that his parents fought violently in the homewas utterly struck from the standard banks so that he would have denied such a thing withshocked surprise had it been suggested. The somatic was unusually severe, caused by thefather kneeling on the mother and choking her:Patient repeated “hear” several times, the auditor asking him to return to an incidentcontaining that word. The patient continued to repeat and then suddenly sank into a stuporwhen he reached the prenatal area. He remained in this “boil-off” for about thirty minutesand then, the auditor rousing him occasionally to make him repeat the word “hear,” manifesteda strong somatic. “Hear” became “Stay here!” The somatic became stronger and “Stayhere” was repeated until the patient could move freely on the track through the engram. Hecontacted his father’s voice and was most reluctant to carry on with the engram, due to itsintense emotional violence. Coaxed and edged into it by the auditor, the engram wasrecounted.FATHER: “Stay here! Stay down, damn you, you bitch! I’m going to kill you thistime. I said I would and I will. Take that! (Intensified somatic as his knee ground into themother’s abdomen) You better start screaming. Go on, Scream for mercy! Why don’t youbreak down? Don’t worry, you will! You’ll be blubbering around here, screaming for mercy!The louder you scream the worse you’ll get. That’s what I want to hear! I’m a punk kid, am I?You’re the punk kid! I could finish you now but I am not going to! (Auditor suddenly hastrouble, patient taking last phrase literally and stopping his recounting; auditor starts him again)206"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"This is just a sample. There’s a lot more than that where it came from! I hope it hurts I hope itmakes you cry! You say a word to anybody and I’ll kill you in earnest! (Patient now runningahead with such an emotional surge that commands are less active on him. This command toremain quiet disregarded) I’m going to bust your face in. You don’t know what it is to be hurt!(Somatic lessened by removal of the knee) I know what I’m going to do to you now! I’mgoing to punish you! I’m going to punish you and God is going to punish you! I’m going torape you! I’m going to stick it into you and tear you! When I tell you to do something you’vegot to do it! Get up on the bed! Lie down! Lie still! (Crack of bones as she is struck in the facewith a fist. Blood pressure coming up and hurting baby) Lie still! You’ll always be here! I’mgoing to finish this! You’re unclean! You are dirty and diseased! God’s punished you and nowI’m going to punish you! (Coitus somatic begins, very violent, further injuring child) You’vegot something terrible in your past. You think you’ve got to be mean to me! You try to makeme feel like nothing! You’re the one that’s nothing! Take it, take it!” (String of sexual banalitiesscreamed for about five minutes) The patient recounted this three times and it erased. It wasbasic-basic! Three days after conception as nearly as could be judged by the subsequent days tothe missed period. It threw into view almost all the other important data in the case, which thenresolved and was cleared.The single word might have landed the patient on some other of the “hears” in the case.In this event it would be necessary to pick it up at its earliest moment or the remainder of theengram might not erase or reduce.The word “hear” might also have landed the patient later on the track in which case theengrams would have had to have been traced back earlier until one was found which woulderase, reducing each one as it was encountered until the earliest was reached when all woulderase.In using single word repeater as in phrase repeater, the auditor should not permit arapid, unmeaning repetition but a slow repeat, the auditor requesting the somatic strip to returnthe while and asking the patient to contact anything else which might associate with the word.Caution: if the patient is not moving on the track, do not give him repeater words orphrases at random as these will pile up engrams where the patient is stuck. Use only efforts toget the patient moving on the track by discovering and reducing the phrase that is holding him.Caution: basic-basic does not always have words in it, often being only painful andaccompanied with womb sounds. It will, nevertheless, hold everything in place by itsperceptics.SPECIAL CLASSES OF COMMANDSThere are several distinct classes of commands. They are outlined here for readyreference with some samples of each.Aberrative commands can contain anything. The auditor does not much concern himselfwith them. Refer back to our young man and the coat in Book II and there we find, in the guiseof hypnotic commands, some idea of what aberrative commands are. “I am a jub-jub bird,” “Ican’t whistle Dixie,” “The world is all against me,” “I hate policemen,” “I am the ugliest personin the world,” “You haven’t any feet,” “The Lord is going to punish me,” “I always have toplay with my thing,” may be very interesting to the patient and even amusing to the auditor andmay have caused a considerable amount of trouble in the patient’s life. Where dianetic therapyis concerned, these all come up in due course. Looking for a specific aberration or a specificsomatic is sometimes of interest and sometimes of some use, but it is not usually important.These aberrative commands may contain enough data to make the patient a raving zealot, aparanoid or a catfish, but they are nothing to the auditor. They come up in due course.Working on them or about them is secondary and less.207"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The primary business of the auditor in any case is to keep the patient moving on thetrack, keep his somatic strip free to come and go and reduce engrams. The moment the patientacts as though or responds as though he was not moving or the moment the file clerk will notgive forth data, then something is wrong and that something has to do with a few classes ofphrase: there are thousands of such phrases contained in engrams, variously worded, but onlyfive classes:DENYERS“Leave me alone,” which means, literally, that he must leave the incident alone. “Ican’t tell” means he can’t tell you this engram. “It’s hard to tell” means it is hard to tell. “Idon’t want to know” means he has no desire to know this engram. “Forget it” is the classic ofthe sub-class of denyer, the forgetter mechanism. When the engram simply won’t come toview but there is a somatic or a muscle twitch, send the somatic strip to the denyer. It is often“Forget it” or “Can’t remember” as a part of the engram. “I don’t know what’s going on” maybe Mama telling Papa something but the pre-clear’s analyzer, impinged, then doesn’t knowwhat’s going on. “It’s beyond me” means he is right there but he thinks he isn’t. “Hold on tothis, it’s your life!” makes the engram “vital” to existence. “It can’t be reached,” “I can’t get inthere,” “Nobody must know,” “It’s a secret,” “If anybody found out, I’d die,” “Don’t talk,”and thousands more.HOLDERSThe holder is the most frequent and the most used since whenever the pre-clear can’tshift on the track or come to present, he is in a holder. A holder combined with a denyer willstill hold: if it can’t be found, look for the denyer first, then the holder. “I’m stuck” is theclassic phrase. “That fixed it” is another. “I’m caught” doesn’t mean to the pre-clear whatMama meant when she said it. It may mean to her that she is pregnant but it tells the pre-clearhe is caught on the track. “Don’t move,” “Sit there until I tell you to move,” “Stop and think”(on this last phrase, when it is uttered on a first recounting the auditor may have to start himgoing again for he does just that, he stops and thinks and he would stop there and think forsome time: the auditor will see this strange obedience to this literal nonsense as he works acase). And thousands more. Any way words literally understood can stop a person or keephim from moving.BOUNCERSThe bouncer could best be demonstrated by a curve.The pre-clear goes back intoprenatal and then finds himself at ten years of age or even present time. That’s a bouncer atwork. He goes early on the time track: it says come back up.When the pre-clear can’t seem to get earlier, there is a bouncer ejecting him from anengram. Get a comment from him on what’s happening. Take the comment or some phrasewhich would be a bouncer and use repeater technique until he settles back down on theengram. If he contacts it easily, it won’t bounce him again. “Get out” is the classic bouncer.The patient usually goes toward present time. “Can’t go back at this point” may mean Mamahas decided she will have to have the baby after all or finish the abortion but to the pre-clear itmeans he must move on up the time track or that he can’t get any earlier period. “Get upthere.” “Run a mile” (“Beat it,” would not be a bouncer; it would mean the pre-clear shouldbeat the engram). “I must go far, far away,” so he does. “I’m growing up,” “Blow youhigher than a kite,” “Batter up.” And thousands more.GROUPER208"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"The grouper is the nastiest of all types of command. It can be so variously worded andits effect is so serious on the time track that the whole track can roll up into a ball and allincidents then appear to be in the same place.This is apparent as soon as the pre-clearhits one. The grouper will not be discovered easily. But it will settle out as the case progressesand the case can be worked with a grouper in restimulation. “I have no time” and “Nothingmakes any difference” are the classic groupers. “Everything comes in on me at once” meansjust that. “They’re all in there together,” “Screwed up,” “Balled up,” “It’s all right here.”“You can remember all this in present time” (a serious auditor error if he uses this to asuggestible patient, for it will gloriously foul a case). “You associate everything.” “I amtangled up,” “Jam everything in there at once,” “There’s no time,” and thousands more.MISDIRECTORThis is an insidious character, the misdirector. When it appears in an engram, thepatient goes in wrong directions, to wrong places, etc. “You’re doing it all backwards.” “Allup now” is a grouper and a misdirector. “Always throwing it up to me” puts the pre-clear upthe track some distance and from there he tries to pick up engrams. “You can’t go down” ispartly bouncer, partly misdirector. “We can’t get to the bottom of this” keeps him off frombasic-basic. “You can start over again” keeps him from finishing the recounting, whereuponhe goes back to the beginning of the engram instead of running it. “Can’t go through thatagain” keeps him from recounting. “I can’t tell you how it began” keeps him starting hisengrams in the middle and they will not then reduce. There are many such phrases. “Let’ssettle down” and all “settlings” make him drift backwards down the track. “I am coming downwith a cold” puts the aberree in a common cold engram. This can be counted upon to makeevery cold much worse. “Come back here” is really a call back but it directs him away fromwhere he should be. A patient who reaches present time with difficulty and then begins to goback has a “Come back here” or a “Settle down.” “Down and out” misdirects him not onlyaway from present time but to the bottom of the track and off it. This is a misdirector and aderailer all at once. “Can’t get past me” is a misdirector on the order of a reverser. “You don’tknow down from up” is the classic phrase. “I’m all turned around.”A special case is the derailer which “throws him off the track” and makes him losetouch with his time track. This is a very serious phrase since it can make a schizophrenic andsomething of this sort is always to be found in schizophrenia. Some of its phrases throw himinto other valences which have no proper track, some merely remove time, some throw himbodily out of time. “I don’t have any time” is a derailer as well as a grouper. “I’m besidemyself” means that he is now two people, one beside the other. “I’ll have to pretend I amsomebody else” is a key phrase to identity confusion. “You’re behind the times” and manymore.There is another special case of the misdirector. The auditor says to go to “present time”and the file clerk throws out a phrase with “present” in it. It does not matter if the present in thephrase was a Christmas present, if it is in the prenatal area, the pre-clear goes there, ignoringwhat the auditor meant. “That’s all at present,” is a vicious phrase, putting everything inpresent time. “It’s a lovely present.”And others. “Now” is sometimes confused with present time but not often. The auditorshould not say “Come to now,” because if he did he would find more “nows” than he couldcomfortably handle. “Present” is a rarer engramic word and is therefore used. “Now” appearstoo frequently.Several severely aberrated persons who had little memory of the past have been foundto be entirely off their time tracks, regressed into the prenatal area and stuck when the case wasentered. As far as their wits were concerned, they had only a few months of past from wherethey were back to conception. And yet these people had managed somehow to function asnormals.209"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Emotional charges usually hold the person off his track and, indeed, are the only thingswhich give these engram commands any power according to current findings.DIFFERENCESThere are two axioms about mind function with which the auditor should be familiar.I.THE MIND PERCEIVES, POSES AND RESOLVES PROBLEMS RELATING TOSURVIVAL.II.THE ANALYTICAL MIND COMPUTES IN DIFFERENCES. THE REACTIVEMIND COMPUTES IN IDENTITIES.The first axiom is of interest to the auditor in his work because with it he can clearlyestablish whether or not he is confronting a rational reaction. The seven-year-old girl whoshudders because a man kisses her is not computing; she is reacting to an engram since atseven she should see nothing wrong in a kiss, not even a passionate one. There must havebeen an earlier experience, possibly prenatal, which made men or kissing very bad. Alldepartures from optimum rationality are useful in locating engrams, all unreasonable fears andso forth are grist to the auditor’s mill. The auditor, with the above law, should study as well,the Equation of the Optimum Solution. Any departure from optimum is suspect. While he careslittle about aberrations, at times a case will stall or seem to have no engrams. He then canobserve the conduct of his patient and his patient’s reactions to life in order to gain data.The second law is dianetics’ contribution to logic. In the philosophic text this is morefully entered. Aristotle’s pendulum and his two-valued logic were abandoned not because ofany dislike of Aristotle but because broader yardsticks were needed. One of these yardstickswas the spectrum principle whereby gradations from zero to infinity and infinity to infinitywere used and Absolutes were considered utterly unobtainable for scientific purposes.In the second axiom the mind can be conceived to recognize differences very broadlyand accurately, in its nearest approach to complete rationality and then, as it falls away fromrationality, to perceive less and less difference until at last it achieves a near approach to utterinability to compute any difference in time, space or thought and so can be consideredcompletely insane. When this follows one thought only, such as a sweeping statement that“All cats are the same,” it is either careless or insane since all cats are not the same, even twocats who look, act and sound alike. One could say, “Cats are pretty much the same,” and stillbe dealing with rather irrational thought. Or one could recognize that there was a species felixdomesticus but that within it cats were decidely different not only from breed to breed but cat tocat. That would be rationality, not because one used Latin but because he could tell thedifference amongst cats. The fear of cats has as its source an engram which usually does notinclude more than one cat and that is a very specific cat of a specific breed with a certain (orperhaps uncertain) personality. The pre-clear who is afraid of all cats is actually afraid of onecat and a cat which is most likely dead these many years at that. Thus as we swing fromcomplete rationality down to irrationality there is a narrowing of differences until they nearlyvanish and become similarities and identities.Aristotle’s syllogism in which two things equal to the same thing are equal to each othersimply does not begin to work in logic. Logic is not arithmetic, which is an artificial thing Maninvented and which works. To handle a problem in logic the mind flutters through anenormous mass of data and computes with dozens and even hundreds of variables. It does notand never did think on the basis that two things equal to the same thing are equal to each otherexcept when employing mathematics it had conceived the better to resolve abstract problems. Itis an abstract truth that two and two equal four. Two what and two what equal four? There isno scale made, no yardstick or caliper or microscope manufactured, which would justify theactuality, for instance, that two apples plus two apples equal four apples. Two apples and twoapples are four apples now if they are the same apples. They would not equal four other apples210"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"by any growth or manufacturing process ever imagined. Man is content to take approximationsand call them, loosely, exactitudes. There is no Absolute anything save in abstract terms set upby the mind to work out exterior problems and achieve approximations. This may seem to be astretched conception, but it is not. The mathematician is very well aware that he is workingwith digit and analogue approximations set up into systems which were not necessarily herebefore Man came and will not necessarily be here after he is gone. Logic, even the simple logicof wondering about the wisdom of going shopping at ten, is handling numerous variables,indefinites and approximations. Mathematics can be invented by the carload lot. There is noactual Absolute, there is only a near approach. Our grammarians alone, much behind the times,insist, probably in memory of the metaphysician, on Absolute Reality and Truth.This is here set down partly because it may be of interest to some but mainly becausethe auditor must realize that he has an accurate measuring stick for sanity. Sanity is the abilityto tell differences. The better one can tell differences, no matter how minute, and know thewidth of those differences, the more rational he is. The less one can tell differences and thecloser one comes to thinking in identities (A = A) the less sane he is.A man says, “I don’t like dogs!” Spot it, auditor, he has an engram about one or twodogs. A girl says, “All men are alike!” Spot it, auditor, here’s a real aberree. “Mountains areso terrible!” “Jewelers never go any place!” “I hate women!” Spot them. Those are engramsright out in broad daylight.Those engrams which inhibit the analytical mind in differentiating are those engramswhich most seriously inhibit thinking.“You can’t tell the difference,” is a common engram. “There is no difference,”“Nothing will ever make any difference to me again,” “People are all bad,” “Everybody hatesme.” This is insanity bait, as the auditors say, and puts a man “spin-bin bound.”There is another class of identity thought and that is the group which destroys time-differentiation. “You don’t know when it happened!” is a classic phrase. “I don’t know howlate it is,” and others have a peculiar effect on the mind for the mind is running on a precisionchronometer of its own and the engrams can thoroughly misread the dial. On a conscious levelone goes along fairly well on analytical time. The engrams slide around back and forthaccording to when they are keyed-in or restimulated. An engram may underlie today’s actionwhich belonged forty years ago on the time track and should be back there. It is not remarksabout time difference so much that aberrate, it is the untimed character of engrams. Time is theGreat Charlatan, it heals nothing, it only changes the environmental aspects and a man’sassociates. The engram of ten years ago, with all its painful emotion, may be encysted and“forgotten” but it is right there, ready to force action if restimulated today.The reactive mind runs on a dime-store wrist watch, the analytical mind runs on abattery of counter-checking chronometers of which a liner could be proud. The cells think thatwrist watch is a pretty fair gimmick -- and it was, it was, back there in the days when Man’sancestor was washed in by the waves and managed to cling to the sand.Thus, a primary test for aberration is similarity and identity, the primary test forrationality is differentiation and the minuteness or largeness with which it can be done.“Men are all alike,” she says. And they are too! To her. Poor thing. Like the fellowwho raped her when she was a kid, like her detested father who said it.RELATIVE IMPORTANCESAND “BELIEVE” AND “CAN’T BELIEVE”The auditor will find himself confronted with two arch enemies in “you must believeit,” and “I can’t believe.”211"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The mind has its own equilibrium and ability and it is aided no more by engrams thanan adding machine is aided by a held-down seven. One of the most important functions of themind is the computing of the relative importances of data.In discovering and conducting research on dianetics, for instance, there were billions ofdata about the mind accumulated throughout the last few thousand years.Now, with a six foot rear vision mirror we can look back and see that here and therepeople had expressed opinions or turned up unevaluated facts which are now data in some ofthe axioms of dianetics or parts of its discoveries. These facts existed in the past, some existnow in dianetics, but with a tremendous difference: they are evaluated. Evaluation of the datafor its importance was vital before the information was of value. Dr. Sententious might havewritten in 1200 A.D. that he believed actual demons did not exist in the mind; Goodwife Sofiein 1782 was heard to say that she was certain that prenatal influence had warped many a life;Dr. Zamba might have written in 1846 that a hypnotized patient could be told he was crazy andthat he would thereafter act crazy. Dr. Sententious might have said also that angels, notdemons, caused mental illness because the patient had been evil; Goodwife Sofie also mighthave said that punk water poultices cured “ravings”; Dr. Zamba might also have declared thathypnotized patients needed only a few more positive suggestions to make them well andstrong. In short, for every datum which approached truth there were billions which wereuntrue. The missing part of each datum was a scientific evaluation of its importance to thesolution. The selection of a few special drops of water from an ocean of unspecial drops isimpossible. The problem of discovering true data could be resolved only by jettisoning allformer evaluations of humanity and the human mind and all “facts” and opinions of whateverkind and starting fresh, evolving the entire science from a new highest common denominator(and it is true that dianetics borrowed nothing but was first discovered and organized; only afterthe organization was completed and a technique evolved was it compared to existinginformation).The point here is that monotone importance in a class of facts leads to nothing but themost cluttered confusion. Here is evaluation: opinions are nothing, authority is useless, data issecondary: establishment of relative importance is the key. Given the world and the stars as alaboratory and a mind to compute the relative importance of what it perceives, and no problemscan remain unsolved. Given masses of data with monotone evaluation and one has somethingwhich may be pretty but is useful.The stunned look of fresh-caught ensigns of the Navy when they first see in the metalthe things about which they have so laboriously read is a testimony to more than the faultyeducational system currently employed: the system seeks to train something which is perfect --the memory -- ; it aligns little or nothing with purpose or use, and ignores the necessity ofpersonal evaluation of all data both as to need for it and its use. The stunned look comes fromthe overwhelming recognition that whereas they have thousands of data about what they see,they do not know whether it is more important to read the chronometer when they take asextant sight or use only blue ink in writing a log book. These gentlemen have been wrongededucationally not because they have not been given thousands of data relative to ships butbecause they have not been told the relative importance of each datum and have not experiencedthat importance. They know more facts than the less educated but they know less about factualrelation.More pertinent to the auditor, there are two species of engramic commands which givemonotone evaluation to data. The persons who have either of these as a major content in theengram bank will be similarly aberrated even if each manifests the aberration with oppositepolarity.Every now and then some unfortunate auditor finds a “Can’t believe it” on his hands.This case is extremely trying. Under this heading come the “I doubt it,” the “I can’t be sure,”and the “I don’t know,” cases.212"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Such a case is easy to spot for when he first comes into therapy he begins by doubtingdianetics, the auditor, himself, the furniture and his mother’s virginity. The chronic doubter isnot an easy case because he cannot believe his own data. The analyzer has a built-in judgewhich takes in data, weighs it and judges it right, wrong or maybe. The engramic doubter has a“held down 7” to the effect that he has to doubt everything, something much different fromjudging. He is challenged to doubt. He must doubt. If to doubt is divine, then the god iscertainly Moloch. He doubts without inspecting, he inspects the most precise evidence, and hestill doubts.The auditor will return this patient to a somatic which tears half his head off, which isconfirmed by scars, which is confirmed by aberration, and which is doubted as an incident.The way to handle this case is to take his pat phrases and feed them to him in reverie orout of reverie with repeater technique. Make him go over and over them, sending his somaticstrip back to them. Shortly a release of the phrase will take place. Feed all doubter phraseswhich the patient has used in this manner. Then continue the case. The object is not to makehim a believer but to place him in a situation where he can evaluate his own data. Don’t arguewith him about dianetics -- arguing against engrams is senseless since the engrams themselvesare senseless.In ten or twenty hours of therapy such a patient will begin to face reality enough so thathe no longer doubts the sun shines, doubts the auditor or doubts that he had a past of somesort. He is only difficult because he requires these extra hours of work. He is usually, by theway, very aberrated.The “Can’t believe it” finds difficulty in evaluation because he has difficulty givingcredence to any fact more than any other fact: this produces an inability to compute relativeimportances amongst data with the result that he may be as concerned with the shade of hissuperior’s tie as with the marriage he himself is about to undertake. Similarly, the “You mustbelieve it” case finds difficulty in differentiating amongst importances of various data and mayhold equally firmly the idea that paper is made from trees and that he is about to be fired. Bothcases “worry,” which is to say they are unable to compute well.Rational computation depends upon the personal computation of the relativeimportances of various data. Reactive “computation” deals exclusively with the equation thatwidely different objects or events are similar or equal. The former is sanity, the latter isinsanity.The “Must believe it” case will present a confused reactive bank, for the bank embracesthe most unlikely differences as close similarities. The “Must believe it” engram command candictate that one person, a class of persons, or everyone must be believed, no matter what iswritten or said. The auditor, returning the patient, will find major aberrations held in place by alock containing only conversation.When father is the actual source and is an ally of the patient, the auditor will discoverthat almost everything father said was accepted literally and unquestioningly by his child. Thefather may not have been aware of having established this “Must believe it” condition and hemay even be a jocular man, given to jokes. Every joke will be found to be literally acceptedunless the father carefully labeled it a joke, which meant it must not be literally accepted. Onecase folder is to hand here where father was the source of “Must believe”: one day the fathertook his daughter, three years of age, down to the seacoast and, through the fog, pointed to alighthouse. The lighthouse gave an eerie aspect in the foggy night. “That’s Mr. Billingsly’splace,” said the father, meaning that Billingsly, the lighthouse keeper, lived there. The childnodded faithfully, if a little frightened, for “Mr. Billingsly” threw around a mane of hair-shadows -- glared to seaward with one eye sweeping the water and stood a hundred feet talland “Mr. Billingsly” let out moans which sounded quite ferocious. His “place” was a ledge ofrock. As a pre-clear twenty years later the daughter was discovered to be frightened of any lowmoaning sound. The auditor patiently traced down the source and found, much to the delight of213"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"himself and the daughter, “Mr. Billingsly.” Vast quantities of aberration, peculiar conceptionsand strange notions were found to derive from casual statements the father had made. Beingskilled in his task, the auditor did not bother to try to locate and erase everything the father hadsaid -- a task which would have taken years and years: he located, instead, the prenatal “Youmust believe me” and its engramic locks, and all the non-engramic locks, of course,disappeared and were automatically re-evaluated as experienced data rather than “held-downsevens.” Of course there is always much more wrong with a case than a mere “You mustbelieve me,” but the change of viewpoint which the patient experienced immediately afterwardswas startling: she was now at liberty to evaluate her father’s data, which she had not beenbefore.Because they teach in terms of altitude* and Authority, educational institutionsthemselves form a social “You must believe it” aberration. It is impossible to reduce an entireuniversity education even if it sometimes appears desirable, but by addressing the momentswhen the patient was hammered into believing or accepting school, from kindergarten forward,many a fact-clogged mind can again be made facile which was not so before, for the facts willbe re-evaluated automatically by the* (By altitude is meant a difference of level of prestige -- one on a higher altitude carriesconviction to one on a lower altitude merely because of altitude. The auditor may find himselfunable to gain sufficient altitude with some patients to work them smoothly and he may have somuch altitude with others that they believe everything he says. When he has too little altitude,he is not believed; when he has too much he is believed too well.) mind for importances, notaccepted on monotone evaluation as is the case in “formal education.”The “Can’t believe it” is a subject so weary and dreary to the auditor that he may findhimself, after a few finished cases, running adroitly away from one. The “I don’t know” andthe “I can’t be sure” cases are not as bad as the “I can’t believe it.” The prize case in difficultyin dianetics is a patient who is a Junior named after either father or mother, who has not onlyshut-down pain, emotion, visio and sonic recall but also “dub-in” for them on a false basis,with a lie factory working full blast, who is uncooperative and who is a “Can’t believe it.”Monotone evaluation hinders the “Can’t believe it’s” acceptance of all facts. Any casemay have a few “Can’t believe its” but some cases are so thoroughly aberrated by the phrasethat they disbelieve not only reality but also their own existence.The mind has a “built-in doubter” which, unhindered by engrams, rapidly sorts outimportances and, by their weights, resolves problems and arrives at conclusions. The rationalmind applies itself to data presented, compares it to experience, evaluates its veracity and thenassigns it relative importance in the scheme of things. This is done, by a clear, with a rapiditywhich sometimes requires the splitting of seconds. By a normal the time required is extremelyvariable and the conclusions are more apt to be referred to another’s opinion or compared toAuthority rather than to personal experience. That is the fundamental effect of contemporaryeducation which, through no particular fault of its own and despite every effort it has made tofree itself, yet, through lack of tools, is forced to follow Scholastic methods. These, bycontagion of aberration, persist against all efforts of advanced educators. The normal is taughton one hand to believe or else he’ll fail and on the other to disbelieve as a scientific necessity:belief and disbelief cannot be taught, they must be personally computed. If a mind could belikened to a general served by his own staff, it could be seen to have a G-2 which, as a combatintelligence center, collected facts, weighed them for importance and formed an estimate of asituation or the value of a conclusion. As the intelligence officer would fail if he had a signedorder to disbelieve everything, so does the mind fail which has a reactive command todisbelieve. Certainly a military organization would lose to every puny enemy if it had,conversely, a command to believe everything, and a man will fail if he has a reactive mindorder to believe all information in the world around him.214"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"The believe and disbelieve engrams present different manifestations, and while onecannot be said to be either more or less aberrative than the other, it is certain that the disbelieveengram, by and large, seems to make the less sociable man.Disbelief occurs in various degrees, of course. There is, for instance, a social disbeliefengram which promotes a class of literature which is as insincere as it is unwitty. Insincerity,shame of emotional demonstration, fear of praising may stem from other things than merely adisbelief engram, but a disbelief engram is most certainly present in the majority of such cases.The auditor will find, when he is trying to enter a very strong “Can’t believe it” case,that experience is disbelieved, the auditor is disbelieved, hope of results is disbelieved and thatthe most ridiculous and unreasonable insults and arguments may be presented. The patient maysquirm in a veritable snake pit of somatics and still disbelieve that he is re-experiencinganything.It is a sadly chronic fact that an aberree has a certain set of cliches from out of hisengram bank. He will repeat these cliches for all occasions and circumstances. Mother, havingan engram bank of her own and father having his, will be found to be uttering pretty much thesame sort of statement time after time. These are dramatizations. One of the parents may havehad an “I don’t know” ready to precede everything he or she said, which makes a whole“stack” of “I don’t knows” in the engram bank: which much undermines understanding. In thesame way, “You must believe!” or “You can’t believe!” may become “stacked” in the engrambank. Once one has heard a few engrams from a patient, he knows he will have many, manymore similar engrams from that source. Once an auditor has listened to the personnel in thepatient’s engram bank for a very short time he knows pretty much what he will have in many,many more engrams. Hence any phrase is liable to be much repeated in the engram bank, withvarying somatics and accompanying perceptics. If Mother is troubled with high bloodpressure, it is raised by Father -- to the intense discomfort of the child and a degree which oftenproduces a later migraine headache -- she is apt to utter, “I can’t believe you would treat me thisway.” Privately, she must have been hard to convince (one doesn’t convince much againstengramic “reasoning”), for he treated her this way about every three days; and every three daysshe was saying, “I can’t believe you” or “I can’t believe you would do this to me,” or “I can’tbelieve anything you say,” or some such thing.The “Can’t believe” is apt to be rather hostile since “Can’t believe” is often hostileconversation. “You’ve got to believe me” is more apt to be a pleading or whining sort of anengram. “Believe what I tell you, God damn it,” is, however, fully as hostile as an auditormight expect.An auditor who finds a case intensely and unreasonably skeptical should expect a“Can’t believe” stack in the engram bank. If he finds a patient incapable of holding an opinionof his own but weather-vaning to each new person or quoting an Authority (all authorities geteasily identified with father in the reactive bank), he should suspect a “Must believe” in someform as well as other things. There are many manifestations of either case. The chronic aspectin therapy is that the “Can’t believe” suspects his own data so strongly that he alters itcontinually and the engrams which, after all, have just one, exact package of content, will notproperly reduce; the “Must believe” takes up every engram he hears about as his own and thatdoes him little good.Do not suppose that any case has a standard aspect, however. The language containsmany words and combinations of words, and aberrees are not unusual who have the entirebasic language and all its idioms securely connected up to some somatic or other. Casesordinarily contain “Can’t believe” and “Must believe” phrases in the same bank. Only whenthese phrases become top-heavy does the person respond in a set pattern. When the set patternis of either species of phrase, then the auditor confronts a patient who must have had, at best, amost unhappy life. But either case clears. They all clear, even Juniors.215"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"PHYSICAL PAIN AND PAINFUL EMOTION COMMANDSBesides visio and sonic, another vital recall to therapy is the somatic, which is to saythe physical pain of the incident. Running a physically painful incident without a somatic isworthless.If physical pain is present, it may come only after considerable “unconsciousness” hasbeen “boiled-off.” If the incident contains pain but the somatic is not turned on, the patient willwriggle his toes and breathe heavily and nervously or he may have jumping muscles. The footwriggling is an excellent clue to the presence of any somatic turned on or not turned on.Breathing heavily and jumping muscles and various twitches without pain denote two things:either a denyer is in the incident and the content isn’t being contacted or, if the pre-clear isrecounting, the somatic may be shut-off in the incident or elsewhere, either earlier by commandor late by painful emotion. The patient who wriggles a great deal or who does not wriggle at allis suffering from a pain or emotion shut-off or late painful emotion engrams or both.There is a whole species of commands which shut-off pain and emotionsimultaneously: this is because the word “feel” is homonymic. “I can’t feel anything” is thestandard, but the command varies widely and is worded in a great many ways. The auditor canpick up his own book of these from patients who, describing how they feel or rather, how theydon’t feel, give them away. “It doesn’t hurt” is a class of phrases specifically shutting off pain,a class which includes, of course, such things as “There isn’t any pain,” etc. Emotion is shut-off by a class of phrases which contain the word “emotion” or which specifically (literallytranslated) shut off emotion.The auditor should keep a book of all denyers, misdirectors, holders, bouncers andgroupers which he discovers, each listed under its own heading. In this way he adds tomaterial he can use for repeater technique when he sees something is wrong with the way thepatient is moving on the track. But there are four other classes of phrases which he should alsostudy and list: shut-offs, exaggerators, derailers and lie factories. He can also add to hisclasses.He will discover enormous numbers of commands in engrams which can accomplishthese various aspects. And he should be particularly interested in the pain and emotion shut-offs and the exaggerators, which is to say, those engramic commands which give the aspect oftoo much pain and too much emotion. There is no reason to give large numbers of them here.They are quite various, language being language.Many combinations are possible. A patient can be found to weep over the most trivialpost-speech things and yet have few or no somatics. Several things can cause this. Either hehad a mother or a father who wept for nine months before he was born or he has anexaggerator at work which commands that he be emotional about everything: “Too muchemotion.” In combination with this he can have something which says he can feel no pain orcan’t hurt or even can’t feel.A patient who aches and suffers and yet cannot weep would have a reverse set ofcommands: he has a “no emotion” command early on the track or a long chain of them and yethas commands which dictate pain to excess: “I can’t stand the pain,” “The pain is too great,” “Ialways feel I’m in agony,” etc. “I feel bad,” on the other hand, is a shut-off because it saysthere is something wrong with the mechanism with which he feels and implies disability tofeel.Both pain and emotion can be commanded into exaggeration. But it is a peculiar thingthat the body does not manufacture pain to be felt. All pain felt is genuine, even if exaggerated.Imaginary pain is non-existent. A person “imagines” only pain he has actually felt. He cannotimagine pain he has not felt. He may “imagine” pain at sometime later than the actual incidentbut if he feels pain, no matter how psychotic he is, that pain will be found to exist somewhereon his time track. Scientific tests have been carefully conducted in dianetics to establish this fact216"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"and it is a valuable one. You can test it yourself by asking patients to feel various pains,“imagining them” in present time. They will feel pains for you so long as you ask them to feelpains they have had. Somewhere you will find the patient unable to actually feel the pain he istrying to “imagine.” Whether he is aware of it or not, he has had pain wherever he “imagines”it and is simply doing a somatic strip return for you on a minor scale.This aspect of pain is quite interesting in that many patients have, at one time or anotherin their lives, pretended to the family or the world that they had a pain. The patient thought,when he asserted this “make-believe” pain, that he was lying. In therapy the auditor can usethese “imaginings” for they lead straight to sympathy engrams and actual injury. Further, these“imaginary” pains are generally displayed to the person or pseudo-person who was thesympathy ally present in the engramic moment. Thus, if a small boy always pretended to hisgrandmother, and thought he was pretending, that he had a bad hip, it will be discoveredeventually that sometime in his early life he hurt that same hip and received sympathy duringthe engramic moment which is now eclipsed from the analyzer. Patients often feel quite guiltyover these pretenses. Sometimes soldiers in the recent war have come home pretending theyhad been wounded and, when in therapy, are afraid the auditor will find out or give them awayto their people. This soldier might not have been wounded in the war, but an engram will befound which contains sympathy for the injury of which he complains. He is asking forsympathy with a colorful story and believes he is telling a lie. Without informing him of thisdianetic discovery, the auditor can often flush into view a sympathy engram which mightotherwise have to be arduously hunted down.“Cry baby” is a phrase against which the pre-clear will negate in an engram, thusinhibiting tears. It is quite ordinary to find the pre-clear confusing himself with older brothersand sisters who are in his prenatal life: their jeers, mother’s orders and so forth then allregister. If the pre-clear knows of any older children, the auditor should look for them in theengrams of prenatal life, for children are quite active and often bounce up and down onmother’s lap or collide with her. Any childish phrases of derision are then not always post-birth.It has been said during dianetic research that if one could release all the painful emotionof a lifetime, he would have ninety-percent of the clearing done. However, the painful emotionis only a surface manifestation of the physical pain engrams and would not be painful if thephysical pain did not co-exist or exist priorly.When emotion and pain shut-offs exist in a case, the patient is normally tense of muscleand nervous, given to twitching or merely tension. When pain and emotion are exaggerated bycommands, one has a highly dramatizing case on his hands.THE ALLY VERSUS THE ANTAGONISTIt is necessary for the auditor to know the reactive mind’s evaluation of importances.Moronic or not, the reactive mind distinguishes violently between friend and foe, about theonly piece of differentiation it does.There is a prime test for an ally. And recall that the ally is a part of sympathy engrams,the things which are most likely to produce psycho-somatic illnesses, immaturities andconfusion on a grand scale. As long as it can rebel and negate, the reactive mind takes care ofthe enemies so far as it is able. It can, of course, be twisted by circumstance into the valence ofthe enemy and so cry havoc and abreact in general if this was a winning valence. But it will notordinarily use the data of the enemy contained in a contra-survival engram save to negateagainst it. When the general tone nears Zone One, of course the reactive mind starts picking upand obeying antagonistic commands. Thus, if father is the villain of the piece, an antagonist,father’s commands are not the reactively obeyed commands but the commands the aberree willusually negate against or avoid.217"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"This is not the case, however, with the ally. The ally, the person from whom sympathycame when the patient was ill or injured, is heeded and obeyed since his “purpose” isapparently aligned with the purpose of the individual to survive. If one thing about a person isright then, according to our moronic little friend, the reactive mind, everything about thatperson is right, everything that person says and does is right and particularly is right whateverthat person said in the engram.The chronic psycho-somatic illness is ordinarily from a sympathy engram. This is quiteimportant, for the sympathy engram will be the last or hardest to reach, being aligned withsurvival purpose.A “Must believe” from an ally means that the person must believe. A “Must believe”from an antagonist ordinarily brings about a circumstance that the person must not believe.Here, in the ally and the antagonist, we have the age-old tale of the hero and the villain,the heroine and the villainess, Mazda and Ahriman, the cowboy in the white hat and thecowboy in the black. The Hindu trinity is found, as source, in father, mother and unborn baby.But the war of “good and evil” is found as reactive data in the engram bank in the form of theally and the antagonist.The very best logic of which the reactive mind is capable is two-valued, white andblack, and two-valued logic finds its response only in the reactive bank. And the reactive mindworks out all problems in absolutes, bringing about logical monstrosities, for there is theabsolute of good, the absolute of evil and the absolute of identity thought. Any rationalcomputation demonstrates an absolute to be impossible from a standpoint of truth orworkability: but the reactive mind never quibbles, it just reacts. It knows a champion when itsees one (it thinks) and it knows a villain (it supposes). The ally, the champion, is everybodywho has any characteristic of the ally and the antagonist, the villain, is everyone who has anycharacteristics of the antagonist. Further, anything associated with the ally is a champion andeverything associated with the antagonist is villainous. If the ally is an aunt, then aunts aregood. If the antagonist is a sign painter, then sign painters are all evil. Further, the dolliesAuntie crocheted mean that dollies are good and that all lacework is good and that anything onwhich lacework sits is good and that anything which looks like lacework is good and so on inthe ad absurdum which only the reactive mind can manage without a qualm. And the signs thepainter painted were evil and where they sit is evil and paint is evil and smell of paint is evil andbrushes are evil so hair brushes are evil so the dresser on which hairbrushes sit is evil and soon.There is an axiom here which is well not to slight in working a patient:ANY CHRONIC PSYCHO-SOMATIC ILLNESS HAS AT ITS SOURCE ASYMPATHY ENGRAM.And another:A REACTIVE MIND WILL NOT PERMIT AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE ABERRATEDOR CHRONICALLY PSYCHO-SOMATICALLY ILL UNLESS THE ILLNESSHAS SURVIVAL VALUE.This does not mean that the individual has a power of choice analytically. It does meanthat the reactive mind, working quietly and hitherto hidden so well, chooses, on identitycomputation, physical and mental conditions to match any circumstance even remotely similarto any concept in the engram bank.There is such a thing as necessity level. This rises and keys-out engrams and can keyout the control of the reactive mind itself. Necessity level often rises. The individual can force itto rise analytically whether or not actual cause exists. A person may have no engram aboutgoing to the electric chair for murder and yet have an engram about murdering people.218"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Necessity level rises and analytically overwhelms all impulse to kill for the analyzer knows allabout electric chairs. When the necessity level cannot rise, then one is dealing with a lowdynamic individual. An artist, terribly aberrated about his work through the kind efforts ofobligingly caustic critics, can yet boost himself by his necessity bootstraps to do another pieceof work and damn the aunt who said he gave her too many chins in her portrait and ripped thework to shreds or damn the critics who said he was too new and his work too swift. Necessitylevel can soar above the reactive mind by, as the marine sergeant said, “Sheer guts.” Given toomany current restimulators, used too hard by life, an individual, caught in the dwindling spiralof reactivated engrams, may come at last to a point where he cannot longer remain well. If thisis his first serious sag and if the sag is deep, a psycho-somatic illness will appear and becomemore or less chronic and, this is important, it will stem directly from a sympathy engram.All psycho-somatic ills carry with them, if less obvious, aberrative commands whichmean that a person suffering from psycho-somatic illness, whether he relishes the idea or not,is also suffering from the aberration which is part of the same engram.If the auditor wants to find the real holders, the real reasons his case appears to resistgetting well, the real aberrative factors and illnesses, he will look to the ally or allies, for anycase may have many. He will exhaust from them the painful emotion of loss or denial andbacktrack immediately to find the underlying engrams.Remember too that the reactive mind is not bright enough to realize that two sides of thesame person are the same person. Hence we can have Mother-the-white-angel and Mother-the-howling-harridan. As the white angel she is implicitly followed, as the harridan she is negatedagainst. Father may be Father-the-beneficent and Father-the-baby- killer. And so with all allies.But only the pure, the absolute, the never changing ally who, resolute and firm, stayed the coldsharp hand of death and placed tenderly in the expiring hand of the wistful child the strong andflaring torch of life (or at least said, “Poor baby, you feel so bad; please don’t cry,”) is themodel, the paragon, the gold-footed idol with free access to the gods. (This was grandpop: hedrank too much and he cheated at cards, but the reactive mind doesn’t see it that way becausegrandpop hauled baby through pneumonia and was darned sure baby got well: good acts if hehadn’t been so melodramatic about it and if he hadn’t talked so much while the poor kid was“unconscious.”)Question the patient adroitly about Father and Mother: if he isn’t much disturbed bytheir deaths (if they are dead) or if he is simply careless of them or if he bares his teeth, they areantagonists; the allies are elsewhere. If the mother and father are indifferently or angrily orpropitiatively regarded, be very sure then, that the patient had a rough time of it betweenconception and birth and later and be sure, if this is the case, that there will be allies in plentyfor the child will have sought them out in every scrape or injury. But you will not find theallies, usually, by mere questions. The reactive mind considers them to be pure gold even if theengrams in which they appear have somatics enough to wreck a person for life. It hides allies.The auditor has to look for them through discharging painful emotion. The death, departure ordenial by an ally is a certain painful emotion engram. One way or another, working at it fromlater painful emotion or earlier physically painful engrams, the ally will eventually uncover andcan be entered as memory in the standard banks and erased as illness out of the engram bank.The solution of chronic psycho-somatic ills lies largely in the field of sympathyengrams. These will not erase early, however, for they are the inner bastion behind which thereactive mind crouches and observes the storming of the outer defenses by antagonists. Thepainful emotion of ally losses masks, at times, not only allies but antagonists as well. Thesympathy engram is not the only source of psycho-somatic illness by far, but it is the source ofthe chronic psycho-somatic ill.By the way, nothing in this dissertation about allies should be construed to mean thatone should not show love to a child. Observers in the past have jumped at questionableconclusions when they felt that demonstrated affection aberrates a child. Lack of affection maykill him, but the reverse is not true. The only way an ally can aberrate a child is by talking to219"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"and sympathizing with a child who is very ill or “unconscious” from injury. If he does this healloys the child’s personality with his own, creates an eventual possibility of psycho-somaticillness and aberration and may generally disable the child for life (except for dianetics, ofcourse). Love a child best and do for him best when he is well. Do anything you please withhim when he is well, say what you please. When he is sick or hurt, it is best, as the bosunsaid, “Patch him up and keep God-damned quiet!”TOKENSThe tale of the magic amulet, the lucky talisman, the belief in the charm and the longcatalogue of fetishes, the objects and mannerisms which one keeps as sakes are the “dearlybeloveds” of the reactive mind.There is nothing wrong with a man keeping llamas in the parlor or wearing purple andgreen suspenders or rubbing fire plugs for luck, nor is there anything wrong with sighing overa stolen lady’s slipper or smoking Pittsburgh stogies. Any Rights of Man should provide forsuch eccentricities. But the auditor can use this data to detect vital information.In dianetics, the term token is defined to embrace the objects and habits which anindividual or society keeps by not knowing they are extensions of an ally.By identity thought there are associative restimulators for every restimulator in theenvironment -- these things connected with the restimulator. Being blank on the subject, theanalytical mind, apprised by physical reaction that a restimulator of something is nearby, thenpicks up the associative restimulator but does not select the actual restimulator. (In Book II, theyoung man’s signal to remove his coat was a touch of the tie: he did not cite the tie in hiscomplaint, the nearest he came to it was the person and clothing of the hypnotic operator.These were associative restimulators.)A restimulator for a contra-survival engram might be an electric light; the aberree looksto the shade, the pull chain, the room or the person under the light to be a source of annoyance,and not only does he not know that a restimulator is present but supposes that the associatedobjects have some evil in themselves.The associative restimulator for a contra-survival engram needs no name other thanthat, associative restimulator. The pain is the thing, the things associated in any way with thething are the thing, are other things, etc. is the reactive equation which fills the world of theaberree full of fear and fills him full of anxiety. Leave a child in a place or a room where he hasbeen unhappy and he may become ill, for he is confronted with some restimulator and he can atbest explain, like the adult, his fear in terms of things not rationally connected to therestimulator. This is the mechanism of engramic restimulation.It is mostly terribly uncomfortable to any aberree who, try as he might, cannot say whyhe does not like some person or object or locale and who cannot connect any of the three withthe actual item which is the restimulator and does not know he has an engram about it. Thismethod of detecting engrams leads nowhere quickly since one cannot select objects, persons orlocales and know they are restimulators. They may be only associative restimulators to theactual restimulator item in the environment. (Words contained in engrams, by the way, and anyother precise restimulator can “push-button” the aberree into action or apathy if they are usedupon him. In words it has to be the exact word; for instance painted will not do when painteris in the engram. What is painted, however, may be an associative restimulator and the aberreemay declare he does not like it; that he does not like it does not mean that it will “push hisbuttons” and made him cough or sigh or get angry or get sick or whatever the engramcontaining the word dictates he should do.)220"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"The token is a very special kind of restimulator. While the auditor may not find muchuse for the associative restimulator as applied to contra-survival engrams, he can employ thetoken as a means of detection to locate allies.The token is any object, practice or mannerism which one or more allies used. Byidentity thought the ally is survival; anything the ally used or did is, therefore, survival. Thevalence of the ally is that one most frequently employed by the aberree. While the clear canshift himself into valences he imagines or beholds at will and convenience and out of them atwill and can stabilize in his own at will, the aberree skids around into valences without hisknowledge or consent and is most likely to be in any valence but his own. The person whoseems to be a different person every time he is met or a different person to each person hemeets, with special valences manifesting here and others manifesting there, is shifting intovarious winning valences; interfered with in his shifts, he goes into secondary valences; ifforced into his own valence he becomes ill. It is understood, of course, that all valencesmanifest something of himself.Shifting into ally valences is the fundamental practice of the aberree. He will feel mostat ease when his own valence is alloyed to some degree with an ally valence. So long as theally or the pseudo-ally is not available, the aberree reminds himself of the ally valence withtokens. These tokens are the things the ally possessed, practiced or did.An aberree will often inextricably associate himself with a pseudo-ally, as in marriage,and then make the astonished discovery that he is not partnered with the optimum ally conduct.(Mother was an ally, Mother baked bread; wife is pseudo-Mother though neither she nor heknows it; wife does not bake bread: Mother frowned on lipstick, wife wears lipstick; Mothergave him his way, wife has a bossy attitude; wife is pseudo-Mother because she has similarvoice tones only.) The aberree then reactively and unknowingly attempts to coax wife orpartner into the ally valence by assuming that the moment of the sympathy engram is presenttime -- a mechanical shift caused only by the restimulation of the sympathy engram because ofvoice tones or some such thing -- and proceeds to manifest the ghost of the engram illness orinjury or operation as a psycho-somatic sickness. The computation of the reactive mind issimple -- just like Simple Simon -- one forces the ally into being by manifesting the somaticwith which the ally sympathized. This can also be an effort to turn a partner in which thereactive mind thinks it has discovered an ambivalent friend-enemy into the sympathy valence.Wife is cruel.Mother was cruel until the injury, then she was nice. Manifest the injury as a chronicpsycho-somatic illness and wife will be nice. Actually wife isn’t nicer, so the computation getsstronger, the illness gets stronger, and down into the dizzy dwindling spiral we go. Thepsycho-somatic illness is also a denial of dangerousness, a plea of helplessness -- a shade ofopossum playing, fear paralysis: “I’m no menace to you. I’m sick!”The aberree goes into his own valence of the time of the sympathy engram in his bid forsympathy and his denial of his own dangerousness. The valence of himself, of course, iscomplicated by the age-tab and somatic of the engram in which he was immature and not well.The psycho-somatic illness is, as well, a token, which is to say it is a reminder of atime when he once had love and care and was told so. He needs it about as much as he needs tobe atom bombed, of course, but this is good, solid reactive mind “survival” and the reactivemind is going to make it so he can survive if it kills him.This is all mechanical and is actually merely restimulation of an engram, but it is betterunderstood as a low order computation.In the absence of an ally, and even in the presence of the ally, he uses reactive mimicry.Conscious mimicry is a wonderful way to learn. Reactive mimicry is most alloying to thepersonality. Reactively, he once had an ally and imitates the ally. Consciously he may not evenrecall the ally or the habits of the ally.221"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The ally, remember, is somebody who has entered the interior world of the mind whenthe analyzer was shut down by illness or injury or an operation and gave forth sympathy orprotection. The ally is part of the sympathy engram. If a child had grandparents he liked andwas lucky enough not to be ill around them or be talked to by them in sympathetic terms whenhe was ill or injured, the grandparents would still be much loved. In dianetics an ally is onlysome one who has offered sympathy or protection in an engram. We don’t have to haveengrams to be loved or to love: quite the contrary, one is better loved and loves more withoutengrams.The token applies, dianetically, only to the ally and is an object, practice or mannerismsimilar to an object, practice or mannerism of the ally.The ally smoked Pittsburgh stogies, so the aberree may smoke Pittsburgh stogies nomatter what they do to his throat or his wife. The ally wore bowlers, the lady aberree dotes onriding habits but has never ridden a horse. The ally knitted, the aberree specializes in wearingknit things or a lady at least makes a pretense of knitting and sometimes wonders why she evertook it up, she is so bad at it. The ally used profanity, the aberree uses the same profanity. Theally wipes his nose on his sleeve and picks his nose, the aberree wipes his nose on a dinnerjacket and fiddles with his nostrils.The token may be a reminder of pure ally or it may be a reminder of the friend side ofan ambivalent friend-enemy. And it may be a winning valence that was also ambivalent towardthe aberree. The token is never an associative restimulator in the meaning that it reminds ofsome antagonist, for associative restimulators are abhorred.The most chronic token, the most constant habit, practice or mannerism of the pre-clearis a direct arrow to the pure ally. And the pure ally is the one the reactive mind will guard to itshighest level of the beset donjon keep. And that is the target of the auditor. He may have torelieve the majority of the engram bank before he can erase the engram which is most likely toaberrate the individual, to saddle him with strange practices and to make him chronically ill.Observe your pre-clear and see what he does and says that are strange to hispersonality, things he does but does not much seem to enjoy. See what he uses and what hismannerisms are. Amongst this collection you may, by asking discreet questions, jog an allyinto his memory which he had forgotten and so jogging, reach swiftly toward the sympathyengram in which that ally is contained or reach toward, for an emotional discharge, the painfulemotion engram of the loss of that ally, his illness or incidents concerning him.Another but special token is that which stems from a “die if you don’t” command.Fathers, for instance, suspicious of paternity, sometimes claim while trouncing or upsettingmothers that they will kill the child if it isn’t just like Father. This is a very unhappy type oftoken to say nothing of being, usually, a bad engram; it can go to the extent of remodelingstructure, of making noses long or hair absent; it may compel an aberree into a profession hedoes not admire and all out of the engramic command that he must be like the parent. As thistype of command is usually given before birth it is often addressed, unknowingly, to a girl,fathers not being gifted ordinarily with clairvoyance; in such a case it will bring about a mostremarkable structural change in a woman and form some unusual mannerisms, “ambitions”(like the dog that gets whipped if he doesn’t fetch the duck) and some habits which, to say theleast, are astonishing. Father, post-birth, to accomplish the reactivation of such an engram,must be quite ambivalent so that the friend-enemy compute comes into being. Not to be likefather is to die: to force father into his sympathy engram self the reactive mind must manifestthe token of illness. Token and likeness is the answer to such a computation. And recall, allsuch computations are not simple but are made further complex by the addition of dozens ofother engramic computations.The friend-enemy is rather easy to find as an enemy, not too hard to find as a friend.Standard technique with its repeater and return et al. would in themselves at last locate any222"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"engram and erase the bank so that it properly refiles. The use of the token facilitates theauditing.In the case of the pure ally, the champion of the right, standard technique also at lastarrives. But here how smooth the use of the token sometimes makes the road! For the tokenmay be as alarmingly strange as an elephant in a bird cage. It takes a real ally to keep some ofthese odd habits around.Measure the pre-clear against his environment and education and his society andprofession. See what doesn’t seem to belong amid the things he uses, the objects he adoresand the mannerisms his friends find so strange. Then find out if he or the spouse knew ofanyone who did those things or liked those things.Do not suppose from all this that our clear has jettisoned all strange mannerisms. Self-determinism is individuality in the extreme; personality is inherent and revealed by clearing,looms up high above the aberree. The engrams compress a man and make him small andafraid. Released his power comes into play. The sympathy engram is to a man like a crutchwhen he has two sturdy legs. But oh, the pre-clear sobs where he loses old Uncle Goston,whose habit of spitting on the floor, as transplanted, so astonished our pre-clear’s friends andbusiness associates. But the grief is brief, usually the half-hour it takes to run the sympathyengram out. Suddenly the pre-clear recalls Uncle Goston, recalls a thousand things UncleGoston and he used to do, for the engram had Uncle Goston occluded and amongst thosemissing from the sight of “I.” Although it might have said in the engram, “All right, there,there, there, Billy. I’ll take care of you. Don’t thrash around so. You’ll be all right.There, there, there. Poor little fellow. Poor little fellow. What a terrible rash you’vegot. How feverish. There, there, there, Billy. You’ll be all right as long as I am here. I’ll takecare of my Billy. Go to sleep now. Go to sleep and forget it.” And Billy was all the time“unconscious” and never “knew” about it. Afterwards he got a partner who looked like UncleGoston (but happened to be a fool), and when bankrupt somehow developed a rash and achronic cough and got very “feverish” about his business affairs. He took to spitting on thefloor no matter where he was; and his health got worse and he got worse: but if you had askedhim about any uncles before he went into therapy, he would have been very vague. “Give mea flash reply,” says the auditor. “Who used to spit on the floor? “Uncle Goston,” answers thepre-clear. “Gosh, that’s funny (hawk, spit), I hadn’t thought of him for years. He was neveraround much, though (not more than ten years constantly, the auditor may discover). Don’tsuppose he’s important. Let’s take up Mrs. Swishback, that teacher I had -- “ “Let’s returnnow to the time Uncle Goston helped you,” says the auditor, “The somatic strip will now goback to the time your Uncle Goston helped you.” “I feel like my skin’s on fire!” complains thepre-clear. “This must be -- hey, it’s my allergy! But I don’t see anybody. I don’t -- Wait, I getan impression of somebody. Somebody -- Why, it’s Uncle Goston!” And he runs it and therash goes away. But maybe the auditor had to get a hundred engrams before he got this one.And then the pre-clear suddenly remembers about him and Uncle Goston and the time -- but geton with therapy.Complete remembering seems to be a synonym for complete sanity. But don’t supposethat just because a clear gets rid of his Uncle Gostons and his habit of spitting on the floor thathe will not now indulge in any eccentricity. The difference is, he is not compelled intoeccentricity without his consent. Good Lord, what a cleared mind can think up to keep itselffrom being bored!WHAT TO DO IF A CASE STOPS PROGRESSINGEven in the easiest cases there will come times when progress seems to stop. Here is alist of possibilities of why:223"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"1. The pre-clear is not moving on the track despite appearances, but is being subject to oneof the five types of commands which can inhibit his free motion or information. Thecommonest of these is a holder and the pre-clear may be found to be in an engram andin a strange valence.2. There is an emotional or pain shut-off. These can always be detected even at thebeginning of a case. The patient’s muscles will tremble or twitch when he is in anengram but he will not feel the somatic: this is inevitably a pain shut-off. Out of therapythe patient may be very tense, his neck muscles in particular may be tight: this is oftenan emotional shut-off. Either of these conditions can be observed in many aberreesbefore beginning therapy. If they appear while therapy is in progress, look for pain oremotional shut-offs.3. There is an exaggerator of emotion and a pain shut-off so that the patient weeps overanything but wriggles and twists when asked to approach pain. He is feeling emotionwithout feeling the pain.4. There is an emotional charge in some area which has not been discharged but which isready to discharge. Or, conversely, if you have been trying to get an emotionaldischarge in a late painful emotion engram and have had no success, there is a feelingshut-off early in the prenatal area.5. The Auditor’s Code has been broken. Change auditors or reduce the moments when thecode was broken.6. There is an emotional upset in the patient’s life current with therapy. Question himclosely and remove the charge, if possible, of the emotional upset as an engram.7. The auditor has missed an important point in this book. Study it.IF A CASE “REFUSES” TO GET WELLIt has long been a popular idea, if an erroneous fact, that people desire to retain theirneuroses. In any case which “resists” therapy, you may be certain that the engrams areresisting, not the patient; do not, therefore, attack the patient but the engrams.There are many computations which give the appearance of resistance. The commonestof these is the ally computation, which derives from engrams containing allies who seem toplead that the patient is not to rid himself of anything. An ordinary situation is one in whichsome relative or friend of the mother’s is advising the mother against aborting the child. Theally is pleading, “Do not get rid of it!” The pre-clear knows this person to be a friend of his ofthe highest order. The pre-clear may interpret this to mean that he is not to get rid of hisengrams.Another computation is the stupidity computation, wherein the pre-clear begins tobelieve he will be stupid or lacking a mind if he gives up engrams. This stems, for example,from the mother saying she will lose her mind if she loses the child: she calls the child “it.” Awhole chain of these may appear in a case, giving the pre-clear the idea that if he parts with anyengrams, he will lose his mind. This is the primary reason why past schools believed that themind was composed of neuroses instead of an inherent personality. The engrams, even thoughunknown, appeared very valuable, which they are not -- none of them.Yet another computation is one of secrecy. It seems to the pre-clear that his life dependsupon holding some secret. This is common in a case where the mother has had a lover. Motherand the lover both enjoin secrecy. The pre-clear, obeying engramic commands, believes thathe has much to lose if he tells this secret even though those who enjoined it were not evenaware that he was present, or if they knew, that he was “listening.” One secrecy computation224"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"stems from the mother’s fearing to tell the father that she is pregnant: if the mother is an ally ofthe child, then the child will be extremely tenacious of this type of engram.All cases have one or more computations which inhibit a delivery of engrams. Somehave all the above and more. This is no great worry to the auditor for, by repeater technique,he can open the engram bank.DRUGSThe so-called hypnotics have no great use in dianetics except, on occasion, when apatient is psychotic and narco-synthesis is employed. By hypnotic is meant such preparationsas phenobarbital, hyacine, opium and so on. These sleep-producing drugs are undesirable saveonly as a sedative and would be administered as sedatives by a medical doctor. Any patientwho needs a sedative already has a medical doctor whose business it is. The auditor shouldnot, then, concern himself with hypnotics or anything producing sleep. Some pre-clears willbeg to be given sleeping drugs to “facilitate therapy” but any such drug is an anesthetic andshuts down somatics, inhibiting therapy. Further, none but the insane should be worked inamnesia trance, particularly a drug trance, for the work is longer than necessary and the resultsslow, as elsewhere explained. Dianetics wakes people up; it does not try to drug them orhypnotize them. Hence, the hypnotic drug is worthless to the auditor.Patients who wish to be knocked over the head with lead pipes or otherwise put into adeep trance should not be allowed to have their way even when they humorously present theirown lead pipes.The trick is to put “I” in contact with the file clerk. All hypnotics work to shut-down“I.” While the file clerk can be reached and sonic and visio are available and even while, withmuch labor, a clearing can be so effected, even the most “hopeless” case is better worked incontact; the work is faster, more satisfactory and less troublesome.When one discovers the science of mind, he inevitably discovers numerous other thingsnot properly in his province. Amongst these is the confusion which has unwittingly existedabout hypnotics. Those things labeled “hypnotics” as named above are not hypnotics at all butanesthetics. And those things labeled anesthetics are not anesthetics but hypnotics. This willbecome brilliantly clear to the auditor when he finds himself tangling with his first “anesthetic”nitrous oxide engram in some pre-clear. Perhaps there will have been another engram whereinmorphine was administered for days and even weeks, leaving the patient in a stupor which, bythe definition “hypnotic” should have been a trance: the aberrative material will be there but itwill be found to be slight -- compared to a chloroform or nitrous oxide engram.Ether, chloroform and nitrous oxide, the “anesthetics,” place the patient in a deephypnotic trance: the reactive bank is wide open and all reception is sharp, clear and aberrative inthe extreme. Of the three, nitrous oxide is easily the worst, being no anesthetic which woulddull pain at all but a first class hypnotic. In nitrous oxide the pain is filed and the content is filedwith high and brilliant fidelity. Some years ago some investigator wondered if nitrous oxidedid not make the brain decay. Fortunately brains do not decay that easily; but nitrous oxidedoes bring into being particularly severe engrams. The serious late-life engrams which theauditor will encounter may include, at the list’s top, a nitrous oxide dental or surgical orobstetrical engram. Nitrous oxide engrams are particularly bad when they involve exodontistry;they often form the most severe late-life engram. Aside from the fact that all exodontists have inthe past talked too much and have offices which are far too noisy with street sounds, runningwater and flapping drill belts, nitrous oxide is not at all anesthetic and sharpens rather thandulls pain.In reverse, nitrous oxide makes an excellent hypnotic for institutional therapy. It is farfrom the best obtainable from the chemists, that is certain, for some brilliant chemist will225"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"certainly be able to bring out a good gas hypnotic now that dianetics is known and the need ofit in institutions is realized.There are some drugs which assist reverie, however. The commonest and most easilyobtainable is plain, strong coffee. A cup or two of this occasionally alerts the analyzer enoughso that it can reach through deeper layers of “unconsciousness.” Benzedrine and othercommercial stimulants have been used with some success, particularly on psychotic patients.These bring the mind enough awake to permit it to overcome engramic commands. Suchcommercial stimulants have the disadvantage of exhausting a Q quantity in the mind.This Q Quantity has not been much studied. It is as though the brain burns a certainamount of Q when it is exhausting engrams. For instance, therapy every day may bring resultsmore rapidly but it will also bring some stale sessions. Therapy every two or three daysproduces the best results as observed. (Therapy once a week permits the engrams to sag andslows a case, one week being too long.) Benzedrine burns up Q. After a few sessions withbenzedrine the current stock of Q is exhausted and the work has been observed to deteriorateeither until a higher dosage was administered -- and there is a close limit to that -- or until moreQ was manufactured.Here, with all this, must be included an important and vital fact. It should be on a pageby itself and underscored. All patients in therapy should be given a dosage of vitamin B1 orallyor by injection at the minimum of 10 mg. per day. Reducing engrams exhausts Q which seemsto depend in some measure on B1. You can be absolutely certain of nightmares in a patientwho is not taking his B1. Taking liberal doses of that, he will have no nightmares. DT’s areprobably caused by a similar exhaustion of Q Quantity. DT’s are best treated by B1 anddianetics. Something like DT’s on a very minor scale have been observed to develop inoccasional patients who were negligent about their B1. With it, in therapy, they thrive.Alcohol is rarely an assist to the auditor. In fact, alcohol is rarely an assist to anyone. Adepressant, classifiable at best as a poison, alcohol has the single virtue of being highlytaxable. All alcoholics are alcoholic because of their engrams. All alcoholics, unless they haveinjured their brains -- which case is cited only because it is possible, not because research indianetics demonstrated any real evidence of it -- can be released. Alcoholism is engramic. It hasbecome, in some very understandable way, a class of contagious aberration whereby thereactive mind confuses alcohol and “being a good sport” or “having fun” or “forget yourtroubles.” Some of these things can also be obtained by strychnine and cyanide. Alcohol hasits uses: one can put specimens of frogs and such in it: one can clean the germs off needleswith it: it burns well in rockets. But one would not consider preserving his stomach in a glassjar and, unless insane, does not think of himself as a needle. While some drunks think they actlike rockets, few have been observed to reach an altitude of more than the floor. It is not only apoor stimulant-depressant, it is also an hypnotic in the finest sense: what is done to a drunkbecomes an engram. The chronic alcoholic is physically and mentally ill. Dianetics can clearhim or even merely release him without too much trouble for alcohol is apparently notphysiological in its addictive effect. With the whole range of chemistry to choose stimulantsand depressants from, why the government chooses a superiorly aberrative and inferiorlystimulative compound to legalize is a problem for the better mathematicians, possibly thesewho deal exclusively in tax income problems. Opium is less harmful, marijuana is not only lessphysically harmful but also better in the action of keeping a neurotic producing, phenobarbitaldoes not dull the senses nearly as much and produces less after effect, ammonium chloride anda host of other stimulants are more productive of results and hardly less severe on the anatomy:but no, the engrams, contaging unpleasantly along from the first crude brew which made oneof our ancestors drunk, decree that alcohol is the only thing which is to be drunk if a personwants to “forget it all” and “have a good time.” There is really nothing wrong with alcohol savethat it depends mainly on engrams and other advertising for its effect and is otherwiseremarkably inferior in performance: that it makes such aberrative engrams is probably its mainclaim to fame and infame. Making one drug immoral and another one taxable is a sample of thealcohol engram in society. However, although it is immensely legal, it is doubtful if the auditorwill find any use for it in therapy.226"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"And speaking of drugs, that three thousand cycle note in your ears came either from anitrous oxide engram or mother taking lots of quinine before you were born in the hope thatshe would not be a mother, saying the while, “It makes my ears ring so: it just keeps on and onand on and will not stop!”AUTO-CONTROLSince the beginning of dianetics research eleven years ago, patients have, in themajority, had some belief that they could run their cases in auto-control.Not understanding that an auditor is only interested in what has been done to, not doneby a patient, some shyness or imagined guilt often prompts this vain hope that one canaccomplish therapy alone.It cannot be done. That is a flat statement and it is a scientific fact. The auditor isnecessary for a large number of reasons. He is not there to control or order the pre-clear about,but he is there to listen, to provide insistence, to compute the trouble the pre-clear is having andremedy it. The work is done on these equations:The dynamics of the pre-clear are less than the force in his reactive bank.The dynamics of the pre-clear plus the dynamics of the auditor are greater than the forcein the pre-clear’s reactive bank.The analytical mind of the pre-clear is shut down whenever he reaches an engram andhe is then unable to pursue it and recount it enough times to discharge it without auditorassistance.The analytical mind of the pre-clear plus the analytical mind of the auditor can discoverengrams and recount them.(There is another equation, not elsewhere mentioned, but germane to the auditor’scode, which demonstrates mathematically the necessity of that code:The force of the pre-clear’s engram bank plus the force of the auditor’s analytical mindis greater than the analytical mind and the dynamics of the pre-clear. This explains thenecessity of never attacking the pre-clear personally. It also explains the behavior of the aberreeunder attack in usual life and why he grows angry and apathetic, for this equation overwhelmshis analyzer.)These equations demonstrate actual natural laws.Auto-control finds the pre-clear attempting to attack something which has never beenovercome by his analyzer although his analyzer has never been trying, interiorly, to doanything else but attack that bank so long as the analyzer would operate. The fact that the pre-clear’s analyzer shuts down whenever he comes into an area of “unconsciousness” was whythe engrams could take him over and use him as a puppet when they were restimulated -- theysimply shut down the analyzer.Many efforts by many patients have been made to put dianetics on an auto-control level.They have all failed and thus far it is believed to be utterly and completely impossible. The pre-clear in auto-control reverie may be able to reach some locks: he can certainly reach pleasantexperiences and achieve data recall by return: but he cannot attack his own engrams without astandard auditor-pre-clear arrangement.Aside from dianetic reverie, some pre-clears have been foolish enough to attempt auto-hypnosis and thus reach their engrams. Hypnotism in any form is unwarranted in dianetics.227"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Auto-hypnosis used in dianetics is probably as close to fruitless masochism as one can get. If apatient places himself in auto-hypnosis and regresses himself in an effort to reach illness orbirth or prenatals, the only thing he will get is ill. Of course, people will try. None are everconvinced until they have tried once they begin to agitate about auto-control. But be sure tohave a friend and this book handy so that he can audit away the headaches and such thatsuddenly turn on.Dianetic reverie, which means with an auditor present, is not dangerous or severe.Auto-control is often very uncomfortable and often fruitless. It should not be attempted.The clear alone can auto-control his whole time track back to conception and does whenhe wants specific data from anywhere in his life. But he is clear.ORGANIC MENTAL ALTERATIONSThere are several things which can happen to the nervous system including the brainwhich can cause structural change. These are called in dianetics, organic mental alterations.They are not called “organic neuroses,” or “organic psychoses” because the alteration ofstructure does not necessarily produce aberrations. There has been a confusion in the pastbetween behavior caused by organic differences and behavior caused by engrams: thisconfusion came about because the engram bank and the reactive mind were not known.Any human being with an organic mental alteration also has engrams. The behaviordictated by the engrams and the action caused by alteration are different things. Engrams carrydramatizations, delusions, tantrums and various inefficiencies with them. Alterations establishinabilities to think or perceive or record or recall. For instance the radio set may have newfilters and circuits added to it which change and vary its performance and reduce it fromoptimum; these would be engrams: the radio set might have original tubes or circuits deletedfrom it or it might have some of the wires crossed; this would be organic mental alteration.The sources of organic mental alteration are as follows:1. Variation of the blueprint of structure by reason of a changed gene pattern. Some partsof the body would grow too much or too little to establish any alteration of structure.This is usually so gross a change that it is obvious. The feeble-minded and so on maysuffer either from engrams or an altered blueprint, but usually both.2. Alteration of the nervous system by disease or growths which divides into two classes:(a) Disease destruction as in paresis. (b) Additional construction as in the case oftumors.3. Alteration of the nervous system by drugs or poisons.4. Alteration by physical disorder as in the case of a “paralytic stroke” wherein certaintissues are inhibited or destroyed.5. Physical change in structure due to injury as in the case of a head wound.6. Alteration of structure by surgery as a necessity to remedy injury or disease.7. Iatrogenic alterations (caused by doctors) undertaken under a misapprehension of brainfunction. These can be divided into two classes: (a) Surgical, to include such things asthe trans-orbital leukotomy, pre-frontal lobotomy, topectomy and so forth. (b) Shock“therapies” of all kinds including electric shock, insulin shock, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.etc.etc.228"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"The first six sources of organic mental alteration are much less common than has beensupposed. The body is an extremely hardy mechanism and its repair facilities are enormous. Ifan individual can be made to speak or follow orders at all, it is conceivable that the techniquesof dianetics can be applied to reduce the engrams in the engram bank, bringing aboutconsiderable improvement in the condition and mental ability of the individual. When thesevarious sources are so severe that they inhibit any use of therapy, and when it is certain that norecourse to therapy is possible and that it is utterly impossible to reach the engram bank bystandard technique, hypnotism or drugs, such cases can be considered beyond help ofdianetics.Category 7 presents another problem. Here we have selective experimentation at workand it would be flatly impossible to conceive, without months of study of their experimentalsubjects, how many brands and varieties of operation have been performed and how many oddand bizarre shocks have been used.All iatrogenic alterations of the nervous system can be considered under the heading of“reduced ability,” in other words, inability. In each case something has been done to reduce theability of the individual to perceive, record, recall or think. Any of these complicate a case fordianetics, but they do not inevitably bar dianetics from working.In shock cases, such as electric shock, tissue may have been destroyed and the memorybanks may in some way have been scrambled, the time track may be altered and otherconditions may exist.In all such iatrogenic alterations, the results of dianetics must be considered equivocal.BUT IN ALL SUCH CASES, PARTICULARLY THOSE OF ELECTRIC SHOCK,DIANETICS SHOULD BE USED IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY IN AN EFFORT TOIMPROVE THE PATIENT.All shocks and operations should be picked up for what they are -- engrams.NO PERSON WHO CAN PERFORM ROUTINE TASKS OR WHOSE ATTENTIONCAN BE ATTRACTED AND FIXED SHOULD FEEL DESPAIR OR BE CONSIDEREDHOPELESS.Any person who has been subjected to such treatment may not be able to reachoptimum mental efficiency but he may be able to reach a level of rationality even yet in excessof the current normal. The thing to do is try. In spite of what has happened or what has beendone, in the large majority of cases there may be a chance of excellent recovery.ORGANIC DERANGEMENTA standard class of prenatal engrams has as its content the worry of the parents that thechild will be feeble-minded if not now aborted in earnest. This adds an emotional overload tosuch engrams and it adds, as importantly, an aberrative condition in the now grown patient thathe is “not right,” “all wrong,” “feeble-minded,” and so forth. The difficulty of aborting thechild is nearly always underestimated: the means used are often novel or bizarre: the worrybecause the child has not come out of the womb after the abortion attempt is acute, and theconcern that he is now damaged beyond repair all combine to make severely aberrative engramsand, because of their content, engrams which are difficult to reach.The aberrative quality of the “feeble-minded” species of remark is of course, high. Theworry that the child may be born blind or deaf or otherwise incapacitated is common. Theformer class of engramic remarks can bring about actual feeble-mindedness; the latter concernover blindness and so on bring about, at best, impaired visio and sonic recall.229"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"The shut-off of the recalls is occasioned as well by an engramic belief in the society atlarge that the unborn child is blind, unfeeling and not alive. This belief is introduced into AA(attempted abortion) engrams by people’s self-justification remarks while attempting anabortion: “Well, he can’t see, feel or hear anyway.” Or, “It doesn’t know what’s going on. It’sblind, deaf and dumb. It’s a sort of growth. It isn’t human.”The greater part of all sonic and visio recall shut-off has as its source the remarks madeat such times or by painful emotion and other engramic data. Hundreds of hours of therapymay pass before these recalls turn on.The bulk of all shut-offs will turn on in the course of therapy. There are thousands ofengramic remarks and emotional situations which will deny the pre-clear his recall and thatrecall can be expected ordinarily to restore.A very low dynamic patient (for people have various native strengths of the dynamic)may have recalls shut-off rather easily. A high dynamic patient would require much moreaberration before the recalls are closed down.These recalls can be turned on simply by running out the physically painful and painfulemotion engrams.It must not pass unremarked, however, that the abortion attempts actually can, if rarely,derange the brain and nervous mechanisms beyond the foetal ability to repair. The result of thisis actual, physiological disability.Children and adults now classified as feeble-minded may then be separated into twogroups: the actual, physiological class and the aberrated class. Further, recall shut-offs must beclassified into two classes as well, regardless of the dynamic and intelligence of the individual:those occasioned by brain damage received during an attempted abortion and those which aresolely aberrational and derived from engramic commands and emotion.The ability of the foetus to repair damage is phenomenal. Brain damage can ordinarilybe repaired perfectly regardless of how many foreign substances were introduced into it. Justbecause the brain was touched in an attempted abortion is no reason to suppose that the recallshut-off has this as a source, for this is the rarer of the two causes.It is understood that this is being read by many with recall shut-offs and it isunderstood that it may well produce a considerable upset. But remember this, sonic and visiorecall are not vital to a nearly full release. This comment about organic damage does not meanthat a release cannot be effected which will leave the person more competent and happier, forthis can always be done regardless of the recalls. And remember this, recalls almost alwaysturn on even if it takes five hundred hours or more. This condition is only remarked because itwill be found in some few cases.The “tests” and “experiments” with human brain vivisection in institutions are not,unfortunately, valid. For all the pain and trouble and destruction caused by these“experiments,” they were done without a proper knowledge of aberration and mentalderangement. None of such data is of any value beyond showing that the brain can be cut invarious ways without entirely killing the man. For the patients used responded both toengramic disorder and the physical disorder caused by the psychiatrist, and there is no way todifferentiate between these after the operation except by dianetics. Conclusions drawn from thisdata are then invalid conclusions, for the response of the patient after the operation might havestemmed from a number of sources: engramic, the engram of the operation itself, attemptedabortion damage early in life, brain disability on account of the operation and so forth. Hence,draw no conclusions that impairment of conceptual thinking, for instance, results only when apart of the brain is removed, that recall is shut off only when the brain is vivisected and so on.From a scientific standpoint no such “findings” were conclusive of anything except that thebrain can be damaged late in life without entirely killing a man and that surgery of any kindoften brings about a mental change in the patient. True, it may have been discovered that this230"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"or that portion of the switchboard called the brain, when removed, removed also some abilityto perform.DIANETIC FIRST AIDIt will be of interest to those associated with emergency hospital work particularly thatthe healing and recovery of any patient can be enormously benefited and the term of illnessshortened by removing the engram occasioned at the moment of injury.The accident case sometimes dies, in a few days, from shock, or does not recover andwill not heal swiftly. In any injury -- a burn, cut, a bruise of whatever kind -- a trauma lingersin the injured area. The moment of the injury created an engram. This engram inhibits therelease of the trauma. The fact that the injured part still hurts is an organic restimulator whichdepresses the ability of the patient to recover.Using reverie or merely working the patient with his eyes closed, and working thepatient as soon after the injury as possible, the doctor, nurse or relative can return the injuredperson to the moment when the injury was received and usually recover and exhaust theincident as a usual engram. Once the engram of the injury is reduced, the general mental tone ofthe patient improves. Further, the injured area is no longer inhibited from healing.Some experimental work on this demonstrated that some burns would heal anddisappear in a few hours when the engram which accompanied their reception was removed.On more serious injuries tests showed definite and unmistakable acceleration of the rate ofhealing.In operations, when anesthetics have been used, dianetics is useful in two ways: (1) asa preventive measure and (2) as a recovery measure. In the first, no conversation of any kindshould be held around or with the “unconscious” or semi-conscious patient. In the second, thetrauma of the operation itself should be recovered and relieved immediately afterwards.A PROBLEM IN MUTUAL THERAPYR and his wife C cleared each other in eight months with dianetics, working four hoursa night four nights a week, each of them auditing the other for two hours of the four. Thismutual arrangement had been complicated by the fact that whereas R was very eager to becleared, his wife was quite apathetic about the work: he had managed only after muchpersuasion to get the cases started.He was a high dynamic case with much emotion encysted; she was an apathy case whoentirely neglected her troubles (black panther mechanism). He was troubled with a chroniculcer and anxieties about his job; she was troubled with a general allergic condition and achronic carelessness in domestic affairs. They were not to any great degree mutuallyrestimulative, but they had problems about tacit consent, avoiding the subjects which had mostupset them while together, such as a miscarriage she had had and the loss of their home by firemany years before, as well as other shocks. Further they were faced by R’s intensity on theone hand and his introversion, which caused him to slight her therapy, and C’s apathy on theother hand, which at once aided R’s effort to take more time as the pre-clear than she andwhich made her less interested in being a good auditor.Further complication took place because C did not understand the auditor’s code or itsuse and on several occasions had become angry and impatient with R when he was in sessionand returned, an attitude which tended to force R into an anger valence.Along this uncertain course therapy had been continuing. R was then informed of tacitconsent and told he had better release some of their mutual painful emotion. He thereafter231"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"addressed the engram of the burning home and suddenly found himself able to audit some earlysympathy engrams of his wife’s which had not heretofore been available. It was discoveredthat her allergies stemmed from a father sympathy compute and that R was the pseudo-father.This resulted in a marked improvement in C’s case. She began to suffer less from her allergiesand a chronic heart pain she had had so long that she no longer heeded it vanished as well. Shebecame interested in being a good auditor and studied the subject. She became slightly annoyedwith R when he demanded more than his share of therapy time. (This increase of interest isalways true of any apathy case which began with neglect of engrams.)R, however, was much inhibited by her periods of anger and found that he nowoperated almost exclusively under auto-control, a condition wherein he decided what should berun and what should not be run in himself. This auto-control is, of course, useless, since if heknew about his aberrations and the data in his engrams, they would not be engrams. He,therefore, started on a period of refusing to display any emotion since she had mocked himabout it, would not follow her directions and was, in short, obeying the engrams which shehad given him when angry with him during past sessions. C was advised to pick up themoments of anger she had displayed as an auditor during therapy and when these werereduced, it was found that R worked well again and cooperated.His ulcer stemmed from an attempted abortion. His father, an extremely aberratedindividual, had sought to abort the baby when it was seven months in the womb. The motherremonstrated that the baby might be born alive. The father said that if it were alive when bornhe would kill it as soon as it came out. He had said, further, that the mother had to hold stillwhile he operated. On another occasion the father had said that he would lock the mother in acloset until she decided to abort the child. (This case was much complicated because the motherhad been afraid to tell the father and had pretended not to be pregnant for three months, givingthe husband the belief that the child, seven months along, was actually only four months along.Therefore, there was much secrecy in the case, much confusion and conflicting data.) Thismeant that R had a severe holder in the prenatal area: he was held by the engram whichincluded a penetration of his stomach. This was the key engram, which is to say otherengrams, by the mechanism of similar somatic and content, had gathered around it to suppressit. This was the tangle of incidents which C was confronting unknowingly: it had become moretangled by her anger. R would now cooperate but his time track had wound into a ball aroundthe holder engram, the key. Two exodontistries for the removal of wisdom teeth with nitrousoxide anesthesia were also suppressing the prenatals.C worked for some time trying to get at the late extraction engrams, which contained anenormous amount of conversation between the dentist and his assistants and R’s mother, who,unfortunately for his sanity, had accompanied him to the dentist’s office.R was made intensely uncomfortable by the continual restimulation of engrams whichyet could not be reached. He was no more uncomfortable than he had often been in the pastand his discomfort would have been absent had C understood and followed the auditor’s code.The case made no progress for several weeks.C’s therapy was progressing. It was intensely restimulative to R to work upon her andincrease his discomfort, but the more he worked on her the better auditing she did and the moreintelligent she was (her I.Q. went up about fifty points after five weeks of therapy). C desiredto know how she could break the impasses in his case and was informed that she was nowpracticing tacit consent, for she had many times been needlessly thoughtless of R long beforetherapy was undertaken and she now realized what she had done to him and yet could not bringherself to face the fact that she was a responsible party to so much of his unhappiness -- shehad quite ordinarily used angry language to him which she well knew would “push-button”him into doing something or into retreating from a quarrel, which language had beenrestimulative to him long before therapy.C thereupon entered into painful emotion engrams late in R’s life and, by working earlyphysically painful engrams which said R could “feel nothing” alternately with late engrams232"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"when he was feeling intensely on an emotional plane but could not exhibit it, began to releasethe emotion in the case. R then showed steady improvement. Late painful emotion was releasedand early prenatals would show to be reduced, at which more late emotion would be visible forreduction.It was suddenly disclosed in the case that the reason R was so easily upset by C lay inthe person of a nurse who had attended R during his tonsillectomy when he was five years ofage. C had some similarity of mannerism to this nurse. This was a sympathy engram, andwhen it was released the time track began to straighten out and the abortion engrams could bemore easily contacted.It so happened that R had been well off his time track most of his life, his memoryoccluded, his recall in poor condition. This was found to lie in the hidden key engram, theabortion attempt wherein his father had vowed to kill him if he came out and had added that thechild could not see, feel or hear anything anyway, engramic material which was demonstratedby R’s inability to move on his time track.The moment the key was found -- two hundred and eighty hours of therapy had elapsed-- R came back on the time track, could move on it, and the erasure of his engrams proceededin an orderly fashion.C had been cleared about two months before R reached the final engram. C’s allergies,however, disappeared long before her case was cleared completely and R’s ulcer and someother psycho-somatic difficulties also vanished well before his case was finally cleared.A PROBLEM IN A RESTIMULATED CASEG was cleared in ten months of sporadic sessions. His case had the initial diagnosis ofnon-sonic, non-visio, pain and emotional shut-off, permanent light trance, permanent“regression” at the age of three years. This is to say that the instant he went into reverie he wasstartled and frightened to find himself in a dental chair, three years old, and having a toothpulled, an engram in which he had been situated, unknowingly, about half of his ensuing life.It had been the partial cause of his chronic tooth decay and his inability to sleep as negationagainst the anesthetic. The situation was obvious since he immediately began to wrestle aboutand lisp, which condition was instantly remedied by running the engram so that he could cometo present time, which he did.He had had considerable difficulty in life, was a high dynamic but manifested apathy. Itwas discovered after seventy-five hours, at which time release took place, that his wife wassometimes his pseudo-grandmother and also, by ambivalence, was his pseudo-mother. As hissympathy computation demanded that he be ill so that his grandmother would stay with himand as his contra-survival engrams demanded that his mother was only nice to him when hewas ill, the reactive computation added up to the fact that he must be ill continually, whichdemand had been obeyed by his body for twenty-three years. All this was recovered andremedied, of course, only by reducing engrams.The erasure began to take place at the end of about two hundred hours of therapy andwas proceeding when the case suddenly stopped all progress. For fifty or more hours oftherapy, few engrams could be located, those which were located could not be reduced, nopainful emotion could be reached and whatever engrams were reached and reduced werelocated and treated only because the auditor in this case used highly skilled forcing techniqueswhich are almost never necessary and should not be employed save in psychotic cases. Suchendeavor had not been necessary at the beginning of the case. Something was obviouslywrong.On close questioning it was discovered that G’s wife was violently opposed todianetics, that she never lost any chance of leveling the most scathing attacks against it to G and233"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"particularly when he was in the company of friends. She derided him as being psychotic. Shesought a lawyer to give her a divorce (announcing it after he had entered therapy but actuallyhaving had continual consultation on it with a lawyer for two years past) and generally agitatedand disturbed G to such an extent that he was continually receiving painful emotional engramseven though he did not display any emotion against her.They had a child, nine years of age, a boy. G was very fond of the boy. The child hadhad an unusual number of childhood illnesses and suffered from eye trouble and chronicsinusitis; he was backward in school. The wife was somewhat sharp with the child. Anythinghe did made her nervous.The auditor in the case, on learning the facts about her attitude toward her husband ingeneral and dianetics in particular, held a conference with her about her husband. She wasfound to be unopposed to therapy for herself. Shortly after the conference, G and this womanhad a brief quarrel in which G made the remark that she must be aberrated. She took intenseaffront at this and said that he must be the one who was crazy since he was interested indianetics. He countered with the fact that of the two he must be the least aberrated since he wastaking steps to do something about it. Further, he pointed out that she must be aberrated or shewould not be as quarrelsome with the child as she was, a fact which definitely indictated thatshe must have a block on her second dynamic, sex.The following day he came home from work and found she had withdrawn the moneyfrom the bank and gone to another town, taking the boy with her. He followed and found herstaying with some of her relatives. She had told them that he beat her and had gone so crazythat he had to have therapy. The truth of the matter was that he had never touched her brutallyin his life. In this meeting, before witnesses, she began to rave and revile any “system ofpsychiatry” which believed in pre-speech memory. He pointed out to her that many schools ofthe past had believed in pre-speech memory, that the whole background of psychiatry had longtalked about “memories of the womb” without knowing what they were, and so forth.Her relatives, seeing him so calm about it, forced her to return home with him. En routeshe made a dramatic gesture, although in no way threatened, of committing suicide by leapingout of the car.The auditor in the case had a private conversation with her on her return. He hadsomewhat belatedly deduced the fact that there was something in her life which she was afraidher husband would find out and that, confronted with a science which could recover allmemory, she had become wildly emotional about it. She at length admitted under closequestioning, that this was the case, that her husband must never know. She was so disturbedthat the auditor, with her consent, gave her a few hours of therapy. It was instantly discoveredthat her father had many times threatened to kill her mother and that her father had not wantedher. Further, it was found that her father’s name was Q and that her engram bank was strewnwith remarks such as “Q, please don’t leave me. I will die without you.” Additionally, whenshe was no longer in session, she suddenly volunteered what was to her a hystericallyhumorous fact that all her life she had been having affairs with men named Q no matter whattheir shape or size or age. This was far from a release but in view of the fact that his otherpatient, G, was jeopardized by all this unnecessary hubbub and that therapy was being stalled,the auditor further questioned her. She divulged that she had tried many times to abort their sonbecause she was terribly frightened that he would be a blond whereas she and her husband haddark hair. Further, the engrams of that child, she knew, contained data which she consideredincriminating beyond mere abortion; while pregnant she had had intercourse with three menother than her husband.The auditor pointed out to her that this guilt feeling, no matter how real, was stillengramic in her and that it was doubtful if her husband would kill her on receipt of thesetidings. He told her that she was condemning a child to a second-rate existence and that shewas reducing her husband to apathy by her fears and causing the auditor far more work thanwas necessary. In her husband’s and the auditor’s presence she confessed her infidelity and234"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"learned with some amazement that her husband had known about it for years. He had notknown about her attempts on their child.She was requested to study a therapy manual and clear the child which, with herhusband’s help, she did. The auditor continued G on to clear, who then cleared his wife.ADVICE TO THE AUDITORThe hidden source of human aberration was hidden for a number of very specificreasons. The auditor will encounter all of these and although with these techniques, the abilityof the reactive engram bank to deny him is precisely nil, he should know the nature of the beasthe has under attack.The mechanisms of protection which the engram bank had -- although they are not verygood now that we know how to penetrate this armor of insanity’s cause -- are as follows:1. Physical pain.2. Emotion in terms of captured units.3. “Unconsciousness.”4. The delayed character of the key-in.5. Delay between restimulation and illness.6. Utter irrationality.Of the physical pain we know much -- that the mind, in memory, sought to avoid it justas the mind in life seeks to avoid it as an outside source: hence, memory blockage.Emotion of loss piles up to make a buffer between the individual and the reality ofdeath.“Unconsciousness” is not only a mechanism of hiding data, it is also a block tomemory which cannot jump the gaps of past moments when the fuses were blown.An engram might slumber for the better part of a lifetime and then, given the correct setof restimulators in the right moment of physical weariness or illness, manifest itself, making anapparent cause of insanity or lesser aberration many years after the actual incident had takenplace.Another aspect of the bank protective mechanism was the restimulator lag, which is tosay that when a keyed-in engram was restimulated it often required two or three days for actionto take place. (Example: say a migraine headache has as its restimulator a rhythmic bumpingsound; that sound is heard by the individual who has the engram; three days later he suddenlyhas a migraine.) Given this lag, how could one locate the cause of a specific restimulation of asporadic illness?The utter irrationality of an engram, the ultimate in irrationality, that everything equalseverything else in the engram and that these are equal to things in the exterior environmentwhich are only vaguely similar is a feat of idiocy which any sentient man might be expected tooverlook as a “thought process.”Man has been looking for this source for some thousands of years; but he was lookingfor something which was complicated on the grounds that anything which could be so235"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"harrowing, so destructive, so vicious and so capable of producing complex manifestationsmust therefore have a complex source; on examination it is remarkably simple.The auditor will have very little to do with trying to draw a line between sanity andinsanity, they are such relative terms. He will be asked to compare dianetics with old standardssuch as the complex classifications of Kraepelin: it can be done but it has the usefulness ofAristotelian natural history, of interest only to the historian.If an individual is incapable of adjusting himself to his environment so as to get alongwith or obey or command his fellows, or, more importantly, if he is incapable of adjusting hisenvironment, then he can be considered to be “insane.” But it is a relative term. Sanity, on theother hand, closely approaches, with dianetics, a potential absolute meaning for we know theoptimum mind. Modifications of education and viewpoint may make the rational action of oneperson appear irrational to another but this is not a problem of sanity, it is a problem ofviewpoint and education, with which the auditor will have but small concern.Thus the patients the auditor will encounter will fall into the three general dianeticclasses of non-sonic recall, imaginary recall and sonic recall. The question of sanity does notarise: the question of how difficult or how long the case may be is fairly well determined by thedegree of these three conditions.However, the auditor will find that he may have in his hands a truly “insane” case, onewhich is “psychotic.” The treatment of such a case depends on which of the three above classesthe psychotic patient may be entered. The problem is to de-intensify the engrams of the patientas swiftly as possible.The conditions and mechanisms which hide the engram bank do not vary: they areuniformly present in every patient, in every human being. The techniques of dianetics may beimproved upon -- and what scientific technique, particularly in its first few years of existencecannot be -- but they also do not perform selectively but are applicable to all individuals.Hence, if we have an “insane” patient, the fundamental problem does not change anddianetic technique works as in any other case. The task is to reduce the intensity of charge inthe case so that it can be resolved by standard technique.Insane patients are often found stuck on the time track, in which case a holder is fed tothem, one kind after another, until they are moving again. If the patient is regressed, he hasbecome so thoroughly stuck that he has lost touch with the present time. Any patient can beginto relive instead of merely return and the auditor, as the remedy for this, merely snaps at themthat they can remember this, which places them in a returned status again. Insane patients areoften found listening to one engram over and over, in which case it is again only necessary tofix attention and feed them holders until they are once more moving on the track. Insanepatients are sometimes discovered completely off the time track, listening to demons or seeingillusion. The problems are always the same; use repeater technique when, by one means oranother, their attention has been fixed and then either get them moving on the track or get themback on the time track. The schizophrenic is usually a long way off his time track.The best way to de-intensify a case so that it can be entered in routine therapy is todiscover and discharge painful emotion engrams. If ordinary means fail, get the help of amedical doctor, place the patient under nitrous oxide or sodium pentothal and reach a deep levelof trance where the patient will be found, ordinarily, to be capable of moving on his track eventhough he was off his track when awake. Find a late despair engram and discharge it asdescribed in the chapter on emotion. The technique for deep trance is no different except thatvery cautious safeguards must be taken to say nothing which will aberrate the patient furtherbut to limit all conversation to therapy patter, being very careful to include the canceller.The insane patient is obeying some engramic command, perhaps many, no matter whathe is doing. That command may dictate, by the patient’s misinterpretation, some strange action;236"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"it may dictate demons; it may dictate anything. But diagnosis merely consists of observing thepatient in order to discover, by his actions, what the engramic command might be.This volume does not cover Institutional Dianetics beyond these few remarks, but anauditor who knows the fundamentals in this volume and with any understanding can bringabout a “sanity” in patients in a short time which the boards of these institutions normallyconsider a miraculous recovery. The patient, however, is very far from a release, and manymore hours should be spent in discharging further painful emotion and reducing engramsbefore an auditor should consider it safe to permit him to leave therapy.The auditor should be extremely cautious, at least for the next twenty years, about anycase which has been institutionalized, for he may be getting a case with iatrogenic psychosis --caused by doctors -- in addition to the patient’s other engrams. Dianetics may help a mind alittle in which the brain has been “ice-picked” or “apple-cored,” but it cannot cure such insanityuntil some clever biologist finds a way to grow a new brain. Electric shock cases are equivocal:they may or may not respond to treatment, for brain tissue may have been burned away to apoint where the brain cannot function normally. In entering any such case, the auditor will beperplexed by the scrambled condition of the standard bank, to say nothing of the circuits bywhich he should be able to reach the engram bank. Syphilis and other brain erosions should besimilarly classified and should be approached or undertaken only with the full knowledge thatdianetics may not be able to help the dismembered machine at all. There have been manythousands of these brain “operations” and hundreds of thousands of electric shock treatments:thus the auditor should be alert not to engage upon what may be a hopeless cause when thereexist so many cases which can better be helped. Any case which has been institutionalizedshould be suspected. And if anything unusual in the way of memory scramble or lack ofcoordination is observed, searching inquiry may reveal hidden institutionalization. Further, anauditor called upon to assist a case which is about to be institutionalized should always bewary. The case which is being sent to an institution may be a case which has been in onebefore, regardless of the protestations of relatives or friends that such is not the circumstance.Similarly combat exhaustion cases should be warily undertaken, for the case wasprobably processed before quitting the service, at which time electric shock or brain operationor narco-synthesis may have been applied without the knowledge or consent of the patient.These warnings are given not because the auditor will be in any particular physicaldanger -- patients seldom do anything but cooperate, sane or insane, when dianetics is applied,even if they snarl about it -- but because much work may be expended only to discover that theentire mental machinery has been wrecked beyond repair.If the auditor undertakes an electric shock case, he should address his primary attentionto the release of that shock as an engram, for there is all manner of careless chatter contained inthese institutional engrams, which may further inhibit treatment. This is aside from the fact thatany electric shock, anywhere in the body, has a tendency to derange the engram bank and bindit so that its incidents are more than usually snarled.For no other reason than the advance of dianetics, and the conservation of an auditor’stime, it should also be remarked that the third degree methods of some police departments andgeneral police abuse of criminals or ordinary citizens may have to be released in a case before itcan be further treated. Prison terms may contain large despair charges sufficient to derange themind and yet may be hidden by the patient under the mistaken idea that the auditor is interestedor will be disappointed in his “character.”Various other things enter into the engram bank which would not be suspected asobstacles to therapy unless mentioned. Hypnotism can be extremely aberrative and may holdup a case. An auditor should have some working knowledge of it so that he can release theengrams it makes, not so he can work dianetics. Hypnotism is the art of implanting positivesuggestions in the engram bank. Here they may append themselves to engrams and becomelocks on those engrams. As most engram banks contain a sample of most common words,237"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"hypnotism is almost certain to be aberrative. The reduction of analytical power by artificialmeans places the subject in an optimum condition for the receipt of an engram. The hypnotistuses the forgetter mechanism with most of his suggestions and most people have similarengramic remarks which make it impossible for the hypnotist’s suggestion to release.Hypnotism can be considered as a “high-powered” lock and may be a serious obstacle in thepatient’s engram bank. With clearing, the suggestions having no anchors of pain below them inengrams, vanish as locks. But hypnotic suggestions may have to be found and cleared before acase can proceed. Hypnotism is very commonly used in this society and it is very often thecase that, with the forgetter mechanism, the patient is unable to recall whether he had ever beenhypnotized or not. Return technique will discover it, repeater technique, making the patientreturn with repetition of hypnotic patter (by the patient) such as “Go to sleep, go to sleep, go tosleep,” can be depended upon to locate it.Not all hypnotism is in the parlor. Perverts quite commonly use it despite the fact thatthe “moral” nature is supposed to rise in a hypnotized subject. Incidents even with people ofrepute have been found in patients when examining their childhood. These incidents were oftenentirely occluded to the patient, so thoroughly cowing were the commands contained in thehypnotic suggestion.Dianetics and hypnotism can be combined, but so can dianetics and astronomy. Theauditor will find himself working with hypnotic patients and will have to be very careful withpatter in order to install minimal words of his own in the engram bank so as not to turndianetics into hypnotism.Any benefit derived from hypnotism is in the field of research or the installation of atemporary manic engram. The latter has far more harm than value. Hypnotic anesthetic is vastlyoverrated. And hypnotism as a parlor game is a thing which no society should tolerate, for itmay be sufficiently destructive to cause the engrams to restimulate to a point of insanity. Andthe hypnotist never knows the content of the engram bank. Any good hypnotist, if he canconquer his desire to talk, should make a good auditor: but if he tries to combine dianetics andhypnotism he will find himself with a very thoroughly sick patient on his hands. Never install apositive suggestion of any kind in a patient no matter how much he may beg for one. It hasproven nearly fatal.An entire case can be worked in deep amnesia trance. It is often possible to waken asleeping person into a deep trance simply by speaking to him quietly several nights insuccession at the same hour and finally getting him to respond to the invitation to talk. Dianetictherapy can then be entered upon and pursued and will succeed particularly if the auditor is notcareless enough to artificially restimulate a late physical pain engram, treating in the post-birthlife mainly engrams of painful emotion.If the person on whom the therapy is being done is aware of the action, he can be putinto reverie so that earlier data can be reached, “I” being more powerful than the weak if wiseattention units which constitute basic personality. He is alternately worked in amnesia tranceand then in reverie. The case will resolve eventually even if reverie is not used. But there aregrave responsibilities with amnesia trance: a canceller must always be installed and used inevery session. Minimal conversation must be employed. All auditor desires should be stated asquestions if possible, as these are not aberrative to the degree that commands are. This methodhas been successful and can be used, but reverie, even if it appears slower, even if sonic is notpresent, is far more satisfactory for the excellent and incontrovertible reason that the patientrecovers more swiftly and recovers on a steady upgrade whereas amnesia trance mayincapacitate him for days together, when incidents are apparently lifted in deep trance butnevertheless “hung up” in the awake state. Amnesia trance is definitely not advised: it has beensubjected to much research and has been found to be both uncomfortable for the patient andharassing to the auditor. However, if other methods cannot be used for one reason or another(and none of those reasons include the desire of the pre-clear who, if the auditor would let him,might crave drugs, hypnotism and positive suggestion in an effort to escape his engrams andwho, if allowed, would have himself a wonderfully messy case for the auditor to unsnarl),238"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"amnesia trance can be employed, but always with the greatest caution and always with the fullknowledge that the patient’s recovery is retarded by as much as a factor of three, for workingon a level with the engram bank leaves the analyzer circuits unused in the discharge. Reverie isbest.EXTERNAL PROBLEMS WITH PATIENTSIt may happen that a patient who has made progress suddenly ceases to make furtherprogress. The answer may lie elsewhere than therapy. The environment of the pre-clear may beso intensely restimulative that he is distracted, always in restimulation and thus works slowly.It may be discovered, in such a case, that the pre-clear (as in one case) has made a bargain witha wife or husband who desires divorce that he or she wait until the pre-clear is cleared. Othersituations of a life nature can place an environmental value on not being cleared. The auditorhas no business with the private lives of his pre-clears, but in a case where therapy itself ismade difficult by existing situations the auditor, with his time at stake, has every right todiscover the reason. All these reasons will compute into some environmental advantage in notbeing clear. Removing the pre-clear temporarily from his home, for instance, may change hisenvironment and advance therapy. The auditor has a right to ask that, clear or not, the patientresolve the problem on his own initiative. It is common with pre-clears that they do not realizethat they are releases for so glittering is the goal of clear that they cease to compare themselvesto the normal which they have already overpassed.A patient can commonly be expected to introvert to a very marked degree in the courseof dianetic therapy. As the case progresses this introversion reaches an acute stage about three-quarters or thereabouts through and thereafter recedes. Ambiversion is a marked characteristicof the clear. When introversion has been marked, a fairly good gauge of the advance of thecase is in the pre-clear’s interest in exterior things.Nearly all pre-clears talk a great deal about their engrams up to the point when they arevery solid releases. If they don’t or won’t talk about their engrams in common conversation,the auditor can suspect something highly protected in the engram bank concerning the necessityto hide something: the auditor can act accordingly. Although the auditor may weary of suchconversation, it nevertheless reveals much new material to him if he observes the phraseswhich the pre-clear uses about engrams.It is very, very true that aberration is caused by what has been done to not what hasbeen done by the patient.The actions of the patient in dramatizing, in committing crimes and so forth are notaberrative to the patient. Therefore the pre-clear’s activities need be no concern whatever of theauditor’s. Whole cases have been completed without the auditor’s knowing what the pre-cleardid for a living. While responsibility for his actions is necessarily demanded of him by anaberrated society, antisocial activity is the resuit of engrams which dictate it. The patient is notresponsible for what he himself has done. Cleared, the matter is different. A clear can beconsidered entirely responsible for his own actions, for he can compute rationally on the basisof his experience. But the aberree has little or no real control over his actions. Therefore, theauditor should make it plain that he does not care what the aberree who becomes a pre-clear hasdone in life. The problem on hand between the auditor and the pre-clear is an engram bankwhich contains, exclusively, what other people have done in life and what has been done to thepre-clear in moments when he could not protect himself. This approach is not only truth, it hasa therapeutic value, for in so explaining himself an auditor can often obtain cooperation whichwould otherwise be denied.The auditor should never violate the auditor’s code with a patient. Extended terms oftherapy inevitably result from such violations.239"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"RESTIMULATIONThe mind is a self-protecting mechanism -- but so is dianetics. A science of thoughtwhich works would so closely approximate the working principles of the mind that it wouldfollow in parallels the injunctions and provisos of the mind itself. Such is the case withdianetics: the mind is diagnosed by its reaction to therapy, therapy is improved by the reactionsof the mind to it. This is a working principle of great value since it explains much observedphenomena and predicts most of the remainder. Part of this parallelism is the self-protectionfeature.It is almost impossible to injure a mind: it is an extremely tough organism. Of course,when one begins to hew and saw upon it with metal or poison it with drugs or bacteria orthrow its natural armor aside as with hypnotism, unfortunate things can occur.Charlatanism is almost impossible where dianetics in any of its principles is beingpracticed. One either practices all dianetics and gets results or practices himself into a decline:that is a mechanical, scientific fact. Dianetics, as a self-protecting science, demands practice byclears or at least good releases. A clear very closely follows in all his conduct the better aspectsof the auditor’s code: his ethical level is very high. Hence, anyone starting a practice ofdianetics is going to find himself, no matter what his original intention, thrust toward the goalof being a clear.There is an excellent reason for this. There is a principle known as restimulation of theauditor. We have an understanding now of what makes an engram come into restimulation.When it comes into restimulation, it forces the pain or the action of the engram into being in theorganism. The observation of some percept in the environment which approximates arecording, sound or sight or organic sensation, in the engram brings the engram into greater orlesser play. Similarly, when an auditor is not cleared himself or when he is not in therapyhimself working toward the goal of a clear, he becomes restimulated. He is, after all, listeningconstantly to engramic material in a patient. This engramic material is the very stuff of whichinsanity is made. Anyone has engrams: sooner or later a patient is going to start going over anengram of his own which will approximate the auditor’s own engrams. This leads to greatdiscomfort for the auditor unless the auditor is in therapy and can have the discomfort sobrought forth released. So long as one is merely working late locks, this is not so much thecase and has made it possible for practitioners and mental healers of the past to escape much ofthe penalty of their own aberrations, but when one deals with the root material of theseaberrations, a constant hammering by restimulators can bring about a serious condition. This isthe mechanism which causes people in asylums to fall prey themselves to psychoses, althoughone must have had them in the first place for them to have been restimulated.The auditor may run one or two cases without any serious repercussion: indeed, nomatter what the repercussion, it can be eliminated by dianetics. To save his own comfort,however, he should himself be cleared or released as soon as possible. He can work as arelease without too much trouble, and this makes it possible for him to make a mutual compactwhere he is worked on while he is working the other. A condition can then come about wheretwo pre-clears are each auditors. This alternation between the couch and the auditor’s chair willusually work very well.Two persons, however, after they have begun work, may discover that they aremutually restimulative -- which is to say each is a pseudo-person in the other’s engrams or oneis restimulated (voice tone, incidents) by the other. This should be no bar to therapy. It hasbeen overcome and therapy has gone forward despite the most severe restimulativecircumstances. A common avoidance technique on the part of a subject is to claim the auditorrestimulates him: it is not sufficiently important to stop therapy. It may be, however, that twopeople can enter a third into the chain and by one clearing the next considerably ease thetension. The triangular work plan, where no person is working on the person who is workinghim, is quite successful.240"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"A husband and wife who have quarreled long and often may find it too restimulative toclear each other. It is possible to do if other arrangements cannot be made and it is often done:but if therapy does not go well, he should find a therapy partner and so should she. Motherswho have attempted abortion on their children or otherwise maltreated them can accomplishtherapy on those children, but in any case of restimulative circumstance such as this, thegreatest precaution must be taken by the auditor to adhere severely to the auditor’s code -- to dootherwise might bring much more stress into therapy than is necessary. In such a case, themother had better herself have at least a release accomplished upon her before she attempts toclear her children -- and she should not touch those children until they are at least eight.The subject of auditor-restimulation, where the auditor restimulates the pre-clear or thepre-clear restimulates the auditor, does not include the routine aspect of therapy that the pre-clear is always being artificially restimulated via standard therapy. An engram can berestimulated by being touched several times and so it will lift. The auditor-restimulationproblem is a specific one where the auditor is a pseudo-enemy, a similarity to a person who hasharmed the patient. Wild antagonism on the part of a patient to an auditor is usually traced tothis. Some patients have such a hatred of men that only women can work them, some havesuch a hatred of women that only men can work them. But even when there is a wild antipathy,if there exists no other auditor or person who can be trained quickly as one, therapy canproceed anyway: and it will accomplish results.REBALANCING A CASEAny case dropped out of therapy will rebalance itself in a few weeks, which is to say, itwill settle to a new high for the individual. Unless drug hypnotism or some other dianeticallyillegal method is used, all cases will so rebalance, much benefited. Restimulations can beexpected to die down if they are due to therapy. The patient will gradually find his own level inthe released state. Cases do not have to be carried forward to clear if auditor time is short, but itis, of course better if they are and, indeed, the majority of patients will insist that they be.WORKING TIME IN THERAPYThe usual period of a dianetic treatment is two hours. In these two hours, with theusual patient, everything is going to be accomplished which can be accomplished on that day.Working every day is not necessary, but working every two days or every three days isdesirable. Working with periods a week apart is not optimum, for the case tends to rebalance.Further, there is a “sag” in a case, usually every fourth day when it is not worked in periods asshort as three days. The fourth day “sag” is a natural mechanical thing: an engram, keyed-in,when it is restimulated in life, takes about four days to cut in sharply. In therapy, three days issometimes required to “develop” an engram. This does not mean that three days have to elapsebefore it is available and it does not mean that work has to stop for three days, but it does meanthat engrams, not being memories and articulate as such, take three days, sometimes, to cometo the surface.To be more clear, an engram can be asked for on day one and will be found on daythree. Meanwhile the auditor is getting other engrams. This process is so automatic that itrequires no attention and will not come to notice except in cases that are being worked once aweek. The engram is asked for on day one, is ready to reduce on day three, sags on day fourand is rebalanced by day seven.The three day aspect is interesting in another sense. This time of three days is just anobservation of the average behavior of pre-clears. Precision investigation may fix it at 2.5 daysor 3.6 days (it varies in individuals), but three days is close enough for our purposes. Whenone is doing just a release on a case, he will sometimes find that it is necessary to take a lateengram and run it: the physical pain engram of later life (post-birth) will appear to rise, willremain constant for three days and then will “sag.” When it sags, the auditor will have to go241"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"back to it and run it again. Taking out these “sags” will eventually make the later life engramstay in a recessed state.Euphoria often sets in on a case when the auditor touches an engram which contains amanic. The patient will then go around saying how wonderful dianetics is because he is now inmagnificent condition and is so happy. Watch out. In three or four days this manic will havesagged back to a depressive state. Be wary if somebody experiences one of these sky-rocket“recoveries” for it is about as permanent as the fire of a burning match. It goes out and leavesvery cold ashes. The auditor, seeing this euphoria, had better enter the case again and reducethe engram it contains more thoroughly or get a more basic engram.The length of time it takes to clear a person is quite variable. By blowing despaircharges and working a few early engrams, an auditor can get a better state of being in thepatient than in any past therapy in twenty or thirty hours: this is a release. It compares to two orthree years of past therapeutic work. The length of time it takes to get a clear cannot becompared to any past standard because a clear is something no past standard ever dreamedabout.In a sonic case, where recall is in good condition, a clear can be obtained in a hundredhours. In a case which has thoroughly shut down recalls, anything can happen up to, inextremity, a thousand hours. Similarly, the imaginative case which has things which neverhappened, may be long.Look at it this way: we can get the results of two or three years of psycho-analysis in ascore or two of hours of dianetics and what we accomplish with dianetics does not have to bedone again, which is not true with psycho-analysis. This is the release. He can go about hisbusiness in a far more competent fashion, his emotional charges being largely freed. In theclear we are attempting and can achieve a supernormal state of mind. Thousands and thousandsand thousands of hours were spent in the education of a man: the expenditure of two or eventen thousand hours of work to make him rank about what would formerly have been possiblefor him is work well spent. But we do not have to spend anything like this amount of time.People have been cleared in anything from thirty hours, when they had sonic and little volume,to five hundred hours when they had shut-down recall plus imaginary recall. What an auditorcan do with his first few cases by way of time is a question mark. He will get to the cleareventually and certainly in less than twelve hundred hours in a severe case. All the time he isworking toward a clear he is achieving a higher and higher release which, after at least fiftyhours, rises well above the current norm and keeps right on soaring. Improvement is such thatfrom week to week the charge is physiologically noticeable and psychologically startling. Ifone thinks the reach for clear is a short jump and a small gain, then he has no conception of justhow high that goal is.Most auditors will try for release at first and are wise if they do. When their own case isfinally cleared, only then will they suddenly realize that the state was worth far more time thanwas expended to attain.It is impossible to forecast, with a new auditor, just how much time he will consume inmaking errors, learning his tools, attaining skill. It is therefore impossible to estimate for himhow long it will take him to gain a clear in a patient. A well trained auditor never takes morethan eight hundred hours with the worst of cases: five hundred is high.DATA FROM RELATIVESThe auditor will always be plagued by the anxiety of the patient to get data fromrelatives or friends. The request for this data itself is restimulative both to the pre-clear and therelative. Mothers have been made very ill by being given the restimulators of their own pastillnesses by the child who has “suddenly found out.”242"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"It is a uniform experience that the data obtained from relatives, parents and friends bythe pre-clear is absolutely and utterly worthless. Here we are depending upon an aberree’smemory when we have at hand, with dianetics, a reliable source of accurate material. Auditorshave had cases progress very smoothly and then suddenly stop progress: on inquiry it isdiscovered that the pre-clear has been running around to his parents and relatives for materialand they, wanting nothing more than that he forget all about what they have done to him, throwhim red herrings which have to be carefully eliminated. These are the villains of the piece, thepeople who have done the things to the pre-clear which made him an aberree. If one expectsaccurate data from them, one might as well expect the moon to be green cheese.If the auditor wants data from these people and requests it, by-passing the pre-clear, hemay get somewhere. But any data so received has a value which, in intelligence, is used tolabel “Incompetent Source -- Improbable Material.”Warn a pre-clear not to bother his relatives and parents and explain to him that he canmake them ill by asking for data, on the restimulator principle. If we want confirmation of thedata received, the only way to get it is put the parent or relative in therapy. At such time, weshall get the basic dramatization sources: in the prenatal life and childhood of the parent. This isa problem of research, not of therapy.If the auditor has Mama available, he can run off the child’s birth and then Mama givingbirth, keeping the two apart, and get his check on the accuracy of therapy. And there are otherdata that can be so compared, using proper safeguards.The subjective reality, not the objective reality, is the important question to the auditor.First, last and always, does the patient get well?STOPPING THERAPYThe woman scorned has a violent rival in the pre-clear on whom therapy has beenstopped by the auditor’s decision.Keeping the pre-clear in therapy, no matter how seldom are the sessions, satisfies insome measure the effort his basic personality makes to fight clear of the aberrations.The basic personality, the file clerk, the core of “I” which wants to be in command ofthe organism, the most fundamental desires of the personality, may be considered synonymousfor our purposes. There is an enormous surge of this basic self -- which is really the individualhimself -- to conquer the engrams. The engrams, borrowing life from their host, appear asthings which do not want to be conquered. As mechanistic as all this actually is, the auditorwill often find himself wondering at the resistance the engrams can make and marveling at theefforts of the basic personality to conquer the engrams. He works with the basic personality,the individual himself, and ignores the engramic efforts to interfere. But there is a situation inwhich the basic personality seems to give free play to the engrams in an effort to accomplishtherapy.In work, a “patient” might have been skeptical, sarcastic or even vicious to the auditor.Or the patient may have been thought to be completely neglectful of his engram bank. Or thepatient may even rage that he hates therapy. For some of these reasons the auditor mayinjudiciously decide to cease working the patient. The patient is so informed. For a short while,perhaps, the patient may manifest no reaction but in a few minutes, a few hours or a few days,basic personality, denied a route out, may begin to use every weapon to hand to compel theauditor to resume therapy.Disturbed by cessation of therapy, even though he may have insisted upon its beingstopped, the ex-patient may begin either to rapidly decline or to attack to his face or behind hisback the auditor and even therapy itself. The woman scorned has rarely made such thorough243"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"upsets as ex-patients who have been refused continuance of therapy. Auditors have beenpersonally reviled, have had other pre-clears searched out and undermined by violent attacksupon therapy itself, have been targeted by all manner of accusations and whispering campaignsand have been made most uncomfortable by pre-clears who have had further therapy denied tothem before a release had taken place. Even solid, legitimate releases, whose psycho-somaticills have disappeared and who should be quite cheerful, have been observed to createturbulence when the auditor would not take them through to clear. Any number of mechanismsmay be used by the ex-patient. as many mechanisms as men use to force other men into action.One of the mechanisms is a resumption of apathy and a “swift decline.” Another is wildcampaigning against therapy. Another is personal attack of the auditor. Each has, as itsprovable intention, the resumption of therapy.The mind knows how the mind works. And the mind which has tasted a way out ofpain and unhappiness may be expected, if that way is blocked, to use all methods to causetherapy to be resumed.No matter how thoroughly disagreeable the ex-patient has been, the moment the auditorstarts therapy upon him again, the attitude alters. No further destructive efforts are madeagainst the auditor or therapy but all is almost as well as it was before the cessation wasdeclared.Do not suppose, however, that the pre-clear, if he has been neglectful, recalcitrant orgenerally uncooperative before, will now embrace therapy as chastened patient. Far from thecase, he is now at least as difficult to work as he was before plus some additional antagonismengendered by the cessation order.In such a case the auditor is damned if he does and double-damned if he doesn’t. Butthere is a way out of this. The phenomenon of “transference,” where the patient simplytransfers his griefs to the practitioner, is not the mechanism here at work; transference is adifferent thing, bred of a thirst for attention and a feeling of needed support in the world.Transference can be expected to keep up forever if permitted; the patient of a doctor, forinstance, may go on and on having illnesses just to keep the doctor around. Transference mayoccur in dianetic therapy, the patient may lean on the auditor solidly, beg the auditor for advice,appear to hold out engrams in an effort to keep the auditor working hard and available andinterested; all this is the resultant of a sympathy computation and is aberrated conduct. Theclever auditor will not give advice or attempt to run anyone’s life, for a person works well onlyas a self-determined organism. In dianetic therapy, no matter what the attitude of the patient, nomatter how great his “desires to be ill” or his transference of burden, no matter about even hisvicious remarks to the auditor during sessions, the condition cannot obtain forever.Basic personality is trying to get through; “I” is trying to integrate self. Even indifferentwork will eventually release enough charge from a case and reduce enough engrams to bring ahigher stability to the patient. Basic personality gets stronger and stronger and therefore moreself-reliant. The introversion occasioned by continual effort to reach the interior world of theengram bank de-intensifies and extroversion comes more and more into being as the caseadvances. The way out is to work the patient smoothly and well and one day he will be wellreleased or clear. But meanwhile, if you stop therapy on anyone, don’t be surprised at anythingthat happens; you can only remedy it by resuming the case.AUDITOR EVALUATIONThe auditor must do much evaluation to himself. He does not evaluate or force upon hispre-clear any computation. If the pre-clear computes that this was what was making him ill,then this is what the auditor accepts. Explaining to the pre-clear what it was in the engramwhich affected him so and so is not only a waste of time but also makes the pre-clear confused.The reason an auditor evaluates is to make sure he is not accepting imagined data or incompletedata as engrams.244"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"An incident will not lift unless the data in it is correct: this is automatic. Change just onesyllable in the incident and it will stick. Or, if it seems to go away, it will be back. So there isno fear that any incident which decreases with recounting is incorrect. The data in it must bemore or less correct or it would not so reduce. Thus the auditor who challenges incidents, dataor otherwise plays god is going to have a thoroughly fouled up case on his hands before hegoes very far, and he is going to have a subject who is not progressing. If the subject begins torun an engram where Mama is having intercourse with five Eskimos, let him run it and never,never, never, never tell him that you feel it was untrue. If you tell the subject you think he isimagining things, you may give him a serious set-back. Tell him you think Mama had herreasons and you have sided with the opposition: you are not attacking the engram, you arehelping Mama attack the subject. To criticize, correct or otherwise judge the pre-clear has noslightest part in dianetics and will do more to slow up a case than any other single action. Anauditor who challenges the material given him may be practicing witchcraft or Chineseacupuncture or shamanism or voodoo, but he is not practicing dianetics. And he will not getresults. One remark to the subject such as, “I think that you are mistaken in believing yourmother would try to abort you,” or “I feel that you are imagining it” may set your pre-clearback fifty hours. The auditor does not criticize or judge the pre-clear, nor does he evaluate forthe pre-clear that person’s material.Auditing is all done privately and to oneself. If the patient has just recounted his fifthprenatal train wreck, you may be sure you have run into a lie factory in some engram. Thewrong way to go about correcting this is communicating it to the pre-clear. The right way to goabout it is to find the lie factory, an engram containing such a remark as, “Tell me anything!Tell me anything. I don’t care so long as you say something. But for God’s sakes don’t tell methe truth, I can’t stand it!” Or, “You can’t tell him the truth. It would hurt too much.” There area thousand forms of lie factory. And they are not too uncommon.Never tell the pre-clear why you are looking for anything. If you say you want a liefactory, the lie factory will make up a lie factory. If you say you want an emotional charge, youwill inhibit any emotional Charge from discharging. Simply make a quiet estimate of thesituation, reduce everything which seems valid and keep on trying to get the reason why thecase is not functioning as well as possible.The test for validity of an engram is not plot. Plot is worthless. Engrams are justcollections of remarks contained in periods of “unconsciousness.” It makes no differencewhatever whether these remarks agree with the way the auditor thinks a life should be run orthe way a pre-clear should look up to his parents. Plot is something writers put in stories.Auditors have nothing to do with it. An engram is basically illogical and irrational; don’t try toread rationality into one! If the parents were known to be fine, upstanding members of thecommunity and the engrams seem to indictate that Mama nightly played the prostitute, acceptthe engrams.Validity is very simply established. Ask these questions of the engrams:(1) Does it have a somatic?(2) Does the somatic undulate, which is to say, undergo a running change?(3) Does it reduce? (If it does not, the content the pre-clear is running is wrong or theengram is way up the chain and has others before it.)(4) Does the engramic content agree with the patient’s aberration?(5) Does the somatic agree with psycho-somatic ills the patient is known to have had?(6) Does it bring relief to the patient? And this last is more important than all the rest.245"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Because mental healers of the past have grandly said, “Oh, this does not fit with myidea of how life is run” is no reason an auditor should run dianetics off the rails. Mentalhealers of yesteryear did not get results. Dianetics gets results: and one of the most importantreasons why dianetics gets results is that it is not trying to warp life to fit dianetics but isapplying dianetics to life. Many new and startling things will come to the notice of the auditor.His motto, as seen on an ancient English crest where a ninety-foot raven stood upon acastle, could read, “Be surprised at nothing.”The Kinsey report did not begin to tell the story you, as an auditor, will get in dianetics.Because the mother, by herself, is neither the face she showed Junior nor the face she showedsociety and because mother and father, by themselves, do not conduct themselves as theymight be supposed to have done in society is insufficient reason to force a pre-clear to go onbeing an aberree.Continually in the psychiatric texts we come upon patients who tried to tell psychiatristsabout prenatal life and who were told, with droll solemnity that the incidents were imaginary.Patients who had been given up on all fronts by all existing schools because their data was nottailored to fit the belief of those schools have recovered fully and achieved optimum mentalcondition, well above that of their former mentors, with dianetics, partially because dianeticsdoes not set itself above the facts of life. He not only requires the patient to face reality byrunning the engrams but he also requires himself to face reality by accepting the fact thatwhatever the content, if it fits any of the above conditions listed, it is valid in therapy.Auditing means to listen; it also means to compute. Computing on a case consists ofestablishing where the patient departs from optimum rationality in his conduct of life but, moreimportant, where physically painful and painful emotion engrams exist and how they can beapproached and reduced.Patients discover some astonishing things about their parents and relatives when theyare in therapy. Often they discover, like one patient who had believed he had daily been beatenby his father, that life was actually much better than it had seemed.Pre-marital conception cases are very common, with the patient yet unborn discoveringhimself at his parents’ wedding. And these cases are often very difficult to resolve since theycontain so much secrecy in their engrams.The lie factory mechanisms will often try to give Mama extra lovers and try to makePapa into a raving beast, but a lie factory is very easy to detect: the incidents brought forth donot run like engrams: the second time over their content is widely changed, they do not havesomatics and their content is not aberrative.In short, the test is whether or not one has an actual engram, not whether or not theengram makes sense. For father could well have been a raving beast in a boudoir and mothercould well have had coitus with the boarders: and father could well have been a tame lamb forall the reputation mother gave him post-birth and mother could well have been a frigid prudedespite the wild tales the pre-clear might have heard. The truth will come out in the reductionbut its truth is no concern of the auditor’s beyond getting up engrams.First, last and always, get engrams, get them as early as possible for pain, later foremotion, get them, erase them, discharge them, clear them! That they did not compute as truedata was what drove the aberree into being an aberree. Leave plot to writers: our task istherapy.But don’t “buy garbage”: ask for the somatic, see if it varies as the pre-clear utters thewords. Test for engrams. And devil take the plot.246"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XDianetics -- Past and FutureTHE HISTORY OF DIANETICSThe history of dianetics would be the history of a voyage of discovery, of anexploration into new and nearly uncharted realms, Terra Incognita, the Human Mind, a landwhich lies an inch behind your forehead.The voyage has taken twelve years and the labor has been long, but we have chartsnow and can go and return at will.Observations of savage and civilized races in this and far climes formed the foundationfor the anthropological research: the writings of a few men in the last four thousand yearsformed the scholarly pilots. The ancient Hindu writings, the work of the early Greeks andRomans including Lucretius, the labors of Francis Bacon, the researches of Darwin and someof the thoughts of Herbert Spencer compose the bulk of the philosophic background. Inevitableabsorption from our current culture provided much unnoticed information. The remainder hasbeen what the navigator calls, “off the chart.”In 1935 some of the basic research was begun: in 1938 the primary axioms werediscovered and formulated. For the next several years these axioms were tested in thelaboratory of the world. The war interrupted the work, as wars will, being chaos, but shortlyafter the cessation of actual hostilities, research was renewed. Within a year the fundamentalsof this science as they applied to the human mind had been integrated. They were tested on along series of random patients and each test further refined the work, but each applicationbrought specific results.Five years after the initial resumption of labor, in 1950, the work was prepared forrelease, all tests having brought forth the conclusion that dianetics is a science of mind, that itdoes disclose hitherto unknown laws about thought and that it has worked on every type ofinorganic mental and organic psycho-somatic illness. Further, in the refinement of formattained, it was proven possible for the work to be used easily by people not lengthily trained.The goal we have here reached is a science which is workable and which can beworked with success by briefly taught individuals. This goal has not hitherto been attained oreven approached.Once one has gained a foothold on unknown lands, more things become known to himand with each new datum his horizon further widens, including broader bodies of knowledge.Dianetics cures, and cures without failure. And there are further goals.Education, medicine, politics and art and, indeed, all branches of human thought, areclarified with dianetics. And even so that is not enough.Dianetics has, as yet, a brief history: it has a strong youth: it forecasts a bettertomorrow. Before it is much older it will have included even more within its scope. Thehistory of dianetics is scarce begun.Plan A included the perfection of the science, its testing on patients of all kinds and,finally, the dissemination of dianetics as pertaining to therapy. That plan ends with the releaseof this book.Plan B includes a further research into life force, an attempt at resolution of some of theills not yet embraced such as cancer and diabetes, and the perfection of techniques discoveredand their dissemination. That will end Plan B.247"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"Plan C includes an effort to discover a higher echelon of universal origin anddestination, if the problem is one of origin and destination, and the factors and forces involvedto the end of securing a better understanding and useful application of the knowledge sogained, if gained, and if so gained, its dissemination.A portion of Plan B is the organization of a foundation so that the research can be moreswiftly accomplished.The history of dianetics has just begun. What other things begin with the origin of ascience of mind only tomorrow can tell.JUDICIARY DIANETICSThis brief summary of Judiciary Dianetics is included in this present work as an aid tothe auditor.JUDICIARY DIANETICS covers the field of adjudication within the society andamongst the societies of Man. Of necessity it embraces jurisprudence and its codes andestablishes precision definitions and equations for the establishment of equity. It is the scienceof judgment.Jurisprudence and its adjudications are constructed on the cornerstones of right andwrong, good and evil. Definition of these is inherent in dianetics: by these definitions a correctsolution can be reached with regard to any action or actions of Man.The fundamental test of rationality is the ability to differentiate right from wrong. Thefundamental factors in establishing censure are good and evil. Without precision definition ofthese four factors any structure of law or judgment is rendered forceless and becomes involvedthrough its introduction of arbitrary factors which seek to adjudicate by introducing errors tonullify errors. Penal codes which will answer all needs can only be written when precision,scientific definition exist for the four factors, and civil equity which will not lead to injusticecan only then be established and formulated.The problems of jurisprudence and, indeed, all judgment, are inextricably interwovenwith the problems of behavior.An ideal society would be a society of unaberrated persons, clears, conducting theirlives within an unaberrated culture: for either the person or the culture may be aberrated. Theaberrations of the culture enter into the equations of conduct as irrational factors both from thedoor of education and of social customs and jurisprudence. It is not enough that an individualbe himself unaberrated, for he discovers himself within the confines of a society which itselfhas compounded its culture into many unreasonable prejudices and customs.The establishment of actual source for wrong and evil is a fundamental problem of alljurisprudence. The actual source unfortunately lies in the irrationalities of those in pastgenerations who, working with limited knowledge and oppressed by their environs, soughtsolutions with equations which contained false and indefinite factors. These generations, longentombed, cannot be brought to bar. We are the heirs to all the ages of the past and that isgood: but we are heirs as well to all the irrationalities of the past and that is evil. Under suchcircumstances and in the absence of broad reason, adjudication by the auditor of the pre-clearas relates to evil or wrong actions cannot be performed with accuracy. The criminal and theinsane, the hypochondriac and the wife-beater, the merciless dictator who seeks to shake theworld and the street cleaner who only sits and weeps are all, each one, gripped and driven bytheir own sources of unreason, by the world which has entered into the hidden depths of theirpain-wracked minds and which, in the form of social aberration, pounds against them fromwithout.248"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"The auditor is interested in what has been done to, not done by his patient; for whateverthe patient has done is forever beyond recall and was not the source but was only themanifestation of his griefs.Given a society of unaberrated persons, given a culture from which has been deleted allunreason, then and only then can Man be truly responsible for his acts, then and only then. Butwe must take the shadow of the responsibility now for the fact of it. A man does not have tosurrender to his engrams.Perhaps at some distant date only the unaberrated person will be granted civil rightsbefore law. Perhaps the goal will be reached at some future time when only the unaberratedperson can attain to and benefit from citizenship. These are desirable goals and would producea marked increase in the survival ability and happiness of Man.Even now the codes of jurisprudence can be reformed and it can be ascertained withprecision whether the act which brought the individual before law was an aberrated act, orstemmed from an aberration of culture, or was an act which was committed to the detriment ofanother or of society. Surely the process of punishment can be refined so as to sentence theindividual not to further aberration as a prisoner or a ruined man but to a higher plane of reasonthrough the deletion of the aberration.The past acts of an individual who has been cleared should be stricken from his recordeven as his illnesses have been, for with the cause removed there can be no point in retributionunless society itself is so aberrated that it desires to operate on sadistic principles.* There ismore than idealism here for it can be shown that aberration in individuals and the society rise inprogressive ratio to the amount of punishment employed.Efforts to resolve problems of jurisprudence which yet did not embrace precisiondefinitions for right and wrong, good and evil, had recourse only to a principle known indianetics as the Introduction of an Arbitrary. Our present society is not aberrated in thisrespect: the insane man is not held guilty or responsible for his acts. Lacking definition of aprecise scientific nature for insanity and failing to recognize that all irrational acts are temporaryinsanity, the society has not been able to carry out its fundamental intention.Broad, unchangeable rules were thrust into problems in an effort to resolve them andyet each new rule further drove reason aside so that more rules were needed. An arbitrarystructure is one in which one error has been observed and an effort has been made to correct itby introducing another error. In progressive complexity, new errors must be introduced tonullify the evil effects old errors. A culture, to say nothing of jurisprudence, grows complexand unwieldy in progressive ratio to the number of new evils it must introduce in an effort tonullify old evils. At last there can be no reason; there can be but force and where there lives noreason and yet lives force, there is naught but the maelstrom of an insane rage. Where theredwells an insane rage, still unresolved, there must at length come apathy; and apathy,dwindling down, inevitably reaches death.We are here at a bridge between one state of Man and a next. We are above the chasmwhich divides a lower from a higher plateau and this chasm marks an artificial evolutionarystep in the progress of Man.The auditor is at that bridge; when cleared he will be at its higher end. He will watchmuch traffic cross. He may see customs, laws, organizations and societies attempt to avoid thebridge but, being swept along, tumble into a nothingness below.In his attitude toward his pre-clears or toward society at large, he can gain nothing byreprimanding and judging past error in the light of current sentience. Not only can he gainnothing but he can inhibit progress. It is a remorseless fact that the attack upon unreason hasbegun. Attack unreason, not the society or the man.249"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"DIANETICS AND WARThe social organisms which we call states and nations behave and react in every respectas though they were individual organisms. The culture has its analytical mind, the combinedsentience of its citizens in general and its artists, scientists and statesmen in particular. Thesocial standard memory bank is the data accumulated along the generations. And the socialorganism has as well its reactive mind as represented by the prejudices and irrationalities of theentire group. This reactive mind is served by an engram bank wherein lie past painfulexperiences and which dictates reactive action on certain subjects whenever those subjects arerestimulated in the society. This, all too briefly, is an analogy used in Political Dianetics.The social organism behaves in a manner which can be graphed on the tone scale; it hasits survival dynamic and its suppressors, its internal suppression due to engrams and its urgetoward an infinity of optimum duration. Criminals, traitors, and zealots constitute, forinstance, internal engrams which suppress the survival potential on the tone scale.There is a precision definition for each social level as related to the tone scale. A freesociety, working in complete cooperation toward common goals would be a Tone 4 society. Asociety hindered by arbitrary restrictions and oppressive laws would be a Tone 2 society. Asociety managed and dictated to by the whims of one man or a few men would be a Tone 1society. A society governed by the mystery and superstition of some mystic body would be aTone 0 society. The potential of survival in each case can be seen anywhere in history. AnyGolden Age is a Tone 4. Oppressive practices, individual greeds and miscalculation in generalreduce the society by introducing into it dissatisfied elements. To cope with these, in the past,further oppression has been used. The survival of the society reduced further. With moreoppression came new engrams and so down the tone scale slipped the chances of longsurvival. And with this reduction of potential came pain as the lower zones were entered.Societies rise and fall on the tone scale. But there is a danger point below which asociety cannot go without reacting as would an individual so suppressed: the society reaches abreak point and goes mad. This point is around 2.0.The quarrel of society with society, nation with nation, has many causes, all of themmore or less irrational. There have been many times when one society was forced to crushanother less sentient than itself. But with each clash, new engrams were born both in theinternational scene and within the societies themselves.War is an international Tone 1. It is no more rational than any individual who, reachinga general and chronic Tone 1, is placed in an institution or, temporarily Tone 1, commits somecrime and is thereafter imprisoned. But there is no jailer to societies, there is at this time onlydeath and so they die and so they have died.Before this time no tool could be employed by a nation but force when faced withanother nation gone mad. By contagion of aberration, both nations then went mad. No nationever fully won a war. No nation ever finally triumphed by force of arms. No nation everaverted war by posing threat or exhibiting defense.Man is now faced, by these pyramiding hatreds, with weapons so powerful that Manhimself may vanish from the earth. There is no problem in the control of these weapons. Theyexplode when and where Man tells them to explode. The problem is in the control of Man.There is no national problem in the world today which cannot be resolved by reasonalone. All factors inhibiting a solution of the problem of war and weapons are arbitrary factorsand have no more validity than the justified explanations of a thief or murderer.The farmer of Iowa has no quarrel with the storekeeper of Stalingrad. Those who saysuch quarrels exist lie.250"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"There are no international concerns which cannot be resolved by peaceable means, notin the terms of supra-national government, but in the terms of reason.Jockeying with indefinable ideologies, playing with mass ignorance, non-existententities like nightmares march the world in the form of the Gods of Ism.No self-interest can be so great as to demand the slaughter of Mankind. He who woulddemand it, he who would not by every rational means avert it, is insane. There is nojustification for war.Behind the curtains of language and different customs populaces are taught to recognizeno kinship with other populaces. Taught by their own terrors and governed by their ownaberrations leaders hold up other isms as detestable things.There is no perfect political state on earth today, there is not even a good definition of aperfect political creed. States are the victims of internal and external aberrations.Dianetics addresses war because there is in fact a race between the science of mind andthe atom bomb. There may be no future generation to know which won.Rationality alone can guide Man past these threats to his extinction.Insanity does not exist without a confusion of definitions and purpose. The solution tothe international problem does not lie in the regulation or curtailment of weapons nor yet in therestraints of men. It lies in the definition of political theory and policy in such terms that therecan be no mistaking the clear processes; it lies in the establishment of rational goals towardwhich societies can collectively and individually work; and it lies in an inter-social competitionof gains so great that none become dispensable to any other.Man’s primary fight is not with Man -- that is insanity. Man’s primary fight is withthose elements which oppress him as a species and bar his thrust toward high goals. Man’sfight is with the elements, with space and time, and with species which are destructive to him.He has hardly begun his conquest. He is just now armed with tools enough and scienceenough to make good his conquest of the Universe. He has no time to bicker and indulge intantrums and yah-yah across back fences about atom bombs.The harnessing of atomic power puts other worlds within his reach. Why haggle forthis one? The late discoveries in the field of photo-synthesis bid fair to feed and clothe himroyally even though he number a thousand times his present two billions on earth. For whatreason can he quarrel? Why?Two rational men will enter into a contest of gain and worth and production. Are thesemighty nations, these powerful, fearful, thundering “giants,” actually small and poorlyeducated, barely sane little boys screaming insults at each other over the possession of a deadcat? What of armies? Armies die. If might makes right, then Rome still rules the world. Whofears now this archeological curiosity that was Rome?There is a higher goal, a better goal, a more glorious victory than gutted towns andradiation-burned dead. There is freedom and happiness and plenty and a whole Universe to bewon.He who would not see it is far from worthy to rule. He who would indulge his hates istoo insane to advise.How much can Man conquer? He loses if he conquers Man. He wins if he conquers hisown fears and conquers. then the stars.251"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Attack the natural enemies of Man, attack them well, and war of Man with Man cannotthereafter be a problem.

Man, bewildered, has notknown his enemies. They are visible now; attack!THE FUTURE OF THERAPYIn twenty or a hundred years the therapeutic technique which is offered in this volumewill appear to be obsolete. Should this not prove to be the case, then the author’s faith in theinventiveness of his fellow man will not have been justified. We have here something whichhas not before existed, an invariably working science of Mind. The application methodscannot but be refined.All sciences been with the discovery of basic axioms. They progress as new data isdiscovered and as the scope of the science is widened. Various tools and techniques rise upcontinually, improved and re-improved. The basic axioms, the initial discoveries of dianeticsare such solid scientific truths that they will be altered but little. The data discovered by thoseaxioms is already large and daily expanding. The techniques of using that data as represented inthis volume will, before much more time elapses, be modified and improved. Their virtue justnow is that these techniques work and produce good, solid, scientific results.Once upon a time somebody set up the basic principles which had to do with fire. Therehad not been controlled fire before. Cooking, heating and finally metallurgy made a newculture. The basic principles of fire are not much altered. The techniques employed in handlingfire soon after it was discovered by Man would be considered somewhat obsolete to us now.We have matches and lighters and fuels today, but just after fire was understood and began tobe used, the bow-drill fire-maker and flint and steel would have been considered marvelousinventions: even so Man was already using fire and had been using it with profit for some timeboth as a weapon and as a household utility when the bow-drill and flint and steel werediscovered or invented.In the case of the wheel, basic principles were laid down which have not altered to thisday. The first workable wheel must have been a rather unwieldy affair. But compared to nowheel, it was a miracle.Thus with dianetic therapy. The basic principles, axioms and general discoveries ofdianetics form an organization not before possessed by Man. Not unlike the first fires and thefirst wheels, the therapy technique can be enormously improved. It works now; it can be usednow with safety and effectiveness.There are two definite drawbacks to this present technique. It demands more skill of theauditor than should be necessary and it is not as swift as it could be. The auditor should not berequired to do any computing whatever and indeed, a therapy technique could be envisionedwhere no auditor at all was necessary, for he is vital at the present time. A complete clearshould take but a handful of hours. The problems here are those of improvement in terms ofless skill required and less work.One might say that it is an imposition upon a mathematician and philosopher to requirehim to resolve all the problems himself and to put forth all improvements. Indeed, it is animposition that he be required to develop any technique of application at all, for there should bein any society an apportionment of labor.252"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"When the basic axioms and computations were finished, it was impossible to releasethem for there were none to whom such research could be released for application. Thus thework had to be carried out to its furthest extent of not only experimentation but thedevelopment and proof of the techniques of application.One might here use an analogy of bridge engineering. Let us suppose that two plateausexist, one higher than the other, with a canyon between them. An engineer sees that if thecanyon could be crossed by traffic, the hitherto unused higher plateau, being much more fertileand pleasant, would become the scene of a new culture. He sets himself the task of building abridge. It has been supposed that no bridge could be built across the canyon and indeed, sincethose on the lower plateau could not see the higher level, the existence of the higher plateauitself was denied. The engineer, by evolving new principles of bridge building and discoveringnew significance in his materials, manages to throw a bridge across the canyon. He himselfcrosses and he inspects the plateau carefully; others cross over his bridge and examine the newterrain with delight. Still more and more cross the bridge. The bridge is solid and, if not wide,can yet safely be negotiated. It has not been built for heavy fast traffic. But it contains the basicprinciples and axioms by which the canyon can be spanned again and again. Many peoplebegin to approach the canyon and look up.What sort of an opinion would you have of the society on the lower plateau if they butmoaned and wept and argued and gave no hand at all in the matter of widening the bridge ormaking new bridges?In this handbook we have the basic axioms and a therapy which works.For God’s sake, get busy and build a better bridge!253"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"APPENDIX IThe Philosophic MethodScience seems always to advance, while philosophy seems always to lose ground. Yetthis is only because philosophy accepts the hard and hazardous task of dealing with problemsnot yet open to the methods of science -- problems like good and evil, beauty and ugliness,order and freedom, life and death; so soon as a field of inquiry yields knowledge susceptible ofexact formulation it is called science. Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art; itarises in hypothesis and flows into achievement. Philosophy is a hypothetical interpretation ofthe unknown, ... or of the inexactly known ... it is the front trench in the siege of truth.Science is the captured territory; and behind it are those secure regions in which knowledge andart build our imperfect and marvelous world. Philosophy seems to stand still, perplexed; butonly because she leaves the fruits of victory to her daughters the sciences, and herself passeson, divinely discontent, to the uncertain and the unexplored.Shall we be more technical? Science is analytical description, philosophy is syntheticinterpretation. Science wishes to resolve the whole into parts, the organism into organs, theobscure into the known. It does not inquire into the values and ideal possibilities of things, norinto their total and final significance; it is content to show their present actuality and operation,it narrows its gaze resolutely to the nature and process of things as they are. The scientist is asimpartial as Nature in Turgenev’s poem: he is as interested in the leg of a flea as in the creativethroes of a genius. But the philosopher is not content to describe the fact; he wishes to ascertainits relation to experience in general, and thereby to get at its meaning and its worth; hecombines things in interpretive synthesis; he tries to put together, better than before, that greatuniverse-watch which the inquisitive scientist has analytically taken apart. Science tells us howto heal and how to kill; it reduces the death rate in retail and then kills us wholesale in war; butonly wisdom -- desire coordinated in the light of all experience -- can tell us when to heal andwhen to kill. To observe processes and to construct means is science; to criticize and coordinateends is philosophy: and because in these days our means and instruments have multipliedbeyond our interpretation and synthesis of ideals and ends, our life is full of sound and fury,signifying nothing. For a fact is nothing except in relation to desire; it is not complete except inrelation to a purpose and a whole. Science without philosophy, facts without perspective andvaluation, cannot save us from havoc and despair. Science gives us knowledge, but onlyphilosophy can give us wisdom.Will Durant254"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"APPENDIX IIThe Scientific MethodThe Scientific Method is based solidly on definite rules, but is none the less, like theAmerican Way of Life, something that must be lived to be fully understood. The United Stateshas a Constitution, but the American Way of Life is far more than that; so the Scientific Methodis, while based on certain readily cited rules, far more than those rules.For one thing, the Scientific Method implies zestfully, gleefully attacking, with everyavailable weapon of logic, every possible logical loophole in -- your own structure of logic andtheory. It requires that a man tear into his carefully built theory with the vim, vigor and spite ofhis worst enemy. It implies that a scientist’s best friend will review his work starting with thepremise that it’s all wrong and do his best to prove it’s wrong.For the intellectual triumph, the warm glow of victory in science, comes not fromproducing a new theory -- but from producing a new theory that stands up, and is useful, evenwhen the most knowing make deliberate attempts to find a flaw.The Scientific Method is behind the testing of Navy armor plate. The production of aperfect piece of 16-inch armor plate is routine and gives no special satisfaction. But theproduction of a slab of 16-inch armor plate with a 16-inch armor-piercing projectile with itsnose buried in that armor, a plate bulged, distorted, but unpierced and unbroken -- that istriumph and satisfaction. We don’t test the 16-inch plate with machine-gun fire, or with 6-inchprojectiles. Test it with the heaviest, deadliest weapons you’ve got; then, and only then, do youhave something to be proud of.So with a theory.There are rules for argument that lead to the building of a theory; they can be condensedto three key, critical points, the sense of which is clear. The problem in application is thesubtlety with which violations of those rules can creep in. The critical rules are:1. Argument by appeal to authority is of no value whatever.2. The observation, not the observer’s report, are the important data.3. No theory, however well-established or long-held, can stand in the face of onerelevant, contradictory fact.The first of those rules is the one that is most often violated, usually quiteunintentionally and without realizing it. Everybody knows that appeal to authority is no soundway to argue a case, even if the authority happens to be right. Yet so subtle can appeal toauthority be that, it is exceedingly easy to miss noticing its insertion; the preceding sentence,for instance, deliberately exemplifies one type of very easily missed “appeal to authority,”actually the most common of all such appeals. “Everybody knows,” “of course,” “naturally”and similar phrases are the slipperiest customers in that respect. “Everybody knew” the worldwas flat for a long, long time, and “of course” the Sun went around the Earth, as any foolcould plainly see. And common clay and the precious ruby have nothing in common --nothing, that is, except the same elements in somewhat different proportions.But even the less subtle appeal-to-authority that is stamped with the Great Name is asource of immense amounts of trouble. It was not Aristotle’s fault that, for nearly a thousandyears, science was stopped still by consistent appeal to Aristotle; he didn’t claim he knew allthe answers -- the scholastic arguers did. Even today, in an age which has some understandingof the scientific method, Great Name arguments show up -- except, of course, that the GreatName himself has become a Great Name by most carefully refraining from using that method!255"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"The sentence, “Einstein says that nothing is faster than the speed of light; it is theoreticallyimpossible,” contains two arguments by appeal to authority, and sounds so learnedly scientificthat anyone might be taken in by it. Saying a thing is “theoretically impossible” is, actually,appeal to the authority of present theories. But a theory is not a fact -- it’s an intelligent set ofopinions, and no more, as any scientist realizes. So far as the Great Name argument goes,those are easy to spot, and their value comes into focus very quickly if you simply substitutethe arbitrary name “Joe Doakes” for the Great Name. The corrected, scientific-method sentenceabove -- so far as argumentative value goes -- would read, “Joe Doakes says nothing is fasterthan the speed of light; in his informed opinion it appears impossible.”Scientifically, there is no difference whatever between the two statements, so far asevidential value goes. The evidence-statement on the subject would read, “Einstein suggested,and physical experiment appears to prove, that nothing is faster than the speed of light; currentphysical theory, which seems to fit most of the observed data, indictates it is impossible.”That is, admittedly, a much less solidly satisfying sort of statement. It sounds weak,uncertain of itself or anything else. And it is the sort of statement -- the sort of thinking -- thatwent from the first small scientific evidence of the atomic theory in 1800 to atomic fission inless than a century and a half. It is the scientist -- who operates on the principle that he doesn’talready know all the answers -- who is out looking for new and better answers. A man whothinks in terms of “This is the answer. I know this is true. That is impossible, because itdisagrees with what I know,” does not have to do research. He already knows the answers. Heis in no danger of making new and disturbing discoveries that might upset his certainty ofmind. The scientist, on the other hand, operates with the certain knowledge that he is uncertain;he is never disappointed, for new data is constantly being found -- he’s looking for it -- thatshows that he was, indeed, a bit mistaken.The non-scientist, who likes to work with Truths and Certainties and think inAbsolutes, the method of uncertainties and probabilities seems stifling, an impossible methodof operation. It is so impossible that it produces, in a single century, electric light and power,radio, television, atomics, the entire science of organic chemistry ranging from dyes tosynthetic drugs, automobiles, airplanes -- practically an entirely new civilization.By realizing that no theory is final, complete, or perfect, a new concept is admitted: atheory is good so long as it is useful. It is, naturally, a very pleasant thing if the theory alsohappens to be true, but that (shocking though the thought may be to the layman) is not at allnecessary. The really important question is not, “Is it true?” but “Does it work?” If it works,we can use it and pretend it’s true; if it is true, that’s an added bonus.This reasoning, which seems to some specious and downright dishonest, is the onlymethod so far found that produces results. Look about you: every product that has beentouched by machines in its production is a demonstration of the observed fact that, byprovisionally assuming a theory is true, concrete, useful results can be obtained. And that bymaintaining a willingness to discard or modify that theory at the first sign of failure, progress ismade.For if a theory is good only when it works, then the first time it fails to work -- the firstfact it encounters which does not fit -- the theory must be discarded, and a new and better onefound. Only someone who insists that a theory is Truth would hesitate to discard a theory thatdidn’t work. And a scientist never insists that a theory is Truth; only that it is useful.When an apparent contradiction appears, however, the most careful checking must beinstituted. First: check the interpretation of the theory. The basic concepts of the theory mightbe right, and the application of those concepts wrong. The reinterpretation of the theory mayexplain the new fact. Second, and actually simultaneously, remember that the observation, notthe observer’s report, is the datum, and repeat the observations. The observer may have beenwrong. Men can’t see beyond the violet or below the red; quinine makes a man’s ears ring, sohe hears sounds that aren’t there, and no man can hear sounds above 20,000 cycles when they256"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"are there. Under ultraviolet light, the human eyeball glows slightly, so that one sees a mist oflight that isn’t there, but since we can’t see ultraviolet light itself, an observer will not see thesource of ultraviolet that is there. Always check the observations; the observer may be wrong.But actual observations, tacts, are never wrong.One source of a lot of misunderstanding is the difference between theoreticalimpossibility and factual impossibility. That is best illustrated, perhaps, by the old story of theman who telephoned his lawyer, explained a legal contretemps, and was told, “Don’t worryabout it; they can’t put you in jail for that!” The client replied, “I’m calling from the jail.”A slight change on that might demonstrate reverse aspect. Make the troubled caller acircus owner; this time we’ll say the lawyer replies, “That’s serious. I’m afraid they can putyour elephant in jail for that.”In each case, theory is in conflict with physical fact; in each case, as it invariably mustby the very nature of things, theory, not fact, breaks down.But all of this is, in essence, a discussion of the scientific method of argument, ofthought. There is, at the root of it all, the scientific technique, the final test and proving groundof all scientific thinking. Ideally, the scientific method follows seven steps:1. Make a series of careful observations.A. These observations must be repeated, and are acceptable as observations only ifmany people following the prescribed techniques can duplicate the results.B. Variations of the prescribed techniques must be tried to eliminate the possibilitythat the observed results might be due to a factor other than that intended. As agross example, suppose it is reported that a magnet will attract objects.Demonstration show it does attract and lift iron balls; that is Step A above.Now variations of the experiment show that the magnet attracts iron but notcopper, silver, etc. The observed effect -- attraction -- is real. Variation of theoriginal experiment is needed to show the actual limits of the effect.2. Combining all relevant data, from all relevant experiments, formulate a hypothesis.A. The hypothesis must explain all observed data.B. It must not demand as a consequence of its logical development, the existenceof phenomena that do not, in fact, exist.C. But it should indictate the existence of real, hitherto unobserved facts.3. Using the hypothesis, predict new facts.A. A logical structure broad enough to explain all observed, relevant phenomenawill necessarily imply further phenomena that have not yet been observed. Usethis mechanism to predict the existence of something which, under previoustheories, would not exist.4. Perform an experiment and make observations on these predictions.5. As a result of the experiment, discard the hypothesis, or advance it now to the status of“Theory.”6. Make further predictions, further experiments, and collect more observational evidenceuntil a contradictory relevant fact is found.257"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"7. Discard the old theory, take the new total of observational data, and form a newhypothesis.8. See Step Three.This process seems, at first glance, a completely circular, going-nowhere system. Itisn’t; the 50-passenger airliner flying by just overhead testifies to that. Notice that each timeround that cycle the new hypothesis shows how to get new data, new experimental evidence,new information. The process is not circular; it’s an expanding spiral, and each sweep aroundit covers a broader and broader field of understanding.But the most important step of all -- the one that took men longest to make once the ideaof organized knowledge was started -- is Step Seven. “Discard the old theory ... and start allover again.” It’s hard for men -- who are basically conventional, status-quo animals! to give upthe comfortable familiarity, the nice, easy routine, of that Old Time Theory, to embark on acompletely new system that calls for a total revision of all their thoughts. It’s so easy andcomfortable to believe that the old theory is Truth, and doesn’t and won’t ever need changing,even if it doesn’t work all the time. Like an old pair of shoes, it is comfortable, and familiar,even if the holes are apparent.The true scientist is in a somewhat different position. He starts off with any theory andfinds it useful only so long as it works. If it no longer works, it should be discarded, and anew, better one fashioned.And that is an old, comfortable familiar theory that you can settle down into, and stickwith for life. Expect change; you can be sure you won’t be disappointed.John W.

It may be likened to the schematic diagram of an electrical circuit,in which the position and relationship of elements derive from the connections to them and notfrom their placing on the page. The connecting lines represent paths for the transmission ofmessages which control activity. In this activity we can trace three separate behavior patterns.First is the basic cycle of automatic physical adjustment, involving only the LifeFunction Regulator as it regulates the life processes of the Organism. This cycle involves thecontinuous metering of body conditions, such as heart rate, temperature, digestion, with theissue of orders through the automatic nervous system to correct untoward conditions as theydevelop. Here lies control of circulation, respiration, perspiration, endocrine secretion and allother body fluid flow, and hence control of metabolism itself for each part of the body and forthe whole. The Life Function Regulator, like the governor of an engine, balances the lifeprocesses against each other and against the environment of the Organism, through the simplecycle of measure and correct, measure and correct, measure and correct.It is to be noted that the Life Function Regulator in operating to regulate the Organismregulates the physical aspects of the Analyzer, the Standard Memory, the Reactive Mind andthe Learned Motion Pattern Responder, all of which are parts of the Organism. The functionsof these parts are described at suitable points in the development of the behavior patternsinvolving them.Second is the cycle of reasoned behavior. The phases of this cycle are the receipt ofpercepts by the Analyzer, the comparison of these percepts with the contents of the StandardMemory and the selection of relevant data, the computation of possible actions and the choiceof action to be taken, and the transmission to the Organism of orders which result in thataction. These orders are ordinarily converted from relatively simple to complex patterns in theLearned Motion Pattern Responder, whose function is commonly attributed to the spinal cord.Reasoned behavior is rarely recyclic, because each act changes the relationship of the Organismto its environment, thereby changing the percepts, so that the next act differs in a progressivepattern.The Standard Memory, on which the Analyzer depends fur data, is a tremendous file ofrecordings covering every sight, sound, smell or other perception of the individual’s life,awake or asleep. The only exceptions are that it does not record pain and that it does not receivedata when the Gate is closed during “unconsciousness.” Such data are recorded in the ReactiveMind, to be discussed later, and cannot be transferred automatically to the Standard Memoryafter consciousness is restored, because the recordings of pain and unconsciousness with themprevent access by the Analyzer. For the same reason they are not available for consciousrecall. The contents of the Standard Memory are complete and detailed, including shades ofcolors and timbres of sounds, and are indexed accurately by time, by topic, and by value to theOrganism.The Analyzer is a calculating machine arranged to analyze each situation in the light ofavailable data and to determine and direct the next acts of the Organism so as best to enable theindividual, his progeny, associates, and environment to survive. Except for bias towardsurvival, which is essential to the continued exercise of its faculties, the Analyzer is self-determined, and is the seat of choice in the human being. Its ability is so highly developed thatit can handle several problems at once, involving procedures whose basic patterns are compare-select-act or compare-select-combine. This computing is ordinarily carried on below the levelof awareness, not in language but in concepts, with only the premises and solutions appearing.259"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"In emergencies which raise the necessity level the Analyzer not only orders thevoluntary kind of behavior but also assumes control of the Life Function Regulator in order toquicken the whole performance of the bodily machine. By this means it suppresses thebehavior of the Reactive Mind.Third is the cycle of reactive behavior. This cycle compasses automatic, or stimulus-response, behavior of such elaborateness that it is often mistakenly supposed to be volitionaland deliberate. The phases of this cycle are the receipt of percepts by the Reactive Mind, wherethey stimulate reactions, the transmission of these reactions to the Organism as commands, thephysical response of the organism to these reactive commands, and new percepts arising fromthe physical activity. This cycle of perceive and react, perceive and react, may occur once, mayrepeat in a spiral of increasing vigor, or may develop a series of cycles progressively varied intheir nature. Each of these response patterns will contain emotion, speech, motion and psycho-somatic disturbances in varying proportions.The exact nature of reactive behavior will follow precisely, congruently, the content ofmemories in the Reactive Mind. These memories cover only perceptions received and recordedduring “unconsciousness” and in the presence of pain. They therefore cover events or groupsof events in which the individual has been a passive participant, but include data from all thesenses.Reactive Mind memories are restimulated, or triggered, by percepts which are at leastfragmentarily congruent with them, such as a word or group of words, a smell, a scene or ablow. The effect of repeated or extensive restimulation is to increase the sensitivity of thestimulus-response cells in which these memories may be conceived to be held, so that smallerand smaller restimulations suffice to trigger reactive behavior. Conversely, in the absence ofrestimulators these cells become less and less sensitive, so that strong, extensive or repeatedrestimulation becomes necessary to produce reactive behavior. It is to be noted that thisthreshold is lowered by illness, injury or fatigue, as we often see in when people go “all topieces” in a state of over-fatigue. The variation of sensitivity with degree of restimulation isindependent for each memory of an event or group of events deriving from a separate period of“unconsciousness.” It is apparent, however, that if portions of two or more such memories areidentical, they will have common restimulators and will restimulate each other through theirdramatization in reactive behavior.Since Reactive Mind memories contain pain and “unconsciousness,” it follows thatthese will appear to some degree in the dramatizations of these memories in reactive behavior,through action on the Life Function Regulator. The dramatization of pain, with its concomitantlife function disturbances, can interfere seriously with organic function, particularly byaffecting all kinds of body fluid flow. This mechanism is at the root of psycho-somatic illness.The dramatization of “unconsciousness” can interfere with rational behavior by causingtemporary or partial Analyzer shutdown, with the filing of additional memories in the ReactiveMind instead of the Standard Memory. Through this mechanism the content of the ReactiveMind can multiply itself in the presence of chronic restimulators until the behavior of theindividual becomes mostly or entirely reactive and the person is judged insane.The three cycles of activity described may be followed readily on the diagram, whereeach forms a closed loop. The tempo of the whole is determined by the Life Force of theindividual, which manifests itself physically as tenacity in life and mentally as vigor andpersistence. This Life Force is not to be confused with physical vigor, which depends also onhealth, or with “energy,” which depends in part on the content of the Reactive Mind. The LifeForce should not be looked on as the fuel for the engine, but rather as the ignition.260"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"APPENDIX III(B)Analyzer SchematicThis schematic diagram is a device which enables us to resolve the Analyzer intocomponents with an arrangement capable of explaining analogically its observed behavior asthe conscious computing, counselling and control agency of the Organism. The schematic doesthis by placing the various elements conveniently and interconnecting them with circuitpathways to show the flow of signals and messages.The key to understanding the Analyzer is the idea of multiple attention. It possesses aconsiderable number of units of attention, perhaps a score, and can devote them to a large or asmall area of activity. Each of these units may be considered to be a separate computer circuitcapable of compare-choose-combine or compare-select-act calculations. The input, or attention,end of each of these computers may then be considered to be one of the lines of an attentionswitchboard. The incoming trunks from any area of activity to which attention is paid will carryin all perceptions, data from the Standard Memory and, when necessary, output data from thecomputers themselves.Complementary to the attention switchboard we must postulate an action switchboardwhich can direct the results of thought to the Organism as action orders, to other computers forfurther thought, or to the Standard Memory for filing or for delayed action.The diagram shows these two switchboards with the computers between them, theincoming and outgoing trunk lines, and a group of interconnecting trunk lines which handleinformation being routed back from output to input fur further use. It also shows separately acontrol center and a consciousness monitor, which must be described carefully in order toavoid errors in using such words as “awareness” and “consciousness.”The control center monitors all circuits and orders attention and action by acting asswitchboard operator. It is thus another and more elaborate compare-select-act computer,exercising the function of personality. The diagram shows the connections for monitoring andcontrol, and also the Life Force connection through which the whole Analyzer is animated. It isimportant to note that the control center operates continuously (but in varying degree ofalertness), whether the individual is awake or asleep, going entirely out of operation onlyduring complete unconsciousness.The consciousness monitor is that element which defines our conscious awareness, ourcontinuity of past, present and future, our ability to look out of our eyes and say, “This is I,looking out of here.” While the control center is aware as a normal part of its operation cycle ofperceive, judge and act, the consciousness monitor is more than aware; it is aware of beingaware. It integrates the pattern of perception, not on a calculator basis, but on a display basis,producing a unified outlook. It is partly like the display panel in the control room of a largemachine, which, when a button is pressed, shows in moving light the inner working of themachine, whose processes go on whether the button is pressed or not.The consciousness monitor, however, goes out of operation when the curtain of sleepis drawn. And with it there go out of operation the first group of computers, all of which itmonitors. The second group of computers, which it also monitors, do not necessarily ceaseoperation at this time. In a light sleep the individual retains these attention units alert. As sleepdeepens, however, they go out of operation one by one until in deepest sleep only the lowestgroup of computers, which are unmonitored, remain in operation.These unmonitored computers provide the attention for a watchman function, to wakenus when peril looms. They also provide creative imagination for the solving of problems whilewe sleep, and for the fabrication of airy structures in dreams. Less spectacular but equallyimportant is their day-labor of scanning the Standard Memory for relevant data for every daily261"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"computation in the moment-by-moment recalculation of the Organism’s position with respect tosurvival and its next move to further that end. (Survival is here considered a spectrum, fromself at one end to all life at the other.)One trunk is shown entering the attention switchboard which existed but was unknownand unused save as a dream channel before dianetics. It is that from the Reactive Mind, and theAnalyzer is unable to connect to it in its normal operation. With outside help, during therapy,however, a large number of units of attention may be directed along this trunk for the recoveryof engrams from the Reactive Mind.D. H.

It is not vital that he knowanything at all about the technique of processing or that he understand dianetics; all this isinherent in him and he will respond and work as desired by the auditor. In short, the auditorneed not explain anything except those items listed below.1. The pre-clear should take vitamin B1 while in therapy. It requires a certain mentalenergy to carry through with therapy and B1 is intimately connected with that energy’sgeneration. If he doesn’t take B1 he may have nightmares now and then. Ten to twentymilligrams a day are sufficient.2. The pre-clear can in no way be damaged by dianetic technique. It is not hypnotism inany remote sense of the word; in the process he remains entirely awake and is able topull himself out of any situation he feels he cannot face.3. The auditor is not interested in anything the pre-clear has himself done. The data maybe of some aid, of course, but it is not at all vital to a resolution of the case. Theauditor is interested in what has been done to not what has been done by the pre-clear.Hence wild efforts to cover up material in the belief that the auditor will discoversomething bad in the pre-clear’s life are all wasted, for the auditor doesn’t want toknow about it anyway. Further, the pre-clear can save a lot of an auditor’s time bysimply going into therapy without large preambles about guilt or sorrows. The auditorwill ask for the personal relationships he needs such as attitude toward father andmother, grandparents and friends as well as the current environment. The auditorknows what he wants to know and the pre-clear doesn’t. Therefore, just answer thequestions. If the pre-clear is a junior (named after a relative) or if he was raised in afamily which spoke some foreign tongue he should volunteer this informationimmediately. He should also tell the auditor if he has ever had any shock treatment orbrain operations. Beyond that, random self-revelation has no use and only wastes timewhich could be better expended in work.4. If the pre-clear has had some therapy such as psycho-analysis, he may tend to carry a“remembering” habit into dianetic process. Remaining in present time and“remembering” does no good. Dianetics has no relationship with past mental treatment.It is entirely mechanistic and works with engineering precision.5. The pre-clear sometimes feels a vanity in a knowledge of some study of mental healing.It will not be of great use to him in dianetics. Arguing about dianetics with the auditorwill not accomplish any therapy. If the pre-clear wants to know about dianetics, theauditor can tell him where he can buy a copy of the handbook. The auditor’s time iswasted by endless argument over whether or not this or that is a fact. Entered intoactual therapy, only then can the pre-clear understand the validity of dianetics. Withoutstudying or experiencing at least as much as a demonstration run on the time track, thepre-clear can know little about dianetics. Short of knowing, the arguer has no data andall urge to argue thus proceeds from prejudice; there is no substitute for knowledge.6. The pre-clear should know that the total process of therapy is a complete recall of hislife and complete refiling of engrams (moments of actual “unconsciousness”) asexperience and memory. The pre-clear is not being asked to get rid of anything nor ishe being asked to believe anything.7. The pre-clear should understand that any attitude of antagonism or skepticism or evenapathy or a “desire” to neglect his engrams is derived wholly from the engramsthemselves and that these dictate his attitudes in a large measure. If he does not like the263"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"auditor personally, then the auditor has some counterpart in an engram. Other auditorscan be found, but this is not a good enough excuse to shift auditors.8. Bombarded by his engrams, the pre-clear is apt to conceive the idea that he talks andacts only from those engrams and that he is never thinking analytically. Repeatertechnique tends to give this conception. It is not a fact, however, that the pre-clearoperates only on engrams. The best and most effective portions of his life, all hisrational acts, concerns and conclusions, are analytical. During therapy he has atendency, at first, to believe everything must be engramic but this is not true. Hisanalytical mind is powerful and active and as therapy progresses he is more and more incommand of his actions and words.9. At first, in therapy, the pre-clear is apt to introvert markedly. This is a temporarycondition, usually, but may extend for some distance into therapy. Gradually he beginsto extrovert. Finally he is no longer interested in his engrams, though he may beinterested in those of others.10. There has long been an incorrect theory that neurosis is the source of mental vigor andambition. This is emphatically false. If the pre-clear believes that his engrams are of anyassistance to him let him go hit his hand hard with a hammer and then argue that he willnow be better at his profession because he has a bruised skin. No engram has anyvalue. The engram is a parasite, regardless of its pretension that it aids the individual.Anything the pre-clear does with engrams he can do far better without engrams. It istrue and valid that experience plays a major role in educating a man and determining hisambitions. Engrams are not experience; they are hidden commands. Only when theyhave been processed by dianetics can their content be properly used in thought andclassified as valid experience. Knowledge of the exact content of his engrams makes aman wiser, but until he knows what they contain they can only drive him and houndhim with pain and reduce his general health and ability to think.11. Once he knows, in the most general sense, that he has engrams, a man can raise hisnecessity level to a point which will overcome them. He does not have to obey hisengrams.12. If the pre-clear is being audited by one who is engaging his first case and has latelystudied dianetics, no apprehension need be felt. No damage can result, even if a largenumber of mistakes are made. The brain cannot be damaged by dianetic therapy.Engrams may be restimulated which contain such a phrase as “Stop it, you are takingmy mind away, piece by piece!” or “You will be well as long as I am with you,” butthese are just engrams and their actual effect may well have been to make the individualquite ill. Have confidence in your auditor. He will become skilled with practice and theskills of dianetics themselves will carry you through. If he is clever and experienced,your auditor may bring about a quicker clear and a more comfortable passage throughtherapy. If he is not experienced, you and he may have some interestingly involvedtimes. But no damage can be done.13. If the pre-clear finds his auditor becoming angry with him, the pre-clear should refer tothe Auditor’s Code. It is there mainly to accelerate therapy and to protect the auditor,but it is of considerable use to the pre-clear who, by every right, should insist that it beobserved. The engrams, when the pre-clear is returned to an early place on the timetrack he follows in therapy, often dictate irrational statements. The auditor shouldunderstand this. While engrams give the pre-clear no license to abuse an auditor whenthe pre-clear is not in session, in actual work the pre-clear should maintain his rights inthe code to be treated fairly no matter what he does or says.14. The pre-clear should not expect the auditor to shoulder all his burdens. The end oftherapy is to make the pre-clear much less a “push-button” machine, pushed around atthe whim of the world which uses his aberrations. The sooner the pre-clear asserts his264"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"own self-determinism and exercises his power of decision in his own affairs, the fastertherapy will advance. Self-determinism comes about automatically. It can be artificiallyinduced by the pre-clear himself who, raising his necessity level to act with entire self-determinism, can meet the end half-way. The auditor is there to audit, not to be anadviser in the pre-clear’s conduct of existence.15. If the pre-clear catches himself lying to the auditor, he should know that he is onlyslowing therapy. If one has pretended war wounds never received or a glittering past,dianetic therapy is no place to carry out the illusion. Such pretenses stem fromaberrations and a clear is not responsible for his own errors in the past once he iscleared, though society may for some time attempt to dictate, aberratedly, otherwise.16. If the pre-clear is being audited by a marriage partner with whom there have been manyquarrels, the way of therapy may be difficult. Either be as forbearing as possible orpersuade some one outside the home to audit. Wrangles over therapy between marriagepartners markedly slow therapy.17. If the pre-clear is a child and is being audited by a parent, the child should be advised toexpress what he feels in therapy, not argued into different or false attitudes from somemistaken parental idea of respect. The parent is already restimulative to the child, beingcontained in many of the child’s engrams; it is therefore possible for the parent toreactivate engrams by being overbearing. The child as a pre-clear should have everyright of an adult including recourse to the Auditor’s Code.18. It is usually worthless for the pre-clear to seek data from relatives. The data is beingsought from a source not necessarily unaberrated, with memory occlusions, and whichhas a personal interest in making everything in the past as creditable as possible. Such arelative may have great power over the pre-clear, being a part of the pre-clear’sengrams. The seeking of data is always an effort to avoid confronting the engramsthemselves and use the relative’s account as a by-pass memory. Experience has taughtthat even when such a relative knows the data and remembers it, some personal interestmay be served in delivering a distorted idea to the pre-clear. If the pre-clear wants hisdata checked by mother or father, be sure that mother or father has inflicted pain on himand is a source of much trouble in the engram bank, no matter what the pre-clearthinks. If the pre-clear wants a confirmation, take it after therapy is completed.19. Should the pre-clear discover that anyone is attempting to prevent him from starting orcontinuing dianetic therapy, the fact should be communicated immediately to the auditorfor this is a useful datum.Anyone attempting to stop an individual from entering therapy either has a use for theaberrations of that individual -- on the “push-button” order -- or has something to hide.In the former case, a fear may exist that when the individual becomes stronger hecannot be handled easily by the complainant or that he may take revenge upon thecomplainant for past acts. In this case, it is true that the clear has no puppet strings andthe fear is well-grounded. As for revenge, the clear, being free from the fears andcommands in his engrams, holds no grudges: his understanding combines with hisstrength; a person is only a menace as long as he is aberrated and he poses no insanethreats when he ceases to be aberrated. When the complainant against the undertakingof therapy fears the disclosure of information, this is the very data which the auditormost needs and which he can obtain through standard therapy. No matter howwonderfully logical are the arguments a wife or a relative may advance against therapy,it has its root in either fear that their control over the patient will be slacked or fear thatdata exists in the patient’s engram bank which is detrimental to them. There is a furtherextension of this case: wives with children may have a fear that therapy will eventuallybe applied to the children, in which case much information might come to light whichthe husband or society “should never know.” In any case, the aberrations of the person265"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"arguing against the undertaking of therapy choose self-interest rather than the welfare ofthe pre-clear. There is no altruistic motive in any attempt to stop therapy.20. The pre-clear should not regard himself as neurotic or insane merely because he wishesto undertake dianetic clearing. The greatest majority of those who will be processed willbe “normal” people. The end of dianetic therapy is not to relieve subnormality but tocreate the optimum individual. Its concern is not with mental derangement but with thecreation of mental freedom. Should anyone infer that the pre-clear engages to becleared because he is “crazy” and that the critic scornfully does not need such a thing,the pre-clear need only point out that one of the ancient tests for insanity was whetheror not the person boasted of his sanity. The average person today contains scores ofmajor engrams. The pre-clear need only indictate that he must be the more sanebecause he is doing something about his engrams and is attempting to gain a morerational plane of existence. Psychiatry and psycho-analysis in specializing in neurosisand psychosis have fostered a public belief that when anyone does anything about hismind he must be neurotic or psychotic. Education is also doing something about themind and yet none would declare all children in schools were neurotic and psychotic.Dianetic therapy specializes in creating the clear and though as a matter of course itresolves mental derangement, a clear is to a current normal person as the current normalperson is to the insane -- such are the gulfs.21. The pre-clear may find himself begging for amnesia trance, hypnosis, drugs and othermeans to “facilitate therapy.” Such yearnings are not derived from any other reasonthan that the pre-clear is afraid to face his own engrams; deep trance does not resolvethis problem. It can be used but is useful mainly on the insane. Dianetic reverie keeps asteady progress and is accompanied by a steady rise in the individual’s health andoutlook. Short-cuts have not proven practical. If they had, they would be included indianetic therapy.22. It is useful to advise the pre-clear that while he may grow as angry as he please at hisrelatives when he discovers what they have done to him, when he is clear he will nolonger be angry and will then have the sometimes arduous task of making friendsagain. This does not excuse the relatives nor does it mean that the auditor should takeumbrage at the pre-clear’s enthusiasm for revenge when he discovers what Mama mayhave done to him or what Papa said; it does mean that whenever a pre-clear has givenvoice to these rancors to the offenders, he has afterwards had to patch up brokenrelations, for when therapy is ended there is no reason nor desire for rage. Therapypasses up a tone scale from apathy, through anger to cheerfulness. At the beginning ofthe case the pre-clear may feel very propitiative toward offenders against him and noteven know they are offenders. Half through a case he may become incensed at theoffenders and indeed, should become angry if the case is progressing at all. At the endof the case he realizes that he was dealing, after all, with aberrees, and he weighs theirdisfavors with their favors and understands without anger. If the pre-clear is a childwho has been badly abused, the auditor may have a difficult time trying to keep himfrom being extremely angry and generally impolite to his parents. The phase is, afterall, only a phase. When cleared the child can love his parents of his own free will andnot out of fear and necessity. Such cases invariably right themselves. When one parentis the auditor, he may have upon his hands at one or another stage of the case, a veryimpertinent and even caustic youngster: if the parent wants the phase to pass, he willpermit the rage to reign and vigorously follow the auditor’s code, giving the child allthe dignity of his righteous anger. After all, the child is entitled to a demonstration afterkeeping it in and living with it for years. He will not recover his feeling of love if thatanger is checked and scolded.23. The health of the pre-clear can be expected to take a roller-coaster aspect duringtherapy. It will not get steadily better on an even curve of progress. It will surgeupward and fall back many times during one session of therapy and will be inconstantfrom day to day as new engrams restimulate and old ones reduce. He will not become266"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"seriously ill and he cannot become as sick as he ordinarily was. But it is disconcertingto the pre-clear to have a nose cold three days after his birth engram was accidentallytouched before it could be reduced; it would alarm a physician who did not know thepatient was in dianetic therapy to watch blood pressure vary and the physical tonechange so rapidly from lows to highs. Yet nothing serious happens and indeed the bulkof therapy is spent in improved and improving physical comfort. But a pre-clearshould not be disheartened or dismayed to find himself with a flicker of “coronarytrouble” on Tuesday, the shadow of a “migraine” on Saturday and a cough onWednesday. These are somatics which sometimes come into restimulation before theycan be reduced. Anything so restimulated by therapy cannot reach any dangerousheights and is of passing duration. They are the illnesses he will never have again andhe should be glad to see them go. A very clever auditor can conduct a whole casewithout restimulating in the period after a session more than an occasional slight ache.But if somatics manifest themselves after and between sessions, do not be surprised,and above all do not interrupt therapy because of these aches and pains; they are less inany case than even a minor illness and are at worst merely uncomfortable. The point is,do not believe, as some patients are apt to do, that the presence of an unidentified acheor pain means anything serious is forecast in the way of illness. In therapy sessionssome mild reproduction of past pain is felt and these may continue on a milder scalebetween sessions, that is all. You won’t get sick, you are getting well.24. The daily work of the pre-clear should never be interrupted and laid aside in the thoughtthat a week or two of dianetics and nothing but dianetics will solve all problems. Ingrade school, high school, and college 18,000 hours are consumed making anindividual a storehouse of knowledge and skill. Many more thousands of hours arespent gathering experience on how to apply the knowledge and develop the skill. Indianetic therapy, a clearing of all occlusions puts the individual into possession of all hehas ever studied, heard and learned and takes away the clumsiness and errors whichmay have inhibited his reaching the height where he belongs. It would be worth 10,000additional hours of time to recover and be able to use and apply the knowledge,experience and skills of a lifetime. One receives a bonus of increased health, happinessand longevity, an increase in longevity which is at least a hundred to one for every hourof therapy. Yet therapy all the way to a clear takes far, far less than 10,000 hours ofwork. A case is as long as it has quality and quantity of engrams: if it takes a thousandhours, then blame the parents, not therapy. Yet few cases should consume a thousandhours even in unskilled hands and the bulk of them should take at most two or threehundred hours, a paltry amount of time compared to the thousands of hours of“forgotten” education, the tens of thousands of hours of occluded reading andexperience which will be recovered, completely in addition to health, happiness andlongevity. There is no Royal Road to Clear; it takes as long as it takes. The pre-clearshould then settle his mind on the fact that he will be in therapy for some time. Heshould not hold off making decisions or hang his life on the end product of beingcleared. Of course he will be impatient. Of course he will attempt to speed the processall he can and that is good.But he should not forget to carry along his life nor should he abandon his diversions orhis work. It has been proven that pre-clears follow a rapidly advancing curve ofprogress and that from week to week their potential rises. It has been observed that theyneglect to remember (since it is no longer important to them in any way) that aberrationsare fleeing from them at a rapid rate. In dianetics one does not “learn how to live withhis troubles.” The troubles vanish like the bubbles in a ship’s wake. One does not keepthem in mind and remember that the reason one does not like spinach was because Papabeat him when he would not eat it. The engram, refiled, does not inhibit the eating ofspinach and Papa’s beating is no longer a source of pain. The troubles are gone.Therefore, it sometimes appears to the pre-clear, who looks only at the engrams ahead,that he is standing still. The auditor may have to ask him how he felt this time lastAugust and make the pre-clear ponder it well before the pre-clear recalls that last August267"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"whenever he tried to write a letter he became nervous, that he hated his children’sracket, and that rain made him wonder about suicide. When he has compared hisexistence at his present level in therapy and his level shortly after he entered therapy,the pre-clear will agree he has made progress.In the next breath he is asking the auditor about possible identity of the ally they havejust scented in the case. The pre-clear, in other words, recognizes no progress, since allprogress is by loss of aberration; blind to this he tends to be extremely anxious andaggressive about getting along with therapy and does not stop being so (unless he isnear the start and is a “neglect-engram” case) until one day he finds himself cleared. Onthat day he takes a glance at the fact that he is cleared and is already wading knee-deepin the enthusiastic business of living. So do not stop looking at the exterior world orliving in it for the period of therapy. Take clearing interestedly but as routine to befollowed. Give as much time to it as can be afforded and give the rest to life. And don’tscold the auditor because work was started Tuesday and here it is Thursday and one isnot yet cleared.25. The pre-clear should thank the auditor after each session. And he should tell the auditorwhen he feels better and that he appreciates progress whenever progress has beenmade. The pre-clear introverts and forgets that the auditor deserves some courtesy. Thisis more important than is readily realized. Even the best of auditors are human.26. The pre-clear has his own responsibility in aiding his own case. He has just as active apart in locating engrams as the auditor. The pre-clear who expects to be run throughdianetic therapy as though he were a car, with no volition of his own, slows his caseenormously.27. The pre-clear who is being handled by an auditor less forceful than himself either frominherent personality or aberrations is liable to dictate to the auditor where they will lookfor engrams and what they will do about them. Remember that if a man knew hisengrams they would not be engrams. Only an exterior mind, the auditor, knows what isbest for the case. The pre-clear who attempts this is wasting his and the auditor’s time.At the start of the session the pre-clear may dictate that, as he has a headache, theyshould put him back to a certain accident and see if that is it and so get rid of theheadache. The headache isn’t important, ever. Getting engrams that will erase or reduceis important. All such dictations are “dodges,” aberrated efforts to avoid engrams. Theless forceful auditor, man or woman, should recognize a “dodge” when they see oneand the pre-clear, knowing this, should abandon this avoidance technique and let theauditor audit.28. The pre-clear should understand that the auditor is restrained in many ways by theAuditor’s Code. The pre-clear should know the code and, knowing it, should notimpose unreasonably upon the auditor’s time or patience, for the auditor also has a lifeto live and out of courtesy and the code, may be imposed upon without being able toprevent it. Be thoughtful.29. There is one major motto in therapy for the pre-clear: “The only way out of it isthrough it!” Remember this. When the auditor says to go through the engram, be it everso threatening, do not beg to come to present time for that brings the engram with it.Two or three runs and the power of that engram is broken forever. “The only way outof it is through it!” Remember that.30. The pre-clear is the only one who “knows” what has been done to him. It may not beimmediately in conscious recall, it may require dozens of hours to find specificinformation as to what people have done. But all the data is there, available for recall intherapy. If the data is not there, then it is not aberrative; if the data is there, it isaberrative. Only the pre-clear “knows” how long the case will take, only the pre-clear“knows” how many allies he is trying to disguise. The pre-clear may not be able to268"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"immediately recall it, but the information is there; he “knows” it.

Neither the auditor nor dianetics “knows”what the content of the pre-clear’s engrams may be; only he knows that.
