It is not necessary tostudy the introductory chapters in order to get started in Self Analysis. The reader may turn atonce to page 39 and follow the simple directions there and begin immediately upon selfprocessing.Or the reader may turn first to page 31 and take the first test and by it learn accuratelyhis potentials and future and so be able to measure, by taking these tests from time to time, hisimprovement under the processing section.Or he may begin at the beginning and find out such interesting things as the basic goalof life, the role language plays in existence, and the basics of human behavior as well as themechanisms of the human mind.This volume includes an explanation of the principles involved, a set of examinationswhich the reader administers to himself, a tone scale which delineates the classes of humanpersonality into which all human beings fall, and the selfprocessing section.Simply by answering the questions contained in the various processing sections, theconcerns and worries of the individual’s life resolve automatically.A card is provided for the readers use which he rotates from question to question andwhich tells him what sense perception to give attention to in the memories revoked.Self Analysis is simple and easy. Only a vast and complete understanding of the humanmind such as that possessed by L. Ron Hubbard could evolve such a system. For although thereader may never be aware of it, an enormous amount of technical knowledge and experienceunderlies Dianetic Self Analysis.In using Self Analysis the reader will experience things he had not thought possible.For anything as fundamental as this system, capable of producing the results it produces, couldnot be otherwise than powerful.A system such as Self Analysis has never before been possible for the basic laws ofhuman thought and behavior were not known until L. Ron Hubbard applied his brilliance andhis trainir.g in the field of atomic and molecular phenomena to the field of human thought.His discoveries and the results he has achieved with them have rocked the savants andold schools of thought to their roots, leaving Dianetics the only validated method of increasingsanity and happiness known to man.It is not necessary for you to take anyone’s statement for it. Apply Self Analysis for ashort time and feel the results for yourself. If you are truly skeptical have yourself testedthoroughly by doctors and psychometrists, use the self-processing section for half an hour aday for a month and then cause the tests to be repeated. If you have been faithful to your task,the change in you should be sufflciently marked to cause a considerable stir. Things like thishave simply never happened before—increased intelligence, faster reaction time, improvedphysical condition, a happier outlook on life and much more likely to be liked by your friends.After their initial antagonism—understandable because Dianetics thoroughly invalidatedtheir beliefs and teachings— leadingauthoritiesnowadmit that Dianetics accomplishes thingsnever before possible in the humanities.Self Analysis and its organization is in itself a triumph, for it gives the benefits ofDianetics to everyone. The scholarly and very intelligent reader can pursue the explanations andaxioms contained herein and explore the whole of Dianetics through more basic tests on the1"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"subject. But the reader who cares little for the technicalities and only wants results can benefitby following the simplest directions.This volume and its system of Self Analysis is not intended for the severely neurotic orpsychotic person but only for the reasonably stable individual, to increase his ability,efficiency, well-being and longevity.THE EDITORS2"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION;Self Analysis cannot revive the dead.Self Analysis will not empty insane asylums or stop war. These are the tasks of theDianetic Auditor and the Group Dianetic Techniaan.But Se]f Analysis will conduct you on the most interesting adventure in your life. Theadventure of you.How efficient are you? What are your potentials? How much can you improve ? Well,basically your intentions toward yourself and your fellow man are good. Basically, ifsometimes clouded over with the not so pale cast of bad experience, your potentialities are agreat deal better than anyone ever permitted you to believe.Take your memory, a small part of your total assets. Is it perfect? Can you, at will,recall everything you have ever learned or heard, every phone number, every name? If youcan’t you can see that there is room for improvement. Now somebody, with a half glance at thetitle page of this book, will try to assume that Self Analysis simply improves memory. That islike saying that all a train can do is meet schedules. It does much more. But memory is astarter. If your memory were as accurate as an IBM card index system and even faster, youwould be more efficient and more comfortable and it would certainly save writing those notesyou have to make. Yes, you probably couldn’t have too good a memory on things you’vestudied and things you need.But there are a lot of things as important as memory. There’s your reaction time. Mostpeople react too slowly in emergencies. Let’s say it, takes you half a second to pull your handoff a hot stove. That’s many times too long a period to have your hand on that stove.Or let’s say you require a third of a second to see the car ahead stop and to start to puton your own brakes. That’s too long. A lot of accidents happen because of slow reaction time.In the case of an athlete, reaction time is a direct index as to how capable he may be in asport. So it assists one in many ways to be able to react quickly.Self Analysis speeds up reaction time. Here’s a trick. Take a dollar bill, unfolded. Havesomebody hold it vertically above your hand. Open your thumb and index finger just below thelower edge of the bill. Now let your friend let go. You try to close thumb and index finger onthe bill. Did you miss it, snapping after it had gone all the way through? That’s very slowreaction. Did you catch it by its upper edge when it was almost gone? That’s much too slow.Did you catch it on Washington’s face? That’s fair. Or did you catch it on the lower edge, evenbefore it really got started? That’s the way it should be. Less accidents, greater generalalertness. Well, barring actual physical damage to hand or arm, Self Analysis will speed that upfor you.Do you have trouble going to sleep or getting up? Do you feel a little tired a lot of thetime ? Well, that can be remedied.As for what they call psycho-somatic illnesses—sinusitis, allergies, some heart trouble,“bizarre” aches and pains, poor eyesight, arthritis, etc., etc., etc., down through seventy percent of man’s ills, Self Analysis should be able to help markedly.Then there’s the matter of how young or old you may look. Self Analysis can makequite a change there.3"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"And there’s the matter of plain ordinary ability to be happy in life and enjoy things. Andthere Self Analysis shines brightly for it can raise your tone fast enough, usually, so that evenyou will agree things can be good.As my boyhood hero, Charles Russell, the painter, once described a certain potion,“It’d make a jack rabbit spit in a wolf’s eye”. Now maybe Self Analysis doesn’t always havethis effect, but it happens regularly enough to be usual. Certain it is that the user often goesthrough such a period, much to the alarm of his friends. Self Analysis does have an effect as inthe song: “I can lick that guy, I can kiss that girl,“I can ride that bronc and make him whirl . . .”The moral and caution is “Don’t pick too big a wolf”. At least not until you’ve beenusing this for a while and kind of get things in proportion again.In short this is an adventure. How good can you get?A lot depends on how good you are potentially—but you can be assured that that’s a lotbetter than you ever supposed. And it’s a cinch it’s better than your friends would ever tell you.Please don’t be discouraged if you find yourself pretty low on the self-evaluation chartlater on. All is not lost. The processing section can boost you up at a good rate if you keep at it.And don’t be surprised if you suddenly begin to feel uncomfortable while you’reworking on the processing section. You can expect that to happen every now and then. Justkeep going. If it gets too bad, simply turn to the last section and answer those questions a fewtimes and you should start feeling better very soon.All I’m trying to tell you is this—adventures are dull if a little excitement doesn’t cropup. And you can expect excitement— too much in some places.You are going to know a lot about you when you finally finish.All this is on your own responsibility. Anything as powerful as these processes canoccasionally flare. If you are fairly stable mentally there is no real danger. But I will notmislead you. If you see somebody who isn’t quite as stable as he thinks he is working withSelf Analysis, coax it away from him. If he can barely stand mental chicken broth, he has noright to be dining on raw meat. Send him to see a professional auditor. And even if he doesthrow a wheel, a professional auditor can straighten him out. Just send for an auditor.Don’t then, disabuse yourself of the fact that Self Analysis can send the unstablespinning.We’re dealing here with the root stuff of why men go mad. If it isn’t explained in thetext, it will be found in a standard work on Dianetics. Even so, it is doubtful if Self Analysiscould create as much madness in a year as an income tax blank from our thorough if somewhatknuckle-headed government.Now to particulars. You’ll find the tests further on . You can take the first one. It willgive you a figure which will place you on the chart. Don’t blame me if it’s a low score. Blameyour parents or the truant officer.Next, it would probably interest you to read the text. It will give you a differentviewpoint on things, possibly. It is regretted if it is too simple for the savant or too complex orsomething. It’s simply an effort to write in American a few concepts about the mind based on alot of technical material in Dianetics but made more palatable. You’ll do better on the processingif you read the text.4"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The processing section has a large number of parts. You can simply work straightthrough or work over each one again, and again, until you feel you’ve sufficiently explored thatpart of your life. In any case you will go through every section many times.To help you there is a two-sided disc in the back of the book. The directions are givenlater.Thus you are prepared to go exploring into your own life. That’s an interestingadventure for anyone. I’ve done what I could to make it easier. Don’t be too harsh on me,however, if you get grounded up some long lost river and eaten by cannibals or engrams. Thelast section will help get you out. What’s left of you, anyway.Don’t get faint hearted and slack off, though, when you find the going rough. It’s easyto quit. And then you’d neva know just what you really are, basically.Going to take the whole trip? You’re a brave person. I compliment you.May you never be the same again—L. RON HUBBARD5"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEAre you a friend of yours ?Probably the most neglected friend you have is you. And yet every man, before he canbe a true friend to the world must first become a friend to himself.In this society, where aberration flourishes in the crowded cities and marts of business,few are the men who have not been subjected, on every hand, to a campaign to convince themthat they are much less than they think they are.You would fight anyone who said of your friends what is implied about you. It is timeyou fought for the best friend you will ever have—yourself.The first move in striking up this friendship is to make an acquaintance with what youare and what you might become. “Know thyself !” said the ancient Greek. Until recently it wasnot possible to make a very wide acquaintance. Little was known about human behavior as ascience. But atomic physics, in revealing new knowledge to man, has also revealed the generalcharacteristics of the energy of life and by that a great deal can be known which was not beforesuspected. You do not need to know atomic physics to know yourself, but you need to knowsomething of the apparent goal of life in general and your own goals in particular.In a later chapter there are some questions you can answer which will give you a betterinsight into your capabilities as they are and what they can become—and do not be deceived,for they can become a great deal more than you ever before suspected.Just now let’s talk about the general goal of all life. Knowing that, we can knowsomething about the basic laws which motivate your own urges and behavior.All problems are basically simple—once you know the fundamental answer. And this isno exception in life. For thousands of years men strove to discover the underlying drives ofexistence. And in an enlightened age, when exploration of the universes had already yieldedenough secrets to give us A-bombs, it became possible to explore for and find the fundamentallaw of life. What would you do if you had this fundamental law ? How easily then would youunderstand all the puzzles, riddles and complexities of personality and behavior. You couldunderstand conjurers and bank presidents, colonels, and coolies, kings, cats and coal heavers.And more important, you could easily predict what they would do in any given circumstanceand you would know what to expect from anyone without any guesswork—indeed with asecurity diabolical in its accuracy.“In the Beginning was the Word”, but what was the Word? What fundamental principledid it outline ? What understanding would one have if he knew it?An ancient Persian king once made a great effort to know this Word. He tried todiscover it by having his sages boil down all the knowledge of the world.At his orders, every book written which could be obtained was collected together in anenormous library. Books were brought to that ancient city by the caravan load. And the wisemen of the time worked for years condensing every piece of knowledge which was known intoa single volume.But the king wanted a better statement of the fundamental Word. And he made his sagesreduce that volume to a single page. And he made them reduce it again to a sentence. And then,after many more years of study, his philosophers finally obtained that single Word, the formulawhich would solve all riddles.And the city died in war and the Word was lost.6"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"But what was it? Certainly its value, since it would make an understanding of Manpossible, exceeded the riches of Persia. Two thousand years later, out of the studies of atomicand molecular phenomena, we can again postulate what that Word was. And use it. Use it toknow ourselves. And to predict the actions of other men.7"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWO;The dynamic principle of existence is: SURVIVAL!At first glance that may seem too basic. It may seem too simple. But when we examinethis Word, we find some things about it which make it possible for us to do tricks with it. Andto know things which were never known before.Knowledge could be represented by a pyramid. At the top we would have simple factbut a fact so widely embracing the universe that many facts could be known from it. From thispoint we could conceive descending down into greater and greater numbers of facts,represented by the broadening of the pyramid.At any point we examine this pyramid we would find that as one descended he wouldfind facts of wider and less related meanings. As one went up he would find greater and greatersimplicities. Science is the process of starting low on the pyramid, much like the Persian king,and rising up in an effort to discover more basic facts which explain later facts. Philosophycould be said to be the operation of taking very basic facts and then leading them intoexplanations of greater and greater numbers of facts.At the point of our pyramid, we have SURVIVAL !It is as though, at some remarkably distant time, the Supreme Being gave forth acommand to all life: “Survive!”. It was not said how to survive nor yet how long. All that wassaid was “Survive !” The reverse of Survive is “Succumb”. And that is the penalty for notengaging in survival activities.But what of such things as morals, ideals, love? Don’t these things go above “meresurvival” ? Unfortunately or fortunately, they do not.When one thinks of survival, one is apt to make the error of thinking in terms of “barestnecessity”. That is not survival. For it has no margin for loss.The engineer when he constructs a bridge, uses something called a “factor of safety”. Ifa bridge is to hold ten tons, he builds it to hold fifty tons. He makes that bridge five times asstrong. Then he has a margin for deterioration of materials, overloading, sudden andunforeseen stress of elements, and any accident which may occur.In life, the only real guarantee of survival is abundance. A farmer who calculates toneed twelve bushels of grain for his food for a year and plants twelve bushels has cut back hischances of survival very markedly. The fact is, he will not survive, unless some neighbor hasbeen more prudent. For the grasshoppers will take part of the wheat. And the drought will takesome. And the hail will take some. And the tax gatherer will take some. And what will he dofor seed wheat if he intends to use all he plants for food ?No, the farmer who knows he has to eat twelve bushels of wheat in the coming yearhad better plant a hundred. Then the grasshoppers and internal revenue people can chew awayas they will. The farmer will still be able to harvest enough for his own food—except of coursein a Socialism where nobody survives, at least for very long!An individual survives or succumbs in ratio to his ability to acquire and hold thewherewithal of survival. The security of a good job, for instance, means some guarantee ofsurvival —other threats to existence not becoming too overpowering. The man who makestwenty thousand a year can afford better clothing against the weather, a sounder and betterhome, medical care for himself and his family, good transportation and, what is important, therespect of his fellows. All these things are survival.8"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Of course the man who makes twenty thousand a year can have such a worrisome job,can excite so much envy from his fellows and can be so harrassed that he loses something ofhis survival potential. But even a subversive will change his political coat if you offer himtwenty thousand a year.Take the man who makes ten dollars a week. He wears clothes which protect him verypoorly. Thus he can easily become ill. He lives in a place which but ill defends him from theweather. He is haggard with concern. For his level of survival is so low that he has no margin,no abundance. He cannot bank anything against the day he becomes ill. And he cannot pay adoctor. And he can take no vacations. Even in a collective state his lot would be such, hisregimentation so thorough that he could do little to protect his own survival.Youth has a survival abundance over old age. For youth still has endurance. And thedreams of youth—good survival stuff, dreams—are not yet broken by failures. Youth has, inaddition, a long expectancy, and that is important, for survival includes length of time to live.As for ideals, as for honesty, as for one’s love of one’s fellow man, one cannot findgood survival for one or for many where these things are absent. The criminal does not survivewell. The average criminal spends the majority of his adult years caged like some wild beastand guarded from escape by the guns of good marksmen. A man who is known to be honest isawarded survival—good jobs, good friends. And the man who has his ideals, no matter howthoroughly the minions of the devil may wheedle him to desert them, survives well only solong as he is true to those ideals. Have you ever heard about a doctor who, for the sake of gain,begins to secretly attend criminals or peddle dope? That doctor does not survive long after hisideals are laid aside.In short, the most esoteric concepts fall within this understanding of Survival. Onesurvives so long as he is true to himself, his family, his friends, the laws of the Universe.When he fails in any respect, his survival is cut down.The end of Survival, however, is no sharp thing. Survival is not a matter of being alivethis moment and dead the next. Survival is actually a graduated scale.9"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREEWhere does one cease to Survive and begin to Succumb? The point of demarkation isnot death as we know it. It is marked by what one might call the death of the consciousness ofthe individual.Man’s greatest weapon is his reason. Lacking the teeth, the armor-plate hide, the clawsof so many other life forms, Man has relied upon his ability to reason in order to furtherhimself in his survival.The selection of the ability to think as a chief weapon is a fortunate one. It has awardedMan with the kingdom of Earth. Reason is an excellent weapon. The animal with his teeth,with his armor-plated hide, with his long daws, is fixed with weapons he cannot alter. Hecannot adjust to a changing environment. And it is terribly important, to survive, to changewhen the environment changes. Every extinct species became extinct because it could notchange to control a new environment. Reason remedies this failure to a marked extent. For Mancan invent new tools and new weapons and a whole new environment. Reason permits him tochange to fit new situations. Reason keeps him in control of new environments.Any animal that simply adjusts itself to match its environment is doomed. Environmentschange rapidly. Animals which control and change the environment have the best chance ofsurvival.The only way you can organize a collective state is to convince men that they mustadjust and adapt themselves, like animals, to a constant environment. The people must bedeprived of the right to control, as individuals, their environment. Then they can be regimentedand herded into groups. They become owned, not owners. Reason and the right to reason mustbe taken from them, for the very center of reason is the right to make up one’s own mind aboutone’s environment.The elements fight Man and man fights man. The primary target of the enemies of Man or a man is his right and ability to reason. The crude andblundering forces of the elements, storms, cold and night bear down against, challenge andthen mayhap crush the Reason as well as the body.But just as unconsciousness always precedes death, even by instants, so does the deathof Reason precede the death of the organism. And this action may happen in a long span oftime, even half a lifetime, even more.Have you watched the high altertness of a young man breasting the forces whichoppose life? And watched another in old age? You will find that what has suffered has been theability to Reason. He has gained hard won experience and on this experience he seeks, frommiddle age on, to travel. It is a truism that youth thinks fast on little experience. And that agethinks slowly on much. The Reason of youth is very far from always right, for youth isattempting to reason without adequate data.Suppose we had a man who had retained all his ability to reason and yet had a great dealof experience. Suppose our greybeards could think with all the enthusiasm and vitality of youthand yet had all their experience as well. Age says to youth, “You have no experience!” Youthsays to age, “You have no vision, you will not accept or even examine new ideas!” Obviouslyan ideal arrangement would be for one to have the experience of age and the vitality and visionof youth.You rnay have said to yourself, “With all my experience now, what wouldn’t I give forsome of the enthusiasm I had once”. Or perhaps you have excused it all by saying you have“lost your illusions”. But you aren’t sure that they were illusions. Are brightness in life, quick10"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"enthusiasm, a desire and will to live, a belief in destiny, are these things illusions ? Or are theysymptoms of the very stuff of which vital life is made? And isn’t their decline a symptom ofdeath ?Knowledge does not destroy a will to live. Pain and loss of self-determinism destroythat will. Life can be painful. The gaining of experience is often painful. The retaining of thatexperience is essential. But isn’t it still experience if it doesn’t yet have the pain?Suppose you could wipe out of your life all the pain, physical and otherwise, whichyou have accumulated. Would it be so terrible to have to part with a broken heart or apsychosomatic illness, with fears and anxieties and dreads ?Suppose a man had a chance again, with all he knows, to look life and the Universe inthe.eye again and say it could be whipped. Do you recall a day, when you were younger, andyou woke to find bright dew sparkling on the grass, the leaves, to find the golden sun brightupon a happy world? Do you recall how beautiful and fine it once was? The first sweet kiss?The warmth of true friendship? The intimacy of a moonlight ride? What made it becomeotherwise than a brilliant world ?The consciousness of the world around one is not an absolute thing. One can be moreconscious of color and brightness and joy at one time of life more than another. One can moreeasily feel the brilliant reality of things in youth than he can in age. And isn’t this somethinglike a decline of consciousness, of awareness ?What is it that makes one less aware of the brilliance of the world around him. Has theworld changed? No, for each new generation sees the glamour and the glory, the vitality oflife— the same life that age may see as dull at best. The individual changes. And what makeshim change? Is it a decay of his glands and sinews ? Hardly, for all the work that has beendone on glands and sinews—the structure of the body—has restored little if any of thebrilliance of living.Ah, youth, sighs the adult, if I but had your zest again! What reduced that zest ?As one’s consciousness of the brilliance of life declines, so has declined his ownconsciousness. Awareness decreases exactly as consciousness decreases. The ability toperceive the world around one and the ability to draw accurate conclusions about it are, to allintents, the same thing.Glasses are a symptom of the decline of consciousness. One needs his sight bolsteredto make the world look brighter. The loss of the ability to move swiftly, as one ran when hewas a child, is a decline of consciousness and ability.Complete unconsciousness is death. Half unconsciousness is half death. A quarterunconsciousness is a quarter of death. And as one accumulates the pain attendant upon life andfails to accumulate the pleasures, one gradually loses his race with the gentleman with the scythe. And there ensues, at last, the physical incapacity forseeing, thinking and being known, as death.How does one accumulate this pain? And if he got rid of it would full consciousnessand a full bright concept of life return? And is there a way to get rid of it ?11"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOUR;The physical universe consists of four elements—matter, energy, space and time.According to nuclear physics, matter is composed of energy such as electrons andprotons. And the energy and the matter exist in space and time. All this is actually very simple.And even then we need not go very far into it to understand that the universe in which we liveis composed of simple things arranged and rearranged to make many forms and manifestations.The concrete sidewalk, the air, ice cream sodas, pay checks, cats, kings and coal-heavers are basically composed of matter, energy, space and time. And where they are alivethey contain another ingredient—life.Life is an energy of a very special kind, obeying certain laws different from what wenormally consider energy such as electricity. But life is an energy and it has some peculiarproperties.Life is able to collect and organize matter and energy in space and time and animate it.Life takes some matter and energy and makes an organism such as a monocell, a tree, a polarbear or a man. Then this organism, still animated by the energy called Life, futher acts uponmatter and energy in space and time and further organizes and animates matter and energy intonew objects and shapes.Life could be said to be engaged upon a conquest of the physical universe. The primaryurge of life has been said to be Survival. In order to accomplish Survival, Life has to continueand win in its conquest of the physical universe.When Life or a Life form ceases to continue that conquest, it ceases to Survive andsuccumbs.Here we have a gigantic action. The energy of Life vs. matter, energy, space and time.Life vs. the physical universe.Here is an enormous struggle. The chaotic, disorganized physical universe, capableonly of force, resisting the conquest of Life, organizing and persistent, capable of Reason.Life learns the laws of the physical universe matter, energy, space and time and thenturns those laws against the physical universe to further its conquest.Man has spent much time learning what he could of the physical universe as in thesciences of physics and chemistry but, more important even, of the daily battle of Life againstthe Universe. Do not think that a monocell does not manifest a knowledge of Life’s workingrules, for it does. What cunning it takes to organize some chemicals and sunlight into a livingunit ! The biologist stands in awe of the expertness of management of the smallest living cells.He gazes at these intricate and careful entities, these microscopic units of Life forms, and evenhe cannot believe that it is all an accident.There is Life, then, a vital energy, not quite like physical Universe energy. And thenthere are Life forms. The Life form or the organism, such as a living human body, consists ofLife plus physical Universe matter, energy, space and time. A dead body consists of physicaluniverse matter, energy, space and time minus Life energy. Life has been there, has organizedand has then withdrawn from the organism, an operation we know as the cycle of conception,birth, growth, decay and death.Although there are answers as to where Life goes when it withdraws and what it thendoes, we need not examine that now. The important thing to a living organism is the fact that it12"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"is seeking to Survive, in obedience to the whole effort of all Life, and that in order to do so itmust succeed in its conquest of the physical universe.Stated simply, Life must first accumulate enough matter and energy to make up anorganism—such as the human body— and must then ally the organism with friendly andcooperative organisms—such as other people—and must continue to procure additional matterand energy for food, clothing and shelter in order to support itself. Additionally, in order toSurvive, it must do two specific things which, beyond the necessity of allies, food, clothingand shelter, are basically important.Life must procure pleasure.Life must avoid pain.Life has an active thrust away from pain, which is nonsurvival, destructive, and whichis death itself. Pain is a warning of non-survival or potential death.Life has an active thrust toward pleasure. Pleasure can be defined as the action towardobtaining or the procurement of survival. The ultimate pleasure is an infinity of survival orimmortality, a goal unobtainable for the physical organism itself (but not its Life), but towardwhich the organism strives.Happiness then could be defined as the overcoming of obstacles toward a desirablegoal. Any desirable goal, if closely inspected, will be found to be a Survival goal.Too much pain obstructs the organism toward Survival.Too many obstructions between the organism and Survival mean non-survival.Thus one finds the mind engaged in computing or imagining ways and means to avoidpain and reach pleasure and putting the solutions into action. And this is all that the mind does:it perceives, poses and resolves problems relating to the Survival of the organism, the futuregenerations, the group, Life and the physical universe and puts the solutions into action. If itsolves the majority of the problems presented, the organism thus achieves a high level ofSurvival. If the organism’s mind fails to resolve a majority of problems, then the organismfails.The mind, then, has a definite relationship to Survival. And one means here the wholemind, not just the brain. The brain is a structure. The mind can be considered to be the wholebeing, mortal and immortal, the definite personality of the organism and all its attributes.Hence, if one’s mind is working well, if it is resolving the problems it should resolveand if it is putting those solutions into proper action, the Survival of the organism is wellassured. If the mind is not working well, the Survival of the organism is thrown into questionand doubt.One’s mind, then, must be in excellent condition if he is to best guarantee the Survivalof himself, his family, future generations, his group and Life.The mind seeks to guarantee and direct Survival actions. It seeks Survival not only forthe organism (self) but seeks it for the family, children, future generations and all Life. Thus itcan be selectively blunted.A mind can be blunted concerning the Survival of self and yet be alive to the Survival offuture generations. It can be blunted concerning groups and yet be very alive to itsresponsibility for the organism (self). In order to function well, the mind must not be blunted inany direction.13"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"To function well the mind must conceive itself able to handle the physical universe ofmatter, energy, space and time within the necessities of the organism, the family, futuregenerations and groups as well as Life.The mind must be able to avoid pain for and discover pleasure for the self, futuregenerations, the family and the group as well as life itself.As the mind fails to avoid pain and discover pleasure, so fails the organism, the family,future generations, the group and Life.The failure of one organism in a group to properly resolve Survival problems is afailure, in part, for the whole group. Hence, “Do not send to find for whom the bell tolls; ittolls for thee!”Life is an interdependent, cooperative effort. Each and every living organism has a partto play in the Survival of other organisms.When it comes to a thinking mind such as Man’s, the organism must be able to actindependently for its own Survival and the Survival of others. In order to accomplish theseSurvivals, however, a mind has to be able to realize solutions which are optimum not only forself but for all other things concerned in its Survival.Thus the mind of one organism must reach agreements with the minds of otherorganisms in order that all may Survive to the highest possible level.When a mind becomes dulled and blunted, it begins to compute its solutions poorly. Itbegins to get confused about its goals. It is not sure what it reaUy means to do. And it willinvolve and inhibit the Survival of other organisms. It may begin, for instance, to compute thatit must Survive as self and that only self is important and so neglect the Survival of others. Thisis non-survival activity. It is highly aberrated.A mind which begins to “survive” only for self and begins to diminish and control withforce other organisms around is already better than half way toward its own death. It is a mindwhich is less than half alive. It has less than half its actual potential. Its perception of thephysical universe is poor. It does not realize that it is dependent for Survival upon cooperationwith others. It has lost its Survival mission. This mind is already outward bound toward death,has passed its peak and will actually take personal actions which lead to its own death.Life, the large over-all Life, has a use for organism death. When an organism can nolonger continue well, the plan of Life is to kill it and invest anew in a new organism.Death is Life’s operation of disposing of an outmoded and unwanted organism so thatnew organisms can be born and can fiourish.Life itself does not die. Only the physical organism dies. Not even a personality,apparently, dies. Death then, in truth, is a limited concept of the death of the physical part of theorganism. Life and the personality, apparently, go on. The physical part of the organism ceasesto function. And that is death.When an organism reaches a point where it is only half conscious, where it is onlyperceiving half as well as it should, where it is functioning only half as well as it should, deathbegins. The organism, thereafter, will take actions to hasten death. It does this“unconsciously”. But, in its aberrated state, such a mind will also bring death to otherorganisms. Thus a half conscious organism is a menace to others.Here is the accident prone, the fascist, the person who seeks to dominate, the selfishand self-seeking person. Here is an organism outward bound.14"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"When an organism reaches a point where it is only a third alive, a third conscious, it isperceiving only a third of what it might, Life even further hastens the death of this organismand those around it. Here is the suicide, here is the person who is continually ill, who refusesto eat.Organisms which are outward bound toward death sometimes require years and yearsto die. For the organism experiences resurgences and still has some small desire to go onliving. And other organisms help it to live. It is carried along by the tide of life even though itsindividual direction is toward death— death for others and death for self and death for thephysical universe around it.Society, the bulk of which is bent upon Survival, fails or refuses to recognize death orthe urge of organisms toward it. Society passes laws against murder and suicide. Society provides hospitals. Society carries such people upon its back. And society will not hearof euthanasia or “mercy killing”.Organisms which have passed the halfway point will take extraordinary measures andmeans to bring about death for others and for things and for self. Here we have the Hitlers, thecriminals, the destructively neurotic.Give a person who has passed this point a car to drive and the car may become involvedin an accident. Give him money and the money will go to purchase non-Survival things.But we must not emphasize the dramatic and forget the important like the newspapersdo. The action and urge toward death becomes noticeable only when it is very dramatic. It ismost dangerous however in its undramatic forms.A person who has passed the halfway point brings death to things and people on asmall scale at all times. Ahouse left dirty, appointments not kept, clothing not cared for, viciousgossip, carping criticisms of others “for their own good”, these are all enturbulences whichbring failure and too many failures bring death.And it should be not supposed that by half-way point one means halfway through life.It means half conscious, half alive, half or less perceiving and thinking. A child may besuppressed to this level by his parents and school. And indeed children quite ordinarily dropbelow the halfway point, so defeated do they become in their environment and in their contestwith life. Age is no criterion. But physical health is. The surest manifestation that someone haspassed the halfway point is his physical condition. The chronically ill have passed it.If one is to have a secure society, then, if one is to rid a society of its death factors, onemust have some means of either destroying the people who bring death to it, the Hitlers, theinsane, the criminals, or he must have some means of salvaging these people and bringing themback into a state of full consciousness.Full consciousness would mean full recognition of one’s responsibilities, hisrelationship with others, his care of himself and of society.How can such a thing be achieved? If you could achieve it, you could raise a socialorder to hitherto unattainable heights. You could empty the prisons and insane asylums. Youcould make a world too sane for war. And people could be made well who have never had themeans of it before. And people could be happy who have never troly known what happinesswas. You could raise the good will and efficiency of all men and all social orders if you couldrestore the vitality of these people.In order to know how it can be restored, one has to know how the consciousness, thevitality, the will to live become reduced.15"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVE;An organism is suppressed toward death by accumulated pain.Pain in one great sweeping shock brings about immediate death.Pain in small doses over a lifetime gradually suppresses the organism toward death.What is pain?Pain is a warning of loss. It is an automatic alarm system built into Life organismswhich informs the organism that some part of it or all of it is under stress and that the organismhad better take action or die.The signal of pain means that the organism is in the proximity of a destructive force orobject. To ignore pain is to die. Pain is the whip which sends the organism away from hotstoves, sub-zero weather; pain is the threat of non-Survival, the punishment for errors in tryingto Survive.And pain is always loss. A burned finger means that the body has lost the cells on thesurface of that finger. They are dead. A blow on the head means the death of scalp and othercells in the area. The whole organism is thus warned of the proximity of a death source and soattempts to get away from it.The loss of a loved one is also a loss of Survival. The loss of a possession is also lossof Survival potential. One then confuses physical pain and the loss of Survival organisms orobjects. And so there is such a thing as “mental pain”.But Life, in its whole contest with the physical universe, has no patience with failure.An organism so foolhardy as to let itself be struck too hard and so depressed intounconsciousness stays in the vicinity of the pain-dealing object. It is considered to be non-Survival if it fails so markedly to Survive.Unconsciousness experienced as a result of a blow or an illness is a quick picture ofwhat happens over a lifespan.Is there any difference except time between these two things ?A blow resulting in unconsciousness which results in death.The accumulated blows over a life span resulting in a gradual lessening ofconsciousness resulting in eventual death.One is slower than the other.One of the basic discoveries of Dianetics was that unconsciousness and all the painattendant upon it was stored in a part of the mind and that this pain and unconsciousnessaccumulated until it caused the organism to begin to die.Another discovery of Dianetics was that this pain could be nullified or erased with areturn to full consciousness and a rehabilitation toward Survival.In other words, with Dianetics, it became possible to cancel out the accumulatedunconsciousness and pain of the years and restore the health and vitality of an organism.16"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Accumulated physical pain and loss brings about a reduction of consciousness, areduction of physical health and a reduction of the will to live to a point where the organismactively, if often slyly, seeks death.Erase or nullify the physical pain, the losses of a lifetime, and vitality returns.The vitality of living, of seeking higher levels of Survival, is life itself.The human body was found to be extremely capable of repairing itself when the storedmemories of pain were cancelled. Further it was discovered that so long as the stored painremained, the doctoring of what are called psychosomatic ills, such as arthritis, rheumatism,dermatitis and thousands of others, could not result in anything permanent. Psycho-therapy,not knowing about pain storage and its effects, discovered long ago that one could rid a patientof one illness only to have another pop up—and psycho-therapy became a defeatist schoolbecause it could do nothing permanent for the aberrated or the ill even when it could do a littlesomething to relieve it. Hence, all efforts to make men vital and well became suspect becausethe reason they were inefficient and ill had not been discovered and proven.With Dianetics it became possible to eradicate aberration and illness because it becamepossible to nullify or eradicate the pain from the pain-storage banks of the body withoutapplying further pain as in surgery.Consciousness then depends upon the absence or the nullification or eradication ofmemories of physical pain, for unconsciousness is a part of that pain—one of its symptoms.Arthritis of the knee, for instance, is the accumulation of all knee injuries in the past.The body confuses time and environment with the time and environment where the knee wasactually injured and so keeps the pain there. The fluids of the body avoid the pain area. Hence adeposit which is called arthritis. The proof of this is that when the knee injuries of the past arelocated and discharged, the arthritis ceases, no other injury takes its place and the person isfinished with arthritis of the knee. And this happens ten cases out of ten—except in those caseswhere age and physical deterioration are so well advanced towards death that the point of no-return is passed.Take a bad heart. The person has pain in his heart. He can take medicine or voodoo oranother diet and still have a bad heart. Find and eradicate or nullify an actual physical injury tothe heart and the heart ceases to hurt and gets well.Nothing is easier to prove than these tenets. A good dianetic auditor can take a broken-down, sorrow-drenched lady of thirty-eight and knock out her past periods of physical andmental pain and have on his hands somebody who appears to be twenty-five—and a bright,cheerful twenty-five at that.Sure it’s incredible. But so is an A-bomb, a few pennyweights of plutonium which canblow a city off the chart.Once you know the basic tenets of Life and how it acts as an energy, Life can be putback into the ill, the de-vitalized, the would-be suicide.And more important than treating the very ill, mentally or physically, one can interruptthe downward spiral in a man who is still alert and well so that he will not thereafter become soill. And one can take the so-called “normal” person and send his state of being up to levels ofbrilliance and success not possible before.Restore an individual’s full consciousness and you restore his full Life potential.And it can now be done.17"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIX;The tone scale, a small edition of which is in this book plots the descending spiral oflife from full vitality and consciousness through half vitality and half consciousness down todeath.By various calculations about the energy of Life, by observation and by test, this tonescale is able to give levels of behavior as Life declines.These various levels are common to all men.When a man is nearly dead, he can be said to be in a chronic apathy. And he behaves ina certain way about other things. This is 0.1 on the tone scale chart.When a man is chronically in grief about his losses, he is in grief. And he behavescertain ways about many things. This is 0.5 on the chart.When a person is not yet so low as grief but realizes losses are impending, or is fixedchronically at this level by past losses, he can be said to be in fear. This is around 1.1 on thechart.An individual who is fighting against threatened losses is in anger. And he manifestsother aspects of behavior. This is 1.5.The person who is merely suspicious that loss may take place or who has become fixedat this level, is resentful. He can be said to be in antagonism. This is 2.0 on the chart.Above antagonism, the situation of a person is not so good that he is enthusiastic, notso bad that he is resentful. He has lost some goals and cannot immediately locate others. He issaid to be in boredom, or at 2.5 on the tone scale chart.At 3.0 on the chart, a person has a conservative, cautious aspect toward life but isreaching his goals.At 4.0 the individual is enthusiastic, happy and vital.Very few people are natural 4.0’s. A charitable average is probably around 2.8.You can examine the chart and you will find in the boxes as you go across it, thevarious characteristics of people at these levels. Horribly enough these characteristics have beenfound to be constant. If you have a 3.0 as your rating, then you will carry across the wholechart at 3.0.You have watched this chart in operation before now. Have you ever seen a child tryingto acquire, let us say, a nickel? At first he is happy. He simply wants a nickel. If refused, hethen explains why he wants it. If he fails to get it and does not want it badly, he becomes boredand goes away. But if he wants it badly, he will get antagonistic about it. Then he will becomeangry. Then, that failing, he may lie about why he wants it. That failing he goes into grief. Andif he is still refused, he finally sinks into apathy and says he doesn’t want it. This is negation.And you have seen the chart in reverse. A child threatened by danger also dwindlesdown the scale. At first he does not appreciate that the danger is posed at him and he is quitecheerful. Then the danger, let us say it is a dog, starts to approach him. The child sees thedanger but still does not believe it is for him and keeps on with his business. But his playthings“bore” him for the moment. He is a little apprehensive and not sure. Then the dog comesnearer. The child “resents him” or shows some antagonism. The dog comes nearer still. Thechild becomes angry and makes some effort to injure the dog. The dog comes still nearer and is18"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"more threatening. The child becomes afraid. Fear unavailing, the child cries. If the dog stillthreatens him, the child may go into an apathy and simply wait to be bitten.Objects or animals or people which assist Survival, as they become inaccessible to theindividual, bring him down the tone scale.Objects, animals, or people which threaten Survival, as they approach the individual,bring him down the tone scale.This scale has a chronic or an acute aspect. A person can be brought down the tonescale to a low level for ten minutes and then go back up, or he can be brought down it for tenyears and not go back up.A man who has suffered too many losses, too much pain, tends to become fixed atsome lower level of the scale and, with only slight fluctuations, stay there. Then his generaland common behavior will be at that level of the tone scale.Just as a 0.5 moment of grief can cause a child to act along the grief band for a shortwhile, so can a 0.5 fixation cause an individual to act 0.5 toward most things in his life. There is momentary behavior or fixcd behavior.How can one find an individual on this tone scale ? How can one find oneself?If you can locate two or three characteristics along a certain level of this scale, you canlook in the number column opposite those characteristics and find the level. It may be 2.5, itmay be 1.5. Wherever it is, simply look at all the columns opposite the number you found andyou will see the remaining characteristics.The only mistake you can make in evaluating somebody else on this tone scale is toassume that he departs from it somewhere and is higher in one department than he is in another.The characteristic may be masked to which you object—but it is there.Look at the top of the first column and you get a general picture of the behavior andphysiology of the person. Look at the second column for the physical condition. Look at thethird column for the most generally expressed emotion of the person. Continue on across thevarious columns. Somewhereyou will find data about somebody or yourself of which you canbe sure. Then simply examine all the other boxes at the level of the data you were certain about.That band, be it 1.5 or 3.0 will tell you the story of a human being.Of course, as good news and bad, happy days and sad ones strike a person, there aremomentary raises and lowerings on this tone scale. But there is a chronic level, an averagebehavior for each individual.As an individual is found lower and lower on this chart, so is his alertness, hisconsciousness lower and lower.The individual’s chronic mood or attitude toward existence declines in direct ratio to theway he regards the physical universe and organisms about him.There are many other mechanical aspects of this chart having to do with energymanifestations and observation of behavior but we need not cover them here.It is not a complete statement to say, merely, that one becomes fixed in his regard forthe physical universe and organisms about him, for there are definite ways, beyondconsciousness, which permit this to take place. Manifestation, however, is a decline ofconsciousness with regard to the physical environr4ent of an individual. That decline of19"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"consciousness is a partial cause of a gradual sag down this chart, but it is illustrative enough forour purposes in this volume.At the top of this chart, one is fully conscious of himself, his environment, other peopleand the universe in general. He accepts his responsibilities in it. He faces the realities of it. Hedeals with the problems within the limits of his education and experience.Then something happens—his perception of the material universe is dulled. How doesthis come about?The first and foremost way that a decline on the chart is begun is through being causedphysical pain by the physical universe. It is one thing to gain experience and quite another tosuffer physical pain. For any experience surrounded by actual physical pain is hidden by thatpain. The organism is supposed to avoid pain to Survive. It avoids, as well, memories of painif it is above 2.0 on the chart. It “relishes” pain memories below 2.0 as these lead to death. Assoon as it can begin avoiding pain wholesale, although that pain is recorded, consciousnessbegins to decrease markedly. The perception of the physical universe begins to decrease and thecaliber of one’s activities begin to decline.One could say that there is an interior world and an exterior world. The interior world isthe one of yesterday. The data it contains is used to judge the world of the exterior, of todayand tomorrow. So long as one has all data available, one can make excellent computations.When the facts he has learned begin to be buried, one’s conclusions are apt to become wrong tojust that degree.As one’s confidence in the physical universe declines, so does one’s ability to handle itdecline. One’s dreams and hopes begin to seem unattainable, one ceases to strive. Actually,however, one’s ability seldom diminishes—it only seems to diminish.When the interior world tells of too much physical pain, the organism becomesconfused. Like the child who finally says he doesn’t want the nickel, the organism says itwants nothing of the physical universe and so perishes—or lives a while in a twilight and thenperishes all the same.The goal is to win. When one has lost too much and too many times, the possibility ofwinning seems too remote to try. And it loses. It becomes so accustomed to loss that it begins to concentrate on loss instead offorward advance. And it does this quite irrationally. Because one has lost two cars does notmean one may lose three, yet he who has lost two will actually be so prepared to lose three thathe will actually, if unconsciously, take steps to lose the third. Thus it may be with people, withany object.As an individual descends the tone scale, he first begins to lose his confidence iD tryingto reach the further rims of his environment, the further frontiers of his dreams, and becomes“conservative”. There is not much wrong with cautiousness, but there is something wrong withchronic conservatism for sometimes it takes a wild charge to win a Life.As physical pain begins to mount up in the recording banks of the mind, the individualfurther confuses yesterdaywith today and further withdraws his confidence. He becomes a littlefrightened and poses as being bored—he says he didn’t want to reach so far anyway. Isn’tworth it. He makes fun of the things he really wants, makes fun of the dreams of others andacts, in general, like a reporter from the New Yorker. He is afraid to face a hopeful fact, muchless a truly desirable object.With a further increase of pain, he continues on down the scale until he is actually onhis way out from Life.20"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The fact of the matter is, the older a person gets and the more experiences he has, thebetter able he should be to handle his environment. If he could stay fully conscious and rationalabout it, this would be true. But the mechanics of pain storage are such that he actually growsless and less conscious the more pain he has received, and so he cannot really use hisexperience at all. If he could gain experience without physical pain, his enthusiasm, his abilityand dash, would remain very high. But man was a lesser organism, evidently, before he was aman. And a lesser organism can only react, it cannot think. Thinking is something new.Until Dianetics, this looked like a hopelessly closed cycle. One had enthusiasm but noexperience. So with enthusiastic rushes he attacked the environment with all the folly of youthand was ignominiously repelled. He gained pain with each repulsion. He gained experience,but he could not think about the experience without facing the pain so the experience did him nogood. When he had enough experience he no longer had the dreams, energy and enthusiasm tocarry home his attack upon his environment.Processing such as the questions in the last section of this book or in Dianetic co-auditing broke the cycle. Youth could attack the environment and experience pain of repulsion.But the physical pain could be knocked out of the mind by Dianetics, leaving the experiencestanding there, with the enthusiasm.There must be, at this writing, tens of thousands of people who have experiencedDianetics by now. A few, here and there, were unable to achieve full benefit because itformerly required considerable technical knowledge to process somebody. This book and SelfAnalysis were developed in order that an individual could gain at least the primary benefits ofprocessing without any technical knowledge and without taking up the time of another person.Wherever a person may be on the tone scale (unless he is very low and in the insanebracket, for this is also a scale of sanity) he can ascend that scale again by rehabilitating hisability to think about and know his environment. Now that one knows the rules it is rathereasily done and one is astonished that it could not be done before.Have you looked at the chart for yourself? Well, don’t go looking for a cliff or an axe ifyou were below 2.0. Self Analysis can pull you up this chart so that even you will see that youhave climbed.Now, just beyond the chart there are some tests and graphs. You should answer these.They will help you to locate yourself. Then you will know much better why you are or aren’t agood friend to yourself. You may find you don’t care to have such a friend. Well, if he’s thatbad off, he really needs your help. So give him a hand. The whole last part of the book is filledwith exercises which will make a better friend to have out of yourself if you just apply theseexercises a half an hour a day.I don’t know how high you can get yourself up on this chart. You can raise yourselfpretty far and Dianetic co-auditing can do the rest if you wish. Or you may get all the way andstabilize there.Right now if you aren’t being a friend of yourself, I’m your friend. I know byexperience that you can climb the chart.Man is basically good. Pain and social aberrations turn him away from high ethics,efficiency and happiness. Get rid of the pain and you’ll be at the high level of the chart.Now turn to the questions which will help you locate yourself. BUT DON’T USETHIS CHART AS AN EFFORT TO MAKE SOMEBODY KNUCKLE UNDER.

This is actually not “self-auditing”. It isauditing done on the reader by the author. Actually, the reader is being audited by L. RonHubbard. Straight Wire processing is relatively safe on any case and is the most elementaryprocess in Dianetics.The position of an individual on this Tone Scale varies through the day and throughoutthe years but is fairly stable for given periods. One’s position on the chart will rise on receipt ofgood news, sink with bad news. This is the usual give and take with life. Everyone howeverhas a chronic position on the chart which is unalterable save for processing.Necessity level (lifting oneself by one’s bootstraps as in emergencies) can raise anindividual well up this chart for brief periods.By education, such as that given under pressure, the education itself has a position onthe tone scale. A person could be relatively unaberrated actually but, by education, be at a lowerposition on the chart than he should be. The reverse is also the case. One can be educated, then,into a higher or lower level on the chart than his own aberrations call for.One’s environment greatly influences one’s position on the chart. Every environmenthas its own tone level. A man who is really a 3.0 can begin to act like a 1.1 in a 1.1environment. However, a 1.1 usually acts no better than about 1.5 in an environment with ahigh tone. If one lives in a low-toned environment he can expect, eventually, to be low-toned.This is also true of marriage—one tends to match the tone level of one’s marital partner.This tone scale is also valid for groups. A business or a nation can be examined as to itsvarious standard reactions and these can be plotted. This will give the survival potential of a business or a nation.This chart can also be used in employing people or in choosing partners. It is anaccurate index of what to expect and gives you a chance to predict what people will do beforeyou have any great experience with them. Also, it gives you some due as to what can happen toyou in certain environments or around certain people, for they can drag you down or boost youhigh.22"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"23"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"24"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"25"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"26"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"27"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"28"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"29"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"30"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"TEST NUMBER ONETake this test before you begin on the processing section of Self Analysis.Be fair and as honest as possible in your findings.Use, as a basis, how you have been in the ]ast year.

Dianetically speaking, this self-processing section could becalled “straight wire”. It is not “auto processing”. The reader is actually being processed by theauthor.In the full use of Dianetics these questions could be considered as preparatory to co-auditing. The auditor is assisted by these lists in that they open a case for the running ofengramsand secondaries and raise the pre-clear on a tone scale. These question sections, so faras is known at this time, will not run out engrams and secondaries as such but will desensitizethem to a marked extent with a consequent improvement in the mental and physical being of theindividual.An auditor, as the practitioner in Dianetics is called since he both listens and computes,can use these questions during a session with a pre-clear. Further, two people can work withthese sections—one of them asking the questions of another who answers—or both of themreading the questions and both of them attempting to get a recall on such an incident as that onecalled for.These lists are used repetitively; that is to say the individual goes over them again andagain. There is no finite period to the work. The reason the recall of these questions isimportant is that they reveal and discharge locks which have formed above the basic engrams(moments of physical pain and unconsciousness) and secondaries (moments of acute loss asdeath of a loved one). The discharging of these locks renders engrams and secondariesrelatively ineffective. A full dianetic clearing of the individual’s engrams and secondaries givesthe highest possible attainable results, but these questions provide self-processing whichprepares the case for such an action and are in themselves highly beneficial.In the process of using these questions the pre-clear may discover many manifestationsin himself. He may experience considerable emotional release. He may become angry at the recollection of some of thethings which have happened to him and he may even feel like crying over some of the losses hehas sustained and indeed may very well cry. However, the intent of these questions is not tofocus the self-processor’s attention upon the bad things which have happened to him but uponthe good things which have taken place in his life. A concentration upon these happiercircumstances tends to discharge the unhappy circumstances and render them far less forceful.These questions are based upon the dianetic discoveries, axioms and postulates whichhave done so much toward amplifying the understanding of people, concerning the nature ofexistence and their roles in it. Life can be considered to have as its fundamental purposeSurvival in the material universe. When one closely examines Survival he discovers that theconcept embraces all the activities of an individual, a group, a state, life itself or the materialuniverse.The material universe is composed of matter, energy, space and time. Life can then beconsidered to be engaged upon the conquest of matter, energy, space and time, induding otherlife forms, organisms and persons. If an organism or a group has been successful in handlingother organisms, groups and the material universe, its survival potential is very great. If theorganism has been unsuccessful, its survival potential is lower. Its moments of success, as itsmoments of pain, are highly charged. It is possible, by certain processes, to remove the chargefrom painful incidents. One of the ways of doing this is to lay the stress and concentration ofthe organism upon the tirnes it has been successful in surviving.With the invention of language man brought upon himself an unexpected source ofaberration. While language itself is very far from the whole reason an organism is less39"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"successful than it might be, our current social order lays undue stress upon language. Wordsare only symbols which represent actions. A child learns these actions very early and learns thesymbols which represent the actions. Later on he begins to mistake the action for the symboland begins to believe the words themselves have force and power which they do not. If youbelieve that words have force and power, hold your hand in front of your mouth and say a fewwords. You will see how negligible is the force of utterance, no matter what words you use.Underlying this mistaken emphasis on the force of words lie actual physical actions of whichthe words are the symbols. The main point then is that words are not powerful but actions are.For example, when an individual has been told to hold still he obeys simply because he hasexperienced earlier in his life the action of being made to hold still by physical force.For many reasons it is important for the organism to increase its mobility. Thediscovery of all the times the organism has been told to hold still and has obeyed has sometherapeutic value but the discovery of actual incidents when the organism has been physicallyforced to remain motionless is much more important in restoring the mobility of the organism.These lists, then, tend to devaluate the importance of language. This is only one of theirmany functions but an important one; therefore, the reading of these lists should direct theindividual to moments action took place, not when somebody said it took place. Just as hearsayevidence is not admissible in a court of law, so are words and phrases given to the individualby others inadmissible in self-processing. For instance, when one is asked for a time whensomebody went away one should not try to recall the time when somebody said somebodywent away or the statement that somebody was going away, but the actual physical departure,regardless of what was said.You will find that words are communicated through the physical universe to otherorganisms. Sounds, for instance, originate within the organism, are translated into soundwaves and reach the other person as sound waves. The written word is made into symbols ofink which are then seen, the other physical fact, of light, byanother organism. Whereastheremayvery well be such things as ESP, it is not aberrative.There are many perceptions, which is to say channels, through which one can contactthe physical universe. You are aware of the physical universe because of sight, sound, mouthand other message systems. Therefore, each time you are asked to recall an incident of a certainkind you will be asked, after you have recalled it, to pay attention to a certain sense channelwhich was present during the time when you experienced the incident. The circular disc isprovided for this purpose. You will notice the disc has two sides.The perceptions or sense messages listed on one side are different from those on theother side. As you read the questions one after the other you should read them through a s]otprovided in the disc. Going to the next question you should rotate the slot oncecounterclockwise for each new question. This will give you a new perception. For instance thequestion may pertain to a time somebody went away from you. You will recall a time when thisoccurred, selecting the moment of actual physical departure. Undoubtedly you will get someperception of the scene and you may even get a very full perception of the scene. Many peoplesee, feel, hear and otherwise perceive memories when they recall them. Some people are toooccluded. These lists wipe away occlusion. As you recall the person walking away from youthen, you are not supposed to recall merely the concept that somebody had walked away, butthe moment when they actually did and get as many perceptions as possible of them doing so.The disc which overlies this question will have uppermost at random one particular perception.That perception may be sound—thus you should attempt to recover whatever sounds werepresent when this individual walked away as the particular emphasis of perception. If you areunable to recover the sounds as such, hearing them again, at least recover the concept °S whatthey rnay have been.If you will examine this disc, you will find that it lists six perceptions with which youhave contacted the physical universe. Actually there are many more of these than six.40"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"When the word “emotion” is uppermost above a question ffler you have recalled theincident suggested by the question, you then try to recall in particular and feel again, ifpossible, the emotion you felt at the time. When the next question is addressed the disc isrotated one turn counterclockwise. You will find that “loudness” is now uppermost. Youshould get an incident in recall suggested by the question and having perceived the incident youshould then give your attention in particular to the loudness of the various sounds in theincident.Going to the next question, you should rotate the disc once more counterclockwise.You will find that “body position” is now uppermost. You should read the question and recallsome incident it suggests, perceive it as well as you possibly can and then give particularattention to the position your own body was in at the time the incident occurred. Going to thenext question and rotating the disc once more you will find that “sound” is now uppermost.You should recall the incident the question calls for and then give particular attention to thesounds in that incident. Going to the next question and rotating the disc once more, you will&d that “weight” is uppermost. In the incident you recall you should then give attention to theheaviness of things, including the pull of gravity on yourself and the weight of anything youmay actually be supporting in the incident such as your clothes, a ball or any other thing whichyou are actually holding at the time the incident occurred.Rotating the disc once more to the next question on the list, you will find that “personalmotion” falls uppermost. When you have answered the question then you should give attentionto the motion which you yourself were undertaking at the time the incident occurred.Every time you go to a new page you should turn the disc upside down. You will findhere a new set of perceptics. These, of course, are applied in such a way that when you go overthe list a second time you will probably not have the same perception, as these things fall atrandom. Thus while you might have answered a question the first time about somebodycoming towards you with attention to sound called for by the disc, the next time you reach thisquestion, on going over the list again, you may find “emotion” uppermost. You should thencontact any and all emotion on the second time, whereas you contacted the sound the first time.You will find on the reverse side of the disc the perceptions of sight, srnell, touch, color, toneand external motion. Sight is what you actually saw at the time. A person whose perceptionsare in good condition will see again what he has seen before when the incident actuallyoccurred. Thus sight calls for what was seen while the incident called for was taking place.Smell requests the individual to recall any and all odors which were present during the scene heis recalling. Touch requests the recall of anything the individual was actually touching at thetime with the sensation of touch, including pressure. One is always in contact with the materialworld in terms of touch, even if only the touch of his feet on the ground or the feel of hisclothes upon him. The perception of color, when uppermost, should cause the individual to tryto perceive again the color which was contained in the scene called forWhen tone is requested the individual should attempt to contact the quality of the soundpresent when the scene occurred. When external motion is uppermost the individual, inrecalling the incident called for by the question, should attempt to perceive in the incidentrecalled the movement contained in the incident, the motion of other people or objects or ofenergy.As one goes over these questions then with the disc, he is exploring his own life andduring that exploration is attempting to call into view with the highest possible level of realitythose things he has perceived. The immediate result is a heightening of perception of hispresent-time world. Another result is a strengthening of his memory. Yet another result is therearrangement and reevaluation of things which have happened to him. Another and moremechanical and fundamental result is the deintensification of unpleasant experiences—likebringing them into the light. For a while one may feel it is better to forget unpleasant things.Forgotten, they have more force and destructive quality than when examined.41"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The individual will find himself, as he repeatedly uses a list, getting earlier and earlierincidents. It is not impossible for him to remember straight back to the earliest beginnings ofhis life, much less his infancy.Again, and it cannot be emphasized too strongly, these questions are requesting actualphysical actions, not statements about physical actions. It is perfectly legitimate to recall sceneswhich have been seen in the movies or read about in books, but when one recalls such scenesone should have full awareness, in the case of the movies, of the screen and the seat and wherethe incident is taking place and when. In the case of books one should get not the scene theauthor would like the reader to see but the actual scene of reading and the recall should berecaptured in terms of print and sitting in a chair, not in terms of imagining.There is a great deal of technology out of sight back of these questions. All that isimportant is that this operation, continued persistently, going over one list and then another andrecalling the things required, considerably improves the individual’s thinking and actingabilities and his physical well being and considerably enhances his relationship with his presentenvironment.You will find the very last list is named the “End of Session List.” This means that afteryou have worked a list, or worked as long as you desire to, during any one period of self-processing, you should turn to the “End of Session List” and answer the questions as a routineoperation.You will also find a list entitled “When Uncomfortable”, which is placed next to the lastin the book. If you find during a session of self-processing that you grow considerablyuncomfortable or unhappy, you should then turn to the “When Uncomfortable” list. Using itshould restore your good spirit swiftly.If you find it is extremely difficult to recall any one question in these lists, simply passover it and go to the next question. If you find you are having difficulty in answering any ofthese lists you will do better if some friend reads them to you.If undergoing self-processing makes you extremely unhappy it is probable that yourcase should be given the attention of a dianetic auditor until such time as you are capable ofhandling this matter for yourself.You can go over a list many times before going on to the next list or you can continueon through all of the lists consecutively without repeating any. You will probably find thatgoing over each list many times before going on to the next will work better than going throughthe book consecutively. You will notice that after you have been over the same memory severaltimes, even though it be an unpleasant one, that it will cease to have any effect upon you. Thismeans its intensity is decreasing and that the energy which it contained and which was affectingyour present time life is dissipating. If you can remember several incidents of the same kind, doso; and if they are troublesome to you, simply go over the things you remembered once more,one after the other, and then again. This, dianetically speaking, is called repetitive straight wire.It de-intensifies unpleasant memories. However, this list is aimed toward the recall of pleasantincidents. Pleasant incidents do not de-intensify as unpleasant ones do but, underneath the levelof attention, deintensify unpleasant incidents when the pleasant incident is recalled.All you really need to work these lists is to know that actions, not words, are requiredand that the disc should be used to give you the particular kind of recall you should have on therecollection called for. If you lose the disc you will note that the bottom of the page has a list ofthe perceptions for your reference. When using the bottom-of-the-page list you should merelytake the recalls,.the perceptions, consecutively one after the other and use them the same wayyou used them with the disc.Don’t simply answer questions “Yes” or “No”. Select an actual moment in your lifecalled for by the question. Try to re-sense that moment with the perceptic called for on the disc.42"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"If going over the questions makes you unhappy, simply continue with the list you areworking, over and over. The unhappiness should “wear out” after unhappy incidents arerecalled many times. The feeling will turn to one of relief.Some people are frightened at the idea of persevering with these questions. Certainlyyou’ve got more nerve than that. The worst they could do is kill you.Don’t be surprised if you feel sleepy after using some of these questions. Thesleepiness is only a symptom of relaxing. The very least the book can do for you is replaceyour sedatives!If, while answering these questions, you begin to yawn, that is good. Yawning is arelease of former periods of unconsciousness. You may yawn so much the tears come out ofyour eyes. That is progress.Should you feel very groggy while answering these questions, that is only “boil-off “,the manifestation of former periods of unconsciousness boiling off. Simply persist in recallingthe incident or others like it and the feeling wiU pass away, leaving you more alert than before.If you interrupt this “boil-off” and stop your session, you may feel cross or irritable. Thisgrogginess occasionally amounts to nearly complete unconsciousness, but it always goesaway. That unconsciousness was what was keeping you from being high on the tone scale.Occasionally vague or even sharp pains may turn on and off as you are answeringquestions. Don’t try to find out where they came from. They will go away if you persist withthese questions. Simply ignore them. They are the ghosts of what they used to callpsychosomatic ills, former injuries restirnulated.An individual is suppressed by these deposits of past pain and unconsciousness.

It may be thathe cannot immediately recall certain periods. These periods are said to be occluded. Workingwith these lists in general, such occluded periods will gradually disappear when one’s life is inrecall to the betterment of his mental and physical well being and his perception of his present-time environment- In Dianetics it is considered that everyone has a “time track”. Everythingwhich an individual has perceived throughout his life is recorded on this “time track” from thebeginning to the end. It is dangerous to have occlusions since the data in the occluded areabecomes compulsive and causes less than optimum conduct. This list is intended to straightenout the track in general.

While each ofthe questions listed pertains to a specific sense channel such as light or sound, the disc couldstill be used, for what is required are specific moments when you were using various sensesand any specific moment includes many other sense messages than the one which is called for.Therefore, use the disc as in any other questions and after you have recalled a specific incidentcalled for in the question then try recalling it with specific attention to that sense whichhappened to be uppermost on the disc at that time.Time SenseAnyone has a sense of time. This sense is apt to become aberrated. The existence ofclocks at every hand seems to tell us that we need mechanical assistance in knowing what timeit is. The first person that had an aberrated or dearranged time sense made the first clockdesirable—but only for him. Clocks and calendars are artificial symbols representing timewhich is an actual commodity and which can be sensed directly by the individual. This sectionand almost every other section in these lists rehabilitates the sense of time. Time in mostpeople’s minds is confused with space. The words which describe time are also the wordswhich describe space, which shows that man has an indifferent attention for his time sense.The organism measures time in many ways, but mostly in terms of motion and growth ordecay. Change is the most striking symbol of time passage, but there is a direct sense of timewhich everyone has although it may be occluded by a society which, using clocks andcalendars, seems to invalidate the fact that it exists no confusion of any kind about time.Can you recall a time when:1.

Personal Motion51"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"SightThere are several portions of the sense channel called sight. Light waves, coming fromthe sun, moon, stars, or artificial sources, reflect from objects and the light waves enter theeyes and are recorded as present time action or as memory for future reference. Light sourcesare also recorded. This is the sense perception called sight. It has subdivisions. First of thesemight be considered to be motion, wherein sight depends upon a time span to record acontinuously changing picture. While one may see motion in present time, various aberrationsof sight may cause him to recall only still pictures. Nevertheless, all the motions are stillrecorded and can be recalled as moving pictures. In this way all other senses have a dependenceupon time in order to bring in the message of motion, since motion is also recorded by the otherperceptions. More particularly, part of sight is color perception. There are people who are colorblind in present time; that is to say, they can see color but are unable to perceive differences ofshading. There are people who may see color in present time but in trying to recall what theyhave seen, recall only in black and white. This would be recall color blind- ness. The color isfully deleted. It is an aberration easily re- medied when one recalls things he has seen in coloras black and white or as still pictures.Another part of sight is depth perception. Depth perception is observed in two ways.One is by seeing the difference in size of objects and so having a conception of the fact that oneis further back than another or that the object itself is at a distance and the other is a“stereoscopic” effect occasioned by the fact is again remediable. An individual who could notperceive motion in present time and who additionally could not perceive color or depth wouldbe a very bad risk as a driver; almost as bad is that individual who cannot recall what he hasseen; depth perception in present time and yet, in recall, see pictures flat and without depthperception. This lack of depth perception is again remediable. An individual who could notperceive motion in present time and who additionally could not perceive color or depth wouldbe a very bad risk as a driver; almost as bad is that individual who cannot recall what he hasseen; or if he can recall it, cannot do so with depth perception, full color and motion. This partof this list is devoted to giving you a better insight into sight. All these perceptics are exercisedover and over by these lists in general.

It is particularly trying onchildren, and undoubtedly was on you when you were a child, to be surrounded with objectswhich are so large. When one is actually getting a good recall on a childhood incident he isquite often startled to see how big things appeared to him and how large were those giants, theadults, with which he was surrounded. The feeling of being small in the vicinity of largeobjects sometimes produces the feeling of inadequacy. It is even said that people who aresmaller than the average feel less secure in their environment. This evidently stems from thefact that their grown up size has not reached the average and thus the feeling of smallness andinadequacy during childhood is in constant restimulation. It is not because the person, thoughsmaller, is really inadequate. In such a way people who are taller than the average becomeaware of the fact, mostly because people smaller than themselves find ways and means ofnullifying them because of their size. The perception of relative size is therefore an importantperception to rehabilitate and a person who is larger than others on the average would do wellto change the reading disc with which he is working these questions so that the word“loudness” on the disc is marked out and “relative size” is substituted.Can you recall a time when:1.

An objectmoves rapidly or slowly, and sets into vibration the air in its vicinity which pulses. When thesepulses strike the eardrum they set into motion the individual’s sound recording mechanism andthe sound is registered. Sound is absent in a vacuum and is actually merely a force wave.Sound in too great a volume or too discordant can be physically painful, just as light in toogreat a quantity can hurt the eyes. However, the amount of nervousness occasioned by sound,as by light, is mainly an aberration and it is not warranted, since the sound itself is notordinarily damaging, and there are few incidents in anyone’s life when a sound has had enoughphysical force to be physically damaging. Apprehension and anxiety about the physicaluniverse and other persons can, however, cause the individual to be nervous about sound, as itis one of the most reliable warning mechanisms; but starting at every sound in a civilizedenvironment, being afraid of voices of others, or even traffic noises is foolish, since men rarelylive a tooth-and-claw existence which warrants such attention. As sound becomes intermingledwith past pain, the individual mis- takes the moment and time he is hearing the sound, and somay associate it, as he may with other perceptics, with past pain. These lists permit anindividual to rehabilitate his skill in telling the difference between one time and another or onesituation . another.Sound has several parts. The first is pitch. This is the number of vibrations per unit oftime of any object from which sound, coming. The second is quality or tone which is simplythe difference between a jagged or ragged sound wave and smooth sound wave as in a musicalnote. The third is volume which merely means the force of the sound wave, its loudness orquietness.Rhythm is actually a part of the time sense, but is also ability to tell the spaces betweensound waves which are pulse regularly, as in the beating of a drum.Many people have what is called extended hearing, which is say they have too high analertness to sounds. This accompanies quite ordinarily, a general fear of the environment or thepeople in it. There is also deafness by which the individual simply shuts out sounds. Somedeafness is, of course, occasioned by entirely mechanical trouble with the recordingmechanism, but most deafness, particularly when partial, is psychosomatic or caused by mentalaberration. The individual may or may not be able, at first, to recall what he has heard andwhich has be recorded in the past, when he remembers it. In other words, it does not get asound when he remembers that he heard a sound. This is an occlusion of sound recordings.Recalling a sound in hearing it again is called “sonic” in Dianetics and is a desirablecircumstance which can be returned to the individual.It is interesting to note that there is also a depth perception in sound. A person havingtwo ears gets a “stereoscopic” effect on sources of sound so that he can tell how far they arefrom him and where they are located in relationship to him.57"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Can you recall a time when you heard:1.

Probably the sense of touch is the oldest sense in theterms of the central nervous system. It has four subdivisions.The first of these is pressure; the second is friction; the third is heat or cold; and the lastis oiliness. Just as an individual can be hard of hearing or have bad eyesight so can his sense oftouch be dulled or even almost absent. This condition is known as anaesthesia. Just as in anyother perceptic, the sense of touch can be pleasurable, unpleasant or painful. When anindividual has been considerably harmed, as in accidents, illness or injury, he tends to cutcommunication with the physical universe and other organisms, just as he cuts communicationby getting bad eyesight, becoming hard of hearing, etc.Not only can the sense of touch be dulled in some people, but it can be too sensitive inothers who have this sense channel aberrated until it seeks to contact danger more avidly thandanger exists. One of the manifestations of the aberrated sense of touch is too high a sensitivityto sexual contact rendering it painful or anxious, or a dulling of this contact sc that sensationcan be nearly absent.A sense of touch is very important. It is partially responsible for pleasure, as in sex andis to a large measure responsible for the sensation we know as physical pain. The sense oftouch extends from the central nervous system to the skin surface and as such is intimatelyconnected and most basically in contact with the physical universe. Sight and sound and theolfactory systems contact things usually at a distance, whereas touch is alert only to the closestproximity of actual contact.Touch is partially responsible for the pleasure taken in food and crosses, to this extent,the sense of taste. As a demonstration of how poorly the sense of touch serves many people,try laying your hand in a friendly fashion on the shoulder of someone. All too many people willdodge or shrink away from the contact. An aberrated sense of touch is partially responsible fora dislike of food as well as impotency and antipathy for the sexual act.The rehabilitation of the sense of touch goes a long way toward rehabilitating one’sconfidence in one’s environment and considerably enhances survival by making it possible forthe individual to obtain pleasure, where before there might only have been distaste.64"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Can you recall an incident when you felt/touched:1.

The principal ones are happiness, boredom, antagonism,anger, covert hostility, fear, grief, and apathy. Other emotions are usually simply greater orlesser magnitude than the ones listed. Terror, for instance, is a volume of fear. Sadness is asmall volume of grief. Dejection is a small part of apathy. Love is an intensity of happinessaddressed in a certain direction. These emotions form a gradient scale which make up inDianetics the Emotion section of the tone scale. Happiness is the highest emotion and apathy isthe lowest. A person can be chronically emotional along any level of this tone scale. Anindividual tends to move up or down this scale through these various listed emotions in theorder of the first sentence.Emotion monitors or regulates the endocrine system. The perceptions and the centralnervous system call for certain emotional secretions to catalyse the body to meet the varioussituations in the environment. Emotion is one of the easiest things to aberrate. There areindividuals who feel they must be perpetually sad, even when their circumstances should makethem happy. There are individuals who believe they have to be happy regardless of theirenvironment and who yet are very miserable. Most people are not emotional—they are misemotional, in that they do not react to the situations in their environment with the emotionwhich would be most rational to display The social order has confused irrationality withemotionalism. Actually a person who is fully rational would be most able to respond to thestimulus of his environment. Being rational does not mean being cold and calculating. Anindividual who is rationally happy can be counted upon to make the best calculations. Withoutfree emotion, an individual cannot appreciate as he should the pleasant things in hisenvironment. Lack of appreciation for art or music comes about when the individual cannot befreely emotional. The person who feels he must be coldblooded in order to be rational is whatis called in Dianetics a “control case”, and on examination will be found to be very far from asrational as he might be. People who cannot experience emotion because of their aberrations areordinarily sick people. Well people can experience emotion.Derangements in the endocrine system, such as the thyroid, the pancreas and otherglands, come about because of aberrations concerning emotion. It has been conclusively testedand proven in Dianetics that function controls structure. To a man or a woman who is aberratedsexually, injections of hormones are of little or no avail in moving the mental aberrations whichmake injections ineffective. Removing emotional aberration rehabilitates the endocrine systemso that the injections are usually not even necessary. When a person’s emotional reactionbecomes frozen, he can expect various physical difficulties such as ulcers, hypo-thyroidconditions, diabetes, and other ills which are more or less directly traceable to the endocrinesystem.Inhibited or excessive mis-emotionalism is one of the most destructive things which canoccur in the human organism. A person who is so aberrated is unable to experience happinessand so enjoy life. His physical body will not thrive.68"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Can you recall an incident when:1.

It is only after he discovershis inabilities in handling organisms, matter, energy, space and time, and when these thingshave been sharply painful to him, that he begins to decline physically, become less competentmentally, and to fail in life. These questions are aimed toward the rehabilitation of his ability tohandle organisms and the physical universe.It was a pre-dianetic error that an individual was healthy so long as he was adjusted tohis environment. Nothing could be less workable than this “adaptive” postulate and had anyonecared to compare it with actuality he would have discovered that the success of man dependsupon his ability to master and change his environment. Man succeeds because he adjusts hisenvironment to him, not by adjusting himself to the environment. The “adjusted” postulate isindeed a viciously dangerous one, since it seeks to indoctrinate the individual into the belief thathe must be a slave to his environment. The philosophy is dangerous because the people soindoctrinated can be enslaved in that last of all graveyards, a welfare state. However, thispostulate is very handy in case one wishes to subjugate or nullify human beings for his ownends. The effort in the direction of adjusting men to their environment by giving them “socialtraining”, by punishing them if they are bad, and by otherwise attempting to subdue and breakthem, has filled the society’s prisons and insane asylums to the bursting point. Had anyonecared to look at the real universe he would have found this to be true: No living organism canbe broken by force into an adjusted state and still remain able and amiable. Any horse trainer,for instance, knows that the horse must not be pushed or broken into submission if one wishesto retain his abilities, but, as they used to say in the army, mules were far more expensive thanmen, and perhaps it was not in the interest of pre-dianetic thought to preserve men in a happystate. However, one should not be too harsh on these previous schools of thought since theyhad no knowledge of the natural laws of thought and in the absence of these, criminals can onlybe punished and not cured and the insane can only be driven down into the last dregs oftractability. The nearer to death, according to those schools of thought, the better, as witnesselectric shock “therapy” and brain surgery—those efforts on the part of the mental medical mento as closely approximate euthanasia as possible without crossing the border into the legal factof death. These past schools have now been taken under the wing of Dianetics, whichembraces all fields of thought, and are being re-educated. It is found that they quickly desert thepunishment- drive “therapies” as soon as they completely understand that they are notnecessary, now that the natural laws of thought and behaviour are known. One cannot,however, wholly repress a shudder at the fate of the hundreds of thousands of human guineapigs whose lives and persons were ruined by the euthanistic methods employed in the darkages of unreason.Your health depends almost entirely upon your confidence in your ability to handle thephysical universe about you and to change and adjust your environment so that you can survivein it. It is actually an illusion that you cannot ably handle your environment, an illusionimplanted by aberrated people in the past, during moments when you were unconscious andcould not defend yourself or when you were small and were directed and misdirected and givenpain and sorrow and upset, and had no way to effect your right to handle yourself in yourenvironment.81"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"On Lake Tanganyika the natives have a very interesting way of catching fish. There onthe Equator the sun shines straight down through the clear water. The natives take blocks ofwood and string them along a long rope. They stretch this rope between two canoes and withthese abreast begin to paddle toward the shoal water. By the time they have reached the shoals,schools of fish are piled and crowded into the rocks and onto the beach. The blocks of woodon the rope made shadows which went all the way down to the bottom of the lake and the fish,seeing the approach of these shadows and the apparent solid bars which they formed in thewater, swam fearfully away from them and so were caught.A man can be driven and harassed and worked upon by aberrated people about himuntil he too conceives shadows to be reality. Should he simply reach out toward them, hewould discover how thin and penetratable they are. His usual course, however, is to retreatfrom them and at last find himself in the shadows of bad health, broken dreams and an utterdisownment of himself and the physical universe.A considerable mechanical background of the action and peculiarities of the energy ofthought make it possible for these lists to bring about the improved state of being that they do,when properly used; but over and above these mechanical aspects, the simple recognition thatthere have been times in one’s life when he did control the physical universe as needful, whenhe was in harmony with organisms about him, validate the reality of his ability.Caught up by the illusion of words, stressed into obedience when he was a child byphysical means, man is subject to his greatest shadow and illusion—language. The words,forcefully spoken, “Come here !” have no actual physical ability to draw the individual to thespeaker. Yet he may approach, although he may be afraid to do so. He is impelled in hisapproach because he has been made to “come here” by physical force so many times in theearly period of his life, while the words “come here” were being spoken, that he is trainedmuch like a dog to obey a signal. The physical force which made him approach is lost to viewand in its place stands the shadow “come here”; thus, to that degree he loses his self-determinism on the subject of “come here”. As life goes on, he makes the great error ofsupposing that any and all words have force and importance. With words, those about himplant their shadow cages. They restrict him from doing this; they compel him to do that andalmost hour-by-hour and day-by-day he is directed by streams of words which in the ordinarysociety are not meant to help him but only to restrain him because of the fear of others. ThisNiagara of language is effective only because it substitutes for periods when he was physicallyimpelled against his wishes to accept things he did not want, to care for things for which heactually had no use or liking, to go where he did not wish to go, and to do what he did notwant to do. Language is quite acceptable when understood as a symbol for the act and thing,but the word “ash tray” is no substitute for an ash tray. If you do not believe this, try to putyour ashes on the air waves which have just carried the words “ash tray”. Called a “saucer” oran “elephant”, the object intended for ashes serves just as well.By the trick of language, then, and a magical wholly un- substantial trick it is, men seekto order the lives of men for their own advantage, and men caged about by the shadowsobserve and believe to their own detriment.All languages derive from observation of matter, energy, space and time and otherorganisms in the environment. There is no word which is not derived and which does not havethe connotation of the physical universe and other organisms.Thus, when you answer these questions by recalling incidents which they evoke, bevery sure that you do not evoke language incidents but action incidents. You do not want thetime when you were told to do something—you want the time when you performed the action.You do not have to connect the language to the action in any way, but you will find as youanswer questions on any of these lists that the value of language begins to depreciateconsiderably and that language strangely enough will become much more useful to you.82"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Can you recall a time when:1.You moved an object.2.An object moved you.3.You threw an organism up into the air.4.

Howwould a deaf mute teach a child to remember? It would be necessary for him to keep forcingobjects or actions on the child when the child left them alone or omitted them. Although parentsare not deaf mutes, children do not understand languages at very early ages, and as aconsequence learn to “remember” by having their attention first called toward actions andobjects, spaces and time. It violates the self-determinism of the individual, and therefore hisability to handle himself, to have things forced upon him without his agreement. This could besaid to account, in part, for some of the “poor memories” about which people brag orcomplain.Because one learns language at the level of the physical universe and action within it, hecould be said to do with his thoughts what he has been compelled to do with the matter,energy, space and time in his environment. Thus, if these have been forced upon him and hedid not want them, after a while he will begin to reject the thoughts concerning these objects,but if these objects, spaces, times and actions are forced upon him consistently enough he willat length go into an apathy about them. He will not want them very much but he thinks he hasto accept them. Later on, in school, his whole livelihood seems to depend on whether or not hecan remember the “knowledge” which is forced upon him.The physical universe level of remembering then, is retaining matter, energy, space andtime. To improve the memory, it is only necessary to rehabilitate the individual’ s choice ofacceptance of the material universe.In answering these questions, particular attention should be paid to the happierincidents.

People can easilybecome confused between these two things so that they forget what they think they shouldremember and remember what they think they should forget. The basic and underlyingconfusion between forget and remember has to do, evidently, with what has been done to theindividual on a physical level and what has been forced on him or taken away from him interms of matter, energy, space and time.The word forget rests for its definition on the action of leaving something alone. Howwould a deaf mute teach a child to forget something? He would, of course, have to hide it orconsistently take it away from a child until the child went into apathy about it and would havenothing further to do with it. If he did this enough, so that the child would abandon the object,a child could be said to have forgotten the object, since the child, or any person, will do withhis thoughts what he has done with the matter, energy, space, time and organisms around him,thoughts being an approximation in symbological form of the physical universe. If a child hasbeen forcefully made to leave alone or abandon objects, energy, spaces and times, later onwhen he hears the word forget, this means he must abandon a certain thought and if he is inapathy concerning the forced loss of objects or having them taken away from him in childhood,he will proceed to forget them very thoroughly.It could be said that an individual will occlude as many thoughts as he has had to leavealone or those objects in life. Pain itself is a loss being uniformly accompanied by the loss ofcells of the body. Thus the loss of objects, or organisms, by the individual can be misconstruedas being painful. Memories then can be called painful which actually contain no physical pain.But the individual must have had physical pain in order to understand that the loss means pain.Punishment often accompanies, in child training, the times when the child is supposedto leave something alone. Thus, having to leave something alone is equivalent to being painful.Thus to remember something one is supposed to forget could be erroneously judged to bepainful and indeed it is not.There is a whole philosophy in existence that the best thing to do with unpleasantthoughts is to forget them. This is based securely upon an apathy occasioned by early training.A child when asking for an object will usually at first be cheerful and when he does not procureit will become angry; if he still does not procure it he may cry; and at last goes into apathyconcerning it and says that he does not want it. This is one of the derivations of the dianetictone scale and can be observed by anyone.These questions, then, are an effort to overcome the times when one has had to leavethings alone, when one has had to lose things, and when the loss has been enforced. Thus,when answering these questions, it would be very well to try to find several incidents for each,particularly a very early incident.88"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"Can you recall an incident when:1.

The incentive toward Survival is theacquisition of pleasure. The thrust away from death is the threat of pain. High ideals and ethicsenhance the potentialities of the individual and the group in surviving. The ultimate in Survivalis immortality.The factors which make up life can become contradictory in that one item can, in itself,assist survival and inhibit survival. A knife for instance is prosurvival in the hand, but contrasurvival when pointed at the breast by somebody else. As a person advances in life, hebecomes confused as to the survival value of certain persons, various objects, energy, spaceand time. The individual desires survival for himself, for his family, for his children, for hisgroup, for life in general, and the physical universe. Confusing one thing with another andbeholding an item which was once survival become nonsurvival, beholding nonsurvival entitiestaking on survival qualities, the ability of the individual to evaluate his environment in terms ofwhether it assists or inhibits survival deteriorates.An individual, a family, a group best survives, of course, when prosurvival entities arein proximity and available and when contrasurvival entities are absent. The struggle of lifecould be said to be the procurement of prosurvival factors and the annihilation, destruction,banishment of contrasurvival factors.Emotion is directly regulated by prosurvival and contra survival factors in life. When anindividual procures and has in his proximity a strong survival entity such as another person oranimal or object, he is happy. As this prosurvival entity departs from him, his emotionalreaction deteriorates in direct ratio to his belief in his ability to recover it. As it threatens todepart he becomes antagonistic and fights to keep it near him. If its departure seems certain, hewill become angry and lest it become prosurvival for another life form and he is assured he haslost it, he will even destroy it. When he realizes what his own state may be or the state of hisfamily, children or group with his prosurvival entity departed he experiences fear that its losswill be permanent. When he recognizes what he believes to be a nearly irretrievable absence ofthis prosurvival entity he experiences grief. When it is considered to be lost permanently heexperiences apathy and in apathy he may even go to the point of saying he did not want it.Actually, from antagonism on down the tone scale of emotion all the way to grief, he is stillfighting to get it back and only in apathy abandons it and negates against it.In the case of a person, animal, object, energy, space or time which threatens thesurvival of an individual, his family, his children, or his group, the best survival can beaccomplished when such an entity has been banished or destroyed or is as distant as possiblefrom the individual, his family, his children, or his group. In the case of the mad dog, thegreatest danger exists when he is nearest and the greatest safety exists when he is most distantor absent. With contrasurvival objects, then, we have the tone scale in reverse. When thecontrasurvival object is present and cannot be put away, the individual experiences apathy.When the individual believes himself to be threatened or when he feels his family, his childrenor his group are threatened by a contrasurvival object to a point where he cannot easily repel it,grief is experienced, for grief contains some hope of victory through enlisting the sympathy ofone’s allies. When a contrasurvival entity is threatening to approach, fear is experienced,providing one feels that direct attack is not possible. If the contrasurvival object is near, but theindividual, his family, his children or his group feel that it can be conquered, even though it isalready too close, anger results. If a contra survival entity might possibly approach, antagonismis demonstrated. Above this level contrasurvival objects may be more and more distant or easilyhandled up to the point where the individual can even be cheerful about them, at which timethey are either absent or can be handled with ease. Individuals get into a fixed emotional stateabout their environment when contrasurvival objects remain too statically in their environment92"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"or when prosurvival objects are too difficult to obtain and cannot be procured or brought nearor seem inclined to leave. Mixed with these emotional states is the confusion occasioned by adulled ability to differentiate between the pro and contrasurvival of an entity.A parent is contrasurvival in that he punishes, is much too big, and cannot becontributed to, which lessens the survival potentialities of a child. On the other hand, the sameparent furnishing food, clothing and shelter, and also, but not least, being an entity which lovesand can be loved, is a prosurvival entity. The parent entirely absent, then, is not a satisfactorysurvival state. The parent present is not a satisfactory survival state. Hence an indecision resultsand the individual demonstrates anxiety toward the parent. But this anxiety exists because ofmany hidden situations extending back to the beginning of an individuals life.

He reaches for something and is turned away from it, not simply by words,but by being himself removed from the object or having the object removed from him. He iskept out of spaces he wishes to enter by being pulled back. He is given one thing when hewants another. His self-determinism is continually interrupted thus in his efforts to explore,obtain or get rid of matter, energy, space or time. From these early interruptions the childbuilds up a long chain of experiences of interruption, not simply by speech but by barriers andobstacles in the physical universe. If he has not been thoroughly interrupted when a child, hecan analytically assess later interruptions, but if he has been handled and denied so as tointerrupt him when he is young, his power of decision is inhibited, to say nothing of his powerof speech and thought.Recalling special incidents as requested in this list brings them into the light and takesthe power from these chains of interruptions.Can you recall a time when:1.An object resisted you and you overcame it.2.You couldn’t move and then succeeded in getting away.3.

Inother words, “You do exact what I say or I am no ally of yours”. This is outright domination.Additionally, it seeks by anger and outright criticism, accusations, and other mechanisms topound another individual into submission by making him less. The second method might becalled domination by nullification. This is covert and quit often the person upon whom it isexerted remains unsuspecting beyond the fact that he knows he is very unhappy. This is thecoward’s method of domination. The person using it feels that he is less than the individualupon whom he is using it and has no the honesty or fortitude to admit the fact to himself. Hethe begins, much as termites gnaw away a foundation, as in California, to pull the otherindividual “down to size”, using small carping criticisms. The one who is seeking to dominatestrike heavily at the point of pride and capability of his target and yell if at any moment thetarget challenges the nullifier, the person using the mechanism claims he is doing so solely outof assistance and friendship, or disavows completely that it has been done. Of the twomethods, the latter is far more damaging. A person using this method seeks to reduce anotherindividual down to a point where he can be completely controlled and will not stop until he hasreduced the target into a confused apathy. The lowest common denominator of nullificationcould be called “invalidation”. The nullifier seeks to invalidate not only the person but the skillsand knowledge of his target. The possessions of the target are said to be not quite as importantas they might be. The experiences of the person being nullified a minimized. The target’slooks, strength, physical capabilities and potentialities are also invalidated. All this may be doneso covertly that it appears to be “in the best interest of” the target. The nullifier seeks to“improve” the person being invalidated.The first question of this list should be, of course, how many people have you knownwho have sought consistently under the mask of seeking to aid you to tear you apart as aperson, and reduce your future, your hopes, your goals, and the very energy of your life.105"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Can you recall a time when:1.
