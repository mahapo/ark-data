Does it make one happier or more able? Byit and with it, can he better achieve his goals ?This is useful knowledge. With it the bond again see, the lame walk, the ill recover, theinsane become sane and the sane become saner. By its use the thousand abilities Man hassought to recover become his once more.Like all useful knowledge it was hardly won. I began search into the back track ofMankind some years ago. There was no actual knowledge of it in existence. There werenumberless superstitions, countless guesses, as many theories in favour of one thing as infavour of another. People believed, some of them, that Man had lived before. They had noproof. Others believed that Man was born innocent and died and went to a place called Hell.Most believed that when you had lived once, that was all, fellow.Such a number of conflicting theories must have truth in them. It became my businessto discover, against considerable odds, that truth.In the first place, there was something wrong with Man. An animal such as a cat, evena reptile, a lizard, had habit patterns which carried him through his early days. Not Man. Whynot? As usual, a lot of vagueness answered this. The very schools of ‘thought’ that said Manwas just another animal bogged utterly on why it was that babies, the young of this veryintelligent animal, are much more stupid than kittens. That was only one thing wrong with Manthat wasn’t explained .The further one investigated, the more one came to understand that here, in this creatureHomo Sapiens, were entirely too many unknowns. People who suddenly, out of no observabletraining, begin to speak foreign tongues, men who ‘seem to remember having been herebefore,’ strange yearnings in people for various parts of the country or the world or the stars ofwhich they have no actual knowledge, such things are routine puzzles.And there was a much more important thing at work than mere curiosity. Now andthen, in my auditing, I would discover a case which would be extremely reluctant to recoverand then would recover only partially so long as I used data from the current lifetime of thepreclear; but as soon as I used the whole span of the time track— about sixty trillion years—Icould obtain immediate response.One must be very impartial, even brutal, in investigation. The last series of cases Iaudited, twenty in number, chosen at random from various life strata and suffering from mentaland physical ills which were extremely varied, were audited to demonstrate finally to myselfone thing only—Can an auditor obtain a swift recovery by auditing the current lifetime only? Iused the most modern of techniques— 1952—and did a standard auditing address to thecurrent lifetime of each one. I obtained mediocre results, partial recoveries, slight betterment inattitude. Then I audited each case addressing only past track, prior to this lifetime: the resultswere swift and spectacular. Thus I validated, for myself, the reality that in auditing the wholetrack, one can obtain excellent results, that in auditing the current lifetime, one can obtain slowand mediocre results. From this series came this conclusion: THE AUDITOR WHO INSISTSON AUDITING THE CURRENT LIFETIME ONLY WHEN HE HAS THE WHOLETRACK TECHNIQUE AVAILABLE, IS WASTING TIME AND EFFORT AND IS, INFACT, SWINDLING HIS PRECLEAR.I announced “whole track” techniques to a large number of auditors. I found the betterauditors quite willing to use them, and these immediately began to obtain “miracle level”results. A very few held back, were very cautious, would not employ the whole track, clung to1"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"this lifetime, invalidated the E-meter, invalidated what they erroneously called “past lives”,were scathingly critical of my employing such data. So I investigated the auditors.Several of these were given sessions by me. I found several noteworthy similaritiesabout them: they were so low in tone it was almost impossible to get them to register on an oldstyle Mathison, their cases were utterly bogged, they generally made a practice of refusing anyauditing, their general record with preclears was very poor, their own lives were runningbadly, they not only fought “past lives” as they called “whole track,” but they fought anytechnique evolved since the summer of 1950 or used later techniques poorly, they would notrun any overt acts even in this lifetime, they needed, so far as their cases were concerned, themost careful auditing. I found two people not auditors, who objected violently to “past lives”and who were “wide-open” cases. Both were in the inaccessible band, both had unsavourysocial records, both protested being audited in any incident of any kind. I concluded, therefore,that the relatively sane are capable of accepting evidence and the insane are not.Occasionally people have told me that I should not release the data contained in thisvolume because there would be a repercussion throughout the country which would ruinDianetics forever. Oddly enough, I’ve been unable to discover this repercussion. I have foundpeople alert and friendly toward this data. “Whole track” is evidently much more acceptablethan the idea of a prenatal. And witness a recent READER’S DIGEST, even the medicalprofession is accepting prenatals.Further, it is very hard to argue with a miracle. Today, Eleanor has arthritis. She isaudited “whole track” with 1952 techniques. Tonight she doesn’t have arthritis. Miracles, using“whole track” are plentiful. By using this data an auditor can obtain a MEST clear rather easily.But the best argument which can be advanced for “whole track” is that it is factual. Byusing this knowledge, more is obtained than auditing results. A preclear suddenly recovers theability carefully learned eighty years ago, to play a piano; an electronics engineer, doing poorlybefore suddenly wraps up formulae that would puzzle Einstein and which may get man offEarth; and a thousand details in a hundred sciences become clear.The search of this track began some years ago and was conducted sporadically on manypreclears. Various instruments such as the electroencephalograph and the police lie-detector,were used to further this search, but these were inadequate and limited for my purposes.Finally, Volney Mathison applied his electronic genius to the problem and invented theElectropsychometer. This instrument had a range and ability greatly in excess of anythingbefore known; it compares to itself only in the field of physioelectrical mensuration and toexisting devices as the electronic microscope compares to looking through a quartz stone. Assoon as this instrument was turned loose on the problem, the problem ceased to exist. Byadding up and checking probabilities on scores of persons, the character, extent and content ofthe whole track was mapped.Once the E-meter gave reliable data, the main problem became the estimation ofintentions, of sources, of the reasons behind the reasons. Most of this work has been done.It comments poorly on Man’s dullness that this project was impeded and slowed greatlyby lack of funds and by very active efforts on the part of some to acquire and own thecopyrights of Dianetics— may the ill of the world forgive them. Thus the map is not ascomplete in this issue as it might be.This work is honest research, done with considerable care. And it will bear up undersurvey by any competent auditor or investigator. The most amusing aspect of the “whole track”is that this work bears up under the onslaught of police lie-detector experts: these, hard-eyedand uncompromising, become startled half out of their wits to discover that some of the crimesthey find on their machines were committed two or three “lives” ago by the criminal under test,and that, most alarmingly, the crimes so discovered are discoverable again to the last detail inthe police archives. This is very upsetting to these operators, to be informed so bluntly that2"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Man lives many years, not three score and ten, and that today’s lifer may again be on theirhands tomorrow as a juvenile delinquent !Gravestones, ancient vital statistics, old diplomas and medals will verify in every detailthe validity of “many lifetimes.” Your E-meter will tell you.L. RON HUBBARD,1951.3"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONEThere are two general problems in processing preclears. The first is HOW to audit, thesecond is WHAT to audit. The present volume presupposes that the skill necessary to the Firstproblem has been mastered: and there is good reason why this should be the case. for thepresent techniques of Dianetics are far from difficult. SCIENTOLOGY 8-8008 to all patentsand purposes. putting the finishing touches on the knowledge necessary to handle thought.A study of HOW to audit embraces thought, emotion and effort. counter-thought,counter-emotion and counter-effort, and three actions of energy, the behaviour of attentionunits, the anatomy of maybe and a general knowledge of the background of Dianetics.Elementary group courses exist which, coupled with book study and. if possible study with acollege associate, give one all the insight and skill necessary to accomplish results.WHAT to audit is covered in some degree in other literature such as THE SCIENCEOF SURVIVAL and the first volume of Dianetics: DIANETICS: THE MODERN SCIENCEOF MENTAL HEALTH, as well as ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS. The currentwork is, however, the first coverage of all categories. It is written to be used in connection withELECTROPSYCHOMETRIC AUDITING and the INDIVIDUAL TRACK MAP, companionpieces of this present volume.There are four general fields of incidents. four areas of past. embraced in this work.These are:1. Present life, from pre-conception to present time;2. The genetic line, being the evolutionary chain on Earth;3. Large, specialised segments of the whole track;4. The theta body line or “whole track”.Of the four only the last is actually capable of producing the clear with any rapidity.However, the auditor should be familiar with all these lines. They are taken, one by one in theabove order in this volume.All incidents in this volume should be detected and audited with the assistance of anE-meter. If it were not for the E-meter these incidents would have remained undetected exceptin the haziest state. Without an E-meter, they cannot be audited with security or even safety forthe preclearHow to audit and What to audit together deserve considerable study. Certainly theydeserve more study than one would give American history or English or arithmetic, for theydeliver a greater dividend to the individual.Studying these incidents may be discovered to be restimulative to the student. If so, hewould find auditing them as restimulative. However, such restimulation is very easily resolvedand, unless he feels close to the end of tolerance, he should not be shy of auditing or studyingthe track.In SCIENTOLOGY 8-8008, we have seen that creative processing is far superior toany other type of processing. Creative processing does not address the facsimiles as such, itbreaks agreement on the power of the facsimiles. In order to audit a preclear however, oneshould have a very good acquaintance with what the facsimiles contain. If he has thisinformation, it is relatively simple for him to give the preclear “mockups” which approximatethe material in facsimiles without telling the preclear why such mock-ups are being given tohim; the facsimiles yet will themselves desensitize. The mock-ups should be parallel to the4"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"incidents which are given here, but should not be close enough to bring the preclear into theactual incident. For instance, in the matter of “FAC 1,” the preclear should be made to handleblack boxes, cameras, things with handles on them and should handle them in any environmenthe chooses, but not the environment of FAC 1 itself. All the various conditions of FAC 1 canbe approximated, preferably very widely until the preclear is no longer interested. In the matterof “FAC 1,” the auditor will find that, as soon as the preclear is given a black box on a tripod tohandle, he may have a tendency to set it on a throne and have large numbers of people bow toit, or have the contraption he has mocked-up chasing him. Do not in any case let him get anactual FAC 1 “coffee-grinder”. This will become clearer as one audits. If the auditor knows ofthe existence of these incidents, and if he finds them in the preclear with an E-meterassessment, then he should use some solid geometry parallel of the material in the actualincident, such as a light bulb for a thetan, etc.The auditor will soon find that he can tell at a glance in many cases what incidents hispreclear is sitting in. This requires experience. For instance, people who wear thickhorn-rimmed glasses and are thin are generally in the monitor valence of FAC 1 and will flipinto the incident with great suddenness if it is even closely approached; as FAC 1 accounts forTuberculosis in most cases, it will be seen, then, that this creative processing of whole-trackincidents is of considerable value. The auditor should not, however, run the actual incident, butshould study SCIENTOLOGY 8-8008 to discover how to approximate the incident withmock-ups.5"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOSEVERAL TARGETS PRESENT THEMSELVES IN A CASE and any one of themcan be audited with some profit.The complexity of the problem of human behaviour was a complexity of factors. not anunresolvable mass of twine. Once these factors are each one known and identified. very littletrouble is experienced .THOUGHT, EMOTION EFFORT, COUNTER-THOUGHT, COUNTER-EMOTION,COUNTER-EFFORT, motivator ATTENTION UNITS, overt ATTENTION UNITS, dedATTENTION UNITS and their manifestation on the various tone scale charts are the sum andtotal of factors to be audited out of any one target. Each and every auditing target contains thesefactors, is audited in the same way has the same basic behaviour pattern and succumbs to suchauditing It does not matter what target one is addressing in a case he will not discover wild orunexplained manifestations in HOW he audits that target. Each one in short, is made up of thesame woof and warp. Each one is basically theta. Theta behaves and manifests in a constantmanner, no matter what form it takes. Thus the auditor should quiet any apprehension he hasthat something he is auditing is behaving differently than a standard item. Variables, so far ashas been discovered do not exist in theta since the discoveries of Dianetics.There are several targets for the auditor. If he understands thoroughly what they are, hischances of mistaking one kind of incident for another are much reduced. They are in their orderof magnitude, not their importance.CELLULAR INJURIES comprise the first target. A cell is a living animal all by itself.The most necessary auditing on CELLULAR INJURIES is the emergency assist wherein theauditor repairs an accident, a burn, an incident which has just occurred. The auditor will findthat, in auditing a cellular injury which has just occurred, the somatics are very sharp and farmore painful than when auditing a standard facsimile. CELLULAR INJURIES are audited nodifferently than any other kind of incident. However, it must be remarked that individual cellshave “past lives”, the easiest manifestation of past lives to check. An auditor can follow aparticular cell throughout its own generations within the body and, as part of the evolutionaryline, discover many injuries to it. Further, in going back on the evolutionary line and auditingan injury to a single cell, the future positions of that cell are easily located in the body fromthere to the present, for the future injuries blow off like small sparks of pahl when the basicinjury is released. The migrations of a single cell throughout the body are very ease to track inthis fashion and ordinarily check against standard suppositions in the field of physical biology.The pulp of a tooth, for instance, tracks back, cell by cell, to early engrams; when these arerelieved a “toothache” in that tooth becomes almost impossible, no matter how many “nerves”are exposed, a matter which brings about quite a revolution he dentistry. CELLULARINJURIES do not require any special kind of auditing and they comprise no special kind ofinjury nor are there psycho-somatics which demand that the cells alone be audited.GENETIC ENTITY, the “GE”, is the second area of address. This is the entity whichcarries forward from the earliest formation of the MEST body. It is this entity which has the“genetic line” engrams. It is located more or less in the centre of the body the stomach but it isactually a composite of all the cellular experience on the line. It has the manifestation of a singleidentity. It was formerly referred to as the SOMATIC MIND (see DIANETICS: THEMODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH). Out of all the past experience of the MESTbody it makes up a form, a working carbon-oxygen engine. It has no real personality it is notthe “I” of the body. It has a record in many cases, of the entire experience forward until the lastlife. The GE has the record of past deaths. Auditing it alters physical structure, eradicatesphysical malformations. But these can be otherwise changed by auditing the theta being. TheGE facsimiles include a transfer of somatics from past theta beings, for it is not common for aGE to have the same theta being twice. The GE is the constant and continual workhorse of thetheta body. It regulates the heartbeat, takes care of all such responses, acts as a6"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"stimulus-response mind to avoid pain and discover pleasure and keeps the body running ingeneral. A GE departs from the body much later than the theta beings abandon one, sees itthrough the death to the end and only then leaves to join the line once more some two or threedays before conception. This is the “mind” of an animal, a dog or a cat or a cow.INJECTED ENTITIES are the third class of target. These are actually synthetics. Theyare ridges that “think”. They form a very complex pattern. They have geographical areas in thebody. These areas are standard, preclear to preclear. These areas answer up on an E-meter likeactual minds rather than compartments of a mind. The areas are the CENTRE (forehead anddown), the RIGHT INSIDE (from the edge of the jaw halfway out to the shoulder), theRIGHT OUTSIDE (from halfway to the shoulder to the point of the shoulder) the LEFTINSIDE (opposite from the right inside), the LEFT INSIDE (opposite from the right inside),the LEFT OUTSIDE (opposite from the right outside), the STOMACH ENTITY (located in thearea of the solar plexus), plus various other entities held in by these basic entities. Theseentities run off their own past deaths, on other tracks, hold sections of the body paralysed, barareas from being audited, withhold information from “I” and do other mischief. They areactually the basis of “demon circuits” (as covered in DIANETICS: THE MODERN SCIENCEOF MENTAL HEALTH) and they mirror the personality of persons antipathetic to the preclearThey are entirely stimulus-response. Each one has, from preclear to preclear, the samepersonality in the same body position. The RIGHT INSIDE, for instance, answers up to thename of “crew chief”. They are male and female. Their source is probably a “softened-up” thetabeing and they disappear when electronic incidents are audited. Prior to their disappearance,they can exhibit a wonderful and awesome role in confusing the preclear. The auditor can movethe attention of the preclear into one of these and audit it through a death or painful experienceand so bring it up to present time. In view of the fact that auditing basic electronic incidentseradicates them, little attention need be paid to them by the auditor beyond knowing that theyare there, that they are the “mysterious voices” in the heads of some preclears, that they makecritical or commanding remarks to him and serve, in general, as a fine source of aberration.Paralysis, anxiety stomachs, arthritis and many ills and aberrations have been relieved byauditing them. An E-meter shows them up and makes them confess their misdeeds. They areprobably just compartments of the mind which, cut off, begin to act as though they werepersons. Here is an inexhaustible source of study and speculation which I leave to another,having located the method of wiping them out without paying any attention to them.THETA BEINGS are the fourth and only really important target for the auditor. Thetheta being is the “I”, it is WHO the preclear is. If all the entities and beingnesses of the preclearwere hydrogen balloons locked up inside him and each had a name and identity, the auditormight be confused and the preclear IS confused as to who “I” is. But if the preclear weresuddenly opened and the balloons let loose, the “I” balloon would float free clear andunmistakable and that “I” balloon would be the theta being, it would be who the preclearalways thought he was anyway. All others are simply modifiers. The theta being does not getlost. It does not go away, it cannot be stolen. If it went away, the preclear would be with it andbe it. The vagueness of personal identity is caused by the confusion of the theta being, not its“inextricable” tanglement with other identities.The theta being can be confused in itself, it can be hypnotised, it can go to sleep. It canexperience emotions. It can think. It can feel pain. It is immortal in that it cannot die—but itcould possibly become so burdened with facsimiles that it could not continue along withbodies. It does not need a body to think, make facsimiles, experience emotions, remember orperceive.The theta being seems natively capable of producing considerable MEST energy.Facsimiles alone inhibit this ability. Whereas it has come to feel, in association with the badcompany of genetic entities and the MEST universe, that it is a stimulus-response thing, it isquite capable of generating thought independently of previous effort, counter effort orexperience.7"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The preclear is not guarding or harbouring or hiding his theta being— he IS his thetabeing. A relaxed understanding of this will prevent a considerable confusion on the part of theauditor and preclear. If the preclear is responding rationally, he is the theta being responding.As the theta being can be “put to sleep”, it is possible to bring then to the surface a GEor another entity which using the motor controls of the body, can talk or experience. But theindividual himself is not usually aware of what happened then. The various strangemulti-personality manifestations of the mind are occasioned by valences and their basics, theentities; ordinarily, unless the preclear is obviously insane, these sub-personalities are notdistinctly units in themselves but only colour the activities of the theta being.Hypnotism is the process of bringing into being the GE or other entity by putting thetheta being into unconsciousness. Self hypnosis is the process of the theta being hypnotizingGE or other entity and setting up a compulsive or inhibitive circuit with it.The auditor must know that the existence of a MEST body within the fields of the thetabeing is incidental and even unfortunate processing which, in the absence of a body, goesmuch faster.The theta being is both outside and inside the MEST body. It is not just inside. Theonly reason it is inside at all is that any field would penetrate the MEST body. The MEST bodyshould not be thought of as a harbour or vessel for the theta being. A better example would be asliver inserted unwantedly in the thumb where the thumb would be the Theta being, the MESTbody the sliver. MEST bodies are good identification tags, they generate exuding emotions,they are fun to operate at times, but they are no end of existence.A theta being with its alertness restored is capable of remoulding the human bods withinits field, taking off weight here, restoring it there, changing appearance and even height. Thebody can also be altered by auditing cells or the GE. All in all, bodies are very easy to handlewhere their condition is concerned. The question is rather, are they practical? The theta beingcan evidently manufacture bodies or a reasonable facsimile thereof which, while they do notlabour, neither do they have to be fed.To a society quite mad on the subject of MEST bodies, very aberrated on “care of thebody”, the foregoing may seem a trifle strange and one might think the writer had, to be short,slipped a cable or two he his wits. Indeed, it is very probable that critics may say so. For theirreality is entirely outraged by such sudden statements. But this matter has been underinvestigation for a year and a half as witness “THETA CLEAR” on the SCIENCE OFSURVIVAL tone-scale chart which I drew in January 1951. It states that the capabilities of atheta clear were unknown. Now they are not so unknown and while there is much to learnabout them still, much can be stated concerning them as clear fact. Back of these statements is atwo year public record of making statements which, under gruelling investigation by others,turn out to be exactly what they were said to be. Before turning away from the above, trySCIENTOLOGY 8-8008 and learn again what it is to be truly FREE. An hours auditing willprove it.8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREETHE PRESENT LIFE is always of considerable interest to the preclear.In the first place, he is continuing to live in the environment and society, usually, inwhich he is being audited. He must still face situations which the auditor will discover. Thedramatis personae of this period is, to some extent, still living or their artifacts are yet in plainview.In the second place, the preclear is still connected to these incidents by the identifyinglabel of his present life name and he is continually called by this label and has it confused withhimself.In the third place, these facsimiles have not been invalidated by the shock of a death andthe “helpful hands” of the “between lives” crew and so are normally visible.Fourthly, in this life we have the combination of the current GENETIC BEING and thecurrent THETA BEING and their struggle to even the harsh roadway of living and theirdivergence of goals.Present life or any life that comes to view should be to some extent, cleared up for thepreclear. Lives are, to some degree, units in themselves. This is caused by the fact that each lifewhile the preclear has been “with body” is lived with a different basic team: the GENETICBEING carries on through the evolutionary line, parallel with the protoplasmic line, generationto generation, usually on the same planet—in this case, EARTH. The THETA BEING comesinto the line from various quarters and each time usually enters an entirely different GE line.Any one life then, is lived with a different GE. The preclear is always and always was andalways will be the THETA BEING. But the THETA BEING has, life to life, a different GE.The character and quality of the MEST body then is different in each lifetime, the past of theMEST body in each lifetime is different from the viewpoint of the theta being. Thus the thetabeing has variation of experience which is not always, life to life, the same pattern. Thus whenlives come to view they should be explored and audited as above, a few hours spent in this canmaterially assist a recovery.The PRESENT LIFE is important out of proportion to the small fraction of total age ofthe theta being; the auditor will find himself, in most cases, compelled to spend many hoursupon it. But he should-not audit any heavy incidents in the present lifetime. These have basicswhich reduce much more swiftly, and these basics are always earlier by many ages.The time spent on the present life earlier in Dianetics was very great. It required scoresor hundreds of hours of auditing to achieve optimum results, and then only with great cunningcould the auditor achieve his goal. Swifter techniques made present life much easier to audit,cut down the time required and increased the results, but the same results can be achieved muchmore swiftly with much less skill and cunning when one audits WHOLE TRACK, meaning thetrack of the theta being.Just as “medical science” has accepted PRENATAL EXPERIENCE according to theirbest heralds, the popular magazines such as CORONET and READER’S DIGEST, prenatalsfade into the obscurity of curiosa in Dianetics. Great as the results were which occurred whenone audited prenatals, results in the same time are now so incomparably greater in auditing thewhole track or even in using TECHNIQUE 80, that one need know very little about prenatals.In the first place, it has been discovered that prenatals happen to the GE, not the theta being.These recordings are so phonograph-record-like because they are wholly in the somatic mind(the GE). They deeply affect the current MEST body structure in many ways but this structurecan be otherwise repaired.9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The GENETIC ENTITY apparently enters the protoplasm line some two days or aweek prior to conception. There is some evidence that the GE is actually double, one enteringon the sperm side, one entering on the ovum side. If the matter were still important, some timecould be spent determining this, for the GE answers dually in present time.The GE continues as the guiding genius throughout prenatal life, building, regulatingthe heartbeat and attending to complex structural matters. It records every perception present,asleep or awake, conscious or unconscious (in knock-out or drugged sense), to the number ofthe (about) fifty perceptions present. Just as the doctor quite often hears a baby in a womb cry,just as he can hear its heartbeat with his stethoscope, so can the child hear what is occurringoutside his mother. This is a very important datum from the standpoint of PREVENTIVEDIANETICS for by knowing it, one can easily forecast the health and mental poise of a childafter birth by making certain that it has a good prenatal existence. Psychotics oftenDRAMATIZE (re-enact) these prenatal engrams and a trip through a sanatorium will show anauditor many prenatals in full play, running oft like records, ending and starting againendlessly.Here is the list of prenatals. They can be any combination of action known to thebusiness of living, but these are the common ones.Prenatal IncidentsAll incidents in any environment are prone to be repeated. Thus these incidentscommonly appear in long chains, many incidents in each, each incident much the same as thelast. To audit the chain one should get the basic on that chain:COITUS CHAIN, FATHERCOITUS CHAIN, LOVERCONSTIPATION CHAINORDINARY BOWEL CHAINDOUCHE CHAINSICKNESS CHAIN, mother’s illnessSICKNESS CHAIN, another member of the family’s illnessWORK CHAIN, mother’s heavy activities at workEXERCISE CHAIN, mother’s activity in sports or calisthenicsMORNING SICKNESS CHAINCONTRACEPTIVE CHAINFIGHT CHAIN, family quarrelsFIGHT CHAIN, outside the homeHIGH BLOOD PRESSURE CHAIN, mother’s high blood pressureDOCTOR EXAMINATION CHAIN, punching motherALCOHOLIC CHAIN, mother’s drinkingACCIDENT CHAIN, mother’s falls and bumpsATTEMPTED ABORTION, SURGICALATTEMPTED ABORTION, DOUCHEATTEMPTED ABORTION BY PRESSUREATTEMPTED ABORTION BY EXERCISE OR JUMPINGCOUGH CHAIN, mother’s coughingCOUGH CHAIN, other members of familyHICCOUGH CHAINMASTURBATION CHAIN, mother’s masturbationCRYING CHAIN, mother’s cryingPre-sperm recordings are quite ordinary. The sperm sequence itself is worthy of notefor it is a race of which the sperm is very conscious. His travails in reaching the ovum aremany. There is a “visio” which is quite standard, of the race. There is quite often a light, a10"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"spark, in this sequence. The sperm reaches the ovum and merges. This merging is anotherincident, conception.Pre-ovum sequences are on record but are not common. The rolling of the ovum downthe tube is commonly recorded.Conception and the impulses generated answer the conditions for one type of cancer,embryonic.Mitosis is an incident. Cellular division, once or many times, is on common record.Mitosis answers the conditions for the other type of cancer—malignant cell.Cancer has been eradicated by auditing out conception and mitosis.The theta being apparently joins the track immediately prior to birth. Its sequence, foritself, is DEATH, BETWEEN-LIVES, BIRTH, all in a few minutes according to somefindings, a sequence which is quite aberrative.The theta being’s joining is called the STARTER. The theta being sometimes fightsaway another theta being, sometimes considers this an overt act.You may audit an entire prenatal bank without getting as much rise in the preclear’s toneas auditing one STARTER for the theta being, after all, is the preclear.BIRTH is a very aberrative affair and a difficult or complicated birth can aberrate theentire lifetime of the MEST body. But this means that birth should be without conversation, ina darkened and quiet room with high humidity and without draughts, not that you should auditbirths. In other words, one should know how aberrative birth is, but one should not audit birthas a practice. One “Facsimile One” has as many as eighty-thousand births on it as locks. Birthpresents itself to be audited much of the time because Mother, complaining of how difficult thepreclear’s birth was, makes it into an overt act. This overt act had birth as a motivator. Thus,preclears are anxious to have their birth engram audited.INFANT and CHILDHOOD ILLNESS are important because in them the theta beingloses much of the control of the body. The incidents of degradation which precede these,however, are a more important target for the auditor.Most preclears are stuck somewhere on the present life track. The E-meter will tell theauditor where if the auditor asks in terms of years. It is rarely where the preclear thinks it is.Operations, accidents. illnesses are all more or less routine. The auditor should take them as heis given them by the E-meter or symbols or both, but he should not audit them as such unlesshe is strongly forced to do so: the incidents on which they depend are so much earlier, so muchmore aberrative.For every motivator in the present life there is an overt or a ded. Thus it behooves theauditor to pay much more attention to using TECHNIQUE 80* than it does to find new andstrange present life incidents to audit. It should not require more than a score of hours to cleanup the present life until heavy incidents in the past can be audited: this is true for the neuroticand relatively sane only, it is not true for the psychotics: for them it may be necessary to auditprenatals or use other techniques and to spend perhaps hundreds of hours of ARC processingto make them entirely sane and stable.Present life incidents, by test, cannot quickly resolve any case. Audit present life onlyuntil one can audit theta line material with safety.* Additional data in “Scientology 8-80” by L. Ron Hubbard.11"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURTHE GENETIC LINE consists of the total of incidents which have occurred during theevolution of the MEST body itself. The composite of these facsimiles has the semblance of abeing. This being would be called the GENETIC ENTITY or the “GE”.The GE is not an actual individual but a composite of individualities assumed in thesingle lives along the evolutionary track.The discovery of the GE makes it possible at last to vindicate the theory of evolutionproposed by Darwin and to discover the various missing connections in the line as well as toexplore the characteristics, goals and developmental urges of organisms on the evolutionaryline. Further, the discovery of the GE makes it possible to adjust hitherto contrary material inthe theory of evolution.Darwin and others proposed some scores of years since that an animal body wasdeveloped by necessity into successive organisms, each one better adjusted to its environment.The organisms began in simplicity and graduated through successive aeons into complexity.Darwin proposed that natural selection was the guiding principle and that protoplasm, genes,etc., were alone capable of modifying the organism. Later workers proposed ingenious theoriesof electronic mutation. Prior to these discoveries of Darwin and others Earthmen acceptedvarious impossibilities as the explanation of the variety of animal forms. The Vedic theoriespersisted until the early A.Ds. when a new cult arose in the Middle East 30° N. Lat. 30° to 80°E. Long. Earth) and proposed that animals had been created suddenly from mud by a Creatorand that this included Man. The Vedic peoples had proposed much earlier that a sort ofevolution was responsible for the various forms. Darwin and his co-workers picked up thistheory after the Vedic hymns had been translated to Europe, about a century earlier, concurrentwith the French English conquest of India. Considerable turmoil resulted from the introductionof the Darwinian theories as these were then in direct contrast with the existing superstition. Atrial of a school teacher who dared teach the theory of evolution in a backwoods area of theUnited States resulted in a victory for the superstition. the school teacher standing convicted.But evolution received so much publicity over the world as a result that it is now the generallytaught theory in schools.However, one should not think of evolution as a standard or precise theory. It is asprawling and contradictory mass of poorly compiled data taken from ancient swamps and tarpits, and there are many schools of evolution. These are taught un-uniformly in biologyclasses. Biology is based on “cytology” or the study of cells. Existing theory in cytology isquite contradictory to various tenets of evolution. In other words, the field is poorly integratedand badly understood and not overly gifted with data. The discoveries in Scientology can beaddressed to these sciences of biology and cytology with considerable profit. By auditingpreviously uninformed preclears up this evolutionary line, the results are similar if not identical.The most direct address to altering the shape and form of the MEST body of thepreclear is the auditing of the evolutionary line. Many illnesses, aches and pains are residual inthe body line itself. These are restimulated by the environment or the thoughts and actions ofthe theta being and, once restimulated, alter the physical condition of the body. However, thebody is responsive in present time to the command of a re-strengthened theta being and theshape and condition of the body can be otherwise changed than by solely addressing the GE.Single or multiple cells respond each one as though it had its own GE. Very early onthe time track, in the area of the photon converter or the “helper”, the GE and the cell entity arethe same, for here the incidents are single cell incidents.The theory of the epicentres applies very particularly along the MEST evolutionary line.This theory holds that in any given generation on the evolutionary line, the sum of itscounter-efforts will form, in the next generation, the new command post. Every central relay12"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"point of the nerve system has been, at some time or another on the evolutionary line, acommand post or a sub-command post of the organism. As the organism develops thesecommand posts each one is subjected to new counter-efforts which forms the area of the newcommand post. Thus the body has many old command posts from which the “somatic mind”(or GE) controlled all the responses of the body. The “funny bone” in the elbow is an oldsub-command post, an old epicentre. Any point of reflex response in the body was an oldcommand post or sub-command post. These epicentres stand along the nerve channels of thebody and are like switchboards. They still command their immediate areas and, independentlyof the central command post in the brain, can cause reaction in their area. The best example ofthis and the most important point for the auditor is the fact that two separate lines once merged(mollusc) and thereafter worked together as a team. These lines each one now has its owncommand post, its own memory bank. These two lines are the right and left brain lobes. Theone in ascendancy ordinarily commands the one in subjugation. The right side of the braincontrols the left side of the body. The left side of the brain controls the right side of the body.Malcoordination of the two halves of the body can be traced to imbalance or confusion oroutright warfare between these two control centres. Half-paralysis, stroke, anaesthesed areascan be traced in part to this mal-coordination of the present lifetime epicentres. Each one ofthese goes back as itself along the same track, generation to generation, sharing the sameexperiences, until one reaches the mollusc or bivalve state where each one has a prior andindependent and separate history. Either one is capable of controlling the whole body. In thebivalve state one finds them at war with each other in an effort to attain sole command of theentire bivalve.Right- and left-handedness are caused by these malcoordinations of the two lines.Actually one should be neither right-handed nor left-handed but ambidextrous: An entiretechnique, complete within itself, was worked out some months ago when I first encounteredthese phenomena. This technique has been working so well for some auditors that they wonderwhy any newer data is introduced. The technique consists of obtaining optimumcommunication amongst all epicentres in the body wit h the result of a complete unity of actionby the body. This does a great deal for timing and coordination in general and has been knownto eradicate severe psycho-somatic ills. Theta line techniques, being addressed to “I” rather thanto the MEST body, produce swifter results.Here is a wealth of material for the investigator. The principal incidents andcircumstances on this line have already been located and were located before this data wasreleased the first time. But innumerable structural puzzles are resolved with this data and feware the preclears whose bodies do not react vigorously to the suggestion that some of theseincidents may exist, so violent is the charge contained in these incidents. An E-meter has beenknown to drop as many as twenty dials on the auditor’s faint hint of the existence of the“helper” or the “weeper”.Life on the evolutionary line is grim, very tooth and claw. So overpoweringly awesomehas been life on this line that the violence pervaded the social theory of psychology for decadesand, indeed, has underlain the most basic philosophies of Man’s behaviour. Here, at the veryleast, is the explanation for so many theories in the past.It should not be overlooked that on this GE line one finds what the uninitiated call “pastlives”. This continuous living on the part of the somatic mind does not end with the ape. Itcontinues right on through to present time. The GE contains enormous amounts of data aboutrecent times and past times.The GE in America seems to have followed the track of the western civilizations. Thisaccounts in part for the strange fact that our histories give us enormous treatises on Greece andnothing on Persia, great tomes on Rome and little on Egypt, enormous writings on that smallcontinent Europe and very little on Asia. A correct track of civilization is not from Phoenicia,through Greece, Rome and Europe to America; it is from China through Chaldea, throughBabylonia through Persia, through Achea and minorly through Greece, Rome and Europe sincethese last form a decline from civilizations at various times and periods. It usually passed13"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"through Greece and Rome and Europe, which accounts for our fixation on these minor empiresand inferior societies. The point here is that a study of history is very restimulative to the GEand produces body alterations for which the theta being, not having been there usually, cannotaccount.YOU as a theta being, may or may not have seen Greece or Rome. Your MEST GE hasprobably activated a body there, just as it has been, (in accordance with Darwin and hisRussian copyist, one of the patron saints of the current slave state of Russia, Lysenko) ananthropoid in the deep forests of forgotten continents or a mollusc seeking to survive on theshore of some lost sea.By the way, if you cannot take a warning, your discussion of these incidents with theuninitiated in Scientology can produce havoc. Should you describe “the clam” to some one,you may restimulate it in him to the extent of causing severe jaw hinge pain. One such victim,after hearing about a clam death could not use his jaws for three days. Another “had to have”two molars extracted because of the resulting ache. The clam and all these incidents are verymuch present in the GE and can be restimulated easily. So do not be sadistic with yourdescribing them to people— unless, of course, they belligerently claim that Man has no pastmemory for his evolution. In that event, describe away. It makes believers over and aboveenriching your friend the dentist who, indeed, could not exist without these errors and incidentson the evolutionary line!The auditor should know about this line for it sometimes crosses the theta line, which isto say, it is “coexperienced” in places by the theta being. This is simple to unravel. Also, thepreclear may have a GE incident in such forceful restimulation that the auditor has no choice butto audit it. When one says GE incident, he means, of course, anything on the entireevolutionary line including “past lives”. One must not forget that the theta being has alsoshared, with another (not present) GE some of these past life experiences. One can discoverwhen the theta being first came to Earth, when it first had a Mest body on Earth, and sodiscover its first contact with some MEST body line—it has co-experienced with a GE in everylife where it has had a MEST body.There are extra-terrestrial GEs, perhaps GEs which evolved elsewhere and which arestill elsewhere. These GEs would be on the evolutionary line of some other planet. They wouldnot cross into this evolutionary line. But the theta being, where it has had a MEST body onsome other planet may have had it in company with a GE there which had its own peculiarities.One almost never audits such a thing, but it is remarked that it can be there.The following incidents are audited with the usual tools of Dianetics and Scientology,with due attention to TECHNIQUE 80. One may wonder what a clam might consider an overtact. The best way to find out is to put it on the E-meter and ask. Every one of these, when inevidence to be audited, is part of a motivator-overt combination. When they do not react on ameter, when they do not present themselves to be audited, don’t bother to go looking for them.If they are to be audited, they will react with violence, as much as a five or twenty dial drop onan E-meter. If they drop in such a fashion there is a companion incident, which is to say thatthey have motivators where they are overt acts and overt acts where they are motivators. Such adrop means that they are being used in present time as motivators or overt acts.The AtomLucretius said that each atom was life. This may or may not be true. But the firstincident one finds in the GE behaves as though the preclear were an atom, complete withelectronic rings. This incident audits very poorly until it is located as a companion to someovert act.14"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"There seems to be a “hole in space” immediately ahead of the Atom. Just after this holeis a condition of motion, with the preclear in the centre, with rings of motion travelling aroundhim.Characteristic of this incident is a state of mind wanting no A-R-C, neither to receiveA-R-C, nor to give A-R-C, wanting NO A-R-C give or take. This is a comfortable aloneness.The preclear usually perceives from this his later necessities for ARC on a MEST level.The Cosmic ImpactAs physicists tell us, cosmic rays enter the body in large numbers and occasionallyexplode in the body. Very early on the track the impact of a-cosmic ray and its explosion isvery destructive to the existing organism. One is “accepting” rays and suddenly one explodes.Sometimes one is accepting one while another explodes elsewhere. This has been found fairlybasic on an anxiety stomach, on acception-rejection confusions. Remember that in all earlyincidents there is a GE line for the left side of the body and one for the right side and either onecan affect the whole body when it is run. Thus, there are ATOMS for the right and left andCOSMIC RAYS for the right and left sides both.The Photon ConverterAll early life is fixated on converting photons to energy. One finds the algae and theplankton taking their living from photons from the sun and minerals from the sea.Because at night there is no sunlight the photon converter sinks into an apathy whichaeons later becomes the MEST body’s craving for sleep. This is a basic problem of no energyreceived, very little storage for energy.All photon converter incidents are concerned with light and dark. the storms of the sea,the fight to keep from rolling into the surf. The fear of and combat with the merciless surf ischaracteristic of all early incidents until well after the “weeper”. Sending the ill to the seashoreto listen to surf is a guaranteed restimulator.There are many types of these incidents. A basic one is concerned with fear of sinking,effort to rise, for the photon converter must stay afloat.Past deaths as a photon converter are common. For only by dying and knowing howone died could the GE utilize the chief counter efforts which menaced. A chain of experiencewhich did not include death would not be able to build efficient organisms and would beunprofitable. Death on the GE line has a very great value and marks progress. Death on thetheta line is so much wasted time. Hence the quarrel between the GE and the theta being.The HelperTHE HELPER is one of the most powerful incidents in terms of charge on the earlytrack. It is actually mitosis or cell splitting.The GE carries along a tiny cell, mobile and swimming. Suddenly it decides to divide.It starts to split in half. There is usually an enormous struggle in this splitting. One side wantsto split, the other usually does not want to split. Having split, one side is energetic and starts togo about its business. Then it sees that the other side is limp and falling toward the mud belowthe water. The energetic side turns and dives and tries to nudge the other up to the surface, triesto revive it. The failing side may revive. In the incidents you will find there will be one of twooutcomes: the failing side fails despite the other’s efforts; the failing side revives and now, all15"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"energetic, swims away leaving to his fate the other that helped it and who is now too weak tolive and so sinks and dies.There are two sides to the HELPER. The whole sequence of the losing side is present,the whole sequence of the winning side is present. The confusion lies in the fact that each isitself, but a moment ago was the other. There are whole squads of HELPERS. It is a confusingarea for the GE which therein has much cause for misidentification.The ClamA variety of incidents may intervene between the HELPER and the WEEPER. Theseare the evolution chain which includes jellyfish, seaweed and some other forms. It is interestingthat immobile states are most liable to have heavy incidents. It is also interesting that bulbousseaweed, uprooted and cast shore by storms, gave Man some of his early experiences withsunlight in the absence of water. A distinct somatic of drying and itching is felt by preclearswhen they encounter this incident, a restimulation of the drying outer skin of the dyingseaweed. It is also interesting that bulbous seaweed is an early pattern of Man’s later generalform. Jellyfish incidents are quite remarkable for their occasional aberrative force; the jellyfishsometimes drifts into a cave or grotto and is pressed against the stone by rising tide and waves,thus gaining the first facsimiles which later become a shell as in the clam. Here is an example ofthe principle of counter-effort moulding the physical shape and necessities of forms.THE CLAM is a deadly incident but mostly when restimulated on purpose. Althoughthis area of the track is called the CLAM, it is improbable that the actual animal was a clam suchas our razorbacks. Visios on this seem to indicate that it is a scalloped-lip, white-shelledcreature. The clam was, of course, quite thoroughly fixed to the rocks and the state is verystatic. The clam had many troubles. The first of these troubles is the double-hinge problem.One hinge wishes to stay open, the other tries to close; thus conflict occurs. Here we have twocontrol centres, both of them more or less equal in power, having no internal communication.In the jellyfish we have the first third dynamic engrams where the goal is to holdtogether at all costs. As soon as the hinges are formed in the clam, we have our first efforts tobe completely contrary and internally at war. The solution occurs when one hinge goes intoapathy and the other assumes complete control.The hinge epicentres later become the hinges of the human jaw. Should you desire toconfirm this, describe to some uninitiated person the death of a clam without saying what youare describing. “Can you imagine a clam sitting on the beach, opening and closing its shell veryrapidly?” (Make a motion with your thumb and forefinger of a rapid opening and closing. Thevictim may grip his jaws with his hand and feel quite upset. He may even have to have a fewteeth pulled: At the very least he will argue as to whether or not the shell stays open at the endor closed. And he will, with no hint of the death aspect of it, talk about the “poor clam” and hewill feel quite sad emotionally.The clam had an astonishing number of adventures for so minor a creature. It would getthings into its shell and be unable to vet them out. It would get its shell stuck open and beunable to shut it. And it would come loose from its rocks under the surface of the water and gettossed into the broil of the surf. And it would become deserted by the tide and left to bakeunder a frying sun, a quite uncomfortable situation which restimulates sometimes in a sunburn.There was or is a spore method of procreation used by the clam. The spore was put onthe inside of the lip and permitted to grow. Eventually it became large enough to become a clamon its own and would depart. There is a guardian-emotion on the part of the clam for thesespores and a sadness on their departure. But there is more to the spore than this. The spore waslike a barnacle. When the clam was cast ashore, these spores were still alive in the shell. Thesun would kill the inner cells of the “barnacle” while the outer shell cells still lived. The deadinner cells would form a gas which, under the heat, would explode violently to the agony of the16"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"living barnacle shell cells. This bursting was sudden and painful. These spores gave incidentswhich permitted the human teeth to have a pattern. The ancient bursting engrams are stilldramatized by the teeth which, under stress, burst or feel like bursting. Running out some ofthese bursting incidents will take the ache out of a tooth rapidly. The “fifth nerve channel” isaround the mouth and is heavy out of all proportion. A nerve channel is as heavy as it has toconduit pain away from the area. Thus I deduced that there must have been much pain in thisarea and that the “fifth channel” is the oldest main conduit and so it is. Audit all such incidentsfor all teeth and you have permanently taken the pain out of toothache and cut down decay. Bythe way, a barnacle, because of this bursting possibility, at length developed a “blow-out area”a cap which would blow easily. And teeth have such an area. It gives way and makes cavities.The clam had many, many deaths. A scan across its deaths locates the one inrestimulation. You will be amazed to find the clam sufficiently advanced as a cellular-somaticmind to have postulates, to think thoughts.THE CLAM is actually a group of incidents rather than a single one.The WeeperAfter leaving the sea, the GE spent a half a million years on the beach. It had alreadyknown about air as a plankton, had known about the beach as seaweed and dying clam. But itnevertheless required some half a million years, according to the evolutionists, for the creatureto learn to use the land.The plights of THE WEEPER are many and pathetic. Still obtaining its food from thewaves, it yet had to breathe. Waves are impetuous and often irregular. The WEEPER wouldopen up to get food from the water and get a wave in the shell. It would vigorously pump outthe water and try to get some air and then, before it could gulp atmosphere, be hit by anotherwave. Here was anxiety. Being still a shell animal, the mobility of the WEEPER is poor. Itcould not withdraw rapidly nor advance rapidly. Tides went out and left it to bake and thirst.The sand got into it. And it had to pump water swiftly in order to continue to live.The WEEPER is so-called because it had to pump salt water. It was deduced that cryingin a human being is very unnatural. Why is it that a human has to pump out some salt water inorder to feel better— which is to say, why does crying out a grief charge produce such achange in a case ? The incident must be one of pumping out salt water.And this is practically the total activity of the WEEPER which, living perilously on theedge of the surf, had to pump to eat and to breathe. The creature had two pumping tubes. Theselater became, because they were furthest toward the light, the eyes of the human being. Thesetubes had very rough treatment, getting full of sand, being battered by surf.The inability of a preclear to cry is partly a hang-up in the WEEPER. He is about to behit by a wave, has his eyes full of sand or is frightened about opening his shell because he maybe hit. An occluded case is sometimes merely a case of “shell-shut”.Get the preclear to imagine that his eyes are in his mouth, looking out. Get him to scanthrough such a situation. You will find the weeper which he has in restimulation.It you make a preclear go through all the physical notions of sobbing convulsively, nomatter what his emotion may be, he may connect with the weeper. Belching, gasping, sobbing,choking, shuddering, trembling. are all manifestations of emotional dramatization of theweeper.The weeper (originally called “the Grim Weeper” or the Boohoo) had trillions ofmisadventures. Scanning over these, the auditor will find the one or two which have remainedin restimulation and which are open to auditing.17"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The VolcanoesEarth was undergoing volcanic upheavals during the days of life on the beach. Possiblyit was this volcanic action which served the chain of evolution for there is a lack of real reasonwhy this evolution should not be continuing on even today. The progress of evolution was cutat the beach, possibly, because the beach is peculiarly subject to violence during volcanicupheavals, sea and land being in clash. Now and then the auditor will find a volcanic upheavalincident in restimulation with its palls of choking sulphurous smoke. It has been suggested thatsmoking tobacco is a sort of dramatization of volcanoes which, at the least, were spectacular.The BirdsOccasionally the creatures of the beach, still shell animals, had their troubles with birdswhich had become so earlier. Birds of a very crude construction developed a taste for clams.Clams had no adequate defence against them. If a clam opened its shell, the bird would thrustin a beak or a claw. If the clam then closed, the bird would fly up into the air. The clam wouldlet go, drop on a rock and become bird food. If the clam didn’t close, it became bird foodanyway.Falling sensations, indecision and other troubles go with the BIRDS.Sometimes a preclear will come up with an incident where he was a bird or even a bat.The auditor should be very careful about what he would call dub-in. For this one belongs not inthe GE but most likely in the theta line with the preclear taking over the body or form of a birdor bat. The incident is quite valid. It does not, however, belong on the GE line.Theta line incidents occasionally restimulate and group with GE incidents. Auditingbrings them apart easily. Thus it is in the case of the BIRDS. For theta beings can fly.Being EatenIn that so many fish and animals were equipped with so many teeth, it is inevitable thatsomebody somewhere on the track would have been eaten. And so it is, for there are a greatmany “being eaten” engrams. These minor circumstances are, of course, motivators. Theauditor should realise that the GE itself did some eating and thus there are many of these eatingengrams which are motivators. Diet faddists, people who will not eat meat are hung in maybeson the subject of digesting and being digested. Many strange psychosomatic ills and skinmanifestation may be traced to these incidents.Anyone who knows TECHNIQUE 80 knows that dispersal of energy is a difficultcondition to run. The GE about to be eaten by a fish, suddenly recognizes the fact. And hisattention units disperse. In fact, he may disperse right off the couch. Few auditors, in theabsence of TECHNIQUE 80, have been able to run “being eaten” incidents. Knowing aboutthe dispersal of attention units and knowing that this is fear may permit an auditor at last to runand reduce these “being eaten” incidents.There is a strange compliance on the part of the GE, in some cases, to be eaten. Lateron this may take on the form of compliance in being beaten or abused. Masochism on the GEline may have its seat in such incidents. There is an “emotion” of being able to at least assist thesurvival of another body by letting it be fed.Auditing an “eating” incident consists of requiring the preclear to locate the dispersal ofhis attention units and the centre of that dispersal. The attention units may be located far behindthe GE in the “eating” incident and should be traced from there back to the preclear until theyare reduced.18"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The SlothThere are many steps and incidents between the BIRDS and the SLOTH. However theyare most of them mobile and few of them are found in high restimulation. With the SLOTH weagain find the GE in a state which is not very mobile, not easily defensible, in a world wherethe evolutionary line has produced more developed and more carnivorous beings.Man’s line is not very pugnacious. The GE is smarter in Man’s line than the GEs inother lines, but Man’s current intelligence comes from an entirely different quarter thanevolution. The SLOTH shows Man’s nature well, so far as GEs are concerned. “Leave mealone and I’ll leave you alone” is the philosophy here. But the sloth was slow and easilyattacked and he had bad times falling out of trees when hit by snakes, falling off cliffs whenattacked by baboons. And the sloth was trying to THINK. The most pitiful painful efforts atthinking are found in this series.THE SLOTH is a chain of incidents and misadventures, mostly showing up fear ofsnakes and of falling.The ApeWhen Man had advanced as far as the APE he was agile and intelligent. The APE isusually an area of overt acts against animals and incidents of protecting young.The Piltdown ManMan’s first real Manhood is found in the PILTDOWN, a creature not an ape, yet notentirely a Man. It is so named not because it is accurately the real Piltdown Man but because ithas some similarity.The PILTDOWN contains freakish acts of strange “logic,” of demonstrating dangerouson one’s fellows, of eating one’s wife and other somewhat illogical activities. The PILTDOWNteeth were ENORMOUS and he was quite careless as to whom and what he bit and often verymuch surprised at the resulting damage.Obsessions about biting, efforts to hide the mouth and early familial troubles can befound in the PILTDOWN. It is a wonderful area in which to locate GE overt acts.The CavemanKeeping women at home for men and keeping a man from keeping one at home forwomen can be found in the CAVEMAN. Here one crippled one’s woman to keep her there orpoisoned one’s man for having kept her there. Marital malaction often goes back to theCAVEMAN. Any condition of interpersonal relationships can be found in this area. Jealousyand overt acts around it, strangling, smashing in heads with rocks, quarrels about homes, tribalrebukes pack instincts can be found in THE CAVEMAN.Past DeathsIt must be kept in mind that past deaths happened to the GE and to the theta being. AnyGE has a regular line of past deaths, coming on forward chronologically.The auditor may have some difficulty locating GE deaths in the last few thousand yearsbecause deaths are also registered on the theta line. The GE under processing may have hadhundreds of theta beings in command of it down the centuries. There is a matter known as the“second facsimile” or “duplicate facsimile.” A theta being takes a picture of the memory of a19"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"GE and carries it as a record. A GE takes a picture of the memories of theta beings and carriesthose. Thus there can be many “second facsimiles” of past deaths for the same period of time.One should not be surprised at “discovering” five past deaths all occurring in the same span ofyears. Some will be second facsimiles, a maximum of two for that period will be actualincidents. One death happened to the theta being using another GE line, the other happened tothe GE. They will be in different places at different times.Second facsimiles are “photographs” of the memories of another. They are still picturesusually. Their characteristic is that they show up with only two or three pictures of some longsituation. As they are “pictures” of change and age and everything else, they will show up onan E-meter as charged incidents. But when one tries to audit them, they change into the basicincident, the actual one, the “pictures” vanishing. The existence of a real facsimile in the GE orthe theta beingwill restimulate and hold as locks, pictures taken from former theta beings and GEs.Any death registering, or any incident registering on an E-meter for a certain period in the GEline tells you that there is a real incident in that area. Hunting for the real one, you may findsome of these second facsimiles. These usually evaporate when touched and the actual incidentis quickly found.This matter is mentioned because auditors are sometimes puzzled by shifting dates onan E-meter or incidents simultaneously occurring where they should not. An auditor, merely bypursuing the matter, automatically sorts out the second facsimiles which may be there and findsthe actual facsimiles which must be audited.Contact between a theta being and a GE must be very intimate for a photograph to betaken of the other’s facsimiles. Or two beings must be in almost hypnotic rapport for the matterto occur. The facsimiles themselves do not shift from one to the other. One being simply sees,then makes a “picture” of the facsimile of another when that other has the facsimile inrestimulation. Any auditor has “seen” his preclear’s incidents.AssumptionsASSUMPTION is the name given to the act of a theta being taking over a MEST body.This is occassionally found to be part of the record of the GE strong enough to be audited. It isthe sensation of being taken over thoroughly, sometimes contains the shock of contact. TheASSUMPTION takes place in most cases just prior to birth for every GE generation.Evidently theta being ASSUMPTION is recent on Earth. It is rare to find a theta beingcoming to Earth 35,000 years ago, rarer to find one earlier. 70,000 years ago is the presentearliest arrival of a theta being on Earth. In a great many cases, the preclear (for the awarenessof awareness of the preclear IS the theta being) will be found to have arrived on Earth for thefirst time only a few hundred years ago. E-meter reaction occurs in the GE line on theseASSUMPTIONS and the auditor should be careful to differentiate whether he is reading for theGE or the preclear himself.The GE takes a poor outlook on ASSUMPTIONS but in reality it is not much differentto the GE to be taken over by a theta being than by a new epicentre developed in the pastgeneration.There is a smothering peculiar to ASSUMPTION from the viewpoint of the GE whichis followed by a fear of being caught, a desire to hide, a wonderingness at this nothingnesswhich hit him and wrapped him up.20"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"DeparturesThe GE stays with a dying body to the complete end and then soars upwards andobtains a downview of the dead. This is routine. In that the anaten of death deepens as the endnears and goes deeper than in any other incident, an auditor may leave the end of a deathunaudited by carelessness.The theta being leaves earlier than the GE and the GE sometimes records the departureof the theta being before the GE itself departs from the dying.There are conditional departures of both in bad accidents and operations.THE THETA BEING is the principal target of the auditor.THE PRECLEAR is the theta being.21"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The main thing wrong with any preclear is that he cannot disentangle himself fromentities and somatic entities, from demon circuits and MEST bodies. He wants to know WHOhe is and WHERE he is.A common complaint from a preclear is that somebody won’t let him be himself. Thejoke of this is that the preclear doesn’t know who HIMSELF is, much less why he can beallowed to be HIM.Take any preclear and, using concept running, motivator, overt and DED and you willfind him instantly in the midst of dozens of engrams if you ask him to run the concepts, “I ammyself,” “You are yourself,” “What is my name?” “Who am I?” and similar concepts whichattempt to single out his identity.The only reason why a person becomes aberrated about other people is that he cannotdistinguish between himself and others. You find preclears—and auditors too—who go aroundthinking themselves burdened with facsimiles of others, who become restimulated and then tryto run the engrams of others to cool the restimulation.IDENTIFICATION OF THE REAL “I” is the sure cure for IDENTIFICATION OFSELF WITH OTHERS AND OTHERS WITH OTHERS.WHO is the preclear ? He is the theta being.How does one really de-aberrate and clear a preclear ? By clearing the theta being.By running genetic entity incidents, by cleaning up present life, by running “pastdeaths,” the auditor can get rid of psychosomatics by the bale for the preclear. The auditor canpractically rebuild the body.He can clarify thought by taking away pains restimulated by thinking. He can do athousand marvels never before possible here on Earth—or anywhere else for that matter.But when he has done all these things, often at great labour, what does he have? He hasa composite being, good enough to be called Homo Novis—a theta-animated MEST bodypossessed of new and desirable attributes. That doesn’t mean he has the preclear cleared. Thatdoesn’t mean that he has located the preclear for the preclear and restored an ultimateself-determinism. It means the auditor has done well. The auditor has made what we are callinga MEST clear, a good, sane, rational MEST being about a skyscraper higher than HomoSapiens. But in that Homo Sapiens is a pretty horrible thing to be, this isn’t good enough, notnearly good enough.This Homo Novis is limited in his self-determinism by all the economic and socialrestrictions of an aberrated society. He is not free of food, clothing or shelter. He dies whenyou get him too cold, he perishes when the oxygen content drops too low. He is living in atolerance band which keeps him cramped to the face of one second-rate planet in a tenth-ratesystem, prey to all the ill will that blows. Is this being free or self-determined ? Maybe he isgood enough to overlord his fellows into a security for himself never before possible. But thatis his only real route towards security. He must fight and command for his three squares, hemust use police protection in order to keep himself free of bullet holes and bumper marks.Compared to a Homo Sapiens, Homo Novis is very high and godlike. Compared to a trulyself-determined being, Homo Novis is an ant ready to die under anybody’s mis-step.This universe is a rough universe. It is a terrible and deadly universe. Only the strongsurvive it, only the ruthless can own it. Given one weak spot a being cannot long endure it forthis universe will search it out and enlarge it and fester and probe it until that weak spot is afestering wound so large that the being is engulfed by his own sores.22"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Fighting this battle for survival, and fight it he must, a being in the MEST universecannot seem to afford decency or charity or ethics; he cannot afford any weakness, any mercy.The moment he does he is lost—for he is surrounded by chilled, coarse rock and molten energywhich, no matter the state of aberration of his social surroundings, will engulf him instantlythat he ceases to obey the very least laws of MEST.This is a universe of force. It is not a universe of reason. Brutal, unthinking, withoutdecency or mercy, MEST force awaits with punishment any being with any weakness.The possession of a MEST body is a liability for through that body the being can begiven pain, can be regimented by the routine demands of eating and care from harm until at thevery, very highest he can be but a puppet dancing to the spin of some unthinking planet underthe strong glare of a remote and careless sun. Under these conditions a being burdened withcare and liability of a body, made uncertain by an unknowingness, bows to strange andnon-existent gods, resorts to terrible make-shifts in lieu of justice,- cringes before the mightierbomb, the sharper blade.You have examined an engram. A standard engram is simply the collision of the bodywith the MEST universe with sufficient impact to produce the confusion of attention known as“unconsciousness.’Should you care to make a test, just run “care of the body” as a total therapy. You willdiscover that by running out the postulates of a preclear about his body and its care and hisinjunctions and insistences to others that they care for their bodies, you can produce soaringchanges in tone. An entire book can be written concerning this therapy. An entire book hasbeen written about it—the first in Dianetics. This therapy could be styled, “The efforts of atheta being to reconcile the frailty of a MEST body with the ethics of a theta being.” They donot reconcile, these two. Schopenhauer, Zeno and names without number in philosophy havebeen trying to make this reconciliation for aeons. One says, “Defeat it all and die, for only bydying can you defeat it.” Another says, “You can’t win, therefore the only victory is in refusingto try to win.”Christianity and a million other unities have struggled with this problem and the result isa pot-pourri of answers, none of which reconcile the problem. You have a soul—it goes offsomewhere, you don’t know about it. You are a soul, you don’t know about it.Today we live in a vast cult called “Worship the body”. Medical doctors, schoolteachers, parents, traffic officers, the whole society unites into this war-cry, “Care for thebody.” This stems from the ignorance that the body is all that one has, that he will have just onebody, that his total devotion is the care of that body.A body is a vegetable. It is not even a sentient vegetable for it lacks perception in thewhole theta range. Like any vegetable it grows from seed and has habit patterns which help itsurvive. And, like any vegetable, one way or another, it gets used by others.Early theta beings saw MEST bodies acting and being as though they wereself-motivated. This was a curiosity. The early theta being did not know that these MESTbodies depended wholly for their wits under the guidance of a decayed theta being. The bodieslooked like entities of considerable force and skill. The theta beingness of them was hidden andunapparent. Thus even theta beings have been fooled by MEST bodies.A MEST body, whether it belongs to the race of Man or the race of ants is yet but ananimated vegetable. Given a theta being to guide it, it becomes part of a composite such asHomo Sapiens: here we have a theta being, decayed into unknowingness, devoted to the careof a MEST body. The “I” of this body, the actual volition of it, all its wits and skills are thetathings derived from the guidance of a theta being. By itself the body would live, walk around,react, sleep, kill, and direct an existence no better than that of a field mouse or a zombie. Put atheta being over it and it becomes possessed of ethics and morals and direction and goals and23"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"the ability to reason; it becomes this strange thing called Homo Sapiens, a being above animalsand yet an animal.Give this MEST body a psychotic theta being and you get a sort of Frankenstein’smonster. Give this MEST body a nearly unconscious theta being and you get a zombie.The body is a carbon-oxygen engine which runs at 98.6° F. The theta being is theengineer running this engine in a Homo Sapiens. There is already an entity running this engine,the GE, but there is here only a total devotion to avoiding pain, seeking survival factors of themeanest sort, begetting new MEST bodies. Every cell in that body has its own theta, the GE istheta. A THETA BEING is something else entirely.In the first place, the theta being came into being without the need of a MEST body,without the need of motors. It is close to a perpetual motion picture machine in that it can createenergy and impulses. It thinks without facsimiles, it can act without experience, it can knowsimply by being. When we have talked of optimum performance in Dianetics or Scientology,we have talked about the actual top level capabilities of the theta being, not the capabilities ofthe MEST being. Early work in Dianetics treats of the composite called Homo Sapiens andtreats that composite for what it is, an identity of several parts which act in greater or lesscoordination. You can go right on treating this composite being as a unit, you can go right ontreating him and getting results for which you will be praised. But you must know that you arenot treating the actual identity when you treat the MEST body—you are furthering a compositeand actually you are subscribing to the International Cult called “Care of the Body.”You can, at your own choice, go on living with and processing this composite knownas Homo Sapiens and create Homo Novis. You can use Dianetics to make hitherto impossiblestrides. But be advised that in this choice you are living with paradoxes which no philosopherin all the ages ever reconciled—the injustice of death, the depravity of human beings as inPlato, the penalty of assisting another, the impossibility of having good ARC and survival too,the liability of being kind and merciful and every “unanswerable” religious paradox known.You, by persisting in yesterday’s reality are persisting then in problems which have never beenresolved with the factors accepted. You are demanding of a MEST-theta composite that he beself determined when every zephyr from a hard universe contains death for him and can turnhim like a top; you are demanding that he be “careful” when his only salvation is to be carefree,you are saddling him with all the unanswered riddles of an aberrated life in an aberrated world.And you are condemning a preclear to the dwindling spiral— for the theta being as part of thecomposite decays fast and soon dies forever in the rigid apathy of MEST.Thus this data is given you. In lieu of this data the only thing which could be given Manis the answering salute to the gladiators—they who are about to die.As an auditor, the choice is yours to make—the paradoxes or the answer. I would notgive you this data unless it can be demonstrated on any preclear with ease. And I would notgive it to you unless you needed it.Here it is.24"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVETHE CAPABILITIES OF THE THETA BEING cannot at this time be set down in afull sweep of data. In the first place, it would be unfair to tomorrow to detail in writing theexact constitution of a theta being, for by just that much could he be predicted and broughtagain into a low state. The auditor does not have to know too much of these full capabilities.The preclear will discover them for himself in processing.But there are a few data necessary to auditing and these are set forth:A theta being is capable of emitting a considerable electronic flow. This is not done byusing facsimiles but is actually a creation of motion which we now know as “electricity”. Atheta being produces considerable voltage and amperage, enough to give somebody a very badshock, to put out his eyes or cut him in half.The theta being, on his own, can instill anything on the emotional range into anotherbeing for each emotion is a wave length and wave characteristic.A theta being does not use facsimiles to think or act. He does “mockups” of thesituation and by examining the “mock-up” knows how something works or what should bedone with a situation. His memory is by pervasion—which is to say by pervading again thearea of the data or by approximation. He is not stimulus response.Facsimiles are accumulated by a theta being at will, discarded at will much as a mancollects stamps.Theta beings can rip chains of facsimiles away from other theta beings. This is not doneas a therapy but as an outright prankish theft.The identity of a theta being is not based on his memory of events but on an actualknowledge of identity.A theta being can be rendered unconscious by wave action; he can be hypnotized; hecan be made to sleep; he can be made to possess facsimiles and use them. He can be aberratedin such fashion so as to forget his identity. He is subject to all the laws and rules of thoughtemotion and effort as described in Dianetics and Scientology—with the difference that, fairlyclear, he has enormous choice in their use.A theta being can be de-aberrated by ridding him of his chains of facsimiles andrestoring to him his knowledge of identity.A theta being can enjoy existence and emotional impact, he can plan and act. Hisactivities lie about 8.0 on the tone-scale. He is very high aesthetically and devotes most of histime to aesthetics.Theta beings associate socially with theta beings and have a high sense of justice.A theta being can be made visible by certain electronic flows; he can be pinned down bycertain flows. The wave lengths of these flows are not known to Homo Sapiens at this time andmethods of emission of them have not been invented on Earth.MEST beings of the class of Homo Sapiens are composite beings motivated by a thetabeing, entities, the GE and the environment. MEST beings, fallen away from being thetabeings, incapable of regaining a theta state in the absence of Dianetics, dislike theta beings(whom we will call THETANS from here on, meaning a theta being who has not been forcedto have a MEST body). MEST beings, trying to inhabit an area of THETANS are commonlybalked and fought by the thetans and the MEST beings then begin to trap and harass the thetans25"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"and will use them to motivate new bodies when the thetans have been reduced to little ornothing in power. The THEY which you will discover in incidents are MEST beings. Thecurrent Homo Sapiens is a THEY. Theta beings (amnesia and a MEST body) attack thetanswho menace him. Thetans can kill MEST bodies by throwing a charge at them. Thus a wardevelops between thetans and MEST beings. Given electronics and hitherto unconqueredthetans, MEST beings can and have won.Thetans communicate by telepathy. They can move material objects by throwing anenergy flow at them. They can travel at very high speeds. They are not bound by atmospheresor temperatures.Thetans quarrel with each other by showing each other facsimiles or throwing energyflows at each other, but they are not very quarrelsome.Thetans do not die. They grow in that there are young and old thetans. Decaying, theyobtain MEST bodies and eventually pass out in the form of a solid, apathetic slumber.A thetan can feel pain. He can be crippled and dismembered, but this requires forcewhich would blow half a town off the map.Thetans live on some planets. They consider these to be “outside the MEST universe”by which they mean outside areas inhabited by the composite beings, the “races” which useelectronics and need bodies.A thetan, brought low enough to have a MEST body, may consider that he has beentrapped by “time warps” or that his universe is another dimension or some such thing. This isnot the case. Thetans live in the same time stream with the difference that they can alterconcepts of time and get future or past at will—it is THE THETAN who is altering his concept,not the time that is changing. So don’t go off on wild chases after fourth and fifth dimensions,time warps and other time-space universes: teleportation makes it look like these exist for thethetan. There is more to this but you don’t really need it in processing.There are two states of “theta clear.” One of these is a CLEARED THETAN, fromwhom all incidents would be removed; the other is the THETAN cleared of a necessity to havea MEST body. When we say “theta clear” we mean the latter.A THETAN is somewhat bound-in here on Earth because of the existence of othersystem forces. Probably, with a few THETANS active, this planet will be much less calm andorderly. Probably Homo Sapiens will use electronics some day to re-trap thetans who arebothering him but if Homo Sapiens has the techniques for getting free himself, some miraclemight avert this. Possibly a handful of thetans will someday become alarmed at the worries andefforts of Homo Sapiens and try to throw the remaining race into a super-controlled slavery.All that is speculation but it is not a speculation that life will become much more interesting onthis planet. It is doubtful if the thetans will pull off the ultimate trick—simply knocking out theatmosphere of the planet— that “clears” everybody after a fashion. There is nothing as wild inthe books of Man as will probably happen here on Earth. And it will happen and be allowed tohappen simply because all this is so incredible that nobody will even think of stopping it until itis far, far too late. Its incredibility is its best safeguard, so you needn’t bother to convinceanybody who doesn’t want to believe it. It took the medical profession two and a half years tocatch on to prenatals. People getting cleared of bodies don’t need any such time lag. And so,may I make this simple request—don’t get spectacular until a few of the boys make it. Youdon’t want to be lonesome—and you’ll need reinforcements if a war gets declared on thetanshere. The preclear may think he can do it alone if he gets cleared of a body—he’ll need morehelp and company than he thinks. So, again, as a final note on this chapter, let’s not goupsetting governments and putting on a show to “prove” anything to Homo Sapiens for awhile- it’s a horrible temptation to knock off hats at fifty yards and read books a couple ofcountries away and get into the rotogravure section and the Hearst Weeklies—but you’ll justmake it tough on somebody else who is trying to get across this bridge.

All you really want toknow of it, however, is how much of it applies to your preclear. You will be pleased todiscover that this is relatively little, a snap of the fingers in time compared to what could be.The whole track seems to begin about seventy trillion years ago.Thetans like facsimiles just like a Homo Sapiens likes TV. A thetan can take a facsimileand inspect it. He likes to collect them like a bibliophile collects books. Any thetan haspurloined packages of facsimilies from other thetans just like schoolboys take pictures ofchampions away from each other. Thus your thetan has two things; he has his own record ofreal experience, of things which actually happened to him; and he has whole banks of “secondfacsimiles” or photographs he has taken from other thetan banks.Second facsimiles are complete pictures. They will show up with charge on an E-meterbecause they also contain the “charge notation”. But the moment you locate the fact that thewhole bank of second facsimiles was taken from another being, the preclear stops using themas experience and they no longer show up on the E-meter. The characteristic of the secondfacsimile on the E-meter then is to show up for a short time, and then, identified as from a“borrowed bank” not register any more.The best way to knock out second facsimile banks is to run out of the preclear incidentsof “borrowing” facsimiles. He’ll have many of these.A preclear, needing a motivator for some overt act he has done, will start to use asecond facsimile as the motivator. It will even give him somatics. A preclear may have as manyas eight banks he is using. Identify seven of them as “borrowed” banks and you have himoperating then on his own bank. This is the stop necessary to get him running on his ownactual track.Sometimes you may find that he has used a second facsimile so much that it has to berun. Run, it shows up as two or three still pictures, not as a moving picture.The only truly important facsimiles are those which actually happened to the thetanhimself, not what he borrowed.You can plot out as you wish the whole track. Incidents given here in this volume orvariations of them will be found on this track.A common history of the theta line as applied to your preclear starts with his“Separation from the Main Body of Theta”, continues through “Home Universe”, runs into hisentrapment by MEST beings and then through life as we know it with its cycle of birth, MESTbody living, death, between lives wipe-out and birth again.The thetan lives his life in segments: the largest segment is composed of “spirals”; as hegoes through the MEST universe he is involved in a series of spirals each one less in terms ofyears, ordinarily, than the last. The first spiral which occurred 70 or 74 trillion years ago,might have been as long as a trillion years but the next spiral after that was a little shorter.Succeeding spirals each one shortened. The present spiral for most people is about 40,000years long, although, many are on a longer spiral than this, and not a few are on a very shortspiral. The length of this spiral might serve to indicate how much longer the thetan cancontinue. By a spiral would be meant a more or less continuous cycle of action. A life in aMEST body is a variety of cycles- it is not a spiral, for the preclear’s knowingness oftenextends to earlier bodies. The first big cycle would be at its probable longest 76 trillion years.This would be sub-divided into spirals, any one of which might comprise more than onelifetime. Spirals could be subdivided into “lives”, such as the current life which is only one28"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"division of the current spiral. A whole spiral can get into restimulation in some earlier periodjust as a past life can get into restimulation in this life. The incidents contained in that wholespiral, then, would be quite important. Sometimes a spiral has ended suddenly and earlier thanscheduled for a preclear. This has remained to him as a very bad shock. It would be like a pastdeath but of a very great magnitude. The beginning of this spiral finds the being thinking he isnew with universes to conquer and the end of the spiral finds him practically expiring, even asa thetan.The overt acts of the thetan are “nipping” by which he harasses other thetans, “nipping”MEST beings—which usually kills them dead much to the thetan’s surprise, blanketing ofMEST bodies for sexual thrill and other purposes, trapping other thetans after one has becomea MEST being and the usual variety of overt acts common on Earth.None of this is very complicated as a history. It is made to LOOK complicated by theexistence of “borrowed” banks, entities and “cover-up” actions by the preclear. The main taskof the auditor is to get the preclear to identify himself as himself and to identify the actual trackof himself. The rest is easy.29"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTHE TYPES OF INCIDENTS found on the theta line are somewhat different than theauditor has been accustomed to running in present life processing. The elements contained inthose incidents are the same—thought, emotion, effort, counter thought, counter-emotion,counter-effort, attention Units and counter-units. The emphasis, however, is upon attentionunits and counter-units. The reason for this is rather obvious.How would you go about nearly killing an almost immortal being? It would requireabout the heaviest force possible. The tone scale above two contains perception, below twothere is little or no perception beyond attention units. Here is the occluded case. The individualhimself may be running on a higher harmonic of his occluded tone—but the incidents whichmust be run to restore his perception in incidents are all too heavy to contain much in the wayof perception. Hence, the tracking of attention units and the skills necessary to that are therequisites in running theta track incidents. Further, so heavy are these facsimiles that evenwhen using “mock-ups”, one must be very conversant with TECHNIQUE 80, for the incidentshang up when the motivator is run too long or when the overt or DED are run too long. (Oldtime incidents were said to go into recession. This is because they had an overt motivatoropposite from them which had to be run.)The auditor never really understands apathy, fear or anger until he has run the heavyfacsimiles of the theta line. It is not that they affect the preclear more strongly—they do not. Itis that they are so heavy they can be like so much glue or hardwood. Reversing to the oppositeincident, to the overt from the motivator, from the motivator to the overt alone makes it possibleto run theta line.One might have known for a very long time how far back this theta line went and howserious were the incidents upon it. But it would have done him no good to know about theseincidents for, without attention unit running, which I developed only a short time ago, theincidents would not be runnable at all.There were two ways of running a case: one was to unburden it until the naturalresurgence of the individual keyed out the lower, heavier incidents, the other was to run theincidents no matter how heavy they were. The theta line, then, could not be audited at all untilattention unit running and overt acts had been developed and refined for auditor application.The first method of unburdening is the one which auditors have been doing wholly whetherthey realized it or not. The other one of cleaning up the incidents themselves, the very bottombasics of the chains has not been in use because it couldn’t be. Thus Dianetics was kept to onelife until such time as the entire mechanical aspect of the lower track could be examined andtechniques developed for resolving it. Of course, these techniques, if they resolve heavyincidents, resolve lighter ones as well, and so a revolution in processing can be announcedwhich, if you MUST process only the current life, will resolve it in most cases in five or tenhours of processing. If it doesn’t resolve, then the auditor simply doesn’t know 8-8008 andthat’s all there is to it.Despite the fact that they are heavy, that they are strange, theta line incidents are easy toaudit IF the auditor knows 8-8008. If the incidents are very hard to run, then the auditorDOESN’T know 8-8008.There is just one warning about theta line-incidents: you are auditing the theta “body”,not the MEST body. It is theoretically possible to run an incident out of the theta being which istoo much for the MEST body. A MEST body which has a weak heart had better be audited inthis lifetime only until his heart condition entirely vanishes. Some of the theta line incidentskick back so hard against the MEST body that the preclear is sure he will not live through them.If the auditor doesn’t balance the overt against the motivator in 80, if he runs one side toostrongly and heavily and really drives in the somatic, he may be embarrassed by making a thetaclear before his time—the body still lying about but not breathing.30"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The incidents themselves contain some things the auditor should know about. Onedoesn’t have to be a nuclear physicist to understand these incidents, but the incidents areactually in the realm of nuclear physics.The auditor must only know the following:1. Strong electrical currents produce in the vicinity of their flow what are calledMAGNETIC FIELDS. If you wrap an electrical wire around a bar of iron and runcurrent through the wire, you have a magnet. When you put a new piece of iron nearthis magnet, the FIELD of the magnet snaps the piece of iron up against the magnet.2. In the vicinity of any strong current a wide FORCE FIELD exists. If this is intensified(by using great quantities of current) the FORCE FIELD may extend for hundreds offeet or even miles. A radio station is a sort of FORCE FIELD in that it reaches hundredsor thousands of miles out from it. It takes a radio set to pick up or contact this fieldstrongly enough to get a good reaction out of it but actually, this instant, thousands ofstations throughout the world are sending force fields through your body. They are toominute to be measured or detected without receiving sets but they are force fields justthe same, wave impulses generated from a central point and extending far out from thatpoint. If a station could generate a billion times the normal current a station uses, youwould be able to contact that field physically, it would be so strong.3. It is possible for a wave to act as a RETRACTOR. That is to say, it is possible forcertain waves to pull back instead of push out. You turn a hose on somebody. Thispushes him back. There can exist a wave which, if it were a hose, would pull you up tothe nozzle instead of pushing you away. Thetans can put out such a retractor wave.4. It is possible to rig up two or three—or one—standing poles which are then activatedwith a current which will apply a very strong field to anyone in their vicinity. It is thenpossible to vary these fields to get various patterns of fields or to shift from one field toanother to get various angles of attack on an object. A thetan sitting amongst such afield pattern can be very thoroughly battered and rendered unconscious. It is alsopossible to rig up a post which would have a retractor wave coming out of it and whichwould pull a thetan into the post and pin him there.5. A field is not always visible. “Black band” waves are the destructive waves. These arenot visible and they light up nothing.It may occur to the auditor that some of these incidents, as he hears them being run, arevery reminiscent of the material which is commonly found among the insane in sanatoria.These people are quite given to chattering about fields and secret waves and telepathy andthings being after them with electronic devices. The past ignorance consisted of treatinganything an insane person had to say as non-factual data. Today may even say that one isinsane to give thought to any circumstances as occur on the theta line. An experienced auditorknows that to make the insane sane it is necessary to run the incidents the insane person isdramatizing. In a brilliant flash of insight someday those in charge of sanatoria may see that thereason the insane chatter about electronics is that electronics are peculiarly adapted totailor-making insanity and that electronics have been used for unthinkably long times to handleand control beings. Electronics alone can make a truly slave society. Those in charge ofsanatoria, in view of the fact that their own figures show that electrical shocks do NO good andhave NO beneficial effects upon patients, may someday wonder why they themselves are soviolently psychotic on the subject of insisting that the insane be given electronics. Ah, you haveit! Those in charge are doing a crude and ineffective dramatization of theta line incidents.Electronics make slaves. If some of these electricity obsessed but electrically ignorant chapswho so gently shepherd our insane really WANT results, I can show them not just how tomake a patient tractable, I can show them how to give him total amnesia so that he can then betaught like a child and may become useful in a few months. You can REALLY wipe people outwith electronics. Electric shock is so stupid and so childish that one wonders, one wonders.31"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"So heavy is the concentration on electronics in the theta line, so closely connected withenergy behaviour is the anatomy of a theta being that only one trained in nuclear physics couldhave cracked this riddle. And with the data on this theta line, human treatment and the treatmentof any life passes entirely into the hands of the electronics experts and out of the hands of themeddlers with minds whose training in electronics ends with knowing how to turn on anelectric light and who yet have at this writing the only legislative passports into the craniums ofthe ill. The era has just begun. Using theta line data, data accumulated from preclears aboutelectronics, wave lengths, practices and social customs, a handful of electronics experts couldbring entire nations into their command with very little work—and those trained in yesterdaywould be completely powerless to stop or even detect that pervasion of command. This isregrettable, perhaps. Maybe all societies go this way. The atom bomb is a toy compared to adevice which would turn into soul-less slaves an entire city, an entire nation, an entire world.But instead of hiding this information, one should bring it to light, for if it goes undergroundonly then can it completely have its sway. One does not look for such an enslavement to occur,for you are reading the pages and the technologies which can and will defeat it.Thus, in running your preclear, keep in mind that he has been, in the PAST, part ofsocieties which had electronics down to a very fine point, which could control the verybreathing of their subjects. Recall that he may have been part of a town, for instance, in whichany revolutionary, lazy or non-survival thought, if thought would bring him, without will, tothe steps of the local thought police station. Remember in processing your preclear that forthousands of years he has played the game of enslaving and being enslaved, and the depths ofcontrol were such, the acts in that control were such as to out-soar any mere imaginings frommodern literature. Modern science-fiction, even that, is a weak piker compared to the data ofthe past from which these writers of the future took their plots. A public couldn’t stomach whatreally went on before Earth. Your preclear isn’t able to stomach it—that’s why he’s forgottenit.What does it take to aberrate a thetan ? Thousands and thousands of volts, thousands ofamperes, poured into destructive wave lengths and thrown straight in his face. What does ittake to get him into a position where he can be aberrated ? Trickery, treachery, lies.Running electronics incidents is not difficult, not if you know 80. But there is a datumwhich must be repeated here even though it belongs in HOW TO AUDIT.The definition in Dianetics of INVALIDATION:INVALIDATION IS ANY THOUGHT, EMOTION OR EFFORT, ORCOUNTER-THOUGHT, COUNTER-EMOTION OR COUNTER-EFFORT WHICHDENIES OR SMOTHERS THE THOUGHT, EMOTION OR EFFORT OF THEINDIVIDUAL.By this definition, a man is invalidated by being struck by anything. If he is run into bya car, he is “invalidated”. Any accident invalidates him. Any force which he cannot conquer oroppose invalidates him.Turn to the chart in your HANDBOOK FOR PRECLEARS. Here you see on theCHART OF ATTITUDES, “I KNOW,” “I AM,” “FAITH,” etc. The more the force of anindividual is cancelled out by counter-forces, the lower he drifts on this chart. Hit by strongforces, he conceives that he “isn’t.”FAITH at the top of the chart turns to DISBELIEF at the bottom.Turn a preclear loose into a heavy theta line incident and what reaction do you get? Youget BOTTOM CHART REACTIONS. That is to say, the force is such in the incident that he isutterly unable to combat it, thus he conceives himself utterly invalidated. In such a wise hecomes to express in the incident BOTTOM SCALE attitudes. He can’t believe it, he isn’t there,etc., etc. Run any theta line incident with its heavy impacts and your preclear will immediately32"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"start to discredit it. Keep him at it, waive aside all his lacks of belief and other comments andsoon the tone band will rise a notch or two. Keep the tone rising, using overts and motivators,and you eventually get perception and concepts.Why do you think these theta line incidents got lost? Why can’t a man who hasundergone a between-lives battering recall that he lived before? Invalidation by force is theanswer. The chart of attitudes will give you your guide.There is another thing you should know about these incidents and the emotional state ofthe preclear: he has become in his own eyes so degraded by force invalidation that he hasdevoted himself to this vegetable thing, the MEST body, as the last ditch effort to control somepart of the environment. HE is invalidated to nothing. So the BODY has to be something.And there is something else, a scale you should have of invalidation:CRITICISM AND COUNTER-CRITICISM are the overt and motivator invalidationson the thought level. MISEMOTIONALISM AND COUNTER MISEMOTIONALISM are theovert and motivator invalidations on the emotion level.PHYSICAL FORCE AND COUNTER-PHYSICAL FORCE are the overt andmotivator invalidations on the effort level.In current or recent lives thought, emotion and effort hang up on the early theta lineincidents. If you can’t get a theta line incident of the electronics type to unburden, run criticismand counter criticism in the current life.In general you will find the preclear has been subjected, as a theta being to enormousinvalidation of all his force, power and natural attributes. The rise in tone potential in runningthe theta line is such that you can expect the preclear to go from low to high on the E-meter afteronly one or two heavy electronics incidents have been run—but make sure they are theta lineand that they happened to the thetan who is the preclear before you.The intent of other beings was to make this preclear into a willing or unwilling but atleast obedient slave or to get him out of the area and keep him running away thereafter or to nailhim into complete useless immobility. They wanted him to have goodreaction to police threats (and most psychotics go psychotic immediately after a policeinterview, no matter how innocent it was). They wanted him to leave MEST bodies alone andrespect them.On his part your preclear was part and parcel of many societies, took his role in effortsto conquer thetans after he had been conquered. He wanted MEST bodies to be respected nowthat he had one. He wanted his slaves to be obedient. He wanted beings he didn’t like to startrunning and keep on running or, barring that, to be immobile MEST thereafter. Your preclearhas been guilty himself of any crime or action he protests occurred to him—for by his worry heconfesses that whether or not it happened to him, he did it to others.Your preclear was basically good, happy, ethical and aesthetic before the contagion ofthe MEST universe got him. Then, still a thetan, he wasn’t very good but he was still trustingand ethical. Finally, when he had a body—well, look around.33"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTThe SPECIFIC INCIDENTS YOU MUST RUN ON THE THETA LINE are directedsolely, at this stage, toward attaining a voluntary and controlled separation between the MESTbody and the theta body. This is much easier to do than you would at first believe, and theincidents necessary to accomplish it are relatively easy to comprehend and locate.Remember that to create a “theta clear,” it is only necessary to bring the being up to apoint where it can leave and return upon a MEST body. A cleared theta clear would be a fullycleared thetan, something so much higher on the tone scale than a MEST clear or theta clear thatit is difficult to comprehend. A theta clear however, is not difficult to attain. Neither does itguarantee the release of all possible aberrations. A theta clear, some tones higher than anythingknown before, is yet subject to some aberration and will be until he attains the state of a clearedtheta clear. (Thus don’t invalidate somebody as a theta clear just because he doesn’t act like asaint—he might even be more devilish than ever!)Separation from the body! How the mystics have striven for this one! India and “joinNirvana” has given us “techniques” WHICH ARE GUARANTEED TO GLUE A THETANTO A BODY AS THOUGH RIVETED AND TIED WITH IRON BANDS. So beware ofmysticism and its techniques and yogism. Your hardworking author has been over the jumpsand through the hoops of more mysticism than is even suspected and on the ground wheremysticism first hit Earth— India, and I can guarantee you that these practices and hopes are asort of theta trap to keep men in their bodies, in apathy, ill and tied to superstition.Theta clearing is about as practical and simple as repairing a shoe-lace. It is nothing todo with hypnotism, voodooism. charlatanism, monkeyism or theosophy. Done, the thetan cando anything a stage magician can do in the way of moving objects around. But this isn’tattained by holding one’s breath or thinking “right” thoughts or voting Republican or any othersuperstitious or mystic practice. So, which is the reason I’ve brought it up, rule out, auditor,any mumbo jumbo of mysticism or spiritualism or religion. Rule out anything but good, solid,contactable incidents which are run wholly and entirely with the mechanical techniques ofDianetics with particular attention to 80.The key chart of theta clearing is THE CHART OF ATTITUDES which you will find inthe HANDBOOK FOR PRECLEARS. All the straight wire is done from that chart.Here are some incidents, more or less in the order that the auditor will find them andrun them.THE JACK-IN-THE-BOX: Here we have an invader trick, a method of trappingthetans. It is a facsimile scrambler. It is very early, not the earliest, only the earliest invadertrick. The thetan area is invaded by MEST beings. The thetans bother the MEST beings,nipping them, etc. The MEST beings use theta traps. One of these is to give to thetans prettylittle boxes. These boxes contain a stack of pictures. As thetans are disposed to gatherfacsimiles, these pictures are very acceptable. The thetan looks over the pictures. He finds theyare quite similar one to another. They show, each one, a picture of a box of pictures. When hereplaces the lid, the box explodes violently. He instinctively tries to dampen the explosion. Hegets his aura of beingness full of pictures which are extremely confusing, being pictures ofboxes of pictures. The running of this incident is simple. One keeps the preclear’s attention onthe point of explosion, out from him. Of course this point slams back at him every time he putshis attention on it. You will find a preclear with this in restimulation to be very curious aboutcereal boxes which have pictures of boxes of cereal which have pictures of boxes of cereal.There may be several such incidents including being near such explosions.THE OBSESSION: This incident is the incident which gives one the feeling he HAS tohave facsimiles in order to know. Actually one doesn’t need facsimiles. One thinks in concepts,approximations, pervasion A fine control trick is to make one think he has to have facsimiles.34"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"This aberrates him and makes him easy to handle. Educational systems are locks on this. Theincident is an electronic incident, very strong, and sometimes includes a great many sourcepoints of energy directed against one’s back. Just before it, one KNOWS. The force of thewaves themselves, depressing one of the CHART OF ATTITUDES stops one from knowing.This incident gives one an obsession to have facsimiles, to steal facsimiles, to do anything toget facsimiles. One is actually trying to find what one lost in the incident and that was lost byforce alone.WARNING: Don’t ever try to run words or other perceptions out of any electronicincidents. Words are seldom included in them. Communication in such an era was usually bythough transfer, not by words. This is very important.BORROWING: Thetans hold facsimiles very loosely. A high scale thetan can pick upand discard facsimiles at will. Further, a thetan often steals the facsimile chains of anotherthetan (as a result of the OBSESSION). Thus we will find, as the primary source of occlusion,the BORROWERS. A thetan puts a retractor beam on another thetan and starts to drag out hisfacsimiles. The victim feels like he is going to pieces. He, the victim, puts up a black screen tohalt the outflow of his facsimiles. The borrower counters by throwing a cone of force aboveand below his victim pinning him between these two cones as thought to squeeze him out. Theblack protecting screen usually can be held in place but the facsimiles, like smoke, trickle outaround the black screen and to the borrower. The most remarkable thing about this incident isthe SLOWNESS with which facsimiles seem to run out. Each facsimile has its own time tab.No matter how rapidly they are leaving these time tabs give the ILLUSION of a very long time.Running up and down one’s time track often gives this illusion. Thus, although the outflowfrom the victim may be done in seconds, it may seem to take years. The preclear often protestsagainst running this incident because “It takes too long.” Actually, it takes very little time.Naturally, on the borrower, the overt act must be got as well as the motivator as in allincidents run. If you don’t get the reverse to what you are running, incidents hang up. In theborrower, the overt is the same as the motivator, as the incidents are very similar but with thereverse action. Run the preclear as the borrower and the victim both, one after the other, backand forth, in order to get up the whole of each.This incident is the source of fear of losing one’s facsimiles, the source of occlusionand the collapse of time tracks.NIPPING: Nipping is a practice much beloved by thetans. They send out two energystreams, like hands, and slap both sides of a victim’s head. This mildly shocks a thetan towhich it is done. It can kill a MEST body. This slap is notable for causing ringing in the ears.This predates any invader. It is very early. It also postdates invaders. In running NIPS one isrunning something very important, for it is a basic on holding on to a MEST body. As in allincidents, when you run the motivator, run the overt afterwards, or vice versa.BLANKETING: This incident consists of throwing oneself as a thetan over anotherthetan or over a MEST body. Blanketing is done to obtain an emotional impact or even to kill.It is strongest in sexual incidents where the thetan throws two MEST bodies together in thesexual act in order to experience their emotions.This sexual lust comes from THE HALVER. It is very, very strong and is veryrestimulative in the running. Here is where the second dynamic becomes abated. There isconsiderable frenzy in these incidents. This is also basic on fastening on to a MEST body orholding a MEST body or protecting MEST bodies. It is an overt act. It has DED’S later than itin almost any sexual activity on the part of the preclear. At times a thetan will blanket a MESTbody, and hold it so that it can be attacked by another MEST body motivated by another thetan.Later the thetan, having committed this overt act, will start protecting MEST bodies fromattacks by thetans. This gives a person great antipathy toward seeing men and women together,lays in a basic on jealousy, etc.35"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"There is a steep emotional curve in blanketing. First there is the high excitement, thenorgasm, then, for the bodies, contentment or apathy as the case may be. This drop affects thethetan strongly and he gets fastened to the bodies and it takes some while to separate himself attimes. These incidents make the future fixation on MEST bodies possible. Thus Freud hadsomething when he blames sex, but sex is far from the whole story.The basic error a thetan made was in considering a MEST body something very special,unmotivated by thetans. He did not realise that any MEST (human) body is run by a decayedthetan. In thirsting to run MEST bodies and in contacting them he thought he was contacting acellular body whereas he was actually contacting a thetan and a body. He desired to go intoARC, without knowing it, with a decadent thetan who had a MEST body. That every MEST(humanlike) body had a decayed thetan on it was unknown to thetans until now. This accountsfor the enormous “kick-back” received by a thetan when he nips a MEST body or blankets one.The body never did have that power. The decayed thetan did. Respect of MEST bodies, then,was entirely misplaced. This is the primary error thetans made.THE HALVER: Don’t think thetans were only abused. When MEST bodies tried toinvade and take over an area they usually wound up enslaved to the thetans in that area. And thethetans used them horribly. The invader sometimes came in with electronics his only defenceagainst a thetan. The thetan quite ordinarily took the electronics over and used them on theMEST bodies. One of the processes thetans used on MEST bodies was a half-light, half-blackgun which shot out a wave. Half of this wave, usually the black, hit the right side of thevictim’s body, the other half, in the same explosion, usually the light side, hit the left side ofthe victim. This had the effects of causing him to be two people. It is also the basic onhalf-paralysis such as strokes. There was not always regularity in this incident. Sometimes itwas the practice to shoot the victim one way and them turn him around and shoot him the other,sometimes the sides and head as well.The halver was rigged up with religious symbols and it truly lays in religion. There is adevil on one side, a symbol carried in the light, angels on the other side. Sometimes it was veryfancy and was complicated with dolls in the shape of nudes, angels, devils, strung on wires toslide and dance.It did terrible things to the victim: it gave him a conflict, one side with the other, onebeing good; the other being bad. It gave him sexual compulsion all mixed up with religiouscompulsion so that an overdose of indulgence would send him to church, sometimes into a lifeof crime. It was a control factor used to keep the community fighting itself.The halver lies as a basic under sexual malpractice, under religious fervour. It shows upin almost every preclear as being in chronic restimulation. It is the one the auditor runs as anovert act when the preclear has a sexual or religious motivator.Remember that the restimulation of a motivator when one does an overt act is notnatural but a consequence of having a body and implants about bodies. You will find some ofthis “you do wrong, you’ll get it right back” in the halver and similar incidents.FACSIMILE ONE: This incident is in everyone’s bank, either as a second facsimile oras an original. Only in the latter case should it be run. It is called “Facsimile One” because it isthe first proven-up whole track incident which, when audited out of a long series of people,was found to eradicate such things as asthma, sinus trouble, chronic chills and a host of otherills. It has a verbal content in most cases. It is quite varied when found as an original—for inthis case, it happened to the preclear in the last ten or twenty thousand years. It was originallylaid down in this Galaxy about one million years ago.The “Coffee-grinder” (which might be an alternative name for it) is levelled at thepreclear and a push-pull wave is played over him, first on his left side, then on his right andback and forth from side to side, laying in a bone-deep somatic which cannot be run unless you36"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"recognize it as a vibration, not the solid board it seems to be. When this treatment is done, thepreclear is dumped in scalding water, then immediately in ice water. Then the preclearis put in a chair and whirled around. He was quite swollen after the pummelling of thewaves and was generally kept in a badly run (but quite modern) hospital for a few days.Sometimes he was given several and after the first one would report back 011 schedule for thenext.FAC ONE was an outright control mechanism, invented to cut down rebel raids oninvader installations. It was probable designed by the Fourth Invader and used by him in itsoriginal state and “ritual” for a considerable time. It gave him a nice, non-combative, religiouslyinsane community. THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF FAC ONE APPERTAINS TO ITS“SUMMONS TO COURT.” This was a sick quiver installed in the stomach area by the“coffee-grinder” during the first part of the incident. The coffee-grinder laid in “baps” on thepineal and other points but almost knocked out the pineal potential forever and relegated itsactions to the pituitary. It knocked in every other glandular point. And these same “baps” wereused against the vagus nerve to give what everyone knows as all “anxiety stomach,”uncontrolled bowel action, etc., etc. The header wanted people to report when sent for. Thusthe context (WHICH MUST NEVER BE DONE UNTIL THE EMOTION AND EFFORTARE REDUCED) when the vagus area was “bapped” concentrates on getting the preclear toreport quickly when summoned and makes him terrified of arrest, of courts, of other legalhocus-pocus. Thus criminal action against individuals, or sometimes any legal action,interrupts the glandular system, gives an anxiety reaction which has no equal anywhere else onthe track. Experienced police know this sudden hitherto inexplicable collapse of the criminaland his feeling that he would rather be dead than simply arrested: one cannot exaggerate theeffect of FAC ONE in the legal department. A check on psychotics recently showed five, takenat random, to have been “triggered” by a threat of arrest a short time before the psychotic breakoccurred. This is FAC ONE at work.The “coffee-grinder” is a two-handled portable machine which, when turned, emits aheavy push-pull electronic wave in a series of stuttering “baps”. It is violently restimulated bywhat construction companies call “widow-makers”—pneumatic drills of the kind used to tearup pavements, the sound is not dissimilar. FAC ONE, not silicosis, is responsible for themortality of workers assigned to these drills on construction projects.In the original version, the invaders operated these machines while wearing hoods andgoggles, not unlike “hot papa” suits used today on aircraft carriers. The victim was placedbehind a black gauze curtain but, in running FAC ONE, the preclear usually catches glimpsesof the “coffee-grinder” and the users. Some people who wear horn-rimmed glasses are foundto be solidly in the operator valence in FAC ONE. Such people are lean and hectic. Somepersons whose faces are “swollen” and who have a “dumpy” build, who are given to asthma,are found solidly in the victim valence.The invader gratuitously left these machines around for the yokels. Believing that thetreatment was vital to get to heaven or some such thing, the yokels practiced on each other,found new victims and generally spread the implant around. Trouble with the machines theinvader left around was that they “backfired” while they were working, sending out a ray intothe chest of the operator to restimulate him, the yokel operator not suspecting that the machinewas hitting anything else but his victim. And the yokel operator had neither goggles nor a “hotpapa” suit. One of these unskilled operators lasted sometimes as long as forty victims before hecollapsed from restimulation himself. The “back-fire” characteristic of the machine left aroundalso inhibited the local people from using electronic hand guns and “rifles”, thus killing offguerrillas who sought to attack the invader, for electronic weapons have a flash back against theuser.FAC ONE deteriorated down the years, became quite varied and with the colonisationof Earth about thirty-five thousand years ago (or up to seventy thousand in a very few cases),37"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"when used FAC ONE was quite non-standard. But it has been used on Earth against somepreclears.About a hundred and some thousand years ago the HALVER was substituted for FACONE as much more efficient, much quicker and less destructive of personnel and more creativeof slave-like devotion. Thus the preclear is certain to have the HALVER as an original; you willalso get an E-meter drop on FAC ONE. Be sure to ask if it is original or a borrowed facsimile.And don’t forget its overt act is FAC ONE being given by the preclear to a victim.BEFORE EARTH: There is a BEFORE EARTH and a BEFORE MEST UNIVERSE inall banks. The incidents are not dissimilar. They consist of the preclear being summoned beforea council, being frowned down, being sent elsewhere than where he was. The odd part of theseincidents, to the preclear. is that he is not usually guilty of anything, not aware of havingoffended. He is simply recruited, is brought in, is sentenced to be transported and goes toa new area. The only thing remarkable about these BEFORE incidents is that they are avery definite degradation and condemnation of the preclear. They are best run by scanning thepreclear backwards on each column of the CHART OF ATTITUDES, from for instance, “IKNOW NOT” to “I KNOW,” etc., for the council’s intent is to reduce the person down scalein order to get a more obedient colonist.THE JOINER: There are three major JOINERS on the track most of them found will besecond facsimiles and do not need to be run. Here is the basic on entities. A person is“packed-in” with other souls by electronics. Actually these entities are synthetic. Very early onthe track, two more entities were “added” to the victim. They were, the three, placed in a ringand hammered by electronics to get them to fuse. There is an empty spot in the centre. A laterjoiner adds two more “souls”. These incidents are responsible for the preclear being“softened-up” to a point where he can be influenced by having a hypnotized soul thrown athim. You will find the marks of these souls on every preclear. They are the basics on demoncircuits. An entity favours the environment, not the preclear, and treats the preclear just likesomebody in the environment treated the preclear. If you ask the entities questions, the areas(having demon circuits in them) will respond. If you ask the entities why they are there, theywill tell you that they were the crew of the thetan, who is asleep, that they will not work, thatthey were all bundled together and sent here. The thetan response is that he made twelve errors,eventually could not control his crew, went into ARC with them, became like an entity, wasbundled up, thetan, crew and all and shipped down here to work matters out. The entities seemto be most interested in keeping data away from the thetan, convincing him he has done wrong.Each entity claims to have had a function that was very specialized. Insane people are found tobe running on their entities, not their thetans. This is a very bad condition, betokening verysolid valence walls. Every entity can be audited independently of the others. Past deaths can berun out of them with the relief of many somatics. Each has a body, so they say, in pawnelsewhere. Here is a wealth of data and detail. Fortunately none of it is very important to us atthis time except in understanding the behaviour of Homo Sapiens. For these entities, regardlessof auditing, work overtime on the preclear. However, in auditing the theta line one is interestedonly in auditing the thetan and this is very easy to do with the incidents given above and below.One ignores the entities. They may be simply borrowed banks. They do not interfere withauditing for their incidents all run like second facsimiles and, although they register at first onan E-meter, they drop out the moment the auditor asks if the incident comes from a “borrowedbank”. If we had to audit through the complexity and aberration of the entities, we would nothave a very easy time of it. Fortunately it is not generally necessary to even think or knowabout entities in order to audit the thetan. The JOINERS, so far as I can establish at this time,can be ignored. If an entity pops up and won’t be ignored, just make your preclear move intohim and audit out where the entity is stuck on the track (psychotic) and the trouble stops.Considerable time was spent on entities in these investigations. There was a great deal of dataabout them yet to learn when they were by-passed in the discovery of direct methods ofauditing the thetan who, after all, IS the preclear. A case of paralysis, however, was partiallyremedied by bringing the entity who governed that side up to present time and putting the thetanin charge of the area again. Experiment with them for your own information if you like; you’ll38"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"find entities lie, cheat. hold out data and act generally neurotic or psychotic. Here is your“circuit case.” As the thetan loses control over his environment and his body, these entitiesmove in on area. Rehabilitate the thetan and the entity problem vanishes. Start auditing entitiesand they increase in power. These questions are at this time not answered satisfactorily: Areentities sub-beings or are they simply electronic installations? Are they very decadent thetanswho have been blanketed by the preclear ? Have they simply decayed until they follow the GEline? Are they control factors from “between-lives”? This question has been answered: Is itnecessary to audit entities? And the answer to that is, No.THE ICE CUBE: Here is an intriguing incident which, if your preclear demands,should be audited. This is evidently a method of transportation of beings to a new area. Thebeing is packed in ice, is taken to the new area and is usually dumped in the ocean. Yourpreclear, if he has this one in restimulation, has very cold hands and feet chronically. A thetanresponds to hypnosis, pain, force and other factors. He also responds to being frozen in ice.You may wonder how the being, if the ice-cube is used or is necessary at all can get into thebetween lives area so easily—in other words, if he can be transported between lives with ease,why should he be dumped originally in the form of an ice-pack. Possibly the answer lies in twoinvader crews at work- an old invader, already in command of an area but rather down scale,controls by between-lives; a new invader crew with more ambition plants beings in the samearea. These beings then fall into the between-lives routine which exists unbeknownst to thenew crew. The new crew in the area is later much surprised to find that their planted beings, socarefully dumped in the sea from a saucer, are being picked up between-lives and given“treatment” by an old, established invader whose methods of political control are long sinceestablished. When such a discovery is made, the new crew may very likely knock out some ofthe old crew installations and upset the routine.THE ICE-CUBE is quite authentic.BETWEEN-LIVES: At death the theta being leaves the body and goes to thebetween-lives area. Here he “reports in”, is given a strong forgetter implant and is then shotdown to a body just before it is born. At least that is the way the old invader in the Earth areawas operating.The implant is very interesting. The preclear is seated before a wheel which containsnumbers of pictures. As the wheel turns, these pictures go away from him. He is moved asideto the right, the left, the back. A mirror arrangement shows him still sitting there before thepictures. A force screen hits him through the pictures. The pictures dim out. The whole effect isto give him the impression that he has no past life, that he is no longer the same identity, thathis memory has been erased. The force screen flattens his own vitality, thus invalidating hisexistence, thus installing, by force alone, a forgetter. The pictures, by the way, are simplygeneralized views, stills of vacant lots, houses, back yards, of a recent Earth period and theycould apply to anybody. They are not the facsimiles of the preclear. The incident contains suchforce that the preclear. at first quite closely in contact runs it willingly. As the force cuts downhis past identity he begins to disbelieve the incident, then himself. If left in restimulation he hasa difficult time remembering things for some days.Gradually through a life-time this BETWEEN LIVES incident keys in. At first itengulfs childhood, then later and later years. Finally, with age, the preclear starts to cyclethrough it automatically and goes into a “second-childhood,” which is to say, he anticipates thecoming implant, conceives it to have done if he lives beyond a normal life span for him. (If itusually happened that he died at sixty, should he now live to seventy, he will get a feeling inthe last ten years that it has been done to him—a routine time restimulation effect.)Preclears do not always report; to have been implanted once is to get a restimulation ondying which will wipe out the past life. Some preclears have one, some have five, some moreof these implants.39"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"The life to life forgetter would follow as a natural course of events from the fact that thepreclear identifies himself and is identified by others as a MEST body; further he identifieseveryone else as a MEST body. Also he would rather start, if he must be a MEST body, with aclean slate and a new body. Also he has many overt acts of convincing others they shouldforget their entire pasts, for by that he can train them for a better future for him. NO IMPLANTWOULD EVER SUCCEED unless there was a natural cause and reason for the implant tomagnify.The report area for most has been Mars. Some women report to stations elsewhere inthe Solar System. There are occasional incidents about Earth report stations. The report stationsare protected by screens. The last Martian report station on Earth was established in thePyrenees.Entities have between-life incidents independent of the thetan. These are not necessaryto run.There are many types of between lives earlier on the track, about ten different periods ofthe entire track being devoted to a practice of keeping a thetan in a body, working and in anarea. These show up as second facsimiles and are not necessary to run. But the data is there inthe secondary banks and it is very “wonderful” data on how to keep races enslaved.THE EMANATOR: Now and then your preclear is found “stuck” in the EMANATOR.This is a large, glowing body of radioactive material which hangs magically in thin air, a sort ofa god, an all knower. Its outpulse puts one into a trance.The story usually starts with the preclear “volunteering” to come to Earth and do good.He walks into the presence of the emanator and that is that. He has volunteered, perhaps,simply out of curiosity, wondering what is contained in that big building. His “agreement” is ofcourse enforced. He is told that they will keep his body safe for him. He “agrees” to go helpout and is transported by hypnotic transference.It never occurs to the preclear to question the safety of his body. He reports back to itbetween lives. The body is preserved and can stay that way for some thousands of years. Butbodies do not last forever. One day the preclear dies on Earth and reports back dutifully to findno body. After that he conceives himself to be lost. He is given no new goals between lives, heis ignored. The next life may find him knocking on the door of a psychiatrist for he is very“lost” and “homeless” and generally bewildered. Running the emanator sequence and lossmakes all right again.The EMANATOR trick as a recruiting device is very old. You will find many secondfacsimiles about it in the preclear’s bank.THE DOUBLE-BODY: With one body in a trance in one place and another body hereon Earth, trouble occasionally occurs. A preclear during an operation may switch bodies. Pain,an anaesthetic or a serious accident cause him to change to the other area with a shockingimpact on the other body. The other body quite commonly dies or is deranged by the suddenimpact. The preclear wakes up from unconsciousness on Earth and tells (or represses) the factthat he has died. Obviously, as the surgeon or doctor will attest, he didn’t die for the heart ofthe patient kept beating. Actually the patient flicked into the other body, transferred the shockand pain and killed it, then came back here and awakened.This incident leaves a patient very, very badly disturbed. The surge into thebetween-lives area is so obviously not a death that attendants there, if attracted, will knock thebody there out with commands to forget, to not let anyone know in order to “protect” themystery. Everyone particularly mental doctors, has in the past accounted for this circumstanceof the patient thinking he died with wild theories about the effects of anaesthetics and delusion.But no patient so treated ever recovered by being informed that it is all anaesthetic nightmare40"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"and delusion and they do recover immediately if the incident is run out. Nitrous oxide is veryvicious in this regard, for it does not dull any pain, it simply “drowns” the patient.Patients wake up after such a double-body incident with the feeling that they have justlearned the secret of the universe, but they can’t quite recall it. They have, to some extent.They’ve learned they’re kept and implanted elsewhere.It IS important for an auditor to know that a DOUBLE-BODY may have happenedsome lifetimes ago during an accident. To a preclear who doesn’t know of the past life, muchless the DOUBLE-BODY, the result is quite alarming.To run a DOUBLE-BODY, run the operation or accident on Earth, then run the incidentas from the other body in pawn. Then run going “under” on Earth and waking in the otherbody and then waking on Earth. Then run being in the other place and appearing on Earth. Runthe DOUBLE-BODY until it is very thoroughly reduced, running the overt acts on it as well—which will be what the preclear says they are.THETA TRAPS: There is no subject more interesting than that of THETA TRAPS. It isof vast interest to any invader. It is of vaster interest to your preclear. How can you trap athetan? By curiosity, by giving him awards and prizes (of an implant), by retractor screens, bymock-ups, by ornate buildings which he will enter unsuspectingly only to be electroniceddown; by many such means the thetan is reduced from KNOWING to a colonist, a slave, aMEST body.All theta traps have one thing in common: they use electronic force to knock the thetaninto forgetting, into unknowingness, into effect. Their purpose is to rid the area of thosenuisances, the thetans who cannot be policed, and gain personnel—always the former, notalways the latter.The thetan feels himself, in some traps, being drawn up to a post. He fights it with hisforce. It cannot be successfully fought. He succumbs. A day or a hundred years later, he ispicked off and elsewise used.A thetan can sustain many implants of this character without becoming obsessed abouthaving a body. But he becomes obsessed very easily about having facsimiles.THE JACK-IN-THE-BOX is a variety of theta trap.THE BODY BUILDER: Sometimes a thetan is taken off a theta trap and put into a fieldwhich makes him fight again with his attention units. The purpose of this field is to make himresist its force and to resist it so as to mould him. Out of his attention units he “builds” a body.Later he is given sharp shots through the places where joints are supposed to be and isgenerally tailored into a body.There were many of these on the whole track. In your preclear they are probably secondfacsimiles.The body builder used some fifty million years ago was very precise. Although it hasdegenerated and is less formalized and although it is doubtful if you will find it in more than asecond facsimile, the original version is given here:After he was caught in some kind of theta trap, the thetan was handled as follows:THE JIGGLER: Placed over a post, the thetan was moved up and down rapidly andeccentrically for some time. He would try to hold onto and stop the post, would go into apathyand finish by being entirely invalidated as himself and would think of himself as the post, thathaving become cause.41"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"THE WHIRLER: The thetan was placed on a platform which whirled eccentrically,jerkily to the left and right until he would turn as the post turned.THE BOUNCER: The thetan was bounced up and down eccentrically until he had afacsimile which fixed him, it would appear, on his time track.THE SPINNER: A chair device was used to spin the thetan until he had no orientation.This is the probable source of the slang term, spinning, meaning going insane.THE ROCKER: This swung or teetered the thetan to the left and right, slowly andquietly. This incident is dramatized today by mystics who, not being low enough on the scaleto die, finish the job by picking up old electronic implant motions and practising them until theyhave “control of the body”—which they mean to mean without meaning to mean it, completebody control of “I”.THE BOXER: This incident is a cousin to the “FLY-TRAP.” Its purpose was to makethe thetan into a complete stimulus-response mechanism. He was hit from every angle by adevice not unlike a boxing glove. He would be forced to kick back against it with his force. Atlength he would be psychotic enough to return every motion be received. This is actuallyaberration itself. It is the psychologist’s definition, though vaguely put, of a “well adjustedhuman being,” one who stimulates and responds without thought.THE FALLER: This installs fear of falling, also fixes the thetan in the incident on thetrack. He is dropped again and again and again to different drops and at varied intervals until heis jammed.THE EDUCATION: After all these, the thetan was given a complete education.This-was of a hypnotic, stimulus-response variety. It was the type of education which makes afile card system out of a thinking being. It is dramatized today in universities as it requires noskilled instruction.THE FLY-TRAP: Very, very early on the track, a long time before any of the presentpopulace came into being, there was a theta trap called the FLY-TRAP. It was of a gummymaterial. The thetan who got into it punched and fought at this material until he was psychoticenough to react to the physical universe laws of responding to motions. He was taken out ofthis trap by a crew of do-gooders who had caught him for his own good and who trained himin religious sweetness and syrup until they considered him fit to be part of their group. Theattitude of these people was SO good, their manners SO understanding that the thetan usuallyran away as soon as possible. Sunday school sometimes brings this, even as a second facsimilewhich it nearly always is, into heavy restimulation.Remember, auditor, that a second facsimile doesn’t have to be audited but will blowwhen the preclear sees that he “borrowed” it from somebody. But that doesn’t mean he won’tuse it. Lacking a motivator, your preclear guilty of some overt act will go back into his“borrowing” and pick out any second facsimile which looks vicious enough to justify his ownaction and he will use it to the hilt. Thus you may find your preclear stuck in incidents of greatage and fury. You may find him with Arsclycus in full bloom (where they spent ten thousandlives labouring on the same job, were stuffed like snakes every few weeks to feed them, wherethey returned after death because a piece of their own body was held in pawn) and unable towork and given to a weariness beyond description. Located as a second facsimile the entireincident tends to depart. Or, locating the overt act the preclear actually did himself, the secondfacsimile goes without auditing. If a preclear holds hard to a second facsimile, he is guilty ofmore overt acts than he is telling the auditor, or the incident is something else than it appears tobe. Ask your E-meter.42"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINEGENERALIZED INCIDENTS would include anything the preclear has done which isan opposite motion to the incident in which he is “hung-up”. The opposite motion is whathangs the incident up.A MOTIVATOR is an incident which happens to the preclear and which he dramatizes.AN OVERT ACT (which may also be covert or accidental) is an incident which thepreclear does to another dynamic.A DED is an incident the preclear does to another dynamic and for which he has nomotivator—i.e., he punishes or hurts or wrecks something the like of which has never hurthim. Now he must justify the incident. He will use things which didn’t happen to him. Heclaims that the object of his injury really deserved it, hence the word, which is a sarcasm.A DEDEX is an incident which happens to a preclear AFTER he has a DED. It isalways on the same chain or subject, is always after the DED. It means THE DED EXPOSED.It is covered guilt. Its effect on the preclear is all out of proportion to the actual injury to him.One would think he was murdered by the harsh word or the scratch. He will explain violentlyhow terribly he has been used. Whenever you have a preclear who has been too abused forwords and keeps on giving you incidents which tend to fix their guilt on the family or womenor some such thing, the auditor can recognize these as DEDEXs and know that he must lookfor the DED. The preclear is usually quite unwilling to give up the DED but the E-meter willfind it. It is on the same subject as the DEDEXs—if he has many incidents about things hismother did to him and these seem fairly routine, there is a previous incident about his mother orsome earlier life mother where with an unmotivated cruelty he executed a DED.A MISASSIST is an incident wherein the preclear has tried to help on some dynamicand failed. These are very aberrative. The incident may be short and harsh or it may be a largenumber of small incidents. The MISASSIST is a failure to assist either by omission orcommission. It is always preceded by a MOTIVATOR-OVERT situation lock-up or aDED-DEDEX situation. The preclear. having injured some dynamic has come into the state ofprotecting that dynamic out of all proportion to the other dynamics. Perhaps he has many timessucceeded in his protection and such incidents are not aberrative. But one day he tries to assistand fails, or he should have assisted and didn’t and the result is the straw added to the weightof an earlier facsimile hang-up.A DEGRADER is an incident or chain of incidents whereby a lowtoned person seeks tobring down the tone of a higher toned person. The actual intent of the low-toned person is toget another low enough so that the latter can be helped. The low-toned person believes hecannot be of assistance to anything higher on the scale than himself. Therefore he will attemptto reduce the tone of another and then, when he has him well down by degrading him, he willbe unable to assist, becomes sympathetic and conducts himself properly until, of course theperson is up again. The preclear will, if very low-toned, try this on the auditor. Any low-tonedperson will do it. The preclear may have many DEGRADERS he has done. Or he may havehad many DEGRADERS happen to him. IF THE PRECLEAR IS PRONE TO DEGRADERSHE HAS A DED-DEDEX SITUATION on the same dynamic he permits to DEGRADE him. Ifhe accepts criticism from women, he has a DED-DEDEX on women. If he claims it was fatherwho got him down, who invalidated him, he has a DED DEDEX on his own father or somepast father or man who looks like his father. If you find a DEGRADER situation, look for theDED-DEDEX on the same subject. If the preclear is given to invalidating he has a DEGRADERchain he has done. The dynamic he DEGRADES has a prior DED-DEDEX.43"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENTHE TRANSFER is the single most important phase of TECHNIQUE 88.It is a circumstance rather than an incident. It is a specific action of the thetan withregard to a MEST body. It is the swing of the thetan from out of the body where he belongsinto the body where he is thereafter in trouble. THE TRANSFER is the action of going into theMEST body.Except in deaths or severe accidents or operations you won’t find a transfer out. Yourtask in auditing is to find and run all the transfers into bodies in order to achieve aself-determined, fully alive transfer out.WHERE is the thetan? Contrary to any past practice, his second best place is justoutside the MEST body monitoring it with direct contact on the MEST body’s motor controlson either side of the head. His very best place of course, is out of contact with the MEST bodyentirely and fully alive as “I.” His worst place is inside the MEST body.The thetan, in most cases, is behind and above the MEST body. In many cases he shiftsposition rather often even in one incident. Now and then he is found to run the body from infront of it. This causes a direction reversal on the part of the person so that he doesn’t knowright from left—people can teach him continually but he will still say his right is his left and hisleft is his right, and so it is, for “I” in this person is the thetan and the thetan is in front, facingthe MEST body and right is the thetan’s right, of course.There are cases where the thetan is barely or hardly ever in contact with the body. Thesecases can be considered quite aberrated, the thetan seeing the body from across the room or thestreet, convinced that he is the body but unable to do anything about it. There are cases wherethe thetan is inside the body continually but this is to say that he isn’t a thetan at all butdegenerated into an entity—and we find this is in those low-tone wide open cases, full on butraving psychotics or nearly so.A thetan is pretty bad off if he thinks all he can do is run a MEST body. This alone is ahalf-transfer. He hasn’t gone into the body yet forever thereafter, perhaps, to be an entity, buthe has achieved the level of degradation where he thinks the MEST body is more importantthan he is and that he IS the MEST body; he has become propitiative toward the body to a pointwhere he is a servant, where it becomes him in his eyes.A full transfer occurs many times in the span of a thetan, but it is not permanent until heenters the body to stay in there from there on.In doing a DED a thetan catches the sorrow waves of the body he is wronging, feelssorry for it and then, for one reason or another, merges into it. This is a temporary transfer.But after a few of these he will become obsessed with being the monitor of a MEST body andwill devote all his time to it. Then he will suppose that his only method of perceiving is throughMEST perceptics, his only method of emoting is through MEST emotions. And he comes wayon down the scale, becomes a servant, feels so degraded that he is himself nothing and theMEST body everything and so tends it continually. Eventually he will merge with it in apermanent transfer and that is probably the end of the thetan, the genetic entity and companythereafter perhaps running from within, perhaps in the next life being picked up by a newthetan. Thetans are continually being pumped into the MEST line. They do not last very long.The “I” of the individual is the thetan.The foregoing paragraph contains steps which the auditor must know. This is the cyclehe is trying to work out of the case.44"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"You will find many conditions occurring in the TRANSFER. There is another type oftransfer, the switch transfer wherein a thetan, to protect the body he has assumed changes insudden moments his control to a person startling or attacking the thetan’s property. This canbecome very bad and very involved. It happens in families and amongst friends and when theypart or somebody dies, the thetan is suddenly bereft of some of the property he was controllingand so carries on as if MEST was important.The CONTROL TRANSFER is a specialized kind of transfer wherein the thetan,having devoted himself to a MEST body now begins to control the environment and otherpeople for his body much as he controls the body. Having forgotten his skills and having manybrands of aberration, whereby he will transfer permanently, at least some of his control, he yetadventures to reach out energy-wise and start to control other people than his own body andalso attempt to control MEST objects and motions. He is at first very capable in this but, havingaberrations which cause him to stick on things, his control of the environment becomes tooextended. When he loses some of the environment he conceives that he has lost some of hisability to control. We get then a dwindling of control along all the dynamics MEST body butonly some small part of it. A thetan without aberration could safely enter into and control thewhole environment, lose widely and reassume control. A thetan very aberrated will getrestimulated when he loses some control of the environment and won’t thereafter try to controlthat type of thing or person again. These control transfers and their losses will be found widelyin any case and are almost as important as auditing control of the first dynamic.As you run facsimiles you will find that there are those seen by the preclear as thoughwithin himself and those seen by the preclear as though outside himself. Audit the latter to auditthe thetan. Audit the former and you audit only entities.CONFUSION OF IDENTITY is a primary problem with preclears. Now that WHO thepreclear is can be established and WHERE he is can be seen by the preclear as he runsfacsimiles, this confusion can be resolved. But do not expect to solve it for the preclear rapidly.And do not expect to be right yourself the first time.TECHNIQUE 88 is an E-meter technique. It can be run without an E-meter but thispermits all manner of dodging and evading. And there are usually six or ten entirely differentbanks in any preclear beside his own—lots of places to dodge into. But SCIENTOLOGY8-8008 solves all this for you.The entities all have banks. Now these are either stolen banks (from some other thetanlong ago as in BORROWING) or they are the identity of this entity. We aren’t much interestedin auditing entities except when auditing one can reduce rapidly a physical somatic or physicalill— easily done for the entities hold these in present time and they will audit in present time. Athetan high enough to be outside the body to a normal control distance is not going to hold afacsimile in restimulation just to hurt or injure his body. Only an entity will do this or a thetanwho has transferred all the way into the body—which makes him an entity and thereafter hewill behave like one (no work, high ARC with groups in order to upset them covertly, etc.,etc.)You will find an understanding of your thetan’s goals a little helpful in making sure youare auditing the thetan. He was quite old when he first fixated on the idea of controlling MESTbodies. That was not too long ago if he is still operating just outside the body (about arm’slength). One of the reasons he fixated on a MEST body was because he was terribly bored.There is a considerable liability to being a thetan from the standpoint that one is quiteimmortal. Even death cycles will look good to a thetan whose aberrations have reduced himdown from the goals and hopes he once had. Now he begins to have hopes for a MEST body.This body will grow and die but at least it will change. Aberrations cut this thetan down to apoint where he couldn’t see any change possible, could not see his own goals would ever beattained; so he fixated on a MEST body, became involved in the pure mechanics of operatingand caring for one, became more aberrated by contagion from the entities in that body and the45"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"uncertainty of life in a mortal being, lost his goals as a MEST body, finally became prettysordidly sick of the whole thing.Now, magically, you uncover for this thetan six or eight banks full of seventy trillionyears or less of incident. The thetan is a wizard at liking to act at being somebody else. That gothim into believing he himself was a MEST body. Well, it will also get him into believing he isany one of the entity banks you uncover. And he will let you audit these things until doomsday.Vicarious existence, better than a motion picture.But ask this thetan to confront the existence which he shudderingly forsook ? Never! Itwas boring. He’s been through all that. He actually knows what happened to him but it wasbad enough to make him wish to forget it until he forgot it. He’ll say he’s this entity or that.He’ll be happy, in preference to facing his own past, to just go on and perish as a MEST body.There are two remedies for this. The first is the E-meter. That is an unequaled remedy.You can find out the identity of every bank in the preclear and know that the thetan isn’t anyone of them. You can find out the first to last transfers. You can discover the location of everyincident the thetan should run.Now in using the E-meter you will discover something strange with regard to thethetan. At first the meter will be much more active on the entities than on the thetan himself. Forone thing, the thetan should be OUTSIDE the body. For another, the thetan would rather lookover and shove into view incidents he himself has never before seen. He’ll help you audit theseentities endlessly.People who keep running incidents without any recourse to an E-meter will achievemuch with the body, very little with the thetan— hence there is no rise in tone although theauditing hours continue to stretch out. In people who continually self-audit without direction,the thetan is just being very propitiative toward MEST bodies and is giving the entities awonderful work-out. The body gets better sometimes. The thetan never gets better. And he is“I.”The behaviour of the thetan in the past was often copied after something he took fromthe entities. He found an entity role wouldrestimulate, he became the actor and performed the role. He left his own bank alone andneglected although there were aberrations to dramatize there too. (And by the way, you willfind the thetan occasionally trying to stop the body from dramatizing out of entity banks).The thetan bank, the one you want, will give you less active needle response than theentity banks when you first start auditing. This is a sort of negative sorting. But you may haveto audit an entity or two because of the way the entity has the body stuck on the track.The point is to find the thetan bank and audit it. The conflict in this person derives fromthe ambitions of the thetan being balked by the laziness and stupidity and desire for death anddestruction on the part of the entities. You can audit any side of this conflict you want. But bysimply making the thetan sufficiently strong, the entities become cowed and won’t act up oreven drop out and leave.The other answer is to clean up present life with attention to all transfers in it, all switchtransfers, all control transfers. Audit the thetan handling the body until you have the current lifewell up.You will find that you will have to start by giving the preclear a drill to locate where thethetan is. Simply run him up and down the track through various incidents, with good attentionto attention unit running, each time locating the thetan outside the body and handling it. Thepreclear will get a dim concept of the handling but he will get a good concept of the location of46"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"the thetan. Now, in the current lifetime, locate the thetan being distracted from his task bynoises or arguments in the environment.Run the sympathy of the thetan for the body, the refusal of the thetan to feel sympathyat times. And run in particular antagonisms or angers from the body at other bodies, from theother bodies at the thetan’s body. Get all the DED-DEDEX computations out of the way andthen audit the thetan entrance somewhere around the time of birth. It isn’t an entrance, it’s apossession of the motor controls.When you have this thetan in good shape for this lifetime he will be strong enough,usually, to tackle NIPS, BLANKETINGS, BORROWINGS. But don’t be amazed when yourun your first of these to find that the thetan has been using an entity bank. Any borrowing,however, is good to run. Any blanketing on the second dynamic shows your preclear once andfor all that he IS a theta being without a body by showing him an incident to that effect.If the case is incapable of finding the thetan in current life, then take the youngest entityand audit it.It generally is the thetan but transferred inside the body.How long it will take you to audit a preclear to theta clear one cannot say. The routereaches high very quickly. Using this know-how and 80 you will attain a MEST clear in a veryshort time. Aside from inaccessible persons and psychotics in general, most cases should be-come MEST clear in a few weeks of hard auditing.THE END47"}]
