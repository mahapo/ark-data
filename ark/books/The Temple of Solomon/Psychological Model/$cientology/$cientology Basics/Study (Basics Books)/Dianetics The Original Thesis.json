A long research in ancient and modern philosophy culminated, in nineteen thirty-eight,in the heuristically discovered primary law. A work was written at that time which embraced manand his activities. In the following years further research was undertaken in order to prove ordisprove the axioms so established.Certain experiences during the war made it necessary for the writer to resolve the workinto applicable equations and an intensive program was begun in nineteen forty-five toward thisend.A year later many techniques had been discovered or evolved and a nebulous form of thepresent work was formulated. Financed chiefly by a lump sum disability compensation, that formof Dianetics was intensively applied to volunteer subjects, and the work gradually developed to itspresent form.Dianetics has been under test by the writer, as here delineated, for the past three years.The last series of random volunteers, numbering twenty, were rehabilitated, twenty out of twenty,with an average number of work hours of 151.2 per subject. Dianetics offers the first anatomy ofthe human mind and techniques for handling the hitherto unknown reactive mind, which causesirrational and psychosomatic behavior. It has successfully removed any compulsions,repressions, neuroses and psychoses to which it has been applied.L. R. H.January, 19481"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":".c.PRIMARY AXIOMSDianetics is an heuristic science built upon axioms. Workability rather than Idealism hasbeen consulted. The only claim made for these axioms is that by their use certain definite andpredictable results can be obtained.The principal achievement of Dianetics lies in its organization. Almost any of its parts canbe found somewhere in history, even when they were independently evolved by the writer. Thereare no principal sources, and where a practice or a principle is borrowed from some past schoolthe connection is usually accidental and does not admit any further use or validity of that school.Dianetics will work, and can only be worked, when regarded and used as a unity. When dilutedby broader applications of older practices, it will no longer produce results. To avoid confusionand prevent semantic difficulties, new and simplified terminology has been used and is used onlyas defined herein.Dianetics is actually a family of sciences. It is here addressed in the form of a science ofthought applicable to psychosomatic ills and individual aberrations.The field of thought may be divided into two areas which have been classified as the“knowable” and the “unknowable.” We are here concerned only with the “knowable.” In the“unknowable” we place that data which we do not need to know in order to solve the problem ofimproving or resolving aberrations of the human mind. By thus splitting the broad field ofthought, we need not now concern ourselves with such indefinites as spiritualism, deism,telepathy, clairvoyance, or, for instance, the human soul.Conceiving this split as a line drawn through the area, we can assign a dynamic principleof existence to all that data remaining in the “knowable” field.After exhaustive research one word was selected as embracing the finite universe as adynamic principle of existence. This word can be used as a guide or a measuring stick and by itcan be evaluated much information. It is therefore our first and our controlling axiom.The first axiom is:SURVIVE!This can be seen to be the lowest common denominator of the finite universe. It embracesall forms of energy. It further delineates the purpose of that energy so far as it is now viewable byus in the “knowable” field. The activity of the finite universe can easily be seen to obey this axiomas though it were a command. All works and energies can be considered to bemotivated by it. The various kingdoms have this as their lowest common denominator,for animals, vegetables and minerals are all striving for survival. We do not know to what end weare surviving, and in our field of the “knowable” and in our choice of only the workable axioms,we do not know and have no immediate reason to ask why.All forms of energy are then surviving to some unknown end, for some unknownpurpose. We need only to know that they are surviving and that, as units or species, they mustsurvive.By derivation from the first workable axiom, we come into possession of the second. Inobedience to the command “survive,” life took on the form of a cell which, joining with othercells, formed a colony. The cell, by procreating, expanded the colony. The colony, by2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"procreation, formed other colonies. Colonies of different types united and necessity, mutation andnatural selection brought about specializing which increased the complexity of the colonies untilthey became an aggregation. The problems of the colonial aggregation were those of food,protection and procreation. In various ways a colonial aggregation of cells became a standardizedunity and any advanced colonial aggregation came into possession by necessity, mutation andnatural selection of a central control system .The purpose of the colonial aggregation was to survive. To do this it had to have food,means of defense, protection and means of procreation. The control center which had developedhad as its primary command, Survive! Its prime purpose was the food, defense, protection andmeans of procreation.Thus can be stated the second workable axiom:THE PURPOSE OF THE MIND IS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS RELATING TOSURVIVAL.The ultimate success of the organism, its species or life would be, at its unimaginableextreme, immortality. The final failure in obedience to the law survive would be death. Betweeneternal survival and death lie innumerable gradations. In the middle ground of such a scale wouldbe mere existence without hope of much success and without fear of failure. Below this pointwould lie, step by step, innumerable small errors, accidents, losses, each one of which wouldtend to abbreviate the chances of reaching the ultimate goal. Above this point would lie the smallsuccesses, appreciations, and triumphs which would tend to secure the desirable goal.As an axiom, the mind can then be said to act in obedience to a central basic command,survive, and to direct or manage the organism in its efforts to accomplish the ultimate goal for theindividual or species or life, and to avoid for the individual or species or life any part of the finalfailure, which leads to the stated axiom:THE MIND DIRECTS THE ORGANISM, THE SPECIES, ITS SYMBIOTES OR LIFEIN THE EFFORT OF SURVIVAL.A study of the field of evolution will indicate that survival has been, will be, and is thesole test of an organism, whether the organism is treated in the form of daily activity or the life ofthe species. No action of the organism will be found to lie without the field of survival, for theorganism is acting within its environment upon information received or recorded, and error orfailure does not alter the fact that its basic impulse was motivated by survival.Another axiom may then be formulated as follows:THE MIND AS THE CENTRAL DIRECTION SYSTEM OF THE BODY, POSES,PERCEIVES AND RESOLVES PR OBLEMS OF SURVIVAL AND DIRECTS OR FAILS TODIRECT THEIR EXECUTION.As there are many organisms in the same species, all attempting to accomplish the sameend, and as there are many species, and as matter itself is attempting in one unit form or another tosurvive, there is necessarily conflict and contest amongst the individuals of the species, species,or units of matter. Species cannot survive without being interested primarily in the species.Natural selection and other causes have established this as a primary rule for survival: That theunit remain alive as long as possible as a unit and, by association and procreation, that the speciesremain alive as a species. Second grade interest is paid by the unit or the species to its symbiotes.Third grade interest is paid to inanimate matter. As this is apparently the most workable solution,3"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"natural selection best preserves those species which follow this working rule. And the symbiotesof the successful species therefore have enhanced opportunity for survival.Man is the most successful organism currently in existence, at least on this planet. Man iscurrently winning in the perpetual cosmic election which possibly may select the thinker of thenew THOUGHT.Man is heir to the experience and construction of his own ancestors. As cellularconservatism is one of the factors of survival, his brain is basically the same brain which directedand resolved the problems of his animal forebears. By evolution and natural selection, this braintherefore has the primary priority in emergencies. Superimposed on this animal brain has beendeveloped an enormously complex analyzer, which probably exists in his frontal lobe.The command, survive, is variable in individuals and species to the extent that it may bestrong or weak. Superior strength of the command in the individual or species is normally, butvariably, a survival factor. The primary facet of personality is the basic strength of the DYNAMICdrive.The DYNAMIC is variable from individual to individual and race to race. It is varied byphysiology, environment, and experience. Its manifestation in the animal brain affects the tenacityof the individual to life or purpose, and it affects the activity of the analyzer. The firstcharacteristic of the individual which should be considered is the basic strength of hisDYNAMIC. By this an axiom can be formulated:THE PERSISTENCY OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN LIFE IS DIRECTS Y GO KERNEDB Y THE STRENGTH OF HIS BASIC DYNAMIC.The analytical, human or, as it has elsewhere been called erroneously, the consciousmind, is variable from individual to individual and race to race in its ability to perceive and resolveproblems. Another axiom can then be formulated:INTELLIGENCE IS THE ABILITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL, GROUP, OR RACE TORESOLVE PROBLEMS RELATING TO SURVIVAL.It should be noted that there is a distinct difference between the DYNAMIC and theintelligence. High intelligence may not denote high DYNAMIC. High DYNAMIC may not denotehigh intelligence. Intelligence is mental sensitivity and analytical ability. DYNAMIC is thepersistency of the individual in obedience to the command, survive!It has been noted that there is a gradation in the scale of survival. Gains toward theultimate goal are pleasurable. Failures toward the final defeat are sorrowful or painful. Pleasure istherefore the perception of wellbeing, or an advance toward the ultimate goal. Pain, therefore, isthe perception of a reduction toward the final defeat. Both are necessary survival factors.For the purpose of Dianetics, good and evil must be defined. Those things which may beclassified as good by an individual are only those things which aid himself, his family, his group,his race, mankind or life in its dynamic obedience to the command, modified by the observationsof the individual, his family, his group, his race, or life.As evil may be classified those things which tend to limit the dynamic thrust of theindividual, his family, his group, his race, or life in general in the dynamic drive, also limited bythe observation, the observer and his ability to observe.4"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Good may be defined as constructive. Evil may be defined as destructive—definitionsmodified by viewpoint. The individual man is an organism attempting to survive in affinity orcontest with other men, races, and the three kingdoms. His goal is survival for himself, hisprogeny, his group, his race, his symbiotes, life and the universe in general in contest with anyefforts or entities which threaten or impede his efforts to attain the goal.His happiness depends upon making, consolidating, or contemplating gains toward hisgoal.It is a purpose of Dianetics to pass man across the abyss of irrational, solely reactivethought and enter him upon a new stage of constructive progression to the ultimate goal.5"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":".c.AN ANALOGY OF THE MINDIt is not the purpose of Dianetics to reconstruct the human mind. The purpose ofDianetics is to delete from the existing mind those physically painful experiences which haveresulted in the aberration of the analytical mind, to resolve the physical manifestations of mentalaberration, and to restore in its entirety the proper working function of a brain not otherwisephysically deranged. Dianetics thus embraces the various aspects of psychosomatic conditions,including the glandular balance or imbalance of the organism, as influenced by painful physicalexperience. However, its purpose is not one of healing, and its address is not to such psycho-somatic manifestations specifically, but rather to those aberrative experiences in which theseconditions have their roots.The initial adjustments of the individual are included in Child Dianetics and EducationalDianetics. Judicial Dianetics, Political Dianetics and Military Dianetics are elsewhere touched uponor allocated for study. Dianetics, as a family of sciences, proceeds however from the axiomscursorily touched upon in the last chapter and is uniformly governed by the principles of thebehavior of the human mind.When an individual is acting contrary to survival of himself, his group, progeny, race,mankind, or life he can be considered to be unintelligent, uninformed or aberrated. Every singleinstance of aberrated conduct threatening the general goal of the individual as outlined in the lastchapter can be proven to have a source which will specifically be found to be a painful experiencecontaining data not available to the analytical mind. Every single instance and facet of aberratedconduct has its exact causation in the physically painful error which has been introduced during amoment of absence of the analytical power.Dianetics consists of discovering the aberration in the individual, finding the physicallypainful experience which corresponds to it and placing the data therein contained at the disposal ofthe analytical mind. More as an effort to demonstrate how that is accomplished than as an actualoutline of the character of the mind, the following analogy is offered.First there is the physio-animal section of the brain, containing the motor controls, thesub-brains, and the physical nervous system in general, including the physical aspect of theanalytical section of the brain. The control of all voluntary and involuntary muscles is contained inthis section. It commands all body fluids, blood flow, respiration, glandular secretion, cellularconstruction, and the activity of various parts of the body. Experimentation has adequatelydemonstrated this. The physio-animal mind has specific methods of “thinking.” These are entirelyreactive. Animal experimentation—rats, dogs, etc.—is experimentation on and with precisely thismind and little more. It is a fully conscious mind and should never be denoted by any term whichdenies it “consciousness” since there is no period in the life of the organism from conception todeath when this mind is not awake, observing, and recording perceptics. This is the mind of adog, cat, or rat and is also the basic mind of a man so far as its operating characteristics areconcerned. A man in the deepest possible somnambulistic sleep is still in possession of moremind and thinking and coordinating ability than a lower animal.The term “consciousness” is no more than a designation of the awareness of now. Thephysio-animal mind never ceases to be aware of now and never ceases to record the successiveinstances of now which in their composite make up a time track connecting memory in an orderlychain. Cessation of life alone discontinues the recording of perceptions on this orderly track.Unconsciousness is a condition wherein the organism is discoordinated only in its analyticalprocess and motor control direction. In the physio-animal section of the brain, a complete timetrack and a complete memory record of all perceptions for all moments of the organism’sexistence is available.6"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"As life progresses, for instance, from a blade of grass, greater and greater complexitiesand degrees of selfdeterminism are possible. Energy in its various forms is the primary motivatorin the lower orders, but as the complexity of the order is increased into the animal kingdom, thephysio-animal brain attains more and more command of the entire organism until it itself begins topossess the second section of the mind.All animals possess in some slight degree an analyzer. This, which we designate theanalytical mind, is present even in lower orders, since it is only that section of the brain whichpossesses the self-deterministic coordinative command of the physio-animal brain and thus of thebody. In a rat, for instance, it is no more than its “conscious” awareness of now applying tolessons of then without rationality but with instinct and painful experience. This is the analyticalsection of the mind in a lower animal but it is the reactive mind in a man whose analytical mind isso highly attuned and intricate that it can command entirely the physio-animal brain and thus thebody.Man not only possesses a superior physio-animal mind but possesses as well ananalytical mind of such power and complexity that it has no real rival in any other species. Theanalytical mind of man cannot be studied by observing the reactions of animals under any situa-tions. Not only is it more sensitive but it possesses factors and sensitivities not elsewhere found.Continuing this analogy: Lying between the analytical mind and the physio-animal mindmay be conceived the reactive mind. This is the coordinated responses of the physio-animal mind,the “analytical” mind of animals, and the first post of emergency command in man. All errors of apsychic or psychosomatic nature can be considered for the purposes of this analogy to lie in thereactive mind. The first human analytical mind took command of the body and physio-animalmind under strained and dangerous circumstances when man was still in violent contest with otherspecies around him. It can be considered that the analytical mind received command with thesingle proviso that instantaneous emergency would be handled by the outdated but faster reactivemind.Any and all errors in thinking and action derive from the reactive mind as it is increased instrength and power by painful experience. It can be called a shadow mind, instantaneouslyreactive when any of its content is perceived in the environment of the individual, at which time iturgently bypasses the analytical mind and causes immediate reaction in the physio-animal mindand in the body. Additionally, the reactive mind is in continual presence when chronicallyrestimulated by a constantly present restimulator—which is to say, an approximation of thereactive mind’s content or some part thereof continually perceived in the environment of the orga-nism. The reactive mind is in action so long as it is activated by an exact or nearly exactapproximation of its content. But given too continuous a restimulation, it can and does derangeboth the physio-animal mind and body below it and the analytical mind above it. It was created byderanging circumstances of a physical nature, hence it deranges.The entire content of the reactive mind is records of physical pain with its accompanyingperceptions during disconnection of the analyzer. All aberrated conduct and error on the part of anindividual is occasioned by restimulation of his reactive mind.None of these minds are “unconscious,” nor are they subconscious. The entire organismis always conscious but the temporary dispersion of the thought processes of the analytical mindbrings about a condition whereby that mind, having been dispersed and considering itself theresidence of the person, is unable to obtain and reach data perceived and received by the organismduring the analytical mind’s condition of dispersion. That the analytical mind can be thrown, bypain or shock, out of circuit is a survival factor of its own: as sensitive “machinery” it must beprotected by a fuse system.7"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":".c.THE DYNAMICSThe basic dynamic, SURVIVE, increases in complexity as the complexity of theorganism evolves. Energy may be considered to have taken many paths through eternity to arriveintact at the infinite goal. The “why” of the goal may lie above the finite line but below it,demarked by the word SURVIVE, definite manifestations are visible. Energy collects into variousforms of matter which collect and aggregate in various materials and compounds. Life evolvesfrom the simplest basic into complex forms since evolutionary change is in itself a method ofsurvival.Conflict amongst species and individuals within the species is additionally a survivalfactor. Affinity of individuals for groups, races, and the whole of its species, and for otherspecies, is additionally a survival factor, as strong or stronger than conflict.Drive is defined as the dynamic thrust through time toward the attainment of the goal.Survive is considered to be the lowest common denominator of all energy efforts and all forms. Itcan then be subdivided specifically into several drive lines as applicable to each form or species.The unaberrated self contains eight main drives which are held in common with man.The dynamics are: One, self; Two, sex; Three, group; Four, mankind; Five, life; Six, thephysical universe; Seven, thought; Eight, universal thought or infinity.An entire philosophy can be built around each one of these dynamics which will accountfor all the actions of an individual. Any one of these philosophies is so complete that it can belogically made to include the other seven. In other words, all purpose of an individual can berationalized into the dynamic of self. A philosophy exists which attempts to rationalize everythinginto the sexual dynamic, and so on with all the dynamics. Observing that each one can stand as alogical unity, one finds it necessary to retire to the lowest common denominator of the basicdynamic which actually does explain the eight subdivisions. As each one of the subdivisions iscapable of supporting the whole weight of a rational argument, it can readily be deduced that eachis of nearly equal importance in the individual. The aberrated conditions of a society tend to varythe stress on these dynamics, making first one and then another the keynote of the society.In an unaberrated individual or society, the validity of all eight would be recognized.The unaberrated individual may physiologically possess or environmentally stress one ormore of these dynamics above the others. In terms of basic personality, thephysiological-environmental-educational aspect of the individual is of varied strength in the eightdynamics.Each one of the eight dynamics breaks further into purposes which are specific andcomplex. Purposes and other factors entangle these dynamics, and varying situations and theobservational power of the individual may conflict one of these dynamics against another withinthe individual himself. This is a basic complex factor of unaberrated personality.I. THE DYNAMIC OF SELF consists of the dynamic thrust to survive as an individual,to obtain pleasure as an individual, and to avoid pain. It covers the general field of food, clothingand shelter, personal ambition, and general individual purpose.II. THE DYNAMIC OF SEX embraces the procreation of progeny, the care of thatprogeny, and the securing for that progeny of better survival conditions and abilities in the future.8"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"III. THE DYNAMIC OF GROUP embraces the various units of the species man, such asthe association, the military company, the people in the surrounding countryside, the nation andthe race. It is characterized by activity on the part of the individual to obtain and maintain thesurvival of the group of which he is a part.IV. THE MANKIND DYNAMIC embraces the survival of the species.Note: The first four dynamics belong to Dianetics. The upper four, introduced late 1950,complete the full eight dynamics of Scien to logy .V. THE DYNAMIC OF LIFE is the urge of the individual to survive for life and for lifeto survive for itself.VI. THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE DYNAMIC is the drive of the individual to enhancethe survival of all matter, energy, time and space.VII. THE THOUGHT DYNAMIC concerns the urge of the individual to survive asthought.VIII. THE DYNAMIC OF UNIVERSAL THOUGHT is the urge of the individual tosurvive for the Creator.While man is concerned with any one of the above dynamics, any one of them maybecome antipathetic to his own survival. This is rational conflict and is normally and commonlyincidental to survival. It is non-aberrative in that it is rational within the educational limitation.The family as a unit is not a dynamic but a combination of dynamics. And in this andother societies it attains a position of interest which is not necessarily inherent in the individual orgroup.Basically simple, complexity is introduced amongst the dynamics by individual andgroup irrationalities. The basic (unaberrated) individual has continual difficulty rationalizing theproblems of importances and choices amongst these dynamics. When the basic individualbecomes aberrated and is attendantly unable to reason freely on all problems, a selection ofimportances amongst these dynamics becomes nearly impossible and produces aberrated solutionswhich may resolve such an extreme as the destruction of the individual himself, by himself, underthe mistaken solution that he may thus obey the primary command.Note: All self-destructive effort is irrationality of a precise nature which will often befound by the auditor in his preclear4 during auditingS but which forms no part of the basicpersonality of that individual.4 preclear: this term covers anyone who is not CLEAR; however, it is principally used todescribe a person who, through auditing, is finding out more about himself and life.5 auditing: the application of Dianetic procedures to a preclear by a trained Dianeticauditor.9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":".c.THE BASIC INDIVIDUALFor the purposes of this work the terms basic individ ual and Clear are nearlysynonymous since they denote the unaberrated self in complete integration and in a state ofhighest possible rationality; a Clear6 is one who has become the basic individual through auditing.The precise personality of the basic individual is of interest to the auditor. His completecharacteristic is established by: 1. The strength of his basic DYNAMIC; 2. The relative strengthsof his dynamics; 3. The sensitivity, which is to say the intelligence, of his analyzer; 4. Thecoordination of his motor controls; 5. His physiological and glandular condition; 6. Hisenvironment and education.The experiences of each individual also create an individual composite and so mayadditionally designate individuality. There are as many distinct individuals on earth as there aremen, women and children. That we can establish a common denominator of drive and basicfunction does not, cannot, and will not alter the fact that individuals are amazingly varied onefrom the next.It will be found by experience and exhaustive research, as it has been clinicallyestablished, that the basic individual is invariably responsive in all the dynamics and is essentially“good.” There are varying degrees of courage but in the basic individual there is no pusillanimity.The virtues of the basic individual are innumerable. His intentional vices and destructivedramatizations are non-existent. He is in close alignment with that ideal which mankindrecognizes as an ideal. This is a necessary part of an auditor’s working knowledge, sincedeviations from it denote the existence of aberration, and such departures are unnatural andenforced and are no part of the self-determinism of the individual.Man is not a reactive animal. He is capable of self-determinism. He has will power. Heordinarily has high analytical ability. He is rational and he is happy and integrated only when he ishis own basic personality.The most desirable state in an individual is complete self-determinism. Suchself-determinism may be altered and shaped to some degree by education and environment, but solong as the individual is not aberrated, he is in possession of self-determinism. So long as he isself-determined in his actions he adjusts himself successfully to the degree that his environmentwill permit such an adjustment. He will be more forceful, effective and happier in thatenvironment than when aberrated.That the basic personality is “good” does not mean that he cannot be a terribly effectiveenemy of those things rationally recognizable as destructive to himself and to his.The basic individual is not a buried unknown or a different person, but an intensity of allthat is best and most able in the person. The basic individual equals the same person minus hispain and dramatizations.The drive strength of the person does not derive from his aberrations. The aberrationslessen the drive strength. Artistry, personal force, personality, all are residual in the basicpersonality. This is derived from clinical research and experimentation. The only reason anaberree occasionally holds hard to his aberrations is due to the fact that his engrams have a contentwhich forbids their removal.The reactive mind consists of a collection of experiences received during an unanalyticalmoment which contain pain and actual or conceived antagonism to the survival of the individual.10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"An engram is a perceptic entity which can be precisely defined. The aggregate of engramscompose the reactive mind.A new sub-field entitled “Perceptics” has been originated here to define adequatelyengramic data. Perceptics contains as one of its facets the field of semantics. Precisely as the fieldof semantics is organized so is organized in perceptics each sensory perception.The audio-syllabic communication system of man has its counterpart in various languagesobservable in lower animals. Words are sounds in syllabic form delivered with a definite timbre,pitch, and volume or sight recognition in each case. Words are a highly specialized form ofaudio-perceptics. The quality of the sound in uttering the word is nearly as important as the worditself. The written word belongs in part to visioperceptics. Having but lately acquired hisextensive vocabulary, the mind of man is least adjusted to words and their sense. The mind isbetter able to differentiate amongst qualities of utterance than amongst the meanings of wordsthemselves.Included in perceptics in the same fashion and on the same axioms as semantics are theother sensory perceptions—organic sensation, the tactile sense, the olfactory sense and the sensesinvolved with sight and hearing. Each has its own grouping. And each carries its class ofmessages with highly complex meanings. Each one of these divisions of the senses is plotted intime according to the earliest or most forceful significances. Each class of messages is so filed asto lead the individual toward pleasure and away from pain. The classifications and study of thisvaried sensory file has been designated “Perceptics.”Engrams are received into the mind forming a reactive area during moments of loweredanalytical awareness of the individual, and they contain physical pain and antagonism to survival.The engram is a packaged perceptic not available to the analytical mind but intimately connected tothe physio-animal mind. Under normal conditions it reacts as a dramatization of itself whenapproximated by the organism’s perceptions of its content in the immediate environment duringperiods of weariness, illness, or hypnotic moments in the life of the individual.When injury or illness supplants the analytical mind producing what is commonly knownas “unconsciousness” and when physical pain and antagonism to the survival of the organism arepresent, an engram is received by the individual. Subsequently, during moments when thepotential of the analytical mind is reduced by weariness, illness or similar circumstances, one ormore of the perceptics contained in the engram may be observed by the individual in hisenvironment, and without his perceiving that he has observed it (or the identity of it) theindividual dramatizes the moment of receipt of the engram.An engram impedes one or more dynamics of the basic individual. Being antagonistic tohis survival it can be considered analogically to consist of a reverse charge.As an example, the analytical mind can be said to possess multiple scanners in layers.Ordinary or pleasurable memory can be considered to have, as an analogy only, a positive charge.The multiple scanners are able to sweep these areas and make available memory data to theanalytical mind so that it can arrive by various mathematical means at a solution for its variousproblems.The engram, as a specific memory package, can be considered to have a reverse chargewhich cannot be reached by the scanner of the analytical mind but which is directly connected tothe motor controls and other physical functions and which can exert, at a depth not nearly as basicas the basic drive but nevertheless low, a hidden influence upon the analytical mind throughanother circuit. The analytical mind in awareness of now, nevertheless, is unable to discover,11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"without assistance from an auditor, the existence of such an impediment since it was receivedduring a moment of extremely low potential on the part of the analytical mind.As a further analogy, and for demonstration only, an engram can be considered to be abundle of perceptions of a precise nature. An engram is an entire dramatic sequence, implantedduring unconsciousness, which possesses specific perceptic keys, any one of which, whenunanalytically perceived by the individual in his environment, may in greater or lesser degrees setthe engram into reaction.Denied to the analytical mind at its reception, it is denied to the analytical mind in its exactcharacter during its dramatization. Its content is literal and, on the physio-animal level, demandsaction. Man’s analytical ability and his vocabulary are imposed above both the physio-animalmind and the reactive mind, both on the evolutionary time track and in awareness. The chargecontained in the engram is inexhaustible and remains reactive in full force whenever keyed into thecircuit by restimulators.Restimulators are those approximations in the environment of an individual of the contentof an engram. Restimulators can exist in any of the various senses. The orderly filing ofperceptics in the memory does not, apparently, include the content of engrams, these being filedseparately under an “immediate danger” heading.There are three kinds of thought: the first is engramic, or literal. It demands immediateaction without examination by the analytical mind. A hand being withdrawn from a hot stovewhen burned is being governed by the reactive principle, but as the ensuing instant ofunconsciousness caused by the shock is ordinarily slight, no real engram can be said to haveformed.The second type of thought is justified thought. Engramic thought is literal, withoutreason, irrational. Justified thought is the attempt of the analytical mind to explain the reactive,engramic reactions of the organism in the ordinary course of living. Every engram may causesome form of aberrated conduct on the part of the individual. Justified thought is the effort of theconscious mind to explain away that aberration without admitting, as it cannot do normally, that ithas failed the organism.The third and optimum type of thought is rational thought. This is the thought used by a“Clear.”An engram is an apparent surcharge in the mental circuit with certain definite finitecontent. That charge is not reached or examined by the analytical mind but that charge is capableof acting as an independent command.When the basic drive of the individual is boosted in potential by an observed necessity,the residual charge in an engram is insufficient to contest, at times, the raised purpose. Theanalytical mind can then be seen to function in entire command of the organism without seriousmodification by engramic command.At other times, hostility in the environment and confusion of the analytical mind combineto reduce the dynamic potential to such a degree that the engramic command, in comparison to thebasic drive, can be seen to be extremely powerful. It is at such times, in the presence of even faintrestimulators, that the individual most demonstrates his aberrations.EXAMPLE: Engram received at the age of three and one-half years. Adult preclear. Aschild in dental chair, against his will, under antagonistic conditions, given nitrous oxide and12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"tricked by dentist. During painful portion of treatment the dentist says, “He is asleep. He can’thear, feel or see anything. Stay there.”The perceptics which can be restimulated in this are the quality, pitch and volume of thedentist’s voice; the sound of the dentist’s drill; the slap of the cable running the drill; street noisesof a specific kind; the tactile of the mouth being forcibly held open; the smell of the mask; thesound of running water; the smell of nitrous oxide; and in short, several of each perceptic class,excluding only sight.The effect of this experience, being a part of an engramic chain which contained twoearlier experiences, was in some small degree to trance the individual and maintain some portionof him in a regressed state.This engram is too brief and extraordinarily simple but it will serve as an example to theauditor. The timeless quality of the suggestions, the conceived antagonism, precursors9 on theengramic chain awakened and re-enforced, all these things confused the time sense of theindividual and were otherwise reactive in later life.For every engram there is a somatic as part of that engram. No aberration exists withoutits somatics unless it is a racial-educational aberration, in which instance it is compatible with itsenvironment and so is not considered irrational.Every aberration contains its exact command in some engram.The numbers of engrams per individual are relatively few. The aberrated condition of theindividual does not depend on the number of engrams but the severity of individual engrams.An engram is severe in the exact ratio that it is conceived by the organism to have been amoment of threat to survival. The character of the threat and the perceptic content produce theaberration. A number of engrams with similar perceptics in an individual produce a complexaberration pattern which nevertheless has for its parts individual engrams.An aberration is the manifestation of an engram and is serious only when it influences thecompetence of the individual in his environment.Engrams are of two types depending upon the duration of restimulation. There are“floaters” and “chronics.” A floater has not been restimulated in the individual during the lifetimesucceeding it. A chronic is an engram which has been more or less continuously restimulated sothat it has become an apparent portion of the individual. A chronic begins to gather “locks.” Afloater has not accumulated locks since it has never been restimulated.A lock can be conceived to be joined to an engram in such a way that it can be reached bythe multiple scanners of the analytical mind which cannot reach the engram. A lock is a painfulmental experience. It is or is not regarded by the analytical mind as a source of difficulty oraberration. It is a period of mental anguish and is wholly dependent upon an engram for its painvalue. When an engram is activated into a chronic, it accumulates numerous locks along the timetrack of the individual. The engram itself is not immediately locatable, except somatically, alongthe time track of the individual. Locks are of some diagnostic value but, as they exist asexperiences more or less recallable by the analytical mind, they can be depended upon to vanishupon the removal of the engram from the reactive mind.The running of a lock as a lock has some value but the exhaustion of locks from anaberrated individual is long and arduous and is seldom productive of any lasting result. Upon thelocation and exhaustion of the engram from the reactive mind, all of its locks vanish. An engram13"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"may exist unactivated as a floater for any number of years or for the entire duration of an indi-vidual’s life. At any future moment after the receipt of an engram, whether that time periodconsists of days or decades, the floater may reactivate at which time it becomes part of thecommand obeyed by the analytical mind in its efforts to rationalize. The removal of the individualfrom his restimulators, which is to say, the environment in which the engram was reactive, is initself a form of therapy, since the engram may then return to its status as a floater.EXAMPLE: Engram—At birth occurs the phrase, “No good,” uttered during a momentof headache and gasping on the part of a child.Lock: At the age of seven while the child was ill with a minor malady, the mother in a fitof rage said that he was “no good.”The removal of the engram also removes, ordinarily without further attention, the lock.Note: Birth remained inactive in the above case as a floater until the moment of reducedanalytical power at the age of seven when a birth phrase was repeated. It is worth remarking thatthe entire content of the birth engram is given simultaneously both to the child and to the mother,with only the difference of somatics. It is further worthy of note that the mother quite oftenperceives in the child a restimulator and uses against it the phrases which were said when the childgave the mother the greatest pain, namely, birth. The child is then victimized into variouspsychosomatic ills by the repetition of its birth engram restimulators, which may develop evenmore seriously into actual disease.The brain controls the multiple and complex functions of the growth and condition of theorganism. Containing organic sensation as one of its perceptics, the engram then, whenreactivated, causes a somatic and additionally may deny body fluids, i.e. hormones and blood, tosome portion of the anatomy, occasioning psychosomatic ills. The denial of fluid or adequateblood supply may result in a potentially infective area. The psychosomatic reduces the resistanceof some portion of the body to actual disease.Somatic and other sensory errors find their basis in unconscious antagonistic moments. Asomatic may be adjusted by an address to a lock but.the permanency of adjustment obtains onlyuntil such time as the engram is again reactivated, causing another lock.All aberrations are occasioned by engrams.An engram is severely painful or severely threatening to the survival of the organism andis an engram only if it cannot be reached by the awake analytical mind.A simple approximation of the action of an engram can be accomplished by an experimentin hypnotism whereby a positive suggestion which contains a posthypnotic signal is delivered toan amnesia-tranced person. The subject, having been commanded to forget the suggestion whenawake, will then perform the act. This suggestion is then actually a light portion of the reactivemind. It is literally interpreted, unquestionably followed, since it is received during a period ofunawareness of the analytical mind or some portion of it. The restimulator, which may be the actof the operator adjusting his tie, causes the subject to commit some act. The subject will then tryto explain why he is doing what he is doing, no matter how illogical that action may be. Thepost-hypnotic suggestion is then recalled to the subject’s mind and he remembers it. Thecompulsion vanishes (unless it is laid upon an actual engram).The obedience of the subject to the command has, as its source, engramic thought. Theexplanation by the subject for his own action is the analytical mind observing the organism, which14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"it supposes is in its sole charge, and justifying itself. The release of the post-hypnotic suggestioninto the analytical mind brings about rational thought.Engrams can be considered to be painfully inflicted, often timeless, post-hypnoticsuggestions delivered antagonistically to the “unconscious” subject. The posthypnotic suggestiongiven the subject in the above example would not have any permanent effect on the subject even ifit were not removed by the operator, because there was presumed to be no antagonism involved(unless, of course, it rested on a former engram).The physio-animal mind of an organism never ceases recording on some level. The exactmoment when recording begins in an organism has not at this date been accurately determined. Ithas been found to be very early, probably earlier than four months after conception and fivemonths before birth. In the presence of pain, any moment prior to the age of two years may beconsidered to be unanalytical. Any painful experience received by the foetus contains its fullperceptic package, including darkness.Once an auditor has worked a prenatal engram and has seen its influence upon theengramic chain and the awake life of the adult, no question will remain in hismind concerning the actuality of the experience. That the foetus does record is attributableto a phenomenon of the extension of perceptions during moments of pain and the absence of theanalytical mind.Laboratory experiment demonstrates that under hypnosis an individual’s sensoryperception may be artificially extended.The existence of pain in any large degree is sufficient to extend the hearing of the foetusso that it records, during the existence of pain and the presence of exterior sound, the entire andcomplete record of the experience. As a chronic engram is but precariously fixed on the mind, thesyllables or voice timbres contained in the prenatal will reactivate the somatic and the emotionalengramic content whenever the approximations of that engram appear in the child’s (or theadult’s) vicinity.The understanding of language is not necessary to reactivate an engram since therecording of the brain is so precise that the utterance of the identical words in similar tones duringlater prenatal periods or during birth, or immediately after birth, can and may occasion the originalprenatal or any of the prenatals to become reactive, producing locks, injuring the health of theinfant or, for that matter, of the foetus.The perceptics of the foetus are extended only during moments of pain. But a chain ofprenatal engrams can occasion a condition wherein the hearing of the foetus is chronicallyextended, forming numerous locks before birth. These locks will vanish when the actual engramsare discovered and exhausted from the psyched.Any painful unanalytical moment containing antagonism is not only a matter of record buta source of potential action in the human organism at any period during its lifetime, reserving, ofcourse, the question of when the foetus first begins to record.Birth is ordinarily a severely painful unconscious experience. It is ordinarily an engramof some magnitude. Anyone who has been born then possesses at least one engram. Any periodof absence of analytical power during receipt of physical pain has some engramic potentiality.15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Moments when the analytical power is present in some quantity, when physical pain isabsent and only antagonism to the organism is present do not form engrams and are notresponsible for the aberration of the individual.Sociological maladjustments; parental punishments of a minor sort, even when theyinclude pain; libidos; childhood struggles and jealousies are not capable of aberrating theindividual. These can influence the personality and environmental adjustment of the individual butso long as he is not pathologically incompetent, he can and will resolve these problems andremain without aberration.The human mind is an enormously powerful organism and its analytical ability is great. Itis not overlaid above naturally unsocial or evil desires, but is founded upon powerful andconstructive basics which only powerful, painful and antagonistic experiences can impede.Engrams will be found to have been conceived by the individual as intensely antagonistic to thesurvival of the organism.The discovery of the basic engram is the first problem of the auditor. It normally resultsin an engramic chain. The content of that chain will be found to be physically severe.An engram is physically painful, is conceived by the organism as an antagonistic threat toits survival, and is received during the absence of the analytical power of the mind. These factorsmay vary within the engram so that an engram may be of minimal pain, maximal antagonism andminimal absence of the analytical power.NOTE: ONE HAS AS MUCH FUNCTIONING ANALYZER AS ONE HASAWARENESS OF NOW.The body is to some degree reliving the experience of the engram whenever theexperience is restimulated. A chronic psychosomatic, such as a painful arm, indicates the chronic,continuous coexistence with NOW of the moment the arm was broken or hurt. Several engramsreactivated into a chronic state bring several moments of unconsciousness, pain, and antagonisminto a coexistence with NOW. The engram is a bundle of perceptics which include, as the primarymanifestation, organic sensation. The organic sensation is enforced on the members of the bodyto a greater or lesser degree whenever, and as long as, the engram is restimulated. There is onlyone psychosomatic command which is common to all engrams. Any engram contains this as partof the command it will enforce upon the body. As a stomach may be made to ache chronically(ulcers), to feel broken, the engram also enforces a command upon the organ of the analyticalmind. That command is common to every engram. Engrams are valid only when they are receivedduring a momentary dispersal or shocked, null condition of the analytical mind. Every engramcontains and enforces the command on the analytical mind that it has been dispersed and is notoperating. This is common to every engram. This is reduction of the intellect by engrams totallyaside from specific engramic content. It explains at once insanity and also the remarkable mentalfacility of a cleared or released individual.16"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":".c.ABERRATIONSAll aberrations of any kind are of precisely the same nature (as covered in the lastchapter). It is the content of the engram which causes the aberration and forms its nature.Complexity amongst engramic contents may demonstrate a most complex aberration.The various commands contained in the engrams, reactivating and modifying the basicdynamic command of the mind, produce abnormal characteristics in the behavior of the analyticalmind, which are chronic or sporadic as the engrams occasioning them are restimulated. An entireconcept of existence may be built from engramic content. Conflicts in the commands contained inengrams and conflicts between the basic drive and the engramic contents combine into behaviorpatterns.When the organism has become so impeded that it can no longer influence or commandits environment, it can be considered to be insane in that environment. Change of environmentmay relieve the condition or, more certainly, the exhaustion of the content of the reactive mindwill restore the ability of the analytical mind to solve the problems with which it is confronted.Whatever the engramic content of the reactive mind and its potential influence upon thebehavior of the individual, it does not necessarily follow that the reactive mind need be chronicallyrestimulated. However, when the reactive mind has been restimulated consistently, the analyticalmind, called upon to solve the problems around and through antagonistic and incorrect data, maybe unable to perform its task. In the absence of disease or injury, any mind not in a physiologicalamnesia state may be restored to normal function by the removal of the reactive mind. It should benoted however that this is modified by the fact that people who have received insulin shocks,prefrontal lobotomies, electric shocks and other treatments are regarded as equivocal and aretemporarily classed with disease cases for lack of adequate observation in this stage of theexperimental research.People can be regarded as rational or irrational only insofar as they react in theircustomary environment. But any person in possession of a reactive mind is an unknown quantityuntil that reactive mind has been examined.There are several factors contained in the engrams in the reactive mind which mostcertainly tend toward aberration. These include engramic commands which derange the time senseof the individual and thus apparently destroy his time track and engrams which containrestimulators of such timelessness and such perceptic content remain thereafter continually withthe individual and seem to arrest him or regress him in time. Engrams containing commandswhich make the individual chronically unable to conceive differences are especially harmful sincethese tend to compare everything to engramic value and thus cause the individual to arrive at achronic state of engramic thinking.The mind resolves problems related to survival, utilizing its ability to conceive similaritiesand observe differences.Engrams which destroy or tend to hold in suspension the analytical mind’s ability toconceive associations most influence the apparent intelligence of the mind. But engrams whichtend, by their command content, to destroy the mind’s ability to conceive differences may producesevere aberration.EXAMPLE: “All men are alike,” received as powerful engramic content would tend tocompare and associate every man with those men contained in the reactive mind as painful anddangerous.17"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"An aberration may attain any form of complexion. As a rough analogy: a compulsion maybe conceived to be an engramic command that the organism must do something; a repression is acommand that the organism must not do something; a neurosis is an emotional state containingconflicts and emotional data inhibiting the abilities or welfare of the individual; and a psychosis isa conflict of commands which seriously reduce the individual’s ability to solve his problems in hisenvironment to a point where he cannot adjust some vital phase of his environmental needs.All this variety of manifestation of aberration is occasioned by the pain-enforcedcommands or contents of engrams.Physical aberrations are occasioned by engrams when they are not the result of injury ordisease; even. then, the aspect may be improved by the exhaustion of the reactive mind of the sickindividual. The engram cannot manifest itself as a mental aberration without also manifesting itselfto some degree as somatic aberration. Removal of the somatic content of engrams which is alsonecessary to obtain any other relief, can and does occasion glandular readjustment, cellularinhibition and other physiological corrections.18"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":".c.THE TONE SCALEThe tone scale denotes numerically, first the status of an engram in the reactive mind,next its erasure or reduction, and provides a measure for sanity in an individual.The derivation of this scale is clinical and is based upon observation of engrams beingworked. When an engram is located and developed, the extreme range it can follow begins withapathy, develops into anger (or the various facets of antagonism), proceeds into boredom, andarrives at last in cheerfulness or vanishes utterly.The tone scale is essentially an assignation of numerical value by which individuals canbe numerically classified. It is not arbitrary but will be found to approximate some actualgoverning law in nature.Zero is equivalent to death. An individual with a zero tone would be dead.Ranging upwards from zero to one then is that emotional bracket which may be denotedas apathy along its graduated scale from death to the beginnings of apathetic resentment.From one to two is the range of antagonism, including suspicion, resentment, and anger.Boredom and its equivalents, by which is denoted minor annoyance, begin at two andend at three.From three to four are the emotions which range from carelessness to cheerfulness.The term tone four denotes a person who has achieved rationality and cheerfulness.Each engram residual in the reactive mind has its own independent tonal value. Seriousengrams will be found in the apathy range. Dangerous engrams will be found in the anger range.Above two point five an engram could not be considered to have any great power to affect theanalytical mind. Each engram in the reactive mind then can be said to possess a tone value. Thecomposite sum of these engrams will give, if added, a numerical value to the reactive mind.Engrams can be computed as they lie along the dynamics, and to each dynamic may beassigned a tone. The sum of the tones of the dynamics, divided by the number of the dynamics,will give a potential numerical value for an individual. This, of course, is variable depending onthe existence of restimulators in his environment to reactivate the engrams.The probable average of mankind at this writing may be in the vicinity of 3.0. Completerationality depends upon exhaustion of the reactive mind and complete rationality is invariably theresult of reaching tone four.The initial diagnosis is done by the assignation of a general tone to denote the conditionof an individual’s reactlve mind. His methods of meeting life, his emotional reaction to theproblems in his environment, can be evaluated by the use of the tone scale.In auditing, as will be covered later, an engram normally can be expected to run from itsinitial value in the apathy or anger range to tone four. Very shortly after it reaches tone four itshould vanish. If it vanishes without attaining the laughter of tone four it can be assumed that theindividual’s basic engram has not been erased.The tone scale has value in auditing and should be thoroughly understood.19"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":".c.THE CHARACTER OF ENGRAMSThere are several general types of engrams. It must be understood that the mindpossesses a time track of one sort or another and that this track is a specific thing. The time trackof an individual will include all those things available to his analytical mind when in a light tranceor during regression. However, a person can be regressed and the data which he can easilycontact along his time track is definitely not engramic even if it possesses an emotional charge.Everything on this track will be rational or justified experience. It will not include engrams. It mayinclude locks—which is to say that it may include moments of mental anguish or antagonism andmay even include instants of unconsciousness which have some slight engramic command value.An engram has several specific, positive characteristics. It is received by the individual atsome moment of physical pain. It is not available to the analyzer and it includes conceived oractual antagonism to the survival of the organism. Certain mechanics such as “forget it” mayswerve a minimumly painful or unconscious experience off the time track. In that case it becomespossessed of engramic command value.All engrams with power to derange the analytical mind and aberrate the physical body lieoff the time track and are not available to the analytical mind.By reason of its disorganization during the moment the engram was received, or becauseit has been forcibly instructed that the data in the engram is not to be recalled, the analyzer cannotreach the engram by ordinary means because the data has been erroneously labelled “dangerous,”“important,” or “too painful to touch.” The engram then, by a bypass circuit, feeds hiddencommands into the analyzer. By a direct instantaneous circuit it is permanently connected to themotor controls, all perceptic channels, the glands, and heart. It is awaiting a moment of lowgeneral tone, weariness, or injury when the analytical mind has reduced powers. It is alsoawaiting the perception of one or more of the engram’s restimulators in the environment of theorganism.Continuous restimulation of the engrams can, in itself, cause a low general tone which inits turn permits more engrams to become restimulated. As the reactive mind comes into a more orless completely chronic state of restimulation, the individual becomes more and more governed bythis mind. His thought becomes more and more engramic and he can be seen to drop in generaltone on the tone scale down to the break point which may be arbitrarily placed somewherebetween 2 and 2.5 and below which lies the region of insanity.Engramic thought is irrational identity-thought by which the mind is made to conceiveidentities where only vague similarities may exist. It is necessary that the auditor thoroughlyunderstand engramic thought, for it is with this complete irrationality of identity that he willbasically deal. As he works with any preclear. he must continually employ in the bulk of hiscomputation on the case the equation of engramic thinking.Engramic thinking can be stated by: A equals A equals A equals A equals A.The engram, when one or more of its restimulators is perceived in the environmentduring a moment of low general tone, may dramatize. The dramatization is the precise content ofthe engram. The aberration is the precise content of the engram. The reaction of an individual’sanalytical mind when an engram is reactivated is justification.There is reason to believe that part of this survival mechanism consists of the axiom: Theanalyzer must never permit an incorrect solution. The engram brings about many incorrect20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"solutions. The analyzer may very well become entirely involved with the attempt to discover anddeliver to a society, or to itself, adequate rational reasons for the behavior of the organism.The analytical mind, though working from the command of the engram itself, is unawareof the source of the command. Not being able to discover the source,it introverts more and more in an effort to solve a problem which contains danger to theorganism. The analytical mind tends to find the danger without and within the organism.There are five ways that the organism can react to a danger in its vicinity. It can attack it,avoid it, neglect it, run from it, or succumb to it. In just these ways can the analytical mind,which, it must be remembered, is possessed of self-determinism and will power, react to thereactive mind. As the general tone lowers, as the analytical mind becomes less and less powerfulthrough weariness, continual reverses in general health, etc., the more and more heed it must giveto the problems unsolved in the reactive mind. These are in essence unsolved problems. As such,they contain their own solutions. The analytical mind, unable to reach them, justifies theorganism’s reaction to them (succumbs to them), causes the organism to attempt to flee fromthem, apathetically may neglect them (as in prefrontal lobotomy), avoids them in many intricateways, or attacks them. The analytical mind is not only not certain where the experience lies on thetime track, it also does not know whether the menace is within the organism or without it. So itcan become entirely indiscriminate, and eventually it may achieve highly irrational solutions bywhich it seeks to solve the problems of the highly irrational reactive mind.The deep sensory perception channel entering the mind is evidently equipped with an“appreciator” which sorts according to the momentary general tone or potential of the analyticalmind. The higher the general tone or potential of the analytical mind the better the data in theappreciator is sorted. The appreciator circuits are evidently fully apprised of engramic content inthe reactive mind and evaluate restimulators perceived in the environment against the general toneof the analytical mind. When that is low, restimulators route more or less directly to the reactivemind which instantly responds by fixed connections into the motor controls. Commands to thevarious members, muscles, glands and organs of the body may be sporadic or constant,producing a high variety of responses in the body. Entire vocabularies are fed into the voicecircuits directly from the reactive mind when an engram is restimulated. Orders to be active orinactive are fed to other portions. The individual time track of the engram spaces the commands tothe organism and a dramatization is accomplished which may contain a portion or all of thecontent of the engram as governed by the situation. Psychosomatic ills, hysterias, rages,tantrums, criminal acts and any and all content prejudicial to the survival of the organism in whichthe organism is seen to be indulging has as its source the reactive mind.The sole and only content of the reactive mind is what exterior sources have done to theorganism.None of the content of the reactive mind is selfmotivated. The auditor is then interestedonly in what is done to the person, not what the person himself hasdone, since, for purposes of auditing, the acts of the organism in its society can bediscounted beyond diagnosis. Even then they are of small importance to the auditor.An organism possessed of an analytical mind, not victimized by incapacitating disease orinjury (and unimpeded) will commit no act knowingly prejudicial to the survival of the organismor other facets within the dynamics. It will combat only those dangers in society which are actualmenaces.21"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Whatever may be the status of the “innate moral sense,” the basic intent of the basicpersonality is to further various energy forms along the dynamics toward the goal. Only momentsof actual dispersal of the awareness of the analytical mind permit data to be received which isprejudicial to the intent of the dynamics. Only from these “unconscious” moments can thebasically stable and enormously powerful and able analytical mind be aberrated through theimplantation of unanalyzed, painfully administered, and antagonistic infommation. It is thepurpose of the auditor to find and exhaust these moments from the life of the individual. Dianeticauditing includes therefore, as its basic principle, the exhaustion of all the painfully unconsciousmoments of a subject’s life. By eradicating pain from the life of an individual, the auditor returnsthe individual to complete rationality and sanity.The auditor should never be content with merely bringing the person back to normal. Heshould achieve with the person a tone 4 even though this is far in advance of the average state ofsociety at this time. A tone 4 with his drives intact and powerful, with his rationality andintelligence increased to the optimum, becomes extremely valuable to the society, whatever hispast.Knowing this the auditor can expect a maximum result of lasting duration with anypreclear not physically hopeless.The entire purpose of the auditor is to rehabilitate the basic dynamic and the normalpurpose or profession of the individual whom he audits. Anything implanted by positivesuggestion or “education” in the course of auditing is harmful and must be cancelled if delivered.Only the basic personality of the individual can decide and evaluate things in his environment.Therefore, hypnotism as practiced with positive suggestions should be shunned since any and allhypnotic commands with the attendant forgetter mechanisms are no more than artificiallyimplanted engrams. Indeed, it is quite usual for the auditor to have to exhaust hypnotically im-planted material received either from some hypnotist or from the analytical mind itself when theperson has been operating under auto-control. Hypnotism as such does not work, and a study andshort practice in Dianetics will reveal exactly why.The auditor is attempting to delete the reactive mindfrom the individual. This reactive mind is an infestation of foreign, careless andunreasoning commands which disrupt the self-determinism of the individual to such an extent thathe no longer has charge, through his analytical mind, of the organism itself but finds himselfunder the continual and chronic orders of unseen, neverreviewed exterior forces, often andusually antipathetic to the survival of the organism.Engrams deal with identities where no identities exist. They therefore pose many strangeand irrational problems which are seen as aberrations in preclears. If a human being has beenborn, he can be supposed to have at least one engram. Anyone who has a birth which has notbeen cleared by therapy has therefore a reactive mind. There is no disgrace attached to having areactive mind since it was thrust without his consent and without his knowledge upon anunconscious and helpless individual. Sometimes this was done by persons with the best ofimaginable intentions. A person not possessed of a rational mind cannot be rationally consideredto be morally responsible, no matter the demands of the current society which hitherto lacked anymethod of determining responsibility.The pain contained in the reactive mind is normally severe. The usual parentalpunishments, family complications, reprimands, minor accidents and the battle of the individualwith his environment, influence but do not cause a reactive mind, nor do these things have thepower to change materially the reactions of an individual.22"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"In the background of any individual exist many hidden personalities contained in thereactive mind. Dealing in identities, the reactive mind often confuses identities of individuals.Therefore, irrational attachments and antipathies are formed by aberrated individuals who canoften find no reason for such attachments or antipathies in their contemporary environment.The content of an engram is literally interpreted, not as it was stated to the “unconscious”subject, but as it was received in its most literal phraseology and perception.The organism possesses many inherent mechanisms and abilities by which it can learn orpreserve or forward itself along the dynamics. Any one of them may be exaggerated by engramsto a point where it becomes an actual threat to the organism or impedes it. Engrams can and doaberrate all the sensory perceptions, any and all parts of the body, and the mind itself. Bydemanding suicide the engram can destroy the entire organism.The error of the reactive mind was introduced by the evolution of speech, for which thebasic mechanism was not designed. When all perceptics save speech formed the reactive mind, itwas to some degree serviceable. With speech came such complexities of perception and suchinterchanges of ideas that a whole series of illusions and delusions could be derived from thereactive mind’s necessity to determine identities for purposes of emergency.With speech the reactive mind came to possess far more power and extensive content.The analytical mind, being a delicate mechanism in some respects no matter how rugged andcapable in others, then could become subjected to delusions and illusions which, howevershadowy and unreal, must nevertheless be obeyed. By stripping the reactive mind of its pastpainful content the analytical mind may be placed in complete command of the organism.The moment a man or a group becomes possessed of this ability, it becomes possessed ofself-determinism. So long as these possess reactive minds, irrationalities will persist. Because itcontains literal speech, no reactive mind can be conceived to be of any value whatsoever to therational organism since the methods of that reactive mind remain intact and will continue to act topreserve the organism in times of “unconsciousness” of the analytical mind. There is no residualgood in any reactive mind. It is capable of any illusion. It has no assist power along the dynamicssave only to cancel or modify other reactive mind content. The source of the individual’s powerand purpose is not derived from the reactive mind but from the Basic Dynamic and its eightdivisions. Any auditor will establish this to his own satisfaction after he has run a very few cases.When an individual during auditing is attempting to “hold on to his aberrations,” theauditor may be assured that that person has as part of the content of the reactive mind suchphrases as, “don’t dare get rid of it,” which, identically translated, apparently applies to aber-rations. It may, in fact, apply in an engram containing an attempted abortion.The identity factor in the reactive mind may cause the analytical mind to respondirrationally in auditing and to justify the aberrations in many irrational ways. Whatever means heuses or statements he makes to avoid the exhaustion of his reactive mind is contained exactly inthe reactive mind as a positive suggestion and has no application whatsoever in rational thought.Individuality (if by that is meant a man’s desires and habits) is not traced to the reactivemind save when by individuality is meant those flagrant eccentricities which pass in Dickens forcharacters.A man is much more an individual after his reactive mind has been cleared.23"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":".c.DRAMATIZATIONDramatization is the duplication of an engramic content, entire or in part, by an aberree inhis present time environment. Aberrated conduct is entirely dramatization. Aberrated conduct willoccur only when and if an engram exists in the reactive mind of the aberree. That conduct will bea duplication of such an engram. The degree of dramatization is in direct ratio to the degree ofrestimulation of the engrams causing it. A mild dramatization would be a similarity to the engram.A severe dramatization would be an identity with the engram.The general tone of an aberree, when high—when his person is unwearied and he is welland not directly menaced in his environment—does not permit as great an influence by the reactivemind, since the tone level of the entire individual possesses too great a differential from the toneof the engram. As the general tone of the individual approaches the tone level of the engram underrestimulation, dramatization becomes more severe.The analytical mind is present to the degree that the general tone of the aberree is high. Asthis general tone lowers through ill health, reverses, or constant restimulation of the reactivemind, the analytical mind is proportionately less aware. Dramatization is demonstrated by theaberree in inverse ratio to the potential of the analytical mind. A geometrical progression is enteredas general tone lowers to cause the analytical mind to lose its entire awareness potential.Once every engram contains, as the common denominator of all engrams, theunconsciousness of the organ which is the analytical mind, dramatizations gain rapidly as thisinteraction progresses.In the presence of a relatively high analytical mind awareness-potential dramatizationtakes the form of similarity. The data of the engram is present but is interspersed with or modifedby justified thought. The physical pain which is always present as part of the dramatization isequally mild, a duplication of the pain which was present during the engram. The awarenesspotential of the analytical mind reduces in the restimulation of the engram which again reduces thegeneral tone.The aberree is subject to almost continuous dramatization of one engram or another as therestimulators appear in his vicinity. (Although the aberration may be so mild as to include onlysome chronically affected organ.) Complete dramatization is complete identity. It is the engram infull force in present time with the aberree taking one or more parts of the dramatis personaepresent in the engram. He may dramatize all the actors or merely one of them. His dramatization isidentity, is unreasoned and always entirely reactive. When the analytical mind reaches the lowpoint of awareness potential it held during the engramic incident, that point is also forced upon theaberree as a part of the dramatization. The aberree may also dramatize himself as he was at themoment of the engram’s receipt.The words, physical actions, expressions, and emotions of an aberree undergoing anidentity dramatization are those of the single or various dramatis personae present in the engram.An engram which can be dramatized may at any time in an aberree’s future be dramatizedas an identity dramatization, when and if his general tone is low and his environment becomesinfiltrated by restimulators.An aberree, because of high general tone and other factors, may not suffer therestimulation of an engram for a number of years after its receipt. A large number of engrams maybe present and undramatized in any aberree, if he has never been presented with their particularrestimulators in an optimum moment for restimulation. The common denominator of all insanity is24"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"the absence of all or almost all awareness potential in the analytical mind. Insanity can be acute orchronic. Any identity dramatization is insanity, by which is meant the entire absence of rationality.The aberree commonly and chronically dramatizes locks. The engramic content maycompel or repress the aberree whenever restimulated. An irrational person is irrational to thedegree that he dramatizes or succumbs to engramic content in his reactive mind. The computationswhich can be made on the basis of dramatization are infinite. The reactive mind thinks inidentities. Dramatizations are severe as they approach identity with the engrams which force theminto being in the conduct of the aberree. The dianeticist can profit in many ways by theseprinciples of dramatization. By examination of the rage or apathy or hysteria patterns of thepreclear, the dianeticist will find himself in possession of the exact character of the engrams forwhich he is searching.In the case of the manic, the fanatic, or the zealot an engram has entirely blocked at leastone of the purpose lines deriving from a dynamic. The engram may be called an “assist engram.”Its own surcharge (not the dynamic force) leads the individual to believe that he has a highpurpose which will permit him to escape pain. This “purpose” is a false purpose not ordinarilysympathetic with the organism, having a hectic quality derived from the pain which is part of it,even though that pain is not wittingly experienced. This “assist engram” is using the native abilityof the organism to accomplish its false “purpose” and brings about a furious and destructive efforton the part of the individual who, without this “assist engram” could have better accomplished thesame goal. The worst feature of the “assist engram” is that the effort it commands is engramicdramatization of a particular sort, and if the engram itself is restimulated the individual becomessubject to the physical pain and fear which the entire experience contained. Therefore, the falsepurpose itself is subject to sporadic “sag.” This sag becomes longer and longer in durationbetween periods of false thrust. It is easy to confuse, in casual observation, an “assist engram”and an actual, valid drive, unless one also observes the interspersed periods of “sag.” The “assistengram” may or may not occasionally accomplish something, but it does accomplish a confusionin the society that the dynamics of the individual are derived from his bad experiences. This is athing which is emphatically untrue.Inherently the individual has great will power. This however can be aberrated. Willpower or its absence occasions the attitude of the aberree toward his reactive mind.The prevention of the dramatization of an engram or a lock further reduces dynamic thrustof the aberree. Chronic prevention lowers his general tone toward the break point. Unhampereddramatization, as it contains restimulation of a physical pain and the reduced potential of theanalytical mind, produces other harmful effects.Necessity can and does render inactive the entire reactive mind. Dramatization occursmost often in the absence of necessity or when the reactive mind has obscured the presence ofnecessity.Dramatization is residual in the motor controls including speech and can be allayed by thephysical exhaustion of the individual. The organism during dramatization tends to revivify towardthe moment of the engram’s occurrence—the engram containing, as one of its identity parts, thecomplete physical condition of the organism as at the moment of laying-in of the engram.There is no folly or facet of human activity which cannot be dramatized. An immediatealleviation can be achieved when addressing an aberree who is in identity dramatization by actingupon the fact that the conditions of auditing, with no exception, already exist; i.e., the preclearreturned to the moment of occurrence. Affinity may be established and dianetic auditing begun atonce. He can be persuaded to listen for the phrases he is uttering and they can be alleviated byexhaustion on routine procedure.25"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":".c.THE AUDITOR’S CODENot because it is a pleasant thing to do or because it is a noble idea, the auditor mustalways treat a preclear in a certain definite way which can be outlined as the auditor’s code.Failure to follow this code will cause trouble to the auditor, will considerably lengthen and disturbhis work and may endanger the preclear. The auditor in the first place, at the optimum, should behimself cleared; otherwise he will find that many of his own engrams are restimulated as he listensto the engrams of his preclears. This restimulation may cause his own engrams to becomechronic, victimizing him with various allergies and delusions and causing him to be, at best,extremely uncomfortable. An auditor can audit while he himself is being cleared as this is apeculiar and special method of locating his own engrams, since they become restimulated.Becoming painful to him, they can be found and speedily removed. Even if he is not himselfcleared, the auditor must act like a Clear towards the preclear. The auditor’s code is the naturalactivity of a Clear.The auditor must act toward the preclear exactly in the way that the preclear as anorganism would desire that his own conscious analytical mind would react to and consider theorganism. An affinity must therefore be maintained at all costs.The auditor must never permit himself to lose his temper, become aggravated, to scold orbadger or antagonize the preclear in any way. To do so would not merely disturb the comfort ofthe preclear but might additionally derange him and might even prohibit further beneficial therapyby the auditor.The code is nearly “Christlike.”The auditor must be confident in that he must continually reassure the preclear whenrestimulated engrams cause despondency on the preclear’s part. A cheerful optimistic presenceencourages the preclear through his most painful experiences.The auditor must be courageous, never permitting himself to be intimidated by either theaggression or hostility of the preclear.The auditor must be kind, never indulging in hostilities or personal prejudices. Theauditor must be trustworthy, never betraying or capriciously denying a preclear and above allnever breaking his word to the preclear. An auditor must be clean, for personal odors or badbreath may be restimulators to the preclear or may disturb him. The auditor must take care not tooffend the concepts or sensibilities of the preclear.The auditor must be persistent, never permitting the case of the preclear to either resisthim or to remain unsolved until it is in a proper tone four, since the restimulation of engrams is amalady unto itself unless they are being properly exhausted.The auditor must be patient, never hurrying or harassing the preclear beyond the needs ofstirring an engram into view. He must be willing to work at any and all times necessary and forthe length of time necessary to exhaust the engrams in process of elimination.In addition to these things it may be remarked that a definite affinity is establishedbetween the auditor and preclear during the auditing. In the case of opposite sexes this affinitymay amount to an infatuation. The auditor must remain aware of this and know that he can andshould redirect the infatuation to some person or activity other than himself when auditing is at anend. Not to do so is to produce an eventual situation wherein the preclear may have to be rebuffedwith consequent trouble for the auditor.26"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":".c.AUDITINGThe auditing technique consists of assisting the preclear’s analytical mind or some part ofit with the auditor’s analytical mind. The auditor then functions during each successive period ofauditing, and only during the periods themselves, as an extra analytical mind of the preclear.The reactive mind was received during the dispersal or inactivity of the analytical mind.The reactive mind is removed by “returning” the preclear to the engram, and laying its contentsbefore the scrutiny of the analytical mind.This technique may be considered the lowest common denominator of a number oftechniques. Anything which will serve this purpose and permit auditing to be accomplishedefficiently is valid technique.The optimum is purely personal affinity brought about by understanding andcommunication with the preclear on agreeable subjects. Another and almost useless method isnarcosynthesis together with the vanous drugs and hypnotics used to produce sleep. Methods canbe found such as faith healing, books onmedical hypnosis, the techniques of Indian medicine men and so forth. It is pointless todelineate these methods here. They are currently available under the name of hypnotism but acaution should be enjoined that hypnosis as itself is not at all acceptable to Dianetics and indeedhas extremely limited use. Briefly, however, it must be remarked that if hypnotism is studied toadvance these techniques, all positive suggestion and post-hypnotic suggestion must be avoidedas these suggestions depend for their effectiveness upon the already existing content of thereactive mind and will only form additional locks.Any and all so-called hypnotic drugs have definite drawbacks since they, like so manyother things, may be termed “shot-gun” methods. These paralyze not only the analytical mind butthe remainder of the organism so that it is nearly impossible to obtain the proper somatic reactionin the preclear. They are not anesthetics but anesthesias. By using them the auditor instantlydenies himself the main material which will lead him to the engram, which is to say, restimulatedphysical pain. Such restimulated pain is never of very great magnitude and is obliterated by theuse of anesthesias.At no time should the auditor permit the preclear to be under the delusion that he is beinghypnotized. This is mentioned because hypnotism is a current fad and the principles of Dianeticshave nothing whatever to do with hypnotism. Both are based upon simple natural laws but havebetween them an enormous gulf. One is the tool of the charlatan and the other is the science of thehuman mind.Regression in its simplest form, hereafter called return, is employed in dianeticauditing.l7 It would be an extraordinary case which required revivification. Return is the methodof retaining the body and the awareness of the subject in present time while he is told to go backto a certain incident. Dates are not mentioned. His size is not mentioned. Various means are usedto restimulate his memory. Any of the perceptics may be employed to return him to some periodof his past. He is told simply to “go back to the time when— — —.” He is asked to recount whathe can of the incident. He is told that he is “right there” and that he can “recall this.” Little else issaid by the auditor save those hints necessary to return the preclear to the proper time.The preclear is not allowed at any moment to revivify in that period since the data isdrained as a surcharge from his time track to present time. He is told that he can remember this inpresent time since that will occasion the somatics to return to present time. Most of the data is27"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"located by observing some somatic pain in the individual or some somatic aberration and seekingto discover wherein it was received.The somatics are employed primarily because the motor controls possess a less disturbedtime track than the sensory strip. Anything which tends to lighten these somatics is thenantipathetic to auditing. It must be remembered that there is no aberration without anaccompanying somatic. The somatics alone, being physical ills of one sort or another, hold theaberrated content of the reactive mind in place. The motor controls can be returned to a periodalthough the conscious or analytical mind believes itself to be entirely in present time. By talkingto the muscles or motor controls or various bodily aches and pains, the auditor can shift them atwill up and down their time track. This time track is not connected to the analytical mind andspeech, but is apparently a parallel time track with greater reliability than the sensory track. Theprecision of data contained in the motor control time track is enormous. Muscles can be made totense or relax. Coughs, aches, and pains can be made to come and go simply by uttering the rightwords for the engrams, or the wrong words.It is the primary task of the auditor to cause the time tracks of the motor strip and thesensory strip to come into parallel. That the time track exists in the strips has not been proven butthey can so be considered for the purposes of this explanation. That they exist is extremelyapparent. The motor strip time track can be asked questions down to the smallest moment of time,and the area of an engram can be so located and its character determined.As an analogy, a dream may be considered as the reception by the remaining analyticalmind of a distortedly reflected and indirectly received picture of the engrams. This applies onlywhen the dream is specifically directed at the reactive mind. It will be found that a preclear with alarge and active reactive mind does not dream to any great extent in normal sleep but that a releasemay dream pleasantly and consistently. A dream in its normal function is that powerful andoriginal mechanism called the imagination compositing or creating new pictures.The use of the dream is not highly technical and has little value in Dianetics. The auditorgleans data from the preclear by his own remarks about any subject, or by the preclear’sillogicalness on a subject. The auditor tells the preclear to dream about this data. When thepreclear has had the dream he is directed to go back to the engram causing the dream. Quite oftenhe will do so. If he does not, or if he becomes hostile, it is certain that an engram exists on thesubject.The lie detector, the encephalograph and many other means are of limited usefulness indetermining both the character and the extent of the engrams since into these as into the dreamscan be fed the restimulators of the preclear. A codified restimulator list can be created which willbe found to be common to most preclears. It should include all types of illnesses, accidents, thecommon trite phrases of the society, and names of various persons who commonly surround achild during his childhood. Such a codified restimulator list would be interesting for experimentand every auditor can compose his own. These are best composed after auditing the individualpreclear and after inquiry into his life to determine the various irrationalities of thought.In that engrams are identity thought, the remarks of the preclear about his engrams will befound to be included in the content of those engrams. When the preclear is asked to imagine a badsituation at certain ages and under hypnotic conditions, he will very often deliver up a completeengram. The auditor must realize that every remark that a preclear makes while he is going overhis reactive mind is probably some part of the content of that reactive mind. That mind is literal.The words the preclear uses when referring to it must be literally evaluated.28"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":".c.DIAGNOSISIt is a useful and positive principle that whatever confronts or contests the analytical mindof the preclear will also confront and contest the analytical mind of the auditor. When the auditoris acting as the analytical mind of the preclear. whatever emotion or antagonism is directedtowards him is the emotion or antagonism which is directed by the reactive mind toward thepreclear’s own analytical mind. If a preclear cannot hear what people are saying in his engrams,he has another engram about “can’t hear.” If he cannot feel anything in his engram, it is becausehe has an engram about “can’t feel.” If he cannot see, he has an engram about not being able tosee, and so forth. If he cannot return, he has an engram about going back, or returning tochildhood, or some such thing. If he is doubtful and skeptical about what is happening or whathas happened to him, it is because he has an engram about being doubtful and skeptical. If he isantagonistic, his reactive mind contains a great deal of antagonism. If he is self-conscious orembarrassed, it is because his reactive mind contains self-consciousness or embarrassment. If heinsists on maintaining his own control, refusing to do what the auditor tells him to do (althoughhe is returned), it is because he has an engram about self-control, and so forth and so on. This isidentity thought, and is used in diagnosis.The return is the best method of learning the problems of the preclear. Trying to work thepreclear into remembrance, hearing, seeing, feeling, going back and forward, going to sleep,awakening, and taking due notice of what he says about the entire process will form a rathercomplete diagnosis on one who is not insane. Questioning the preclear as to what is wrong withhim while returned will elicit replies straight out of his principal engrams. Listening to an endlessjustification of his actions is both a delay and a waste of time but listening to what he has to sayabout what he thinks has happened to him or what he is afraid of is of definite value.The insane form and pose a slightly different problem but essentially the same.It is a clinically established observation that the reactive mind is relatively shallow. Belowit lies the basic personality of the individual no matter how “insane” he may be. Therefore, by onemeans or another, a rational being may be reached within a person, a being which is notaberrated. It is this fact of non-aberration which makes the basic personality a difficult aid indiagnosis. Here however it can be established what the person really wants, what he hopes, whathe actually feels. It has been observed that no matter what his raving state, providing his brainstructure is normal and complete, the basic personality is entirely sound and sane and willcooperate. After auditing the person will become this strong, competent and able personality.The reactive mind, when unable to exert itself to its aberrated full in the environment ofthe person, will break the person, or cause him to lose tone. Therefore it is of definite interest todiscover what immediately preceded the break of the preclear or what is currently causing himunhappiness. Something is dispersing his dynamics. The probability is that he has a chronicrestimulator in his vicinity. Wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, superiors, etc., can be the sourceof such breaking since they turn the purpose of the reactive mind, which pretends to desire aboveall else the best interest of the person, back upon the person himself. Thus these sources cause theindividual to lower back into the tone of the reactive mind, apathy, or a low tone two.The problem of the fixed person and the problem of the sympathy engram are both visiblein the aberrated individual. The identity thought of the reactive mind has taken some part of thepersonality of some individual in the current environment and referred it to some part of thepersonality of an individual in the engramic past. The discovery of this identity is one of theprincipal problems in auditing. The sympathy engram is of a very specific nature, being the effortof the parent or guardian to be kind to a child who is severely hurt. If that parent or guardian hasshown the child antagonism prior to the time of the injury, the adult (preclear) is prone to29"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"reactivate the injury in the presence of the identity personality with whom he is now associated.This causes many somatic ills to present themselves in the present. Only the exact words of asympathy engram will soothe the aberrated personality.There are not many personality types. A human being learns through mimicry. If his ownself is found to be too painful he can become another self and very often does. A tone four canbecome another person at will without being aberrated about it, thus enjoying books and plays by“being” the person portrayed. But an aberrated individual can become part of the engramic cast ofhis reactive mind and so solve all of his problems in such an aberrated fashion. Aberrated personsare not themselves since they do not possess their own determinism.As has been stated, those emotions, doubts, worries and problems which confront theauditor when attempting to place the preclear in reverie or to work him in that reverie will lead theauditor into the basic content of the reactive mind.There are certain definite manifestations which can be suspected and certain routineswhich follow every case. Every human being has been carried in the womb and every humanbeing has been born. The discovery of the basic engram on each chain is extremely important.Finding the basic engram is like taking the enemy in the flank. There is nothing before it,therefore the end most remote from the adult life of the individual is the end most exposed for theattack of the auditor.In the basic engram the preclear can see, feel, hear, and freely emote. When he isreturned to later incidents, it may be found that he cannot do these things no matter how hard theauditor works to enable him to do so. By pursuing the engramic chain up its chronologicalsequence, this ability will be restored. Therefore it is necessary first and foremost to locate thebasic engram. This may, in some few cases, lie later than birth. In the majority of the cases it willbe found to lie at or before birth. No discussion is here entered about the ability of the humanmind to remember at such remote periods. It can be stated however that when engramic data doesexist, the time track is opened by pain and antagonism at these extreme points and can becontacted and exhausted. It is with the greatest difficulty that the auditor will find the basicengram. It is ordinarily quite painful, and since the scanning mechanism has as its purpose (orone of its purposes) the avoidance of pain, it will not easily reach them. Like the scanningmechanism on a cathode ray tube, the scanners of even a very reduced potential analytical mindsweep over, skipping and not touching the data on the engramic chain. By various means theauditor must then require the scanners to contact that data and force the data back onto the timetrack where it can be properly exhausted.Light prenatals are the best possible approach to a case. When the only prenatal is anextremely heavy one or an attempted abortion (which, by the way, are very common), the auditormust use a great deal of guile. It can be said that the basic engram and the beginning of the actualengram chains is very early, before, near, or during birth, is painful, and will not be easilycontacted. In that few preclears have more than a few hundred serious engrams, the task is lightwhen once begun but requires a great deal of imagination and persuasion.A prenatal must always be suspected unless birth, when lifted, rises easily into a tonefour. If none of the engrams will rise into a tone four, the auditor would suppose that he has notdiscovered the basic. There are three kinds of engrams: the precursor, the engram and thefollower. By engram here is meant that experience which the auditor has found and is workingupon. If it does not seem to be lifting after a few recountings, a precursor (earlier engram) mustbe suspected and returned to. In this way an earlier basic may be discovered. Blows in the womb,attempted abortions, and birth are the usual basics. Easily the most important are the prenatals.30"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"When a child is abnormally afraid of the dark, he probably has a severe engramicexperience in prenatal. This prenatal experience will include all the sound data and sensory data ofthe incident. It is idiotic and identical. The preclear will have somatics. These on the first fewrecountings will be ordinarily faint and then become more severe as more data is located. The datawill finally be in a more or less complete state and the engram will begin to lift, rising up throughthe various tones. All prenatals are apathy experiences and are therefore serious. Minor taps anddiscomforts in the womb are of no consequence. A true engram will consist of such a thing as aknitting needle being rammed through the foetus, half of the foetus’ head being badly injured,blows of various kinds bringing about foetal unconsciousness and so forth. Return eventuallywill find an opening into any period when there has been pain.Disbeliefs and antagonisms from the preclear on the subject of such a thing as anattempted abortion should be overlooked by the auditor or taken into account as the sign of anexisting engram. A case is recalled wherein a girl insisted that if an abortion had ever beenattempted on her it should have been successful. Through several sessions, while an attempt wasmade to lift birth, she continued this assertion until the auditor realized that this was probably aremark made by the abortionist (or the mother) when his efforts failed. As soon as this wassuggested to the girl she was able to contact the actual incident. A chronic apathy case undertreatment for some years in an institution, she suddenly responded to auditing, brought theabortion to tone four, erased birth to tone four and recovered mentally and physically into a socialasset well above normal.The auditor should continue to suspect prenatals as long as he cannot get later engramseasily into tone four. Once an engramic chain has been lifted at its end nearest to conception, thepreclear should begin to release relatively automatically, aided but little by the auditor. The erasureshould be in terms of laughter at its optimum. This laughter is the reversing of charges residual inthe locks which depended for their fear content or antagonistic content upon the basic engrams.Abortion attempts are easy to recognize when an auditor has had some experience. Theparent who attempted the abortion will, after the child’s birth, likely be a source of anxiety to theindividual who seems to require a great deal of affection and attraction from that parent. Theindividual will be found to be most fond of the parent (or other) who did not aid, or who actuallytried to prevent the abortion attempt. At this time abortion attempts are extremely common. Whenan abortion attempt has been lifted, the engramic chain should easily be brought to the time trackand exhausted.Auditing is essentially very simple but it demands precise understanding of the principlesinvolved and imagination and sympathy on the part of the auditor. He must learn to computeengramically—or learn to think with his analytical mind, only for the purposes of auditing others,engramically. His biggest problem is the discovery of the basic of basics. It may elude him for aconsiderable period of time.There is, however, preparatory work to do in a case other than the discovery of the basic.Occasionally an entire time track must be rehabilitated in which “do not remember” and “can’tremember” have obscured the track. Later locks can be found and exhausted in the same mannerthat engrams are exhausted, and rapid scanning methods may be developed in the future for these.The hysteria or fear of the individual can be momentarily allayed one way or the other and theproblem of reaching the basic can be entered upon. There are as many types of case as there arecases, but these are the primary fundamentals.An auditor must think his way through every case, taking as his data the constantlyreiterated statements of the preclear during auditing, and accumulating experience as to howincidents can be thrust off the time track, burying them from sight by the analytical mind, thusforming a reactive mind to the detriment of the organism.31"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":".c.EXHAUSTION OF ENGRAMSThe technique of exhausting an engram is not complicated but it must be adhered to. Anengram is an unconscious moment containing physical pain and conceived or actual antagonism tothe organism. Therefore, that engram before it is discovered will exhibit antagonism toward theauditor trying to discover it. When it is first discovered, it may be found to be lacking in itsessential data. There are many techniques by which this data can be developed. In a prenatalengram the analytical mind apparently must redevelop the situation. Many returns through theincident are therefore necessary.When an engram will not exhaust, the first thing the auditor should suspect is an earlierengram. It is actually possible for a later one to contain essential information which will not permitthe information to rise. In the course of auditing, when an engram is restimulated by the auditorbut will not rise above apathy and does not seem to contain all the necessary data, the auditor mustlook for an earlier engram, and it almost inevitably will be found to exist. This precursor is thendeveloped as the basic engram. If it follows the same behavior pattern of not lifting or becomingcomplete, another previous to it must be discovered. If at last the auditor is entirely certain thatthere is no engram ahead of the one being run, some possible locking mechanism later on may befound and exhausted, at which time the basic may show itself. Continual application of energy tothe basic will at length bring it into full view and continual recounting of it will gradually developit, raise its tone and lift it into tone four.The principle of recounting is very simple. The preclear is merely told to go back to thebeginning and to tell it all over again. He does this many times. As he does it the engram shouldlift in tone on each recounting. It may lose some of its data and gain other. If the preclear isrecounting in the same words time after time, it is certain that he is playing a memory record ofwhat he has told you before. He must then be sent immediately back to the actual engram and thesomatics of it restimulated. He will then be found to somewhat vary his story. He must bereturned to the consciousness of somatics continually until these are fully developed, begin tolighten and are then gone. Tone four will appear shortly afterwards. If the preclear is bored withthe incident and refuses to go on with it, there is either an earlier engram or there is other data inthe engram which has not been located.The auditor will discover that occasionally an engram when lifted into a three, or evenerased, without reaching laughter, will sag. This is a certain sign of an earlier basic on that chain.Any kind of sag from a tone four is impossible if tone four has truly been reached.Tone four will not be reached if there are earlier basics. The engram may vanish and beerased, but there will be no cheerfulness or laughter about it at the end if it is not the basic.Once the basic has been reached and brought into tone four, it will disappear. The nextengram on the chain will be located and rather easily brought into tone four. If one is accidentallyskipped, the third in line will be found to hold or sag. The intermediate must then be located andbrought into a tone four. In such a way the chain will gradually come up into a complete tonefour. At this time the locks, the merely mentally painful incidents in the person’s life, will begin torelease automatically. These will erase or lift without any attention from the auditor. While theseare releasing, the auditor must concern himself with secondary engrarns. These would beengrams on their own if they had not had forerunners. They therefore do not relieve after theremoval of the basic but must be located as themselves. These in turn will start a chain ofreleasing locks which again need no attention. There may be entirely distinct engramic chains inthe reactive mind which are not appended in any way to the original basic.32"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"So long as a preclear retains any part of a reactive mind, he will be interested in himself(in the condition of his mind) and be introverted. Therefore, so long as he is interested in his ownreactive mind, he is impeded in his dynamic pursuit of survival. A guarantee of a tone four is thepatient’s interest in positive action along his dynamics, and his application of himself to the worldaround him. Introversion is not natural nor is it necessary to the creation of anything. It is amanifestation of the analytical mind trying to solve problems on improper data, and observing theorganism being engaged in activities which are not conducive to survival along the dynamics.When a Clear has been reached, the basic personality and self-determinism of the individual willhave asserted itself. No chronic somatics in the present will remain (excepting those which can beaccounted for by actual disease, injury or malconstruction of the brain).Though more germane to Child Dianetics, it is of help to the auditor to know that a childcan be considered to have formed his general basic purpose in life somewhere around the age oftwo. This purpose is fairly reliable, as at that time his engrams have probably not gained muchforce over him since his responsibilities are slight. He will have tried to hold his main purposethroughout his life but it will undoubtedly have been warped both by his reactive mind’sexperience content and by his environment. The time when the purpose is formed varies and mayindeed never have been manifested, as in the case of amentia. As the preclear is normallyinterested in this purpose and its rehabilitation, he will often take a more intense interest inauditing if there is an attempt made to discover it. This purpose is quite valid and the preclear canbe expected to rehabilitate his life along its dictates unless he is too oppressed by his environment.(It can be remarked that a Release or Clear will ordinarily order or change his environment. )Vocational therapies have as their source the tenet of the rehabilitation of the generalpurpose of an individual or the establishment of a false purpose in order to allay the activity of hisreactive mind. It has little bearing on Dianetics, but an auditor, for the term of auditing mayengage his preclear along the purpose line of becoming a Clear. This is not necessary and isindeed often automatic since the basic personality beholds at last a chance to manifest itself.However, it will occasionally aid the auditor.The auditor should be prepared to have to solve many individual problems since abovethe basics are almost as many problems as there are cases. For example, in the case of a preclearwho has several very nasty prenatals it will be found that the formation of the body in the wombhas overlaid or confused the time track so that a later prenatal must be partially lifted before anearlier prenatal can be exhausted. This is often true of a later period of life. In one case an entireseries of prenatals was held down by a dental operation under nitrous oxide at the age oftwenty-five. Until some portion of this was removed, the bulk of the prenatals were not available.In short, the circuits of the mind can become entangled to a point where even the motor controltime track is confused.Dispersal of purpose by some engram along some dynamic or purpose line is a commonsituation and is indeed the basic concept. As a stream of electrons would behave if they were toencounter a solid object in their path, so does a drive or purpose disperse. These many varied andfaint tracks after impact with the engram are symptomatic. Along dynamic two, the sexual drive,promiscuity inevitably and invariably indicates a sexual engram of great magnitude. Once thatengram is removed promiscuity can be expected to cease.Anxiety is established in the preclear’s mind by such dispersals and he dramatizesbecause of the dispersal. This is one of the manifestations of his malady. No pervert ever becamea pervert without having been educated or abused by a pervert. And that abuse must have beenvery thorough. The contagion of engrams is an interesting manifestation which the auditor shouldand must observe. It can be said that insanity runs in families, not because this is a eugenic truthbut because a standard patter during emergencies or stress creates certain types of engrams whichin turn create types of insanities. Insanities are so definitely contagious that when a child is raised33"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"by aberrated parents, the child becomes aberrated. As would be delineated by Child Dianetics, thebest way to guarantee a sane child is to provide it with cleared or released parents. This is ofdefinite interest to the auditor since he will discover that in cases of severe prenatals and birth theengrams were also received by the mother exactly as they were received by the child. The childwill thereafter be a restimulator to the mother and the mother a restimulator to the child for thesevere incidents. The mother, having received the exact wording of the engram, also contains theengram. Restimulation by the child will occasion the use of the engramic language toward thechild. This brings the infant and child and adolescent into the unhappy situation of having hisbirth engram or his prenatal engrams continually restimulated. This occasions dire results andvery great unhappiness in the home and is one of the main sources of family difficulties.A child, even if he despises them, will dramatize the actions of his parents when hehimself is married and when he himself has children. In addition to this the other partner in themarriage also has his or her own engrams. Their engrams combine into doubled engrams in thechildren. The result of this is a contagion and a progression of aberration. Thus any society whichdoes not have a high purpose finds itself declining and gaining greater numbers of insane. Thecontagion of aberration is at work progressively, and the children become progressively aberrateduntil at last the society itself is aberrated.While the fate of society belongs definitely in Social and Political Dianetics, the auditor isinterested in the fact that he can take the prenatal and birth content of the engrams of his preclearand run them to discover post-birth locks and secondary engrams. The mother will normally haveused much the same data whenever the troubles of the child impinged upon her reactive mind; thisof course accounts for the locks.The auditor will also discover that where he has a married preclear who is aberrated, heshould have two preclears, which is to say, the partner. It is useless to return a preclear to his orher aberrated spouse and expect domestic tranquility to result. While the release cannot and willnot pick up his old engrams from the spouse in whom he has implanted them, he will, never-theless, find his life made unbearable by the mere existence of a spouse that he himself may haveaberrated.Further, the children of these people will also need auditing, since they will be found (ifthe parent’s aberrations were of any magnitude) to be sickly or aberrated or deficient in someway. The auditor should therefore, when he undertakes a case, be prepared to audit the family ofhis preclear, should an investigation of that preclear make it seem necessary.Aberrations are contagious and where a person has been aberrated, his environment willto some degree also have become aberrated. The preclear may, for one thing, be somewhatvictimized and impeded by his reactive mind which is now existing in his associates.The auditor should not permit such terms as “psychoneurotic,” “crazy,” or “mentallyexhausted” to exist for long in the preclear’s mind. These are depressive and are actuallyaberrations in the society. It is true and provable that the preclear is on his way to being, not aperson who is crazy or neurotic, but an individual who will have more stability and self-commandand ability, possibly, than those around him. To be blunt: this is not the process of revivingcorpses into a semblance of life. It is a process which, at its best usage, is taking the “normal” and“average” and giving them their birthright of happiness and creative attainment in the world ofman.34"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":".c.ENGRAM CHAINSMore than one engramic chain will be found in every aberree. When this person becomesa preclear the dianeticist does well to discover the earliest chain. It is not always possible to dothis with accuracy since apreclearis sometimes in such a nervous condition that he cannot beworked on his basic chain but must be alleviated in a greater or lesser degree by the exhaustion ofa later and more available chain. This last, however, is not the usual case.The dianeticist should clearly understand certain working principles and definitions. Byan engram is meant a moment of unconsciousness accompanied by physical pain and conceivedantagonism. The basic engram is the earliest engram on an engram chain. Also there may beengrams of the same character and kind on the same drive line as the basic engram of the chain.An engram chain is composed of a basic engram and a series of similar incidents. Engram chainsalso contain locks which are instances of mental anguish more or less known to the analyticalmind. These are often mistaken by the preclear for the cause of his conduct. A true engram isunknown to the conscious computer of the preclear but underlies it as a false datum on which areerected almost equally unknown similar incidents and an enormous number of locks.In order to release an engram chain it is vital and absolutely necessary to discover thebasic of that chain. An individual will have more than one engram chain but he has a basic chain.This must be released as soon as possible after auditing is begun on the preclear.When an engram is discovered by the dianeticist, he must examine the aspect of it todetermine whether or not it is the basic. Discovering it is not, he must immediately determine anearlier basic, and so forth until he is obviously on the scene of the basic engram.There are certain tests which he can apply. A basic engram will rise to laughter, “sag”slightly, and then rise to tone four and vanish. Successive engrams will then erase from that chainwith very little work. Almost any engram on an engram chain can be exhausted, but if it is not abasic engram it will recede and vanish at times but will rise in part again when the basic engramhas been reached and the preclear is brought forward into its area.An engram not basic is subject to “sag.” Which is to say that it may be brought to the twopoint zero (2.0) tone, but after a certain length of time has elapsed— from one to two days—itwill be found to have “sagged” and to be, for instance, in a one point one (1.1) tone. It can besuccessively lifted until it is apparently in a three point zero (3.0) tone, at which point much of itscontent will disappear. This is reduction.Any engram chain can be reduced to some degree without reaching the basic but when ithas been reached the basic itself and subsequent engrams can be brought rapidly to tone fourproviding no engrams are skipped on the return up the time track.When an engram chain has been brought to tone four, it can be considered to havevanished. The preclear can no longer find it on the time track (he may even be unable to recallsome of its most painful and disheartening aspects). The mind apparently has been proofedagainst the data it has contained. A search for an engram chain after it has been exhausted and atone four has been achieved should, for purposes of auditing, be entirely fruitless.Once the basic has been discovered and the engram chain has been brought to tone fourthe locks will vanish of their own accord. If this does not occur then there is something remainingor the auditor has been too optimistic about the selection of his basic engram for the chain and hasnot, in reality, discovered it.35"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"All engram chains should be exhausted from a preclear. These may be discovered to liealong the various dynamics but any chain may influence more than one dynamic.Another type of engram is the cross engram. This is usually a childhood or adult engramwhich embraces more than one engram chain. The receipt of the cross engram, containing as itdoes the convergence of two or more engram chains, is often accompanied by a “nervousbreakdown” or the sudden insanity of an individual. A cross engram may occur in a severeaccident, in prolonged or severe illness under antagonistic circumstances, or a nitrous oxideoperation. Cross engrams are very easy to locate but should not be addressed by the dianeticist assuch since an enormous amount of work upon them will not exhaust them until the basic and thechains on which the cross engram depends have been brought to tone four.Post-battle neurasthenia is almost always traceable to the receipt of a cross engram. Thismust be, of course, an engram in its own right on more than one chain. It is conceivable that itmay be so severe that it “breaks” the individual even if it lies on only one chain.There are certain rules the dianeticist may employ to establish the basic engram of a chain.In first entering a case these rules apply as well to the first goal which is the location of the basicengram of the basic chain.Number one: No engram will lift if the basic of that chain has not been lifted.Number two: The basic engram will not lift until the basic instant of the basic engram hasbeen reached, which is to say, the first moment of the engram. Ordinarily this is the mostobscure.Number three: If after two or three test recountings of an engram it does not seem to beimproving, the auditor should attempt to discover an earlier engram.Number four: No engram is valid unless accompanied by somatic pain. This may bemild. Incidents which do not contain somatics are either not basic (the chain having beensuspended by some such command as “can’t feel” in the basic) or else it may not even be anengram.Cases should be entered as near as possible to the basic engram. Then they should bereturned to earlier incidents until the basic is discovered.The running of locks themselves may accomplish some alleviation of a case.36"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":".c.PRENATAL, BIRTH AND INFANT ENGRAMSThe human mind and the human anatomy are enormously more powerful and resilientthan has commonly been supposed. Only incidents of the greatest magnitude in physical pain andhostile content are sufficient to aberrate a mind.The ability of the mind to store data can scarcely be overrated. In early life before soundis analyzed as speech a human being receives and stores exact impressions of everything whichoccurs. At some future date, when similar perceptics are encountered, the reactive mindre-analyzes—on the basis of identities only—the content of the early mind. This becomes thefoundation of the post-conception personality. The actual personality in the individual is powerfuland very difficult to aberrate. Unlike animals which can be driven mad by minor mechanisms ofexperimental psychology, a man must be most severely handled before he begins to show anysigns of derangement. That derangement proceeds from the ability of the reactive mind to storeperceptions from the earliest moments of existence and retain them on either the analytical or thereactive plane for future reference.The basic personality does not proceed from engrams, and the dynamics of the individualare impeded not enhanced by engrams. The dynamics are entirely separate and are as native to theindividual as his basic personality, of which they are a part.Information falls into two categories: the educational or experience level, banked andavailable to the analytical mind on at least its deeper levels; and aberrational, or data stored in thereactive mind and often used but never reached by the analytical mind, save through auditing.There would seem to be two types of recording. The first is cellular recording in which the cellswould seem to store data. In that cells in procreating become themselves again—which is to saythat when cell A divides, both halves are still cell A—cellular intelligence is not lost. Personalidentity is duplicated. In the case of individual men, procreation is far more complex andindividual identity is lost—the son is not the father but a genetic composite of vast numbers ofancestors.The cells of the human being shortly after conception are capable of enormous percepticand retentive power. After a very short time in the womb, the brain and nervous system arealready operating. From then until birth the human being is apparently capable of computations ofa rather complex nature on the analytical mind level. Far more certainly he retains information onthe reactive level.Fear, pain, and unconsciousness extend the range of perception of the individual. Whenthe human being in the womb is injured his senses extend so as to record sounds outside themother’s body. He records them so well that their precise nature is stored for future reference.The human being in the womb responds exactly as it does after birth to the receipt of engrams,storing the data with precision and reacting to it.The repair facilities available to a human being before birth are greatly enhanced by thepresence of ample connective tissue, oxygen and sustenance. These repair facilities areunimaginably great so that a prenatal human being can be severely torn and ripped withoutbecoming structurally deficient. It does, however, receive engrams and these are subject torestimulation. In many cases of attempted abortions it was found that large sections of the prenatalhuman being’s brain could apparently be injured without the brain being deficient or even scarredafter birth. These repair facilities do not however lessen the extreme severity of the engramswhich can be received by the prenatal human being. The word foetus is dropped at this point andit is advised that it should be dropped from the language as a description of a pre-birth humanbeing. Insufficient evidence is at hand to make an outright declaration that attempted abortions are37"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"responsible for the bulk of our criminal and insane aberrees. But according to the cases at handthe attempted abortion must be accounted responsible for the majority.The attempted abortion is the most serious aberration producer. So exact is the recordingof the pre-birth human being that the reactive mind makes no errors in recognizing its enemiesafter birth. The mind becomes aberrated in having to depend upon these same enemies for theordinary sustenance of life while the child is a helpless infant. The diagnosis of a prenatal case isrelatively simple. Nearly all preclears will be found to have at least one prenatal engram and thecase will not solve unless that prenatal is reached and exhausted.The dianeticist can usually establish the attempted abortion preclear by an investigation ofthe conduct of the infant and child. Uneasiness or unhappiness in the home, a feeling of not beingwanted, unreasonable fear, and a strong attachment to grandparents or another non-parentalmember of the household are often signs of an attempted abortion. Fear of the dark is usually butnot always a part of the attempted abortion case. The auditor should suspect an abortion attempt inevery preclear he audits, at least for this next generation. Whether or not the preclear disbelievesthe diagnosis is of no importance to the auditor as the prenatal engrams may very well contain thewords, “Can’t believe it.” The parents themselves, as well as society, mislead the individual as tothe enormous prevalence of this practice at this time. The attempted abortion preclear may not bediscovered to be such until considerable auditing has already been done. Any auditing done on anattempted abortion preclear, unless it is solely addressed to making the case workable, is wasteduntil the attempted abortions are reached.The post-birth aberree presents a somewhat different case than the prenatal since his casecan be entered at any point and the earliest moments of it can be attained easily. This is not true ofthe attempted abortion preclear. Attempted abortions may run to any number. Since they are easilythe most prevalent dramatization of engrams in the society, they are repeated time and again. Theauditor will find it necessary to “unstack” the prenatal period. He will ordinarily reach the latestprenatal injury first. As he finds and examines it, it places itself on the time track. By going toearlier and earlier attempts, more and more of these engrams are revealed until at last the earliest isdiscovered. The auditor must be prepared to spend many hours of hard work in unstackinginjuries. He will many times believe that he has reached the basic of that engram chain only todiscover that another type of abortion was attempted prior to that moment. He need not addressthese engrams for any length of time before he goes on to the earlier one. He should only getsome idea of them so that they will be easily locatable on the return. The basic engram on theattempted abortion case may be found shortly after the first missed period of the mother.Its emotion will be exactly that of the person or persons attempting to perform theabortion. The prenatal human being identifies himself with himself but an adult returned to theprenatal period is reinterpreting the data and will find that he has and is confusing himself withother people associated in the attempts. This engramic data may have slumbered for years before itbecame violently restimulated and may indeed never have been awakened. It must be removed,however, before a release can be obtained. The auditor should be prepared to unstack fifty ormore incidents before birth if necessary.When he is at last in the vicinity of the basic, even the most skeptical preclear (one whohas skepticism as part of the prenatal engram chains) will have no further question as to what ishappening to him. The auditor should be prepared to encounter difficulty in the ability of thepreclear to hear voices or feel pain, as it is quite common for the engramic content to contain suchphrases as “Unconscious” and “Can’t see, can’t feel, can’t hear,” this having been themisconception of the society regarding prenatal life.The auditor should never be appalled at the damage the prenatal human being has receivedand so question the validity of his preclear’s data. Unless the umbilical cord is severed or the heart38"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"is stopped it is apparently the case that no damage, particularly in the earlier months, is too greatfor the organism to reconstruct. In that parents performing abortions are usually dramatizingattempted abortions which have been performed on them, rationality of content in the engramsshould not be expected. Even the data given for it by the abortionist father, mother or professionalis often entirely inaccurate.The test of an engram is whether or not it will lift and whether or not the somatics whichaccompanied it disappear and a tone four is obtained. Rearranging data into other sequences willnot obtain this. The exact content must be brought out. The attempted abortion human being isoften struck unconscious by the earliest part of each attempt since the head is so available to theknitting needles, hat pins, orange-wood sticks, buttonhooks, and so forth which are employed.These periods of unconsciousness must be penetrated and will quite ordinarily release slowly.The number of prenatal engrams should not particularly appall the auditor for when thebasic has been discovered and a tone four achieved, the succeeding experiences will lift withgreater and greater ease. The periods of consciousness interspersed between the prenatal engrams,being locks, will vanish.Birth is in itself a severe experience and is recorded by the human being from the firstmoments of pain throughout the entire experience. Everything in a birth is engramic since thehuman being conceives the ministrations to be more or less antagonistic when they areaccompanied by so much pain. A birth must be lifted as a matter of course but not until thepresence or absence of prenatals has been established. Even after birth has been lifted, prenatalsshould be looked for, since prenatals may often be found only after birth has been exhausted. Thehabits of obstetricians, the presence of sound and speech in the delivery room, the swabbing of aninfant’s nostrils, the examination of its mouth, the severe treatment administered to start itsbreathing and the drops on the eyes may account in themselves for many psychosomatic ills. Acough, however, although it is present in birth and seems to be alleviated by the exhaustion of thebirth engram, is quite ordinarily blood running down the throat of the prenatal during an attemptedabortion. Any perception during birth, when difficulty is encountered with breathing, maybecome a restimulator for asthma. Clean fresh air and electric lights may cause allergies and maybe the principal restimulators. Everything said during birth, as well as everything said duringprenatal experiences, is recorded in the reactive mind and acts as aberrational matter which canand does cause psychological and physiological changes in the individual. Because the parents arenot greatly in evidence at birth, this experience may not be restimulated for many years. Prenatals,on the other hand, restimulate more easily.Infant life is very sentient. Delay in learning to talk is delay in learning the complexity ofhandling vocal muscles rather than an inability to record. Everything in infant life is recorded andthe engrams received in it are extremely valid.The auditor will find himself dealing mainly with prenatal, birth, and infant life. Thecases are very rare which have many important basics in childhood or adult life. These lastperiods contain mainly other engrams which, though they must be addressed to create the release,should not engage much initial attention on the part of the dianeticist. Most of the experiences ofmental anguish in childhood and adult life are founded on very early engrams and are locks whichare almost self-removing.Moments of unconsciousness which contain physical pain and conceived antagonismlying in childhood and adult life are serious and can produce aberration. Engram chains completewith basic may be found which will, all by themselves, exhaust.39"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":".c.THE “LAWS” OF RETURNINGBy aberration is meant the aberree’s reactions to and difficulties with his currentenvironment.By somatic is meant any physical or physically sensory abnormality which the preclearmanifests generally or sporadically in his environment, or any such manifestation encountered andre-experienced during auditing.The aberration is the mental error caused by engrams and the somatic is the physical erroroccasioned by the same source.The auditor follows the general rule that no aberrations or somatics exist in a subjectwhich cannot be accounted for by engrams. He may ordinarily be expected to discover thatanything which reduces the physical or mental perfection of the subject is engramic. He appliesthis rule first and in practice admits no organic trouble of any character. Only when he hasobviously obtained a Clear and when he has observed and has had that Clear medically examinedafter a period of sixty days to six months from the end of auditing should he be content to assignanything to organic origin. He cannot be expected to know until the final examination exactlywhat somatic was not engramic. In other words he must persistently adhere to one line of thought(that the preclear can be brought to mental and physical perfection) before he resigns any mentalor physical error in the preclear to a purely organic category. Too little is known at this writing ofthe recoverability of the mind and body for a dianeticist to deny that ability to recover. Sinceprimary research, considerable practice has demonstrated that this ability to reconstruct andrecover is enormous, far beyond anything previously conceived possible.Dianetics accounts for all faith healing phenomena on an entirely scientific basis and thedianeticist can expect himself to consort daily in his practice with what appear to be miracles.In addition to knowledge of his subject, considerable intelligence and imagination, and apersonality which inspires confidence, the dianetic auditor must possess persistency to aremarkable degree. In other words, his drives must be phenomenally high. There is no substitutefor the auditor’s having been cleared. It is possible for an individual to operate with Dianeticswithout having been released and he may do so for some time without repercussion, but as heaudits he will most certainly encounter the perceptics contained in sorVe of his own engrams timeafter time until these engrams are so restimulated that he will become mentally or physically ill.In psychoanalysis it was possible for the analyst to escape this fate because he dealtprimarily with locks occurring in the post-speech life. The analyst might even experience relieffrom operating on patients since it might clarify his own locks which always had been more orless completely available to his analytical mind. This is very far from the case with the dianeticistwho handles continually the vital and highly charged data which cause physical and mentalaberrations. An auditor in Dianetics may work with impunity for a very short time only before hisown condition demands that he himself be audited. While this is aside from the main subject ofauditing, it has been too often observed to be neglected.Every engram possesses some quality which denies it to the analytical mind. There areseveral types. First there is the “denyer” engram which contains the species of phrase, “Frank willnever know about this,” “Forget it!” “Cannot remember it!” and so forth. Second is theself-invalidating engram which contains the phrases, “Never happened,” “Can’t believe it,”“Wouldn’t possibly imagine it,” and so on.40"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Third is the “bouncer” engram which contains the species of phrase, “Can’t stay here,”“Get out!” and other phrases which will not permit the preclear to remain in its vicinity but returnhim to present time. A fourth is the “holder” engram which contains “Stay here,” “Hold still,”“Can’t get out,” and so on.These are four of the general types which the dianeticist will find occasion him thegreatest difficulty. The type of phrase being encountered, however, is easily diagnosed frompreclear reaction.There are many other types of engrams and phrases which will be encountered. There isthe self-perpetuating engram which implies that, “It will always be this way,” and “It happens allthe time.” The auditor will soon learn to recognize them, forming lists of his own.An engram would not be an engram unless it had strong compulsive or repressive datacontained in it. All engrams are self-locking to some degree, being well off the time track andtouching it slightly, if at all, with some minor and apparently innocuous bit of information whichthe analytical mind disregards as unimportant. Classed with the denyer variety are those phraseswhich deny perception of any kind. The dianetic auditor will continually encounter perceptiondenial and will find it one of the primary reasons the preclear cannot recall and articulate theengram. “Can’t see,” “Can’t hear,” “Can’t feel,” and “Isn’t alive” tend to deny the whole engramcontaining any such phrases.As the engram is a powerful surcharge of physical pain, it will without any phraseswhatsoever deny itself to the analytical mind which, in seeking to scan the engram, is repelled bythe operating principle that it must avoid pain for the organism. As has already been covered,there are five ways the organism can handle a source of pain. It can neglect it, attack it, succumbto it, flee from it, or avoid it. As the entire organism handles exterior pain sources, so does theanalytical mind tend to react to engrams. There is an exterior world reaction of the organism topain sources then. This is approximated when the analytical mind is addressed in regard toengrams. There is an excellent reason for this. Everything contained in the reactive mind isexterior source material. The analytical mind went out of circuit and was recording imperfectly ifat all in the time period when the exterior source was entered into the reactive mind.An analytical mind when asked to approach an engram reacts as it would have had it beenpresent, which is to say, in circuit, at the moment when the engram was being received.Therefore, an artificial approach to the engram must be made which will pemmit the auditor todirect the subject’s analytical mind into but one source of action: Attack.The actual incident must be located and re-experienced. In that the analytical mind hasfive possible ways of reacting to the engram and in that the auditor desires that only one ofthese—attack—be used, the preclear must be persuaded from using the remaining four.On this general principle can be created many types of approach to the problem ofobtaining a Clear. The one which is offered in this manual is that one which has met with quickerand more predictable results than others researched at this time. It has given, in use, one hundredper cent results. In the beginning, at this time, an auditor should not attempt to stray far from thisoffered technique. He should attempt to vary it only when he himself has had extensive andsufficient practice which will enable him to be very conversant with the nature of engrams. Bettertechniques will undoubtedly be established which will provide swifter exhaustion of the reactivemind. The offered technique has produced results in all types of cases so far encountered.There are three equations which demonstrate how and why the auditor and preclear canreach engrams and exhaust them:41"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"I. The auditor’s dynamics are equal to or less than the engramic surcharge in the preclear.II. The preclear’s dynamics are less than the engramic surcharge.III. The auditor’s dynamics plus the preclear’s dynamics are greater than the engramicsurcharge.When the preclear’s dynamics are entirely or almost entirely reduced, as in the case ofamnesia trance, drug trances and so forth, the auditor’s dynamics are not always sufficient toforce the preclear’s analytical mind into an attack upon the engram.The auditor’s dynamics directed against an engram in a preclear who has not beensubjected to a process which will inhibit the free play of his reactive mind and concentrate it,ordinarily provokes the preclear into one of the four unusable methods of succumbing, fleeing,avoiding or neglecting the engram. Demanding that the preclear “face reality,” or “see reason,” orthat he “stop his foolish actions” falls precisely into this category. The auditor’s dynamicsoperating against an awake preclear can produce an “insanity break,” temporary or of considerableduration in the preclear.When the preclear is in reverie some of his own dynamics are present and the auditor’sdynamics added to these make a combination sufficient to overcome the engramic surcharge.If the auditor releases his dynamics against the analytical mind of the preclear, which is tosay, the person of the preclear. while an attempt is being made to reach an engram (in violation ofthe auditor’s code, or with some erroneous idea that the whole person of the preclear isconfronting him) he will receive in return all the fury of the engramic surcharge.An engram can be dramatized innumerable times, for such is the character of the reactivemind that the surcharge of the engram cannot exhaust itself and will not exhaust itself regardlessof its age or the number of times dramatized until it has been approached by the analytical mind ofthe subject.The additive dynamic drive law must be made to apply before engrams are reached. It isoccasionally very necessary to change dianetic auditors, for some preclears will work well onlywith either a male or a female auditor, or with one or another individual auditor. This will not befound necessary in many cases. Three cases are on record where the preclear was definitely anti-pathetic toward the auditor throughout the entire course of auditing. The dianeticist was found tobe a restimulator for one or more of the persons contained in the engrams. Even so, these personsresponded. Greater patience was required on the part of the auditor. Closer observance of theauditor’s code was necessary and a longer time was required for auditing. It will be discoveredthat once the preclear understands what is desired of him and why, his basic personality isaroused to the extent that it will cooperate with any auditor in order to be free. It will sufferthrough many violations of the auditor’s code. Once a preclear has started his auditing he willordinarily continue to cooperate in the major requirements to the fullest extent, no matter whatapparent antagonisms he may display in minor matters.Reverie is a method that has been used with success. The analytical mind of the preclear,while reduced in its potential and under direction, is still capable of thinking its own thoughts andforming its own opinions. Implicit obedience to whatever the auditor suggests is not desirable asthe preclear will inject extraneous material at the faintest suggestion of the auditor. Drugs inhibitthe somatic and have no use in entering a case.42"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The fact that the dianeticist is interested solely in what has been done to the preclear and isnot at all interested in what the preclear himself has done to others greatly facilitates auditing sincethere is no social disgrace in having been an unwitting victim.In reverie the preclear is placed in a light state of “concentration” which is not to beconfused with hypnosis. In the state of alliance, therefore, the mind of the preclear will be foundto be, to some degree, detachable from his surroundings and directed interiorly. The first thingthat the dianeticist will discover in most preclears is aberration of the sense of time. There arevarious ways that he can circumvent this and construct a time track along which he can cause thepreclear’s mind to travel. Various early experiences which are easily reached are examined and anearly diagnosis can be formed. Then begins an immediate effort to reach basic, with attemptedabortion or prenatal accident predominating. Failures on the first attempts to reach prenatalexperiences should not discourage the dianetic auditor since many hours may be consumed andmany false basics reached and exhausted before the true prenatal basic is attained.In this type of reverie the dianeticist can use and will observe certain apparently naturallaws in force. They are as follows: The difficulties the analytical mind encounters when returnedto or searching for an engram are identical to the command content of that engram .An aberree in adult life is more or less obeying, as restimulated, the compositeexperiences contained in his engrams.The preclear’s behavior in reverie is regulated by the commands contained in the engramto which he is returned and is modifed by the composite of chronologically preceding engrams onhis time track.The somatics of a preclear are at their highest in an engram where they were received andat the moment of reception in that experience.When returned to a point prior to an engram, the commands and somatics of that engramare not effective on the preclear. As he is returned to the moment of an engram, the preclearexperiences, as the common denominator of all engrams, a considerable lessening of his analyticalpotential. He speaks and acts in a modified version of the engram. All complaints he makes to theauditor should be regarded as possibly being verbatim from, first, the engram that he isreexperiencing or, second, from prior engrams.At the precise moment of an engramic command the preclear experiences obedience tothat command. The emotion a preclear experiences when regressed to an engram is identical to theemotional tone of that engram. Excesses of emotion will be found to be contained in the wordcontent of the engram as commands.When a preclear is returned to before the moment of reception of an engram he is notsubject to any part of that engram, emotionally, aberrationally, or somatically.When the time track is found to contain loops or is blurred in any portion, its crossings orconfusions are directly attributable to engramic commands which precisely state the confusion.Any difficulty a preclear may experience with returning, reaching engrams, perceiving, orrecounting, is directly and precisely commanded by engrams.An engram would not be an engram were it easy to reach, or if it gave the preclear nodifficulty and contained no physical pain.43"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The characteristic of engrams is confusion. First, the confusion of the time track; second,the confusion of an engramic chain wherein similar words or somatics mix incidents; third,confusion of incidents with engrams.This confusion is occasioned by the disconnected state of the analytical mind during thereceipt of the engram. Auditing by location and identification of hidden incidents, first rebuilds atleast the early part of the time track, locates and fixes engrams in relation to one another in time,and then locates the basic of the basic chain and exhausts it. The remainder of the chain must alsobe exhausted. Other engrams and incidents exhaust with ease after the erasure of the basic or thebasic of any chain (within that chain). Locks vanish without being located. A tone four gained onbasic permits the subsequent erasure on the time track to go forward with ease. A whole chainmay rise to four without the basic chain having been located.Any perception of pre-speech life during reverie denotes the existence of engramicexperience as far back as the time track is open.If the individual’s general tone is clearly not tone four, if he is still interested in hisengrams, another more basic chain than the one found still exists.Engramic patterns tend to form an avoidance pattern for the preclear. From basic outwardthere is an observable and progressive divergence between the person himself and his returnedself. In the basic engram of the basic chain and for a few subsequent incidents on that chain, hewill be found within and receiving the experiences as himself. In subsequent incidents cleavage isobservable, and in late engrams the preclear is found to be observing the action from outside ofhimself, almost as a disinterested party. This forms the principal primary test for the basic of thebasic chain. Another test for basic is “sag.”Any engram may be exhausted to a point where it will recede without reaching tone four.Although it is temporarily and momentarily lost to the individual and apparently does not troublehim, that engram which has been exhausted in a chain without the basic having been reached will“sag” or reappear within twenty-four to sixty hours. Basic on any chain will not “sag” but will lifton a number of recountings, rise to tone four and will remain erased. Another test for basic iswhether or not it begins to lift with ease. If an engram does not intensify or remain static aftermany recountings, it can be conceived to be at least a basic on some chain. Locks will lift anddisappear without returning as they are not fixed by physical pain. Large numbers of locks can beexhausted bringing an alleviation of the preclear’s difficulties and such a course may occasionallybe pursued in the entrance of a case. The discovery and lifting of the basic to which the locks areappended removes the locks automatically.These rules and laws even if modifed in their statement will be found invariable.Incompetent auditing cannot be excused by the supposed discovery of a special case or exception.A physical derangement must be in the category of actually missing parts of the organism whichcause permanent disability, and instances of this are not common.44"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":".c.CASE HISTORIESThe following case histories have been selected at random. Due to lack of time, these casehistories are Releases, not Clears. The Releases have been fully diagnosed and researched.CASE NO. 1HYPERTENSION, COMBAT FATIGUETUBERCULOSIS, ARRESTEDMYOPIC ASTIGMATISMA forty-three year old ex-Army officer and author; inclined to petty tyrannies; twicedivorced; no children. Processed by army as psycho-neurotic.Birth was discovered immediately but would not satisfactorily release. The preclearexperienced great difficulty in visualizing and his aberrations intensified during auditing.By use of dreams and restimulation of somatics the preclear was able to reach thebeginning of the engramic chain as counted backwards from birth. Fifteen prenatal experienceswere unstacked. They were found lying in two loops. The loops were corrected and the basicengram of the basic chain was reached. (A loop is a redoubling of the time track back on itself. Inthis case incidents are not in their correct place on the time track. )The basic consisted of a severe quarrel between his mother and father with severalabdominal blows being received by the mother. The mother was protesting that it would make hersick all of her life. At the same time the mother was coughing from a throat blow. The father wasinsisting that he was master in his own home and that people had to do what he told them. Thisquarrel occurred at about four and a half months after conception and resulted in the temporaryparalysis of the preclear’s right side. The remainder of the chain consisted of similar incidents,evidently dramatizations on the part of the father of his own engrams, as the words used werealmost identical, one engram to the next. This chain accounted for and relieved the subject’s fearthat he would be ill and his desire to tyrannize others.Birth was then found to consist of near suffocation and considerable antagonism betweenthe doctor and the nurse. This was registered as commands to himself to the effect that he wasblind and could not see. Birth was in the home and dust, camphor, the smell of clean sheets andgreased metal were the restimulators for this severe lung irritation. This birth was not restimulateduntil the age of five and the prenatals were not restimulated until entrance into the service when theneed for authority manifested itself.No locks were found to need attention and only one half hour of his war experience failedto release, that being a new basic.Number of hours on case: fifty-five.CASE NO. 2APATHY, PRECLEAR HAD BEEN UNDER PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT FORTWO YEARS PRIOR TO DIANETIC AUDITING. SHE HAD EXPERIENCED NO RELIEF.MALNUTRITION.45"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"An eighteen-year-old girl in a condition of apathy bordering upon a break and worsening.She had been recently married. Afraid of her husband. She had done very badly in school,sporadically engaged in sexual escapades, relapsing afterwards into an illness which wasvariously diagnosed.Case was entered with ease. Birth was reached and would not exhaust. A search forprenatals was for ten hours fruitless, until certain somatics were artificially restimulated andintensified to the point that the preclear had to recall the incident to find relief. Eight prenatals werethen unstacked and only two incidents were discovered in confusion with each other, heldtogether with a head somatic.The basic proved to be a mutual abortion attempt by the mother and father. The mothersaid she would die if anyone found out but that she would probably die anyway. The father saidthat the baby was probably like her and that he didn’t want it. Eighteen penetrations of the head,throat and shoulders with a long orange-wood stick—probably in the third month. Several similarincidents completed this chain. Coitus followed each attempt at abortion. Another incident provedto be a basic without a chain and with innumerable locks: an attempted abortion by a professionalabortionist who used some form of needle and scraper. Birth was found to be a mild experience.Three infant engrams with their own basic were discovered. They consisted of the mother’s fearover the injury and the fear that the baby would die.Contagion of attempted abortion engrams was particularly manifest in the mother’sneurotic dwelling on fear of death, which was obviously a dramatization.All neurotic and psychotic symptoms were relieved with a marked improvement in thehealth of the preclear and an increase of twenty-seven points on the Army Alpha test. Time ofwork: 65 hours.CASE NO. 3PSYCHOTIC MURDEROUS RAGES.CHRONIC SKIN RASH.A thirty-year-old male negro, six feet four inches in height, about two hundred and fiftypounds—swamp worker. He was in continual trouble with police and had a considerable jailrecord. He continually dramatized a hatred of women. He also dramatized a continuous suspicionthat he was about to be murdered. His I.Q. was about eighty-five.Uniquely enough this case offered no difficulties in entrance. The subject was extremelycooperative with the dianeticist. Birth was found and exhausted without improvement in the case.A number of infant and childhood engrams were discovered and tested. Continual address of thepreclear’s attention to prenatal life finally brought about a convulsion in which terror and ragealternated. The dianeticist was able to induce the preclear to listen to the voices he was hearing andto go through with the experience.The convulsion proved to be twenty engrams nearer birth than the basic, which lay onanother chain and which was discovered by dream technique. The convulsion was caused by thedramatization of an engram involving the injection of turpentine into the uterus by the mother in anattempted abortion. The main engramic chain consisted of the mother’s efforts to abort herself.From engramic content it was gathered that the mother was a prostitute, for as many as twentyexperiences of coitus succeeded two of these abortion attempts. They were too numerous to beevaluated.46"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The basic chain contained many quarrels about money between the mother and hercustomers. The somatics of this chain were largely bruises and concussions caused by the motherramming herself into pointed objects, or beating her stomach and abdomen. There were manyloops in the basic chain caused by the similarity of incident and the confusion of coitus withabortion attempts. The basic incident was at last discovered and exhausted. It was found to lieabout twenty days after conception, when the mother first discovered her pregnancy.All engrams were exhausted in the basic chain. The convulsion was fully cleared andbirth was suddenly found to have been a very painful experience, particularly because the childwas taken by others immediately after birth. Only one engram chain (unconsciousness resultingfrom fist fights) was found in childhood.47"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":".c.GLOSSARYA.A.—An attempted abortion case.ABERREE — An aberrated individual, sane or insane, containing unrelieved engrams.ANALYTICAL MIND — The residence of consciousness in the individual and the seatof his basic personality. This is an analogical term. The analytical mind can be sub-divided.ASSOCIATIVE RESTIMULATOR— A perceptic in the environment which is confusedwith an actual restimulator.BREAK ENGRAM — The secondary engram after the receipt of which the individualexperienced a lowering of general tone to 2.5 or below and became therefore unable to cope withhis environment.CLEAR—(1) Dianetic Clear: An individual who has been cleared of all engrams andchains and who has achieved a general tone four; a Dianetic Case Completion; one who throughDianetic processing has become free of those things which make a person susceptible to, and“hold in place,” psychosomatic ills, and is a healthy, happy human being. In this book Clearmeans Dianetic Clear. (2) Scientology Clear: A person who, having received all the processinggains from Dianetics to Grade VI (highest Scientology Release Grade), has then completed theClearing Course at an Advanced Organization. A Scientology Clear has by definition the ability tobe cause over mental matter, energy, space and time as regards the First Dynamic (ref. chapterThe Dynamics, in this book).CONFUSION — The condition of an area of an engram or the condition of a chain.Instants of existence which are not properly aligned on the time track.CROSS ENGRAM — The severe engramic experience wherein two chains have metcausing a marked change in the life of the individual. This is an engram which is on the time trackof each of two or more chains.DIANETICIST— A skilled user of dianetic therapy.DIANETICS — Means “through the soul” (from Greek dia. through, and noes, soul). Itis the first fully precise science of the mind. The world before Dianetics had never known aprecision mental science.DISPERSAL— The action of a dynamic or purpose meeting an engram. It is describableby an analogy of an electron stream striking impedance and showering around it, muchweakened.DYNAMIC — The dynamic thrust into time and space of an individual, a species, or aunit of matter or energy. Especially defined for the purpose of Dianetics as “Survive.”DYNAMIC DIANETICS—The science of the basic drives of the individual and his basicpersonality. At this writing the branch of Dianetics most intensely under observation and researchis this one. (See Science of Survival by L. Ron Hubbard.)ENGRAM — A period of physical pain including unconsciousness and antagonismexperienced by an individual, group or society and residing thereafter as irrational andrestimulatable dramatizations.48"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ENGRAM CHAIN— A series of similar engrams on one or more dynamics whichimpede the dynamics of the individual.LOCK— A period of mental anguish depending for its force upon an engram. It may ormay not be available to the analytical mind but it does not contain actual unconsciousness.PRECLEAR — Any individual receiving dianetic auditing for the purpose of beingcleared; anyone not yet Clear.PURPOSE—The survival route chosen by an individual, a species, or a unit of matter orenergy in the accomplishment of its goal. (NOTE: The purpose is specific and may be closelydefined being a subdivision of one of the sub-dynamics. It has been tentatively established byinvestigation that an individual human being has established his purpose for life at the age of twoyears and that the actual purpose is not derived in any degree from engrams but is only warped bythem.)REACTIVE MIND — That portion of the nervous system which contains reflexive orreactive data which does not clear through the analytical mind but is subject to dramatization oraberrations. It uses as a thought process the conception of identities. A equals A equals A. This isessentially the animal thinking mechanism.RELEASE — ( 1 ) Dianetic Release: A preclear in whom the majority of emotional stresshas been deleted from the reactive mind. Has had large gains from Dianetics, is not yet a DianeticCase Completion. (2) Scientology Release: A series of major levels of gain wherein Scientologyprocessing frees the person from the principal life difficulties or personal “blocks” stemming fromthe mind. Called Release Grades, each of these levels must be completed for one to be ready toundertake Scientology Clearing. Note: Release, in this book, refers to Dianetic Release.RESTIMULATOR — The environmental perceptic which approximates a precise part ofthe engramic perceptics in the reactive mind.SCIENTOLOGY — The study of knowledge in its fullest sense, and applied religiousphilosophy that covers man’s relationship to the universe. Dianetics is the forerunner ofScientology. Dianetics was the ultimate development of the mind of human beings. Scientology isthe road from there to total freedom.SOMATIC—The physiological counterpart of mental aberration. A somatic attends everyaberration. This term is used in lieu of “physical pain” in auditing due to the high engramic valueof the word pain and its failure to include in its meaning all painful perceptics.TIME TRACK—The memory record of an individual, motor or sensory, preciselyaligned in moments of time. In a Clear all such moments are available to the analytical mind. In anaberree areas of the time track are obscured, but the time track is considered to be in perfectcondition, if partially and temporarily obscured. The existence of two time tracks is suspected—one sensory and one motor, the latter being more available to the dianeticist in the form ofsomatics. The time track is precise but as the analytical mind addresses it in the aberree, it isapparently obliterated in part, or tangled.TONE—The emotional condition of an engram or the general condition of an individual.TRAUMA — A term from a school of psychology implying an experience which wouldcreate a psychic scar. It is unused in Dianetics as being liable to misunderstanding of the nature ofsevere experiences. Scars cannot be removed; psychosomatic experiences can be.49"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"UNCONSCIOUSNESS — A condition wherein the organism is discoordinated only inits analytical process and motor control direction.
