Ron Hubbard"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Introduction to ScientologyScientology is different than any other Earth organization of information or knowledgeto date. The word “science” as you know is a simple word meaning merely “truth”.Scientology means knowing, “Scio” (Latin), but “Scio” means something quite interesting. Itdoesn’t mean just knowing— it means knowing in the fullest sense of the word. Scientology isan aim at total know.People have a great deal of difficulty describing Scientology to other people, for theexcellent reason that they try to fit it into a frame of reference with other “knows”. They say,“Well then it’s like something or other”. Well, there have not been any other total “knows”.As far as the basic attempt is concerned, there has been only one organisation of know-ledge on earth which has had a similar goal —which is the goal of Total Freedom, being able toget out of the trap of confusion, being able to back up and take a look at it all, and that wasBuddhism, practically 2500 years ago. Unfortunately Buddhism isn’t adequate as a comparabledatum to Scientology because the Western World hasn’t a clue as to what Buddhism is allabout, and we should understand that we’re embarked upon something that hasn’t beenembarked upon for 2500 years. It isn’t that what we’re doing is as important as Buddhism. Itisn’t that Buddhism is as important as Scientology. But both of them attempted to select out theimportant things—a selection of the importance’s of life, and to fill Man’s void of knowingwith accurate observation.Scientology is a practical, every-day philosophy—a technology of the human spirit.Through Scientology, Man has the means to better himself, increase his abilities and raise hisIQ. Scientology evolved from Dianetics. Dianetics and its goals are outlined in Dianetics, theModern Science of Mental Health, published on May 9th, 1950. Subsequently read by overone and a half million Americans and published abroad, this material occasions a great deal ofinterest because, primarily, it poses the hope to Man that he can disentrap himself from some ofthe difficulties in which he finds himself. It delineates certain phenomena of the mind which,when dealt with, brings about a considerable return of ability to the individual. It states inDianetics, the Modern Science of Mental Health that after we had established the foundation,after we had put Dianetics into operation at least to some degree in the society, we would go onand investigate the origin and destination of Life, and the various problems that life itself as lifeis facing. So, Scientology began.Scientology addresses Man the Spirit, not Man the Machine. As long as we address thespirit, as long as we return to the individual some belief and faith in himself, he gets better,brighter, his IQ. goes up, his ability to handle things gets better, he gets more powerful, morepersistent and he becomes kinder and more merciful, more tolerant, less critical. If we starttreating the Machine we get a patched up broken leg.The spirit of Man has gotten so little acknowledgment and there’s been so muchacknowledgment to the individual as a body, that people have begun to feel safe in thedestruction of bodies because all a body can do is hit or fire a gun. What feeling of guilt couldyou possibly get? None. So we get a lessening of a feeling of moral responsibility.Unless some few of us become active and thoughtful in the direction of a practical reli-gion and technology of the spirit, and revive some feeling, some height, some decency, thisplanet will be as bald as a billiard ball. And this is a good playground. The back history of thisplace was destruction and more destruction and more destruction as far as this planet isconcerned with less building and less building and less building. Until we get today where wecan deliver the big punch to end it all. It never occurs to anybody that there might be some fewamongst us who didn’t feel it necessary to end it all. It is to those few that Scientology isappealing.L. R. H.19672"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DianeticsThe Evolution of a ScienceThe optimum computing machine is a subject which many of us have studied. If youwere building one, how would you design it?First, the machine should be able to compute with perfect accuracy on any problem inthe Universe and produce answers which were always and invariably right.Second, the computer would have to be swift, working much more quickly than theproblem and process could be vocally articulated.Third, the computer would have to be able to handle large numbers of variables andlarge numbers of problems simultaneously.Fourth, the computer would have to be able to evaluate its own data and there wouldhave to remain available within it not only a record of its former conclusions but the evaluationsleading to those conclusions.Fifth, the computer would have to be served by a memory bank of nearly infinitecapacity in which it could store observational data, tentative conclusions which might servefuture computations and the data in the bank would have to be available to the analytical portionof the computer in the smallest fractions of a second.Sixth, the computer would have to be able to rearrange former conclusions or alter themin the light of new experience.Seventh, the computer would not need an exterior program director but would be en-tirely self-determined about its programming guided only by the necessity-value of the solutionwhich it itself would determine.Eighth, the computer should be self-servicing and self-arming against present andfuture damage and would be able to estimate future damage.Ninth, the computer should be served by perception by which it could determinenecessity-value. The equipment should include means of contacting all desirable characteristicsin the finite world. This would mean color-visio, tone-audio, odor, tactile and selfperceptions—for without the last it could not properly service itself.Tenth, the memory bank should store perceptions as perceived, consecutive with timereceived with the smallest possible time divisions between perceptions. It would then store incolor-visio (moving), tone-audio (flowing), odor, tactile and self sensation, all of themcross-co-ordinated.Eleventh, for the purposes of solutions, it would have to be able to create newsituations and imagine new perceptions hitherto not perceived and should be able to conceivethese to itself in terms of tone-audio, color-visio, odor, tactile and self sensation and should beable to file anything so conceived as imagined labeled memories.Twelfth, its memory banks should not exhaust on inspection but should furnish to thecentral perceptor of the computer, without distortion, perfect copies of everything- andanything in the banks in color-visio, tone-audio, odor, tactile and organic sensations.Thirteenth, the entire machine should be portable.There are other desirable characteristics but those listed above will do for the moment.3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It might be somewhat astonishing, at first, to conceive of such a computer. But the factis, the machine is in existence. There are about two billion of them in use today and many,many more billions have been made and used in the past.In fact, you’ve got one. For we are dealing with the human mind.The above is a generalization of the optimum brain. The optimum brain, aside from thefact that it is not always capable of solving every problem in the Universe, basically worksexactly like that. It should have color-visio (in motion), tone-audio (flowing), odor, tactile andorganic memory recall. And it should have color-visio (in motion), tone-audio (flowing), odor,tactile and organic imagination, also recallable after imagining like any other memory. And itshould be able to differentiate between actuality and imagination with precision. And it shouldbe able to recall any perception, even the trivial, asleep and awake from the beginning of life todeath. That is the optimum brain, that and much, much more. It should think with suchswiftness that vocal pondering would be utterly unable to keep pace with a thousandth part ofone computation. And, modified by viewpoint and educational data, it should be always right,its answers never wrong.That is the brain you have, potentially. That is the brain which can be restored to youunless you have had some section of it removed. If it does not do these things, it is slightly outof adjustment.It took a long time to arrive at the data that this was an optimum brain. In the beginningit was not realized that some people had color-visio—moving-recall, for instance, and thatsome did not. I had no idea that many people imagined, and knew they were imagining, intone-audio, et cetera, and would have received with surprise the data that somebody couldsmell and taste last Thanksgiving turkey when he recalled it.Fifteen years ago, when the researches which culminated in Dianetics. (Gr. dianouathought) were started in earnest, no such high optimum of the human brain was held. In fact,the project was not begun to trace function and restore optimum operation, but to know the keyto human behavior and the code law which would reduce all knowledge.My right to enter this field was an inquiring brain which had been trained inmathematics and engineering and which had a memory bank full of questions and far-flungobservations.It was the basic contention that the human mind with a problem in engineering and thatall knowledge would surrender to an engineering approach.And another primary assumption was made:All answers are basically simple.As it stands today, the science of Dianetics and its results—which are as demonstrableas the proposition that water, at fifteen pounds per square inch and 212° F. boils—is anengineering science, built heuristically on axioms. It works. That is the only claim for Dianeticsor chemistry. They may not be True. But they work and work invariably in the finite world.When the problem had been shuffled around, in the beginning, and when questions hadbeen formulated to be asked of the Universe at large, there was no concept of the optimumbrain. Attention was fixed upon the normal brain. The normal brain was considered to be theoptimum brain. Attempts were made, when work finally got around to the problem of the brainitself, to obtain results comparable with the normal mind. Minds became aberrated. Whenrestored they would be normal.In fact, in the beginning, it was not even certain that minds could be restored. All thatwas required was an answer to existence and the reasons minds aberrated.4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In a lifetime of wandering around many strange things had been observed. The medi-cine man of the Goldi people of Manchuria, shamans of North Borneo, Sioux medicine men,the cults of Los Angeles, and modern psychology. Amongst the people questioned aboutexistence were a magician whose ancestors served in the court of Kublai Khan and a Hinduwho could hypnotize cats. Dabbles had been made in mysticism, data had been studied frommythology to spiritualism. Odds and ends like these, countless odds and ends.If you were constructing this science, where would you have started? Here were all thevarious cults and creeds and practices of a whole world to draw upon. Here were facts to anumber which makes 1021 binary digits look small. If you were called upon to construct sucha science and to come up with a workable answer, what would you have assumed, gone toobserve, or computed?Everybody and everything seemed to have a scrap of the answer. The cults of all theages, of all the world seem, each one, to contain a fragment of the truth. How do we gather andassemble the fragments? Or do we give up this nearly impossible task and begin postulating ourown answers?Well, this is the story of how Dianetics was built. This, at least, was the approach madeto the problem. Dianetics works, which is what an engineer asks, and it works all the time,which is what nature demands of the engineer.First, attempts were made to discover what school or system was workable. Freud didoccasionally. So did Chinese acupuncture. So did magic healing crystals in Australia andmiracle shrines in South America. Faith healing, voodoo, narco-synthesis—and, understandthis right here, no mystic mumbo jumbo need apply. An engineer has to have things he canmeasure. Later the word “demon” is used. That’s because Socrates describes one so well.Dianetic use of it, like Clerk-Maxwell’s, is descriptive slang. But no wild immeasurableguesses or opinions were wanted. When an engineer uses only those, bridges break, buildingsfall, dynamos stop and a civilization goes to wrack.A primary need, in arriving at a dynamic principle of existence, was to discover whatone wanted to know about existence. One does not have to dabble long with the gods to knowthat they point unvaryingly if divinely up a very blind alley. And an engineering study ofmysticism demonstrates that mysticism embraces largely what it cannot hope to state precisely.The first proposition went off something on this order. Let us find out what we cannotconsider or do not need to consider to get an answer we can use. Some tests seemed todemonstrate that the exact identity of the Prime Mover Unmoved was not necessary to thecomputation. Man has been convinced for a long time that He started this affair, so no greatgain could be made in getting disputive about it. Let us then take a level immediately below thePrime Mover Unmoved.Now let us see what else falls into the category of data unnecessary to the computation.Well, we’ve studied telepathy, demons, the Indian rope trick and the human soul and so far wehave yet to find any constants in this class of data. So let us draw a line below that as ourhighest level of necessary information and now call this our highest line.What do we have left? We have the finite world, blue serge suits, Salinas Valley, theCathedral at Rheims as a building and several decayed empires and roast beef for dinner. Wehave left only what we can perceive with no higher level of abstraction.Now, how do we perceive and on what and with what? Ensues here a lot of timespent— 1937—in computing out the brain as an electronic calculator with the probablemathematics of its operation plus the impossibility of such a structure capable of doing suchthings. Let us then rule out the necessity of knowing structure and use this as an analogy onlywhich can become a variable in the equation if necessary.5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Now what do we have ? Well, we’ve been a little hard on demons and the human soul.These are popular but they refuse to stand out and submit to a thorough inspection and calipermensuration and if they won’t so cooperate, then neither will we. And so two things comefrom this reduction of equation factors necessary to solution. First, existence is probably finiteand second, finite factors alone answered the need of the problem.Probably we could be very obtuse and mathematical here, but no matter. A good,workable heuristic principle, a workable one, is worth an infinity of formulas based onAuthority and opinions which do not work.All we can do is try the principle. We need a dynamic principle of existence. We look inSpencer and we find something which reads awfully good. It read good when he took it fromIndian writings, the same place Lucretius got it. But it only pretends to be dynamic because itdoesn’t compute. We need a dynamic principle, not a description.But what does a principle mean in a sphere this large? And doesn’t it need a betterdefinition? Let us then call it a dynamic lowest common denominator of existence.Will such a lowest common denominator lead us straight up above the highest level wehave set and send us spinning off with a fist full of variables and no answer? It had better not.So let us pose some more questions and see if they clarify the principle.What can we know? Can we know where life came from? Not just now. Can we knowwhere life is going ? Well, that would be interesting but few of us will live to see that.So what can we know? Who, when, why, where, what—WHAT! We can knowWHAT life is doing.Let us postulates now that life started somewhere and is going somewhere. To knowwhere it came from might solve a lot of problems but that seems unnecessary to know at thistime for this problem. And the somewhere might be known too some day but again we do notneed to know that. So now we have something for the equation which will stay in terms ofconstants. WHAT is life doing enroute ?Life is energy of some sort. The purpose seems to involve energy. We are beingheuristic. No arguments necessary because all we want is something with a high degree ofworkability, that’s all any scientist needs. If this won’t work, we’ll dream up another one andpostulate until something does work.What is energy doing ? It’s surviving— changing form, but surviving.What is life doing? It’s surviving.Now maybe it is doing a whole lot more, but we’ll just try this on for size. What is thelowest common denominator of all existence which we have so far found ?SURVIVE!The only test of an organism is survival.That can be computed.We can even go so far as to make it colorful and say that there was a beginning of trackand at this beginning of track Somebody said SURVIVE! He didn’t say why and He didn’t sayuntil. All He said was SURVIVE!Well, that’s simple and it computes. It makes sense on the slide rule and it makes sensewith a lot of activity and it seems pretty good. Let’s see.6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The brain was a computer-director evolved on the same principles and on the same planas cells and by cells and is composed of cells. The brain resolved problems relating to survival,asked itself questions about survival, acted upon its own best conceived but personallyviewpointed plan for survival.If one sagged down towards unsurvival, one was goaded up the scale toward survivalby pain. One was lured ahead by pleasure into survival. There was a graduated scale with oneend in death and the other in immortality.The brain thought in terms of differences, similarities and identities and all its problemswere resolved on these lines and all these problems and all these activities were strictly andsolely survival-motivated. The basic command data on which the body and brain operated wasSURVIVE! That was all; nothing fell outside this.It was postulated to see if it worked.That was in 1938 after several years of study. The axioms began with SURVIVE!SURVIVE was the lowest common denominator of all existence. They proceeded throughaxioms as to what Man was doing and how he was doing it. Nice definitions for intelligence,drive, happiness, good, evil and so forth fell into line. Suicide, laughter, drunkenness and follyall fell inside this, too, as it computed out.These computations stood the test of several years. And then, as you may have heard,came a war. But even wars end. Research was resumed, but now with the added necessity ofapplying the knowledge gained to the problems of friends who had not survived the war toowell.A researcher gets out on a rim of the unknown just so far and the guide books run out.In the libraries were thousands and thousands of mental cases, neatly recorded. And not onecase contained in it the essential data to its solution. These cases might just as well have beenwritten in vanishing ink for all the good they were. Beyond proving conclusively that peoplemanifested strange mental aberrations they were worthless. How do you go about building ascience of thought without being permitted to observe and without having any observed data?Out of a multitude of personal observations in this and distant lands, it was the first taskto find a constant. I had studied hypnotism in Asia. I knew hypnotism was, more or less, afundamental. Whenever shamans, medicine men, exorcists or even modern psychologists go towork, they incline toward practices which are hypnotic.But of what use is such a terrible, unpredictable variable as hypnotism. On some peopleit works. On most it doesn’t. On those on whom it works it sometimes achieves good results,sometimes bad. Wild stuff, hypnotism.The physical scientist, however, is not unacquainted with the use of a wild variable.Such erratic things usually hide real, important laws. Hypnotism was a sort of constant threadthrough all the cults—or hypnotic practices—but perhaps one might at least look at it.So hypnotism was examined. A wild radical. The reason it was wild might be a goodanswer. The first investigation of it was quite brief. It did not need to be longer.Examine a post-hypnotic suggestion. Patient in amnesia trance. Tell him that when heawakens he will remove his left shoe and put it on the mantel. Then tell him that he will forgethe has been told and wake him up. He awakens, blinks for a while and then puts his footforward and removes his shoe. Ask him why. “My foot’s too hot.” He puts the shoe on themantel. Why? “I hate to put on a damp shoe. Warmer up here and it will dry.” Keep this inmind, this experiment. The full reason for its importance did not appear for nine years. But itwas recognized that, with various suggestions, one could create the appearance of variousneuroses, psychoses, compulsions and repression’s listed by the psychiatrist. The examination7"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"promptly went no further. One had too few answers yet. But it was clear, that hypnotism andinsanity were, somehow, identities. A search was begun for the reason why.For a long time and with many, many people attempts were made to unlock the riddle.What caused hypnotism? What did it do? Why did it behave unpredictably?Examination was made of hypno-analysis. It sounds good in the texts but it doesn’twork. It doesn’t work for several reasons, first among them being that you can’t hypnotizeeverybody. Further it works only occasionally, even when a person can be hypnotized. Sohypno-analysis was buried along with the water-cure of Bedlam and the pre-frontal lobotomyand the demon extraction techniques of the shamans of British Guyana, and the search for thekey which could restore a mind to normal was continued.But hypnotism wouldn’t stay quite dead.Narco-synthesize seemed a good lead, until some cases were discovered which hadbeen “cured” by narco-synthesis. They were reworked with the technique just to discover whathad occurred. Narco-synthesis sometimes seemed to fix a man up so his war neurosis couldrise to even greater heights at some future date. No, that is not entirely fair. It produces slightlyhigher results than a magic healing crystal in the hands of an Australian medicine man. Itseemed to do something beyond what it was supposed to do, and that something beyond wasbad. Here was another wild variable, a piece of the puzzle of insanity’s cause. We knewWHAT Man was doing. He was surviving. Somehow, some way, he occasionally becameirrational. Where did hypnotism fit into this? Why did drug hypnotism affect people soadversely at times ?These people one met and worked with did seem to be trapped somehow by somethingwhich modern methods almost never touched. And why did whole nations rise up to slaughternations? And why did religious zealots carry a banner and crescent across three quarters ofEurope? People behave as if they’d been cursed by something. Were they basically evil? Wassocial training a thin veneer? Was the evil curse a natural inheritance from the tooth and clawanimal kingdom ? Was the brain ever capable of rationality? Hypnotism and narco-synthesis,unpredictable radicals, refused for a time to divulge answers.Out of orbit again and without tools with which to work, it was necessary to hark backto the techniques of the Kayan Shaman of Borneo, amongst others. Their theory is crude; theyexorcise demons. All right. We postulated that Man is evil, that the evil is native. Then weought to be able to increase the civilized veneer by planting in him more civilization, usinghypnotism. So the patient usually gets worse. That postulate didn’t work. Provisional, let’s trythe postulate that Man is good and follow its conclusions. And we suppose something such asthe Borneo shaman’s Toh has entered into him which directs him to do evil things.Man has believed longer that demons inhabit men than Man has believed they did not.We assume demons, We look for some demons, one way or another. And we found some!This was a discovery almost as mad as some of the patients on hand. But the thing todo was try to measure and classify demons.Strange work for an engineer and mathematician! But it was found that the “demons”could be classified. There were several “demons” in each patient, but there were only a fewclasses of “demons”. There were audio demons, sub-audio demons, visio demons, interiordemons, exterior demons, ordering demons, directing demons, critical demons, apatheticdemons, angry demons, bored demons and “curtain” demons who merely occluded things. Thelast seemed the most common. Looking into a few minds established soon that it was difficultto find anyone who didn’t have some of these demons.It was necessary to set up an optimum brain. That brain would be postulated, subject tochange. It would be the combined best qualities of all brains studied. It would be able to8"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"visualize in color and hear with all tones and sounds present, all memories necessary tothought. It would think without talking to itself, thinking in concepts and conclusions ratherthan words. It would be able to imagine visually in color anything it cared to imagine and hearanything it cared to imagine it would hear. It was discovered eventually that it could alsoimagine smells and tactiles but this did not enter into the original. Finally it would know whenit was recalling and know when it was imagining.Now, for purposes of analogy it was necessary to go back to the electronic computeridea conceived in 1938. Circuits were drawn up for the visio and audio recall, for color andtone recall, for imagination visio and audio creation and color and tone creation. Then weredrawn the memory bank circuits. All this was fairly easy at this time since some extensive workhad been done on this in the thirties.With this diagram, further circuits were set up. The optimum brain was a plain circuit.To this were added the “demon” circuits. It was found that by very ordinary electronics onecould install every kind of a “demon” that had been observed.The “demons”, since none of them consented to present themselves for a properexamination as demons, were, it was concluded, installed in the brain in the same way onewould install a new circuit in the optimum brain. But as there was just so much brain, it wasobvious that these electronic “demons” were using parts of the optimum brain and that theywere no more competent than the optimum brain inherently was. This was more postulating.All one wanted was a good result. If this hadn’t worked something else would have been tried.Thus the solution was entered upon. While the human brain is a shade too wonderful aninstrument to be classified with anything as clumsy as contemporary electronics, as marvelousas modern electronics are, the analogy stands. It stands as an analogy. The whole sciencewould hang together brightly now without that analogy. But it serves in this place.There are no demons. No ghosts and ghouls or Tohs. But there are aberrative circuits.So it was reasoned. It was a postulate. And then it became something more.One day a patient fell asleep.- When he awakened he was found to be “somebody else”.As “somebody else” he was questioned very carefully. This patient, as “himself”, had a sonicmemory block, an audio memory block, and was color-blind. He was very nervous ordinarily.Just now, awakened into being “somebody else” he was calm. He spoke in a lower voice tone.Here, obviously, one was confronting one of these electronic screwups the savants callschizophrenics. But not so. This was the basic personality of the patient himself, possessed ofan optimum brain!It was very rapidly established that he had color-visio recall on anything, tone-audiorecall, tone-audio and color-visio imagination and entire co-ordinative control. He knew whenhe was imagining and when he was recalling and that, too, was something he had not been ableto do before.He wanted to know something. He wanted to know when the operator was going tohelp him get himself squared around. He had a lot of things to do. He wanted to help his wifeout so she wouldn’t have to support the family. How unlike the patient of an hour before!He obligingly did some mental computations with accuracy and clarity and then he waspermitted to lie down and sleep. He woke up with no recollection of what had happened. Hehad his old symptoms. Nothing could shake those electronic blocks. He didn’t even know if hehad eaten lunch, the color of my scarf, and as for his wife, served her right for being acondemned woman.This was a first introduction to basic personality. It was a long way from a lastacquaintance. It was found that it was possible to contact optimum brain operation in a numberof people.9"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"And the basic personalities contacted were invariably strong, hardy, and constructivelygood! They were the same personalities as the patients had in a normal state minus certainmental powers, plus electronic demons and plus general unhappiness. I found that a “hardenedcriminal” with an obvious “criminal mind” was, in basic personality, a sincere, intelligent beingwith ambition and cooperativeness.This was incredible. If this was basic brain, then basic brain was good. Then Man wasbasically good. Social nature was inherent! If this was basic brain—It was. That is, a “Clear”. But we pull ahead of the story.People were uniformly miserable being aberrated. The most miserable patient on therolls had an aberration that made her act “happy” and the most nervous aberree one would evercare to encounter had a mastering aberration about being always “calm”. She said she washappy and tried to make herself and everyone believe it. He said he was calm. He instantly flewinto a nervous fit if you told him he wasn’t calm.Tentatively and cautiously a conclusion was, drawn that the optimum brain is theunaberrated brain, that the optimum brain is also the basic personality, that the basicpersonality, unless organically deranged, was good. If Man were basically good, then only a“black enchantment” could make him evil.What was the source of this enchantment.Did we admit superstitions and demons as actualities and suppose the source wassomething weird and wonderful in the way of ectoplasm? Or did we part company with manycurrent beliefs and become something a little more scientific?The source, then, must be the exterior world. A basic personality, so anxious to bestrong, probably would not aberrate itself without some very powerful internal personal devil atwork. But with the devils and “things that go boomp in the night” heaved into the scrap heap,what did we have left? There was the exterior world and only the exterior world.Good enough: we’ll see if this works again. Somehow the exterior world gets interior.The individual becomes possessed of some unknowns which set up circuits against hisconsent, the individual is aberrated, and is less able to survive.The next hunt was for the unknown factor.The track looked pretty fair, so far, but the idea was to formulate a science, of thought.And a science, at least to an engineer, is something pretty precise. It had to be built on axiomsto which there are precious few, if any, exceptions. It has to produce predictable resultsuniformly and every time.Perhaps engineering sciences are this way because natural obstacles oppose theengineer, and matter has a rather unhandy way of refusing to be overlooked because someonehas an opinion. If an engineer forms an opinion that trains can run in thin air and so omits theconstruction of a bridge across a stream, gravity is going to take over and spill one train into thestream.Thus, if we are to have a science of thought, it is going to be necessary to haveworkable axioms which, applied with techniques, will produce uniform results in all cases andproduce them invariably.A great deal of compartmentation of the problems had already been done, as previouslymentioned or in the course of the work. This was necessary in order to examine the problemproper which was Man in the Universe.10"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"First we divided what we could probably think about and had to think about from whatwe probably didn’t have to think about, for purposes of our solution. Next we had to thinkabout all men. Then a few men. Finally the individual man and at last a portion of the aberrativepattern of an individual men.How did the exterior world become an interior aberration ?There were many false starts and blind passages just as there had been in determiningwhat an optimum brain would be. There were still so many variables and possible erroneouscombinations in the computation that it looked like something out of Kant. But there is noargument with results. There is no substitute for a bridge heavy enough to hold a train.I tried, on the off-chance that they might be right, several schools of psychology—Jung, Adler. Even Freud. But not very seriously because over half the patients on the rolls hadbeen given very extensive courses in psycho-analysis by experts, with no great results. Thework of Pavlov was reviewed in case there was something there. But men aren’t dogs.Looking back on these people’s work now, a lot of things they did made sense. But readingtheir work and using it when one did not know, they didn’t make sense, from which can beconcluded that rear-view mirrors six feet wide tell more to a man who is driving with apeephole in front than he knew when he was approaching an object.Then came up another of a multitude of the doctrines which had to be originated toresolve this work. The selection of importance’s. One looked at a sea of facts. Every drop inthe sea is like every other drop. Some few of the drops are of vast importance. How to findone? How to tell when it is important? A lot of prior art in the field of the mind—and as far as Iwas concerned, all of it—is like that. Ten thousand facts, all and each with one apparent unitimportance value. Now, unerringly select the right one. Yes, once one has found, by someother means, the right one, it is very simple to look over the facts and pick out the proper oneand say, “See? There it was all the time. Old Whoosis knew what he was doing.” But try itbefore you know! It’s a cinch Old Whoosis did not know or he would have red-tabbed the factand thrown the others away. So, with this new doctrine of the selection of importance’s, alldata not of personal testing or discovery was jettisoned. I had been led up so many blind alleysby unthorough observation and careless work on the part of forerunners in this business that itwas time to decide that it was much, much easier to construct a whole premise than it was to goneedle-in-the-haystacking. It was a rather desperate turn of affairs when this came about.Nothing was working. I found I had imbibed, unconsciously, a lot of prior errors which wereimpeding the project. There were literally hundreds of these “why everybody knows that”—which had no more foundation in experimentation or observation than a Roman omen.So it was concluded that the exterior world got interior through some process entirelyunknown and unsuspected. There was memory. How much did we know about memory ?How many kinds of memory might there be? How many banks was the nervous systemrunning on? The problem was not where they were. That was an off-track problem. Theproblem was what they were.I drew up some fancy schematics, threw them away and drew some more. I drew up agenetic bank, a mimic bank, a social bank, a scientific bank. But they were all wrong. Theycouldn’t be located in a brain as such.Then a terrible thought came. There was this doctrine of the selection of importance’s.But there was another, earlier doctrine—the introduction of an arbitrary. Introduce an arbitraryand if it is only an arbitrary, the whole computation goes out. What was I doing that hadintroduced an arbitrary? Was there another “why, everybody knows that—” still in thiscomputation?It’s hard to make your wits kick out things which have been accepted, unquestioned,from earliest childhood, hard to suspect them. Another sea of facts, and these in the memorybank of the computer trying to find them.11"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"There was an arbitrary. Who introduced it I don’t know but it was probably about thethird shaman who practiced shortly after the third generation of talking men had begun to talk.Mind and body.There’s the pleasant little hooker. Take a good look at it. Mind AND body. This is oneof those things like a ghost. Somebody said they saw one. They don’t recall just who it was orwhere but they’re sure—Who said they were separate ? Where’s the evidence? Everybody who has measured amind without the body being present please raise both his hands. Oh, yes, sure. In books. I’mtalking to you but I’m not there in the room with you right now. So mind is naturally separatefrom body. Only it isn’t. A man’s body can leave footprints. Those are products of the body.The products of the mind can also be viewed when the body is not there, but these are productsof and the product of the object is not the object.There can be a mind without a body— but we must not confuse the products of themind with the mind itself.So let’s consider these mental products and the body as a unity. Then the body remem-bers. It may co-ordinate its activities in a mechanism called the brain, but the fact is that thebrain is also part of the nervous system and the nervous system extends all through the body. Ifyou don’t believe it, pinch yourself. Then wait ten minutes and go back to the time you pinchedyourself. Time travel back. Pretend you are all back there. You will feel the pinch; that’smemory.All right. If the body remembers and if the mind and body are not necessarily twoitems, then what memories would be the strongest? Why, memories that have pain in them, ofcourse. And then what memories would be the strongest? Those which would have the mostphysical pain. But these are not recallable!Maybe it’s the wrong postulate, maybe people are in fifty pieces not just one, but let’stry it on for size.So I pinched a few patients and made them pretend they had moved back to the momentof the pinch. And it hurt them again. And one young man, who cared a great deal about scienceand not much about his physical being volunteered for a nice, heavy knockout.And I took him back to it and he recalled it.Then came the idea that maybe people remembered their operations. And so a techniquewas invented and the next thing I knew I had a memory of a nitrous oxide dental operation laidwide open and in recall, complete with pain.A great deal of experimentation and observation disclosed the fact that there were nomoments of “unconsciousness”. And that was another misconception which had held up Man’sprogress.“Unconsciousness”. Some day the word will either be gone or have a new meaningbecause just now it doesn’t really mean a thing.The unconscious mind is the mind which is always conscious. So there is no“unconscious mind”. And there is no “unconsciousness”. This made modern psychology looklike Tarawa after the marines had landed; for this is about as easy to prove as the statement thatwhen an apple is held three feet in the air and let fall, it drops, conditions being normal.It was necessary, then, to redraw all the circuit diagrams and to bring forth someterminology which would not be quite as erroneous as “unconsciousness” and “the un-12"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"conscious mind”.For handy purposes, in view of the fact that I had got myself into difficulties before byusing words with accepted meanings, I turned some adjectives into nouns, scrambled a fewsyllables and tried to get as far as possible from the focus of infection: Authority. By using oldterms, one interposes, in communication, the necessity of explaining away an old meaningbefore he can explain the new one. A whole chain of thought can get thoroughly jammed up intrying to explain that while this word meant . . . it now means . . . Usually, in communica-tions, one is not permitted to get beyond an effort to explain one does not mean . . .Now there is no reason here to go into an evolution of terms in Dianetics. The cycle ofthe evolution is not yet complete. And so I will place here terms which were long afterwardsconceived. They are not yet stet. But their definitions are not quibbles: the order of definition isclear in the order of apples are apples.The important thing is what we are defining. There were several heuristic principles onwhich the initial work was based which were “understand”. One was that the human mind wascapable of solving some of the riddles of existence. At this stage in the evolution of Dianetics,after “unconsciousness” had been smoked out of the “why, everybody knows that—” class ofinformation and labeled for what it was, an error, it was necessary to look over some of the“understood” postulates of 1938. And one of those “everybody knows” postulates has beenthat the human mind is not capable of understanding the workings of the human mind.And “everybody knew that” the human mind was liable to err, that it was stupid, andwas very easily aberrated by such small things as because papa loved mama and Jimmy wantedto love mama too.And “everybody knew that” the workings of the human mind were enormously com-plex; so involved that a complete direct solution of the problem was impossible. That, in effect,the human mind was a Rube Goldberg device built up of an enormously unstable and delicatelybalanced pile of oddshaped bits of emotion and experience, liable to collapse at any time.From the engineering viewpoint, that seems a little strange. Two billion years ofevolution, a billion successive test models, would tend to produce a fairly streamlined,functional mechanism. After that much experience, animal life would be expected to produce atruly functional mechanism—and Rube Goldberg’s devices are amusing because they are soinsanely non-functional. It somehow doesn’t seem probable that two billion years of trial anderror development could wind up with a clumsy, complex, poorly balanced mechanism forsurvival—and that jerry-built thing an absolute master of all other animal life!Some of those “everybody knows that—” postulates needed checking sand checkingout of the computation.First, everybody knows that “to err is human”. And second everybody knows that weare pawns in the hairy grasp of some ogre who is and always will be unknown.Only this didn’t sound like engineering to me. I’d listened to the voodoo drums in CapHaitian and the bullhorns in the lama temples of the Western Hills. The people who beat thosedrums and blew those horns were subject to disease, starvation and terror. Looked like we hada ratio at work here. The closer a civilization—or a man—moved toward admitting the ability ofthe human mind to compute—the closer the proposition was entered that natural obstacles andchaos were susceptible to orderly solution—the better he —or they—fared in the business ofliving. And here we were back with our original postulate again, SURVIVE! Now thiscomputation would be warranted only if it worked.But it was a not unwarrantable conclusion. I had had experience now with basic per-sonality. Basic personality could compute like a well greased Univac. It was constructive. Itwas rational. It was sane.13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"And so we entered upon the next seven league boot stride in this evolution. What wassanity? It was rationality. A man was sane in the ratio that he could compute accurately, limitedonly by information and viewpoint.What was the optimum brain? It was an entirely rational brain. What did one have tohave to be entirely rational ? What would any electronic computer have to have? All data mustbe available for inspection. All data it contained must be derived from its own computation or itmust be able to compute and check the data it is fed. Take any electronic calculator . . . no, onsecond thought, don’t take them. They’re not smart enough to be on the same plane with themind because they are of a greatly sub order of magnitude. Very well, let’s take the mind itself,the optimum mind. Compare it to itself. When did Man become sentiently It’s not absolutelynecessary to the problem or these results to know just when or where Man began to THINK,but let’s compare him to his fellow mammals. What does he have that the other mammals don’thave? What can he do that they can’t do? What does he have that they have ?All it takes is the right question. What does he have that they have? He does have some-thing—and he has something more than they have. Is it the same order? More or less. Younever met a dog yet that could drive a car, or a rat that could do arithmetic. But you have menthat couldn’t drive a car, and men that couldn’t do much better arithmetic than a rat. How didsuch men vary from the average ?It seemed that the average man had a computer that was not only better, it was infinitelyfiner than any animal’s brain. When something happens to the computer, Man is no longerMAN but a dog or a rat, for purposes of comparison in mental power.Man’s computer must be pretty good. After all those millions of years of evolution, itshould be—in fact it should, by this time, have evolved a perfect computer, one that didn’t givewrong answers because it couldn’t make a mistake. We’ve already developed electroniccomputing machines so designed, with such built-in self-checking circuits, that they can’t bytheir very nature, turn out a wrong answer. Those machines stop themselves and summon anoperator if something goes wrong so that the computer starts producing a wrong answer. Weknow how to make a machine that would not only do that, but set up circuits to find the error,and correct the erring circuit. If men have figured out ways to do that with a machine already—I had long since laid aside the idea that one could do this job by dissecting a neurone.Dead, they don’t talk. Now I had to lay aside the idea that the brain’s structural mechanismcould even be guessed at this stage. But working on the heuristic basis of what works, it is notnecessary to know how it is done in terms of physical mechanism if we can show that it isdone. It was convenient to use electronic circuits as analogs, and the analogy of an electronicbrain, because I knew the terms of these things. The brain may or may not run on electriccurrents; what things can be measured in and around it by voltmeters are interesting. Butelectricity itself is measured indirectly today. Temperature is measured by the coefficient ofexpansion caused by temperature. Encephalographs are useful working around a brain but thatdoesn’t mean that the brain is as clumsy and crude as a vacuum tube rig. This was a necessarystep because if the problem were to be solved one had to suppose that the brain could bepatched up and with some method decidedly short of surgery.So here was what I seemed to be working with: a computing machine that could workfrom data stored in memory banks, and was so designed that the computer circuits themselveswere inherently incapable of miscomputation. The computer was equipped with sensingdevices—the sensory organs—which enabled it to compare its conclusions with the externalworld, and thus to use the data of the external world as part of the checking feedback circuits.If the derived answer- did not match the observed external world, since the computing circuitswere inherently incapable of producing a wrong computation, the data used in the problemmust itself be wrong. Thus, a perfect, errorless computer can use external world data to checkthe validity of and evaluate its own data input. Only if the computational mechanism isinherently error-proof would this be possible. But men have already figured out mechanicallysimple ways of making an error-proof computer—and if Man can figure it out at this stage of14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"the game, two billion years of evolution could and would.How did the mind work ? Well, to solve this problem we did not have to know. Dr.Shannon commented that he had tried every way he could think of to compute the material inthe memory bank of the brain, and he had been forced to conclude that the brain could notretain more than three months’ worth of observations if it recorded everything. And Dianeticresearch reveals that everything is recorded and retained. Dr. McCulloch of the University ofIllinois postulating the electronic brain in 1949 is said to have done some computation to theeffect that if the human brain cost a million dollars to build, its vacuum tubes would have tocost about 0.1 cent each, that the amount of power it would consume would light New YorkCity and that it would take Niagara Falls to cool it. To these competent gentlemen we deliver upthe problems of structure. To date Dianetics has not violated anything actually known aboutstructure. Indeed, by studious application of Dianetic principles, maybe the problem ofstructure can be better approached. But at a swoop, we have all this off our minds. We aredealing with function and ability and the adjustment of that function to the end of obtainingmaximum operation. And we are dealing with an inherently perfect calculator.We are dealing with a calculator which runs entirely on the principle that it must be rightand must find out why if it isn’t right. Its code might be stated as, “And I pledge myself to beright first, last and always and to be nothing but right and never to be, under anycircumstances, wrong.”Now this is what you would expect of an organ dedicated to computing a life and deathmatter like survival. If you or I were building a calculator, we’d build one that would alwaysgive correct answers. Now, if the calculator we built was also itself, a personality, it wouldmaintain that it was right as well.Having observed this computer in its optimum state as the basic personality, the con-clusion was very far from a mere postulate. And so we call this computer the “analytical mind”.We could sub-divide things further and get complicated by saying that there is an “I” as well asa computer, but this leads off in another direction. And so the “analytical mind” or the“analyzer” is a computer and the “I” for our purposes. All we want is a good workablesolution.The next thing we must consider is what apparently makes Man a sentient being andthat consideration leads us into the conclusion that possession of this analyzer raises Man farabove his fellow mammals. For as long as Man is rational, he is superior. When that rationalityreduces, so does his state of being. So it can be postulated that it is this analyzer which placesthe gap between a dog and a man.Study of animals has long been popular with experimental psychologists, but they mustnot be mis-evaluated. Pavlov’s work was interesting: it proved dogs will be dogs. Now bylight of these new observations and deductions it proved more than Pavlov knew. It provedmen weren’t dogs. Must be an answer here somewhere. Let’s see. I’ve trained a lot of dogs.I’ve also trained a lot of kids. Once I had a theory that if you trained a kid as patiently as youtrained a dog, then you would have an obedient kid. Didn’t work. Hm-m-m. That’s right. Itdidn’t work. The more calmly and patiently one tried to make that kid into a well-trained dog—”Come here” and he’d run away—hm-m-m. Must be some difference between kids and dogs.Well, what do dogs have that kids don’t have. Mentally, probably nothing. But what do kidshave that dogs don’t have. A good analytical mind!Let us then observe this human analytical mind more closely. It must have a charac-teristic dissimilar to animal minds—minds in lower orders of mammals. We postulate that thischaracteristic must have a high survival value, it is evidently so prominent and widespread andthe analyzer—hm-m-m.The analyzer must have some quality which makes it a slightly different thinkingapparatus than those observed in rats and dogs. Not just sensitivity and complexity. Must have15"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"something newer and better. Another principle ? Well hardly a whole principle but—The more rational the mind, the more sane the man. The less rational the mind, thecloser Man approaches in conduct his cousins of the mammalian family. What makes the mindirrational ?I set up a series of experiments, using the basic personalities I could contact above orbelow the level of the aberrated personalities and in these confirmed the clarity and optimumperformance of the basic computer. Some of these patients were quite aberrated until they werein an hypnotic amnesia trance at which time they could be freed of operator control. Theaberrations were not present. Stutterers did not stutter. Harlots became moral. Arithmetic waseasy. Color-visio, tone audio recall. Color-visio, tone-audio imagination. Knowledge of whatwas imagination and what wasn’t. The “demons” had got parked somewhere. The circuits andfilters causing aberration had been by-passed to be more precisely technical and scientific.Now let’s postulate that the aberrative circuits have been somehow introduced from theexternal world—covered that ground pretty well, pretty solid ground.And here’s an answer. The introduced bypass circuits and filters became the aberrationsin some way we did not yet understand. And what new complexion did this give the analyzer?Further research tended to indicate that the answer might be contained in the term“determinism”. A careful inspection of this computation confirmed observations. Nothing wasviolated. Did it work ?Let’s postulate this perfect computer. It is responsible. It has to be responsible. It isright. It has to be right. What would make it wrong? Exterior determinism beyond its capacityto reject. If it could not kick out a false datum it would have to compute with it. Then, and onlythen, would the perfect computer get wrong answers. A perfect computer had to beself-determined within the limits of necessary efforts to solve a problem. No self-determinism,bad computation.The machine had to be in a large measure self-determined or it would not work. Thatwas the conclusion. Good or bad, did it lead to further results?It did.When exterior determinism was entered into a human being so as to overbalance hisself-determinism the correctness of his solutions fell off rapidly.Let’s take any common adding machine. We put into it the order that all of its solutionsmust contain the figure 7. We hold down 7 and put on the computer the problem of 6 x 1. Theanswer is wrong. But we still hold down 7. To all intents and purposes here, that machine iscrazy. Why? Because it won’t compute accurately so long as 7 is held down. Now we release 7and put a very large problem on the machine and get a correct answer. The machine is nowsand rational. It gives correct answers. On an electronic computer we short the 7 so it is alwaysadded in, no matter what keys are punched. Then we give the machine to a store-keeper. Hetries to use it and throws it on the junk heap because it won’t give correct answers and hedoesn’t know anything about troubleshooting electronics and cares less. All he wants is acorrect total.Admitting the analytical mind computation, and admitting it only so long as it works,where does it get a held-down 7—an enforced wrong datum?Now a computer is not necessarily its memory bank. Memory banks can be added anddetached to a standard computer of the electronic type. Where do we look for the error? Is it inthe memory bank?16"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The search for what was holding down 7 involved quite a little hard work and specu-lation and guesses. Some more work had to be done on the computer—the analytical mind.And then came what seemed to be a bright thought. Supposing we set up the whole computeras the demon. A demon that is always and invariably right. Let’s install one in a brain so thatthe computer can project outside the body and give the body orders. Let’s make the computer acircuit independent of the individual. Well, hypnotism has some uses. Good tool for researchsometimes even if it is a prime villain in aberration.Two things happened the moment this was done. The computer could direct the body asan “exterior entity” and draw on the memory banks at will for anything. Seven was no longerheld down.Naturally this was a freak test, one that could be set up only in an excellent hypnoticpatient. And it could be installed only as a temporary thing.This artificial demon knew everything. The patient could hear him when the patient wasawake. The demon was gifted with perfect recall. He directed the patient admirably. He didcomputations by moving the patient’s hand—automatic writing—and he did things the patientevidently could not do. But why could it ? We had artificially split the analyzer away from theaberrated patient, making a new by-pass circuit which by-passed all the aberrated circuits. Thiswould have been a wonderful solution if it had not been for the fact that the patient was soon aslave to the demon and that the control, after a while, began to pick up aberrations out of theplentiful store the patient had. But it served to test the memory banks.Something must be wrong about these banks. Everything else was in good order. Thebanks contained an infinity of data which appalled one in its very completeness. So thereensued a good, long search to find something awry in the banks. In amnesia sleep or undernarco-synthesis, the banks could be very thoroughly ransacked. By automatic writing,speaking and clairvoyance they could be further tapped.This was a mad sort of way to go about things. But once one started to investigatememory banks, so much data kept turning up that he had to continue.There’s no place here for a recital of everything that was found in the human memorybank, its completeness, exactness and minuteness or its fantastically complicated, but verysmart cross-filing system. But a resume is necessary of some high points.In the first place the banks contain a complete color-video record of a person’s wholelife, no matter the “demon” circuits. The last occlude or falsify. They do not alter the bank orthe accuracy of the bank. A “poor” memory means a curtained memory, the memory beingcomplete. Every perception observed in a lifetime is to be found in the banks. S1 theperceptions. In good order.Memories are filed by time. They have an age and emotional label, a state of physicalbeing label, and a precise and exhaustive record of everything perceived by organic sensation,smell, taste, tactile, audio and visio perceptics plus the train of thought of the analyzer of thatmoment.There is no inaccuracy in the banks. Inaccuracy can, of course, be caused by surgery orinjury involving actually removed portions. Electric shock and other psychiatric efforts areequivocal. Pre-frontal lobotomy is such certain and complete mind-murder that one cannot becertain thereafter of anything in the patient except zombiism.Anyway, the memory banks are so fantastically complete and in such good orderbehind the by-pass circuits in any man not organically tampered with, that I very nearly woreout the rug trying to conceive it. Very well, there was something between the banks and theanalyzer. Must be. The banks were complete. The circuits were intact. In any patientorganically sound, and that includes all patients who have psychosomatic ills—the basic17"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"personality was apparently intact, the banks were intact. But the banks and the analyzersomehow did not track.Well, let’s take another look. This is an engineering problem. So far it has surrenderedbeautifully to engineering thought and computation. Apparently it should go right onsurrendering. But let’s look at Freud. There’s his Censor. Let’s see if there’s a censor betweenthe banks and the analyzer.That folded up in about two seconds Mex. The censor is a composite of by-pass circuitsand is about as natural and necessary to a human being as the fifth wheel on a motorcycle.There isn’t any censor. Served me right for trying to lean on Authority. In terms of authority, ifyou can spell it, it’s right. In terms of engineering, if it can’t be found and measured in somefashion, it’s probably absent.I rechecked the memory banks. How was I withdrawing data ? I was using automaticwriting for some, by-pass circuit for others, direct regression and revivification on the old lineHindu principle for others. I set about trying to classify what kind of data I was getting witheach method of recall. All of a sudden the problem fell apart. By automatic writing I wasgetting data not available to the analyzer. By by-pass I was getting data not available otherwise.By regression and revivification material was being procured only a little better than could berecalled by the tranced subject. The data I could check was found to be invariably accurate byany of these methods. What was the difference between automatic writing data and simpletrance data?I took a patient’s automatic data and regressed him to its period. He could not recall it.The data concerned a broken leg and a hospital. I bucked him into the incident by main force.The patient received a very sharp pain in the area of the old break.This was a long way from hypno-analysis. This was an effort to find an interpositionbetween memory banks and analyzer, not an effort to relieve “traumatic experiences”.And there was the answer. Why not? Very simple. It had been sitting right there staringat me since 1938. Oh, these six-foot wide rear view mirrors! I had even made a law about it.The function of the mind included the avoidance of pain. Pain was unsurvival. Avoid it.And that’s it—the way to hold down seven. You can hold it down with physical pain!The exterior world enters into the man and becomes memory bank. The analyzer uses memorybank. The analyzer uses the exterior world. The analyzer is caught between yesterday’s exteriorworld now interior and today and tomorrow’s exterior world, still exterior.Can it just be that this analyzer gets its data on one perceptic circuit. Can it be that thatperceptic circuit carries yesterday and today both? Well, however that may be, the analyzercertainly behaves to yesterday’s interior world the same way it behaves to today’s exteriorworld so far as the avoidance of pain goes. The law works both ways.The analyzer avoids yesterday’s pain as well as today’s pain. Well, that’s reasonable. Ifyou avoid yesterday’s pain in today’s environment, you have a much better chance to survive.In fact. But see here, there’s more to the problem than this. If the analyzer had a clear view ofyesterday’s pain it could better avoid it in today. That would be good operation.That was the “flaw” in the machine. But it was a highly necessary “flaw”. Just becausean organism is built to survive, molded to survive and intended to survive does not mean that itwill, as a matter of course, be perfect.But the analyzer was perfect.18"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The banks were perfect.The analyzer just plain wouldn’t ever let the irrationalities of exterior world inside staylong as it could help it.As long as it could help it!I was probing now for the villain of the piece. He was not found for a while. Manyexperiments were made. Efforts were made to make several patients well by simply breakingthrough the pain wall the analyzer was “seeking to avoid”. A lot of painful incidents werebroken, mental and physical anguish by the library full, and without much relief. The patientsrelapsed.Then it was discovered that when a patient was bucked through a period when he was“unconscious”, he showed some improvement. Then it was discovered that these “uncon-scious” periods were rather like periods of hypnosis driven home by pain. The patientresponded as though the “unconscious period” had been post-hypnotic suggestion!From this series of experiments a prime datum was picked up.You relieve the pain and the “unconsciousness” and the suggestive power goes away.The subject did not have to have any of the mumbo jumbo of hypnosis in this “unconsciousperiod”. But every perceptic perceived tended to aberrate him.I did not realize until then that I was playing tag with a hitherto unappreciatedmid-evolution step in Man. If he was once a polliwog, he had never lost any of the parts he hadevoluted through. How does a fish think ?Well, let’s see how a fish would respond to pain. He is swimming in brackish water ofyellow color over a green bottom, tasting shrimp. A big fish hits him a whack, misses but doesnot kill him. Our fish lives to come back another day. This time he swims into an area ofbrackish water with a black bottom. He gets a little nervous. Then the water becomes a yellowcolor. The fish becomes very, very alert. He coasts along and gets over a green bottom. Thenhe tastes shrimp and instantly swims away at a terrific rate.Now, what if Man still had his lower organism responses? Well, it seemed, on ex-periment, that he did. Drug him with ether and hurt him. Then give him a whiff of ether and hegets nervous. Start to put him out and he begins to fight. Other experiments all gave the sameconclusion.Lower organisms can be precisely and predictably determined in their responses. Pav-lov’s dog. Any dog you ever trained. The dog may have something of an analyzer too, but heis a pushbutton animal. And so is Man. Ah, yes, so is Man. You know, just like rats.Only Man isn’t! Man has a wide power of choice. Interfere with that wide power andthere’s Double brewing. Aberrate him enough and he’s unpredictably push-buttonable. Cut hisbrain out with a knife—and he can be trained to speak woof-woof for his food. But by golly,you better cut pretty well to get a good, satisfactory one hundred percent of the timewoof-woof!What happens when a man gets “knocked out”? He “isn’t there”. But all the memoryrecordings during the period are. What happens when you knock him half out? He doesstrange, automatic things. What happens when his analyzer is so aberrated that . . . hey! Wait!How would you build a good, sensitive analyzer? Would you leave it connected to everyshock? Huhuh! You’d fuse it so it would live to think another day. In an emergency what kindof a response do you want ? Automatic!Stove hot, hand on stove, withdraw hand. Do you do a computation on that ? No19"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"indeed. What withdrew the hand ? The analyzer ? No. What happened to the analyzer for aninstant during the shock ? The analyzer goes out of circuit and leaves a mechanical determiningdirector in full charge! A good, fast identity-thinking director.The analyzer does not think in identities.It thinks in differences, similarities. When it loses its power to differentiate and thinksin identities—no, it never does that. That’s madness and the analyzer does not go mad. Butsomething around here thinks in identities. Start working on a patient and find out that hashequals snow equals an ache in the knee—that’s identity thinking.We don’t know here what really happens to that analyzer. But we do know that wehave found something which interposes between the banks and the computer. Somethingwhich thinks in identities, has a high priority over reason during moments of stress, can befound whenever a man is sent into some of yesterday’s unconscious moments.We know what it does now. It takes command when the analyzer is out of circuit.Whether or not it is the old style mind which Man did not shed while graduating to sentience bydeveloping an analyzer is beside the point. Whether or not it is a structural entity of acombination of “unconscious periods” is equally outside our concern here. We are working infunction and we want answers that work every time.Call this the reactive mind . It is a mind which is constructed to work in moments ofenormous physical pain. It is rugged. It works all the way down to the bottom and within amillimeter of death. Maybe it’s almost impossible to build a sharply sentient mind which wouldoperate under the terrible conditions of agony in which we find the reactive mind operating.Maybe the reactive mind . . . well, that’s structure. Here it is as function.The reactive mind thinks in identities. It is a stimulus-response mind. Its actions areexteriorly determined. It has no power of choice. It puts physical pain data forward duringmoments of physical pain in an effort to save the organism. So long as its mandates andcommands are obeyed it withholds the physical pain. As soon as the organism starts to goagainst its commands, it inflicts the pain.The fish, had he failed to swim away when in a danger area where he had beenattacked, would have been forced away by the crude mechanism of pain going intorestimulation. No swim equals aching side. Swim equals all right.The analyzer blows its fuses as any good machine would when its delicate mechanismis about to be destroyed by overload. That’s survival. The reactive mind kicks in when theanalyzer is out. That’s survival.But something must go wrong. This was a pretty good scheme of things. But it didn’talways work.Or it worked too well.Thus were discovered the reactive memory bank and its total contents, the engrams andtheir locks.An engram is an energy-picture. It is made during a period of physical pain when theanalyzer is out of circuit and the organism experiences something it conceives to be or which iscontrary to survival. An engram is received only in the absence of the analytical power.When the analyzer is out of circuit, data of high priority value can pass, without evalu-ation by the analyzer, into the memory bank. There it becomes a part of the emergency bank.This is a red-tab bank, the reactive mind, composed of high-priority, dangerous situationswhich the organism has experienced. The reactive mind has this bank as its sole source of20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"information. The reactive mind thinks in identities with this red-tab bank. So long as theanalyzer is fully in circuit the red-tab bank is null and void. With the analyzer partially out ofcircuit—as in weariness, drunkenness, or illness part of this bank can cut in.Let’s begin to call “unconsciousness” a new word: ANATEN. Analytical Attenuation.There is great or lesser anaten. A man goes under ether. He becomes anaten. He is hit in thejaw and is anaten.Now what does an engram contain ? Clinical examination of this object of interestdemonstrates that the engram consists of anaten, time, physical age, emotion, physical pain,and every perception in order of sequence. Words, sights, smells, everything that was there.We had to organize a new sub-science here to think about engrams properly. It’s thescience of Perceptics. Know your general semantics? Well, same organisation only we take inall the perceptics and we show where the meaning of each perceptic originates and why Mancan’t nonidentify with ease and aplomb so long as he has engrams.The automatic writing I was getting was straight out of engrams. That and by-passcircuits would disclose data received during anaten—engrams. And then I discovered that theseengrams had a peculiar faculty. They could create their own circuits, parasitically using the hostcircuits.Here’s how an engram can be established: Mary, age 2, knocked out by dog, dog bites.Content of engram: anaten; age 2 (physical structure); smell of environment and dog; sight ofdog jaws gaping and white teeth; organic sensation of pain in back of head (hit pavement); painin posterior; dog bite in cheek; tactile of dog fur, concrete (elbows on pavement), hot dogbreath; emotion; physical pain plus endocrine response; audio of dog growl and passing car.What Mary does with the engram: She does not “remember” the incident but sometimesplays she is a dog jumping on people and biting them. Otherwise no reaction. Then, at age 10similar circumstances, no great anaten, the engram is restimulated. After this she has headacheswhen dogs bark or when cars pass that sound like that car, but only responds to the engramwhen she is tired or harassed otherwise. The engram was first dormant—data waiting just incase. Next it was keyed-in—stuff we have to watch out for. Then it was thereafter restimulatedwhenever any combination of its perceptics appeared while Mary was in slight anaten (weary).When forty years of age she responded in exactly the same way, and still has not the slightestconscious understanding of the real reason!Now let’s consider what would have happened if Mary’s mama had yelled somethingreally choice; “Be calm! Be calm! Oh, my darling, it’s always this way. Get out, get out!”Something mama had tucked away as the proper thing to do and say when dogs bite daughters.We here have what amounts to a post-hypnotic suggestion: identity (equals) thought.All the perceptics equal all the words equals a dog equals mama equals get out, et cetera, etcetera, et cetera, and each equals all and any part of each. No wonder nobody could compute amadman! This is irrationality deluxe. Literally this computation of identity thought makes nosense. But it’s survival data and it better be obeyed or the cheek will hurt, the head will acheand the elbows will get a permanent “dermatitis”.But remember that this engram also had, as a tab, anaten, the exact degree of anatenpresent during that moment. The analyzer is a fine device but it is also, evidently, a physicalorgan, probably the pre-frontal lobes and organic sensation includes several things.Restimulation brings about this state of affairs: “Analyzer shut-off.” “Reactive mind to cells.Red-tab dog in sight. Shut off analyzer. This is a priority situation. That is all.”The degree of anaten is very far from the original in the facsimile. But it is sufficient toproduce a reduced state of analyzing, in effect a reduced sanity The subject just has a feeling ofdull, stupid mental confusion many times, a sort of dumb, unreasoned and unidentified21"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"emotion that seems to stop thought in numbness. You’ve had it! Thus we have a situationwhich begins to approach a pushbutton determinism. The engram which has become keyed-incan, when the individual is slightly anaten—weary, ill, sleepy—be push buttoned. Use the keyword to the slightly anaten subject which is contained in one of his engrams and one of thatengram’s reactions may be observed. Push the button thoroughly enough and a full drama-tization can be effected—he will re-enact the original situation!Thus the red-tab “memory” bank of the reactive mind. The discovery of this bank is oneof the several original discoveries of Dianetics. Many parts of Dianetics can be found, ifimproperly evaluated, in old philosophic schools or in modern practice, but there remain a fewentirely new facts which have no prior art. This red-tab bank is a very special affair and is quitedifferent in composition, content and circuit from the analytical banks—conscious bankscontaining data which can be “remembered”.The reason this bank was never discovered before is not difficult to find. The red-tabbank content was implanted when the analyzer was out of circuit—unconscious. It is locatedthen many strata below conscious awareness in the stupefaction of a physical knock-out. Whenone tried to get to it with hypnotism or narco-synthesis he was confronted with a patient whosimply looked knocked-out, who was unresponsive to everything. As narco-synthesis andhypnotism both savor of sleep, the deeper sleep of the composite whole of all the pastknock-outs of a lifetime render the patient entirely insensible even when one was squarely ontop of the reactive bank. So this bank remained hidden and unknown. And that is a sad thingbecause unless one knows about this bank the entire problem of Man’s imperfection, hisinsanity, his wars, his unhappiness, can go begging or get into the files of a shaman or aneurosurgeon. Much more widely, the hidden character of this bank can be said to be res-ponsible for irrational conduct on the part of all Mankind. And how many lives has that cost inthe last four thousand years ?It is a very peculiar sort of a bank. It is the only bank in the human mind from whichany content can be exhausted. All its content is pain and unconsciousness. And only physicalpain can be deleted from the mind. Now wouldn’t you say that this was a peculiar sort of abank ? Here it is full of experiences which, because of the way they are filed, can drive a manto suicide or other madness. Here it is with its memories all ready to click into the motorcontrols of the body, ready, without so much as a by-your-leave from the sentient analyzer, tomake a man run insanely until he drops from heart failure. Here it is able to change the perfectstructure of the body into a nightmare thing with a fetus-like face and wasted or undevelopedlimbs. Here it is ready to manufacture anything you can name by way of physical ills or at leastto predispose them, possibly even cancer. Here it is filling hospitals, mental institutions andjails. And yet it is the one portion of human memory that can be modified and changed!What price some of the old philosophies when the reducible “memory” is one of pain?Try any technique you can name on a pleasant or even a merely passing memory in oneof the conscious banks. It will stay right where it is, indelible, particularly the pleasurable ones.But a “memory” in the red-tab bank, when properly approached by Dianetic technique, willvanish out of that bank entirely. It refiles as a memory in the conscious level banks, and assuch, by the way, is fantastically difficult to locator the order of what you ate for dinner onJune 2nd when you were two years of age and when found bears the tag “found to benonsurvival data, do not permit it or similar data into any fundamental computations”. And oneof these unconscious “memories” when treated, produces about the same emotional responseafterwards as a mildly amusing joke.The red-tab bank could cause circuits to be set up which looked and sounded likedemons. It could occlude the conscious bank in part or so thoroughly that it appeared that therewas no past. It could command and order a person about like a moron might control a robot.And yet it is perishable. And it can be de-intensified and refiled, with consequent great increasein the survival chances of a man. All its content is contra-survival. When it is gone, survival isdemonstrably enhanced—and that means what it says and the fact can be proven in a clinical22"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"laboratory with an experiment on the order of “is this water?”Pleasure memories can be attacked with various techniques. But they are set. Theywon’t budge. Refile the reactive memories and the whole conscious lifetime of the individualsprings into view, brilliant and clear, unmodified by the by-pass circuits which are madness.Reduce the reactive bank and the optimum mind for the individual comes into view. Thereactive bank was neither the drive nor the personality of the individual—these are indelible andinherent.And another thing happens. The by-pass circuits and the reactive bank apparently standonly between the conscious banks and the analyzer. They do not stand between, for instance,the ear and the sonic file in the conscious bank, the eye and the visio file, et cetera. This is avery important discovery in its own right, for it means that an aberration, for instance, aboutthe inability to hear did not prevent all proper sound from being filed, about the inability to seecolor did not prevent all color from being filed. Clear away the reactive circuit which apparentlyprevented the observations and the analyzer finds itself possessed of whole banks of material itnever knew it had, all in proper sound and color, et al.For instance, a man who supposes that the whole world was ugly and sordid is guidedthrough therapy. The aberration which made the world seem ugly and sordid folds up when theengram or engrams to that effect deintensify and refile. The by-pass circuit these engramscaused to be set up did not prevent a full, true recording to be made, via all sensory channels.Therefore, when the analyzer is permitted to enter the files, the individual discovers that he hasinnumerable pleasurable experiences which, when they occurred, appeared to him to be uglyand sordid but which are now bright.This postulates another circumstance, interesting but not vital to Dianetics. The standardmemory banks of the mind are evidently not filled with memories which are entities capable ofwilly-nilly determinism on the individual. They are not automatically restimulated by theperception of something which suggests them in the environment. They are not hooked intocircuit on a permanent basis at all. They are filled with conclusions and the analyzer may pickup the old conclusions or create new ones which change the old. In other words, the standardbank is at the command of the analyzer and the individual; the individual is not at the commandof the standard banks.In short there is no such thing as conditioning. Conditioning is all right for rats anddogs and cats. They run on the reactive type bank. Therefore what we refer to, ordinarily, asconditioning, is actually an engram command laid down in a specific moment. This is easilysusceptible of clinical proof. The conditioning of a lifetime on the subject, say, of eating with aknife, breaks down the instant that the engram command demanding it is de-intensified.This is not theory, but actuality: conditioning in the absence of engrams on the subjectdoes not and cannot exist. Conditioning can be removed and will stay removed. There are thentwo things at work: the reactive mind commands certain actions and these can be altered by thede-intensification of engrams. The analyzer can hook up and arrange certain automaticresponses for various mechanical situations and actions. Call the reactive mind demand a habit,call the analytical requirement a training pattern. There are habits: these can be removed. Thereare training patterns: these can be altered only with the consent of the analyzer, which is to say,the individual. Practically all the survival patterns which really lead to survival are laid down onthe analytical level. The reactions in which people indulge which are contra-survival are laiddown on the reactive level.Conditioning, therefore, is another term which can be laid aside. The analyzer, workingwithout impedance by engrams, can lay down or take up training patterns at will. The reactivemind can lay down commands which make habits only when the exterior world implants suchcommands in the absence of full analytical power. Dianetics can break up habits, simply byrelieving the engrams which command them. Dianetics could only change a training pattern ifthe individual consented to it.23"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"These discoveries were an additional proof that Man was a self-determined individual.Further investigation led to another finding; that although the reactive bank was exteriordeterminism this determinism was a variable on the individual. In other words, the determinismlaid in by pain had a variable effect. The same engram introduced into three different peoplemight bring about three different reactions. Man is so thoroughly a self-determined organismthat he has a variable reaction to all attempted determinism Research brought about the fact thathe could exercise a power of choice over the reactive bank, even if in a limited manner.He had five ways to handle an engram: he could attack it and its counterpart in the ex-terior world, he could flee from it and its counterpart, he could avoid it and its counterpart, hecould neglect and its counterpart, or he could succumb to it. He was self-determined to somedegree within this group of reactions. And these are the reactions to any dangerous,contra-survival problem.These are, by the way, known as the “black panther mechanisms” in Dianetic parlance.Imagine that a black panther is sitting on the stairs. There are five ways of handling thesituation for a man sitting in the living room and who has a desire to go upstairs. He couldattack the panther, he could flee from it, he could avoid it by going outside and coming up viathe porch lattice or entice the panther away as another method of avoidance— he could simplyrefuse to admit it was a black panther and attempt to go up anyway, or he could simply lie stillin fear paralysis and hope that the black panther would either eat him quietly without too muchpain or merely walk off in antipathy to corpses. (Fear paralysis, denial of dangerousness.)Now an analyzer does not handle conscious level—standard bank—memories in thisfashion. The analyzer evaluates the present and future in terms of experience and education ofthe past plus imagination. The standard bank is used for computation, not for emotionalreaction, guilt, self-revilement, et cetera. The only valid data is that data in the standard bankand in its search for success, happiness, pleasure or whatever desirable end or merely in the artof contemplation, the analyzer must have reliable information and observation. It uses memory,conclusions drawn from experience and conclusions drawn from its conclusions and computesin various ways to obtain correct answers. It avoids a false datum as a curse once it knows it isfalse. And it is constantly re-evaluating the memory files to reform conclusions. The moreexperience it has, the better its answers. Bad experience is fine data for computation because itbrings in the necessity level. But the analyzer cannot compute reactive data, the “unconsciousmemories” it cannot reach and does not even know about.So these reactive “memories” aren’t memories at all as we understand memory. Theyare something else. They were never meant to be recalled on the analytical level or to beanalyzed in any way. The analyzer, trying to get around that red-tab bank sets up some circuitswhich would tax a Goldberg to duplicate. The analyzer is trying to reach its proper consciouslevel banks. If it can’t, it can’t compute right answers. If the analyzer keeps getting strange andseemingly sourceless material which nevertheless has pain to enforce its acceptance, thatanalyzer can get very wrong answers. And the structural body can go wrong. And motives gowrong. And somebody invents phrases like “it’s human to err”.No, reactive “memories” aren’t memories. So we call them by a good medical term, en-grams—a lasting trace—and modify the definition by qualifying “lasting”. They were certainlylasting enough pre-Dianetics.The engram is received, we can postulate, on a cellular level. The engram is cellularmemory by the cells and stored in the cells. We won’t go further with this because at presentwe want to stay out of the problems of structure. But we can prove to anyone’s satisfaction thatthe reactive mind bank is apparently inside the cells themselves, and is not part of the humanmind banks which are composited of, we suppose, nerve cells. Engrams are in any kind of cellin the whole aggregation. They do not in the least depend upon nervous structure to exist. Theyuse and prey upon nervous structure as we know it. So we are not talking about memory whenwe talk about engrams. We are talking about cellular recordings on the order of phonographrecords, smell records, organic sensation records, all very precise. And when we say reactive24"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"mind we are talking about no special part of the body but a composite, cellular level moronicmethod of remembering and computing. Someday somebody may cut off a chunk of brain andcry, “Eureka, this is the reactive mind”. Possibly. But staying with our functional computation,we can make good time and get workable results. And so we need to know no seat for thereactive mind. And we need to know nothing about the exact structure of its banks.All we want to know is what they do.The reactive engram comes in with pain when the analytical mind is more or less out ofcircuit. The engram is not recorded in the conscious level banks. It comes in on a cellular level,just as though the cells which compose the body, suddenly recognizing that the organism is inapparent danger of perishing, grab data in an effort to save themselves on the order of adisintegrated, every man for himself, effort. But the data they get is not disordered. It is mostterribly precise, most alarmingly literal. It is exact. “Bean” means “bean” in all the ways thesound of “bean” can mean “bean”.Once received, this engram can then lie dormant, inactive. It takes a remotely similar,conscious level experience to stir that engram up. This key-in moment evidently refiles theengram within the red-tab banks and gives it articulation. The words of the engram getmeaning. The perceptions get hooked into the sensory organs. The engram is now in place.After this it can be very easily restimulated. The cells are now capable of back-seat driving.Well, these are the discoveries. Once they had been made it was necessary to find outhow they could be applied.Man, we have postulated—and it is certainly working—is obeying the basic command,SURVIVE! This is a dynamic command. It demands action. In looking over the matter ofobedience to this command numerous computations were necessary. Survive. Well, the firstanswer and the too obvious one is that Man is surviving as a unit organism. A very thoroughcomputation on this—about two hundred thousand words— revealed the fact that whileeverything in the Universe could be explained by a few shifty turns of logic—in terms ofpersonal survival, the thing was unwieldly and unworkable. We want things to be workable.This is engineering, not idle study. We have a definite goal. So let us see if Man is all out forMan.The whole reason for the organism’s survival can be computed down into this singleeffort, the survival of contemporary Mankind. All the reason a unit organism survives is to letall Mankind survive. But that does not work well.Now let us take a group, under which we put symbiotes. Let us postulate that the unitorganism survives wholly for the group. Again, a computation can be made that explainseverything down to group. Group is the only reason, says this computation. It’s unwieldly butthere’s nothing wrong with it.All right, let’s try bringing it all down to sex. And still it can be computed perfectly, if itis a trifle unwieldly. The reason Man as a unit survives is to enjoy sex and create posterity. Butit requires an enormous number of heavy, cumbersome manipulations of logic that no onewould like.Investigating in the mind—going to the object one is studying and really examining itinstead of windily arguing about it and quoting authority—it was discovered that an apparentbalance existed only when and if all four drives were relatively in force. Each one computedwell enough, but taken as the four-fold goal they balance. The computing becomes verysimple. Behavior begins to look good. Using all four, we can predict.Now comes the proof. Can we use it? Does it work? It does. Impediments lie acrossthese drives. They have their own energy, these impediments, a reverse polarity surchargewhich inhibits the drive on which they lie. This is very schematic but it computes and we can25"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"use it in therapy. An unconscious period containing physical pain and conceived or actualantagonism to survival thwarts or blocks or impedes the flow of drive force. Begin to stack upthese impedance’s on a drive and it begins to damp markedly.Now comes arithmetic. There’s a good reason to use the figure four. There are fourdrives. There are four levels of physical tone. If a man’s composite drive force is considered asfour and his restimulated—acute or chronic, either way—reactive mind force is high enough toreduce that composite drive force below two, the individual is insane. In view of the fact that anengram can be currently restimulated to reduce that force below two, a condition of temporaryinsanity results.An engram can consist of father beating mother during a child’s anaten. When thisengram is highly restimulated, the child, now an adult, may possibly dramatize it either as thefather or the mother and will carry out the full drama, word for word, blow for blow.In view of the fact that when father beat mother, father was probably dramatizing one ofhis own engrams, another factor can be found here which is highly interesting. It is contagion.Engrams are contagious. Papa has an engram. He beats mother into anaten. She now has anengram word for word from him. The child was anaten, maybe booted aside and knocked out.The child is part of mother’s perceptics for that engram. Mother dramatizes the engram on thechild. The child has the engram. He dramatizes it on another child. When adulthood is attained,the engram is dramatized over and over. Contagion.Why do societies degenerate ? A race comes to a new place. New life, fewrestimulators— a restimulator being the environment’s equivalent to the engram’s percepticcontent —and high necessity level which means high drive. The race thrives on the newfrontier. And then begins this contagion, already present, brought in part from the oldenvironment. And the descending spiral can be observed.Having an engram makes one slightly anaten. Being slightly anaten one more easilyreceives new engrams. Engrams carry physical pain—psychosomatics—which reduces thegeneral tone and brings on further anaten. And in a rapidly descending spiral, the individualdecays.These were the computations achieved by research and investigation. Now it came tomaking them work. If they didn’t work, we’d have to change things and get new principles. Ithappens that the above works.But to start them working was a difficult thing. There was no way of knowing howmany engrams a patient might have. One could be cheerfully optimistic by this time. After all,there was a pretty good computation, some knowledge of the nature of the black enchantment,and it might be possible to bring about a “Clear”—optimum working condition of theanalyzer—in almost any patient. But the road was full of stones.Several techniques were developed all of which brought alleviation approximating acouple of thousand hours of psycho-analysis. But that wasn’t good enough. They could bringabout better results than hypno-analysis and bring them about much more easily. But thatwasn’t getting the train over the stream.I found out about locks. A lock is a situation of mental anguish. It depends for its forceon the engram to which it is appended. The lock is more or less known to the analyzer. It’s amoment of severe restimulation of an engram. Psycho-analysis might be called a study of thelocks. I discovered that any patient I had had thousands upon thousands of locks, enough tokeep me busy forever. Removal of locks alleviates. It even knocks down chronicpsychosomatic ills at times. It produces more results than anything else so far knownelsewhere, but it doesn’t cure. Removal of locks does not give the individual all his mentalpowers back, his audio-tone, visio-color, smell, taste, organic memory and imagination. And itdoesn’t particularly increase his IQ. I knew that I was far from the optimum analyzer.26"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"It was necessary to go back and back in the lives of patients looking for real engrams,total anaten. Many were found. Some were found that would release when the patient wasremoved in time back to them and was made to go over and over them, perceptic by perceptic.But there were also engrams that would not release, and they should have, if the originalcomputation was correct. The optimum computer must analyze the data on which it operates,and, once false data have been called to its attention for questioning, the self-checking featureof the computer should automatically reject that falsity.The fact that an engram wouldn’t release worried me: either the basic idea that the brainwas a perfect computer was wrong, or —hm-m-m. Before too long it was found that one hadto have the first instant of each perceptic before the later engram would go. That looked likeorder. Get the earliest pain associated with, for instance, a squeaking street car wheel and laterstreet car wheels, even in bad engrams, gave no trouble. The perfect computer wouldn’tovercome the short circuit at level 256 if the same circuit was shorted at level 21, but clear theshort circuit—the false data—where it first appeared, and then the computer could readily findand correct the later errors.Then began the most persistent search possible to find the earliest engram in anypatient. This was mad work. Utterly weird.One day I found myself with a complete birth engram on my hands. At first I did notknow what it was. Then there was the doctor’s patter. There was the headache, the eyedrops,Hello! People can remember birth when they’re properly bucked into it! Aha! Birth’s theearliest engram. Everybody has a birth. We’ll all be Clears!Ah, if it had been true! Everybody has a birth. And believe me, birth is quite an ex-perience, very aberrative. Causes asthma and eyestrain and somatics galore. Birth is no picnicand the child is sometimes furious, sometimes apathetic but definitely recording, definitely ahuman being with a good idea of what’s happening when he isn’t anaten. And when theengram rises, he knows analytically all about it. (And he can dramatize it, if he’s a doctor orshe can dramatize it, if she’s a mother.) But birth isn’t all the answer. Because people didn’tbecome Clears and stop stuttering and stop having ulcers and stop being aberrated and stophaving demon circuits when birth was lifted. And sometimes birth didn’t lift.The last was enough for me. There was an axiom: find the earliest engram. Knowwhere it wound up? Shortly before conception, for a body. Not all cases, fortunately. Somecases waited four days after conception before they got their first engram. The embryo anatenseasily; evidently there as cellular anaten.No statement as drastic as this—as far beyond previous experience as this can beaccepted readily. I have no explanation of the structure involved; for the engineering answer offunction, however, structural explanation is not immediately necessary. I was after one andonly one thing: a technical process whereby aberrations could be eliminated, and the fullpotentiality of the computational ability of the mind restored.If that process involved accepting provisionally that human cells achieve awareness onthe order of cellular engrams as little as a day or two after conception, then for the purposes athand that proposition can, and must be, accepted. If it had been necessary to go back throughtwo thousand years of genetic memory, I would still be going back to find that first engram—but fortunately there’s no genetic memory, as such. But there definitely is something which theindividual’s mind regards as prenatal engrams. Their objective reality can be debated by anyonewho chooses to do so; their subjective reality is beyond debate—so much so that the processworks when, only when, and invariably when we accept the reality of those prenatal memories.We are seeking a process that cures aberrations, not an explanation of the Universe, thefunction of life, or anything else. Therefore we accept as a working—because it works—postulate that prenatal engrams are recorded as early as shortly before conception. The objectivereality has been checked so far as time and limited means permitted. And the objective reality ofprenatal engrams is evidently quite valid. Any psychologist can check this if he knows Dianetic27"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"technique and can find some twins separated at birth. But even if he found discrepancies thebald fact remains that individuals cannot be rehabilitated unless the prenatal engrams areaccepted.What happens to a child in a womb? The commonest events are accidents, illnesses—and attempted abortions!Call the last an AA. Where do people get ulcers ? In the womb usually, AA. Fullregistry of all perceptics down to the last syllable, material which can be fully dramatized. Thelargest part of the proof is that lifting the engram of such an event resolves the ulcer!How does the fetus heal up with all this damage ? Ask a doctor about twenty yearshence—I’ve got my hands full. That’s structure, and right now all I want is a Clear.What’s that chronic cough ? That’s mama’s cough which compressed the baby intoanaten when he was five days after conception. She said it hurt and happened all the time. So itdid. What’s arthritis? Fetal damage or embryo damage.It so happens, it is now known, that a Clear can control all his body fluids. In anaberree the reactive mind does a job of that. The reactive mind says things have to be such andso and that’s survival. So a man grows a withered arm. That’s survival. Or he has inability tosee, hysterical or actual blindness. That’s survival. Sure it is. Good solid sense. Had anengram about it, didn’t he?What’s TB? Predisposition of the respiratory system to infection. What’s this, what’sthat ? You’ve got the proposition now. It works. The psychosomatic ills, the arthritis, theimpotence, this and that, they go away when the engrams are cleared from the bottom.That was the essence of the derivation of the technical process. With the research stagecompleted the actual application was the remaining stage, and the gathering of data on the final,all-important question. The process worked—definitely and unequivocally worked. But the fulldefinition of a science requires that it permit accurate description of how to produce a desiredresult invariably. Would the technique work on all types of minds, on every case ?By early 1950 over two hundred patients had been tested; of those two hundred people,two hundred cures had been obtained. Dianetics is a science because by following readilyprescribed techniques, which can be specifically stated, based on definitely stated basicpostulates, a specifically described result can be obtained in every case. There may,conceivably, be exceptions to the technique now worked out, but I tried honestly to findexceptions and did not; that’s why I tried so many cases, of so many different types. And someof them were really gruesome cases.Who is an aberree? Anybody who has one or more engrams. And since birth itself is avery engramic experience every human being born has at least one engram!The whole world, according to the hypnotist, needs nothing but to be hypnotized. Justput another engram, an artificial one, into a man, even if it’s a manic engram—makes thesubject “big” or “strong” or “powerful” plus all other perceptics contained—and he’s all right.That’s the basic trouble. Reduction of self-determinism. So we don’t use hypnotism. Besides,it’s not workable on any high percentage. If you’ve followed this far without realizing that weare trying to wake up an analyzer, you made the same mistake I did for many months. I tried towork with hypnosis. Well, it works, after a sloppy fashion. But how you put a man to sleepwho is already three-quarters asleep—normal, near as I can discover—is a problem I wishcould be solved. But fortunately it doesn’t need solution.The analyzer went to sleep with each engram. Each engram had locks—like it, alsoengrams, but subsequent to it—and each chains of engrams—same species, people have aboutfifteen or twenty chains on the average of ten or fifteen engrams to the chain —has about a28"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"thousand locks. There are luckless people who have hundreds of engrams. They may be sane.There are people who have twenty engrams and are insane. There are people who are sane foryears and suddenly get into just the right environment and get restimulated and go mad. Andanybody who has an engram he has had fully restimulated has been mad—vox populi—for atleast once, even if only for ten minutes.When we start to treat a person, we are treating a partially asleep analyzer—and theproblem is to wake him up in the first engram and then erase—that’s right erase, they vanishout of the reactive bank on recounting over and over with each perceptic—all subsequentengrams. The locks blow out without being touched, the Doctrine of the True Datum workingfull blast and the analyzer refusing to tolerate what it suddenly notices to be nonsense. And ashe recovers mental function enough to reach back a little way into his past, we begin toalleviate. Then we finally find out the reactive mind plot—why he had to keep on beingaberrated—and we blow out the demons—upsetting the circuits —and all of a sudden we are atbasic basic, first engram. Then we come forward, recounting each engram over and over untilit blows away and refiles as experience as opposed to command.A Clear has regression recall. Basic personality, in an aberree, isn’t strong enough togo back so we use what we call the Dianetic reverie.We found why narco-synthesis is so sloppy. It puts the partially restimulated engraminto full restimulation, keys all of it in. The drug turns off the somatic—physical pain—so thatit doesn’t wholly go away. And narco has no chance of going back far enough to get basicbasic and the one it reaches will pretend to erase and then will surge back in from sixty hours tosixty days.Does any special thing hold up a case? Yes, the sympathy computation. Patient had atough engramic background, then broke his leg and got sympathy. Thereafter he tends to goaround with a simulated broken leg— arthritis, et cetera, et cetera. These are hard to cracksometimes, but they should be cracked first. They make a patient “want to be sick”. Sicknesshas a high survival value says the reactive mind. So it tailors up a body to be sick, good andsick. Allies are usually grandmothers who protested against the child being aborted—effortalready made, child listening in, not knowing the words just then but he’ll know them laterwhen he knows his first words—nurses who were very kind; doctors who bawled mama out,et cetera, et cetera. Patient usually has an enormous despair charge around the loss of an ally.That’ll hold up a case.We’ve completely by-passed how this ties in with modern psychology. After all,modern psychology has labels for many observed conditions. How about schizophrenia, forinstance ?That’s valences An aberree has a valence for every person in every engram. He hasbasically three, himself, mother and father. Every engram has dramatic personnel. A valencebuilds up in the reactive mind and walls off a compartment, absorbing some of the analyzer—which is shut down by restimulation. Multi-valence is common to every aberree. The valenceof every aberree gets shifted day to day depending upon whom he meets. He tries to occupy thetop dog valence m every engramic dramatization. Taking this is the highest survivalcomputation that can be made by the reactive mind: always win. Break a dramatization and youbreak the patient into another valence. If you break him down to being himself in that engramhe will probably anaten or get sick. Keep breaking his dramatizations and he is disabledmentally.Who will practice Dianetics? In severe cases, doctors. They are well schooled in the artof healing, they are always being bombarded by psychosomatics and mental situations. Thedoctor has, like the engineer, a certain necessity for results. There are several methods ofalleviation which will work in a few hours, break up a chronic illness in a child, changevalences, change a person’s position on the time track—people get caught in various placeswhere the command says to be caught—alter dramatization pattern and generally handle the sick29"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"aberree.In the general case, however—the psychotic, neurotic, or merely sub-optimum indivi-dual—Dianetics will probably be practiced by people of intelligence and good drive on theirfriends and families. Knowing all the axioms and mechanisms, Dianetics is easy to apply to thefairly normal individual and can relieve his occlusions and colds and arthritis and otherpsychosomatic ills. It can be used as well to prevent aberrations from occurring and can evenbe applied to determine the reactions of others. Although the fundamentals and mechanisms aresimple and, with some study, very easily applied, partial information is dangerous, the tech-nique may be the stuff of which sanity is made but one is after all engaging action with the verystuff which creates madness and he should at least inform himself with a few hours studybefore he experiments.I have discussed here the evolution of Dianetics. Actually I have concentrated uponAbnormal Dianetics. There are Medical Dianetics, Dynamic Dianetics—drives and structure-Political Dianetics, Military Dianetics, Industrial Dianetics, et cetera, et cetera, and not the leastPREVENTIVE DIANETICS. On that may hang the final answer to society.And now as an epilogue, Dianetics is summarized in its current workable form. It doesthe following things, based on an ample series of cases:1. Dianetics is an organized science of thought built on definite axioms; it apparentlyreveals the existence of natural laws by which behavior can uniformly be caused or predicted inthe unit organism or society.2. Dianetics offers a therapeutic technique with which we can treat any and all inorganicmental and organic psychosomatic ills, with assurance of complete cure in unselected cases. Itproduces a mental stability in the “cleared” patient which is far superior to the current norm.(This statement is accurate to date; it is conceded that further work may demonstrate someparticular case somewhere which may not entirely respond.)3. In Dianetics we have a method of time dislocation dissimilar to narco-synthesis orhypnosis which is called the Dianetic reverie; with it the patient is able to reach events hithertohidden from him, erasing the physical and mental pain from his life.4. Dianetics gives us an insight into the potential capabilities of the mind.5. Dianetics reveals the basic nature of Man and his purposes and intents, with thediscovery that these are basically constructive and not evil.6. Dianetics gives us an appreciation of the magnitude of events necessary to aberrate anindividual.7. With Dianetics we discover the nature of pre-natal experience and its precise effectupon the post-natal individual.8. Dianetics discovered the actual aberration factors of birth.9. Dianetics elucidates the entire problem of “unconsciousness” and demonstrates con-clusively that “total unconsciousness” does not exist short of death.10. Dianetics shows that all memories of all kinds are recorded fully and retained.11. Dianetics demonstrates that aberrative memories lie only in areas of “unconscious-ness” and, conversely, that only “unconscious” memories are capable of aberrating.12. Dianetics opens broad avenues for research and poses numerous problems forsolution. One new field, for instance, is the sub-science of Perceptics—the structure and30"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"function of perceiving and identifying stimuli.13. Dianetics sets forth the non-germ theory of disease, embracing, it has been esti-mated by competent physicians, the cure of some seventy percent of Man’s pathology.14. Dianetics offers hope that the destruction of the function of the brain, by shock orsurgery, will no longer be a necessary evil.15. Dianetics offers a workable explanation of the various physiological effects ofdrugs and endocrine substances and points out numerous answers to former endocrineproblems.16. Dianetics gives a more fundamental explanation of the uses, principles and funda-mentals of hypnotism and similar mental phenomena.17. To sum up, Dianetics proposes and experimentally supports a new viewpoint onMan and his behavior. It carries with it the necessity of a new sort of mental hygiene. Itindicates a new method of approach to the solution of the problems which confrontgovernments, social agencies, industries, and, in short, Man’s sphere of endeavor. It suggestsnew fields of research. Finally it offers a glimmer of hope that Man may continue his processof evolution toward a higher organism without straying toward the danger point of his owndestruction.This is part of the story of the search. I wrote it for you this way because you haveminds with which to think. For strictly professional publications, I can, will, and have dressedthis up so it is almost impossible to understand, it’s so exact. Here I have told you the story asis and I have given you the major results exactly as they turned out.It is indeed fortunate for Mankind that the social and personal aberrations, travelingfrom Egypt’s time and before, piling up higher and higher, being broken only by new landsand new mongrel races, have not been as impenetrable a barrier as they could have been. Thatbarrier is slavery. Man’s effort to enslave Man so that Man can be free. Wrong equation. That’sthe Road to nowhere.We’ve a magic word to break it and a science to be applied. Dianetics is the beginningof the Road to Total Freedom for Mankind. Up there are the stars. Down in the arsenal is anatom bomb. Which one is it going to be?31"}]
