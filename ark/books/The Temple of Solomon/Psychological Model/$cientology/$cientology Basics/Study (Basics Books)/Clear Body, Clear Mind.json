Megan ShieldBachelor of Science, Doctor of MedicineDrugs, toxic chemicals, pesticides and other life-hostile elements currently pervade thesociety in which we five Other than choosing to live in a sealed environment, cut off from theremainder of the race, there is no way a person can avoid exposure to these toxic influences.The magnitude of the problem cannot be overstated. Chemical elements harmful to livingtissue have been found to accumulate in the human body. This has far-reachingconsequences: a person Who was involved in taking drugs and who later stopped can yet beinfluenced by a drug, even years later. Pesticide residues found in food accumulate in thefatty tissues of the body; factory workers inhale toxic fumes from manufacturing processes;firefighters are exposed to the smoke of fires that can sometimes contain deadly poisons.Cases can be recited endlessly.Customary medical procedures held no solution to this problem. Various Treatments” havebeen proffered which ranged from the psychiatric viewpoint of getting the person to believethat the problems he was experiencing from toxins were all in his mind, to the administrationof drugs to suppress the symptoms exhibited. These “treatments” only serve to compound thesituation.No breakthrough was made at all until L. Ron Hubbard attacked this problem head-on.He found that people with histories of taking drugs had less than optimum reactions tosituations in life and less success in handling their jobs and relationships. When the effects ofthese drugs were reduced, people’s ability to survive well was enhanced. Over the years Mr.Hubbard developed various methods of achieving a reduction of the effects of drugs.In 1979 his researches as described in this book, culminated in the Purification program. Thisis the first and only regimen in existence that has been shown in scientific studies to reducethe level of toxic material stored in the body and to do so safely and Without theadministration of any further drugs.L. Ron Hubbard claimed no medical results for his work; his intention was to make itpossible for people to achieve future mental and spiritual improvement. However, thePurification program has extremely broad application, as all truly basic discoveries do.In the course of my stork, I have had the opportunity to observe firsthand the results of thePurification program, and have found them to be nothing less than miraculous. The people Ihave put through the program include patients with minor effects of residual toxins peoplewho were exposed to toxic chemicals on the job, casual drug users and long-term heavy drugusers with bodies ravaged from the effects of those drugs. The depression, hopelessness andfear which often accompany such problems were also evident in many of these patients. Uponcompletion of the Purification program, these people were changed, both physically andmentally.The common theme expressed by people who have completed the program is that they are nolonger encumbered by the chemicals which were shutting off their lives. They expressincreased mental clarity and new hope for the future. Their lives upon completion of theprogram are happier, healthier and more productive.Since the release of this program in 1979, tens of thousands of people have completed it. Ihave had the privilege of being able to use the program in my own practice, helping peoplenacho otherwise would have had no hope of recovery from the effects of drug and toxinresiduals. In view of the increasing presence of toxic chemicals in industry, the proliferation1"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"of toxic waste and pollution and the epidemic use of destructive drugs at all levels of society,the importance of the Purification program, not only to the medical profession but to thesociety as a whole, becomes immediately apparent.The Purification program developed by L. Ron Hubbard is the only procedure of its kind andit is the only detoxification program that actually works. This program is one of the majordiscoveries of our times. It is also one of the most vital actions that must be done to salvage acivilization that is dying from the devastating effects of drugs and toxins.Megan Shields is a Bachelor of Science and Doctor of Medicine who practices as a medicaldoctor in Los Angeles, California. She has administered the delivery of L. Ron Hubbard’sPurification program to over three thousand people in the course of her practice. She has alsoparticipated in independent scientific studies of the efficacy of the program.2"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The PurificationProgram:Theory, Principlesand Elements3"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"OUR BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETYThe planet has hit a barrier which prevents any widespread social progress—drugs and otherbiochemical substances.These can put people into a condition which not only prohibits and destroys physical healthbut which can prevent ants stable advancement in mental or spiritual well-being.That’s the situation today.We live in a biochemical society.Bio means “life; of living things.” (It is from the Greek Word bios, which means “life” or“way of life.”)Chemical means “of or having to do with chemicals.” And chemicals are the substances,simple or complex, which are the building blocks of matter.By biochemical is meant “the interaction of life forms and chemical substances.”Toxic substance is a term which has been used to describe drugs, chemicals, or any substanceshown to be poisonous or harmful to an organism. The word toxic comes from the Greekword toxikon which originally meant a poison in which arrows were dipped.The human body is made up of certain exact chemicals and chemical compounds, andcomplex chemical processes go on continuously within it. Some substances, such asnutrients, air and water, are vital to the continuation of these processes and for maintainingthe body’s health. Some substances are relatively neutral when entered into the body, causingneither benefit nor damage. Colic substances are those which upset the bodies normalchemical balance or interfere with its chemical processes. Some of them can wreak havoc,blocking or perverting vital body functions and making the body ill or even killing it.Detoxification would be the action of removing a poison or a poisonous effect fromsomething (such as from one’s body).TOXINS IN ABUNDANCEThere has been an enormous volume of material written on the subject of toxic substances,their reported effects and the prospects for their handling. Examples abound in publicationsand news reports.Unfortunately, the current environment is becoming permeated with these life-hostileelements. Drugs, radioactive wastes, pollutants and chemical agents of various types are all apart of the scene and, apparently, more and more prevalent as time goes on.According to studies, even some of the things that are put in a can of peas or a can of soup areto be considered toxic.They are preservatives and the action of a preservative is to impede decay. Yet digestion andcellular action are based on decay. In other words, those things might be great for themanufacturer as they preserve his product, but they could be very bad for the consumer. It isnot that I am on a food faddism kick or a kick against preservatives; the point is that man issurrounded by toxins. This one example alone (preservatives in foods) is an example of thedegree to which one can be confronted with toxic substances in the course of daily living.And with the enemies of various countries using widespread drug addiction as a defeatistmechanism, with nations vying with each other in the manufacture and testing of nuclear4"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"weapons (and so increasing the amount of radioactive material free in the environment), withpainkillers and sedatives so easily available and with the increased use of industrial andagricultural chemicals, to say nothing of the substances developed for chemical warfare, weface a growing problem.Putting it quite bluntly, this society, at this time, is riddled with toxic substances.To briefly point out certain data regarding those substances which pose a threat to individualsand to society at large Will bring the biochemical situation more clearly into focus.STREET DRUGSResearch has demonstrated that the single most destructive element present in our currentculture is drugs.The acceleration of widespread use of drugs such as LSD, heroin, cocaine, “angel dust,”marijuana and a long list of others has contributed heavily to a debilitated society.Reportedly, some of these can cause brain and nerve damage. Marijuana, for example, sofavored by college students who are supposed to be getting bright today so they can be theexecutives of tomorrow has been reported capable of causing brain atrophy. Even schoolchildren have been shoved into drugs. And children of drug-taking mothers have been born asdruggies.I have even established that there is such a thing as a “drug personality.” It is artificial and iscreated by drugs. Drugs can apparently change the attitude of a person from his originalpersonality to one secretly harboring hostilities and hatreds he does not permit to show on thesurface. While this may not hold true in all cases, it does establish a link between drugs andincreasing difficulties with crime, production and the modern breakdown of social andindustrial culture.The devastating physiological effects of drugs are the subject of newspaper headlinesroutinely. That they also result in a breakdown of mental alertness and ethical fiber is all tooobvious.The drug scene is planet wide. It is swimming in blood and human misery.But, vicious and damaging though they are, street drugs are actually only one part of thebiochemical problem.MEDICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC DRUGSMedical and most particularly psychiatric drugs (Valium, Lithium and LSD to name but afew) can be every bit as damaging as street drugs. The prevalence of these currently incommon use would be quite amazing to one unfamiliar with the problem.Phenobarbital (under various brand names like Luminal and Nembutal) and other such drugsare often administered as though they were a panacea for all ills. As early as 1951 manypersons had become so accustomed to their daily dosage of sleeping pills or painkillers thatthey did not consider their little pills as drugs. More recently the drug Valium has taken itsplace among the tranquilizers so frequently employed. But this by no means completes thelist.Too often the attitude is “If I can’t find the cause of the pain, at least I’ll deaden it.” In thecase of one mentally ill, this might read, “If he can’t be made rational, at least he can be madequiet.”5"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Unfortunately, it is not recognized that a person whose pain has been deadened by a sedativehas himself been deadened by the same drug, and is much nearer the ultimate pain of death. Itshould be obvious that the quietest people in the world are the dead.COMMERCIAL PROCESSES AND PRODUCTSIn recent years much research has been done on the potential toxic effects of many of thesubstances commonly used in various commercial processes and products, and to what extentthey may be finding their way into the bodies of this planet’s inhabitants. Following are a fewexamples of what this research has brought to light.Industrial Chemicals: Under this heading exists a vast array of chemicals that are used inmanufacturing. Not all such chemicals are toxic, of course. But workers in factories whichproduce or use such things as pesticides, petroleum products, plastics, detergents andcleaning chemicals, solvents, plated metals, preservatives, drugs, asbestos products,fertilizers, some cosmetics, perfumes, paints, dyes, electrical equipment, or any radioactivematerials can be exposed, often for extended periods, to toxic materials. And of course, theconsumer can be exposed to residual amounts of such chemicals when he uses these products.Agricultural Chemicals: Pesticides are the most obvious of the toxic substances to whichworkers in agricultural activities could be exposed. These include insecticides (insect-killingchemicals), man-made fertilizers and herbicides (chemicals to kill unwanted plants such asweeds).Under the heading of herbicides come several which contain a substance known as “dioxin,”known to be a highly toxic chemical, even in amounts almost too small to detect in the body.(Dioxin is found in “Agent Orange,’’ a chemical defoliant used in the Vietnam War. Thischemical was the subject of considerable publicity when it was found that some US soldierswere exposed to it, apparently with varying adverse effects.)Contact with chemicals used in agriculture can occur in a number of ways: The chemical canbe carried on or in the plant itself and so eaten; it can be carried on the wind and be breathedin directly by those living or working in agricultural areas; or it can even be carried intodrinking water supplies.Food, Food Additives and Preservatives: There are substances added to some commerciallyprocessed foods that are meant to “enhance” color or flavor or, as mentioned above, to keepthe food from spoiling. Also becoming more common are various artificial sweeteners usedin “diet” soft drinks and other commercially packaged foods. From research on these“enhancers” and “preservers,” it appears that a number of them are quite toxic, and the wholesubject of food additives and preservatives has become a matter of concern to many people.There is another side to this matter of food. Research findings point to the possibility thatrancid oils are a health hazard of a magnitude not previously suspected. Oils used in cookingor commercial processing of foods, where they are not fresh, pure and free of rancidity, havebeen linked by researchers with digestive and muscular ills, and even cancer.Perfumes and Fragrances: Use of perfumes and fragrances in all sorts of products has becomemore and more prevalent in recent years. Everything from clothing to laundry detergent, fromcellophane tape to wrapping paper is turning up with fragrance added to it. And that fragranceis almost always a cheap chemical derivative, an extract of coal tar which probably costsabout 10 cents a fifty-gallon drum. Findings seem to bear out that these chemicals, floatingabout in the local supermarket as “fragrances,” are actually toxic and can end up in the foodproducts sold there. And when you get a mouthful of this stuff it is no aid to digestion,believe me!6"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Radiation: You’ve no doubt seen in news publications that contact with radiation can occurthrough exposure to nuclear weapons tests or the radioactive particles they can release intothe atmosphere, nuclear wastes, or to some manufacturing processes which use radioactivematerials. There are other sources of radiation exposure, too: prolonged exposure to the sun,dental and medical X-rays, television sets and unshielded computer display screens areamong them.Recent research has been done into a naturally occurring radioactive gas known as radon. It isa product of the decay of another radioactive element, radium, which has been found to bepresent in minute amounts in the ground and in many building materials such as concrete,brick and gravel. Apparently, tiny amounts of radon gas can escape from the surfaces of suchmaterials and thus be present in the air and inhaled. If ventilation is not provided for, theradon content of the air in a building can reportedly reach 50 to 100 times the level foundoutdoors.These factors are all part of the biochemical problem. Any of these substances reportedly hasthe potential of remaining in the system. This compounds the biochemical problem andpresents a barrier of magnitude.The most likely place for a toxic substance to lock up is in the fatty tissue. It has been saidthat in middle age and past middle age, a body’s ability to break down fat lessens. So here wehave, apparently, a situation of toxic substances locked up in fatty tissue and the fatty tissue isnot actually getting broken down, and so such toxic substances could accumulate.My interest in these somewhat brutal truths was not born only of an objective to resolve thephysical ills of individuals. Rather, it was a continuation of my initial research involving thefreeing of man as a spirit and handling, on this route, any barriers needing to be resolved.The Purification program is a proffered answer to the barrier we call the biochemicalproblem. It could be called a “long-range detoxification program.” While it is addressedprimarily to the handling of drug residues lodged in the body, it is possible that there aremany toxic substances which the body accumulates which the program may accelerategetting rid of.My concern in developing the Purification program has not been with handling bodies. Myresearch for many, many years has been carried out with the purpose of freeing manspiritually. My original inquiry was into the nature of man and the bulk of my work hasalways addressed man as a spiritual being. When barriers to this have arisen, those barriershave merited further research and resolution.The Purification program was developed to meet a growing threat to mental and spiritualadvancement and well-being stemming from the more and more common use of drugs andbiochemical substances in the current culture. Its procedures do not supplant technologydeveloped earlier, used especially in Narconon drug rehabilitation centers for handlingpersons currently on drugs and apt to experience withdrawal symptoms when taken off them.The Purification program would be begun only after such technology was applied.There are no medicines or drugs used on the Purification program. The only dosagesrecommended are those classified as food. There are no medical recommendations or claimsmade for the program. The only claim is future spiritual improvement.The data contained herein is a record of researches and results noted; it cannot be construedas a recommendation for medical treatment or medication, and it is undertaken or deliveredby any individual on his own responsibility.If the Purification program can be used to salvage even a part of a civilization sick from theonslaught of drugs and other toxic substances, then perhaps there is hope for all of thatcivilization.7"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Developmentof thePurification Program8"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"WHAT IS THE PURIFICATION PROGRAM?To state it simply, it is a program developed to assist in releasing and flushing out of the bodythe accumulated toxic residues which may be lodged in the tissues, while also rebuilding theimpaired tissues and cells. What is its genesis?DISCOVERY THAT LSD CAN LODGE IN THE SYSTEMIn the 1970s, working with cases of individuals who had been drug users, and in a study oftheir physical symptoms and behavioral patterns, I made a startling discovery.People who had been on LSD at some earlier time sometimes had reactions which appearedto act as if they had just taken more LSD!As it has been stated that it takes only one millionth of an ounce of LSD to produce a druggedcondition and because it is basically wheat rusty which simply cuts off circulation, myoriginal thinking on this was that LSD must remain in the body.9"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"In other words:LSD apparently stays in the system, lodging in the tissues, and mainly the fatty tissues of thebody, and is liable to go into action again—giving the person unpredictable “trips”—evenyears after the person has come off LSD.This was an observable phenomenon—dramatically so!In the face of this discovery, was it then also possible that residues of other drugs could lockup in the system and at some point reactivate with similar, if less dramatic, effect?And if so, how did one then ever fully free people from the effects of drugs? Were theysimply doomed thereafter to be at the effect of drugs whenever these residues chanced toreactivate?What of the other debilitating effects of the presence of these drug residues? It was knownthat drugs burn up vitamin reserves. What other physical consequences might stem from thehidden presence of such drug deposits?10"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"One could not ignore the possibility that, even when “dormant”—if that expression canindeed ever be used for a toxic substance—they might be highly damaging to the organism.And what of the potential spiritual and mental growth of individuals so affected? For it wasalso an observable fact that one was faced with some unchanging characteristics in a certainnumber of these cases, even when much of the mental and spiritual trauma of drugexperiences had apparently been relieved. Among these characteristics was a “woodenness”of personality and a noticeable difficulty in the ability to absorb and comprehend or retainand apply new data—in other words, an impaired ability to learn or change.WHAT WAS THE ANSWER TO THESE CASES?No known method existed for ridding the body of these minute drug deposits which, lockedas they were in the tissues, were not totally dispelled in the normal processes of elimination.The answer obviously did not lie in attempting to handle with more drugs or biochemicalswhich would only compound the situation.But could a method be evolved to dislodge and flush them out, thereby freeing the person forfull rehabilitation physically as well as mentally and spiritually?THE ORIGINAL SWEAT PROGRAMOperating on the premise that the negative factors observed might be reversed if there were ameans of getting LSD deposits out of the system, and that the most logical method toaccomplish this would be to sweat them out, I worked out and released in 1977 a regimencalled “The Sweat Programs Utilized mainly by those who had been heavily into drugs,particularly LSD, the procedure produced positive results. With it, evidences of the release ofresidues of other types of street drugs began to appear.The regimen was a lengthy process, however, taking months to complete. A refinement andspeed-up was needed.DISCOVERY OF OTHER EMBEDDED TOXINSUsing data and proven theories from earlier researches over the years, development wasbegun of a more comprehensive program, broader nutritionally and more streamlined.From its earliest application another factor emerged which tended to support the theoriesupon which this new program was based: persons on the research program were reporting theapparent exudations of substances other than just street drugs— substances smelling ortasting or feeling like medicines, anesthetics, diet pills, food preservatives, pesticides and anynumber of other chemical preparations in common use!The list included not only LSD, heroin, cocaine, marijuana and “angel dust,” but many otherbiochemical substances— medicinal and pharmaceutical drugs such as aspirin and codeine,as well as commercial and agricultural and industrial chemicals.These same persons were also experiencing, in mild form, some of the sensations of oldsunburns, past illnesses and injuries and other past conditions, both physical and emotional.Thus it seems that residues of any or all of these hostile biochemical substances apparentlyhave the potential of remaining in the system, getting caught up in the tissues and remainingthere, unsuspected, even after they have supposedly been eliminated from the body yearsearlier.11"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Their accumulation, unhandled, probably disarranges the biochemistry and fluid balance ofthe body.This was my early thinking on the subject. It was now being borne out by further research, asmore and more manifestations occurred. (It has also since been borne out by clinical tests andby medical autopsies which have found deposits of certain drugs embedded in body tissues.)With the ongoing research, all indicators were that these substances were being flushed out aspeople progressed on the program. And these same individuals were reporting that they felt anew vigor, a renewed vitality and interest in life.With a large number of people coming successfully through the regimen the research wascompleted.The Purification program was released.ELEMENTS OF THE PURIFICATION PROGRAMThe Purification program is a precisely designed regimen. It includes the following elements:* Exercise, in the form of running, to stimulate the circulation.* Prescribed periods in a sauna, which, accompanied by certain vitamins and othernutrients, enable one to sweat out the accumulated toxins.* A nutritional program, including:One’s regular diet which is then supplemented with plenty of fresh vegetables which are notovercooked.AN EXACT REGIMEN OF VITAMIN, MINERAL AND OIL INTAKE.Sufficient liquids to offset the loss of body fluids through sweating.A properly ordered personal schedule which provides the person with the normally requiredamount of sleep.These are not unfamiliar actions to the majority of us.How then can they accomplish what they apparently do? Why this particular set of actions?How is it that these elements, combined, might accomplish what no one of them apparently,singly or even in other combinations, has accomplished heretofore?While the procedures to be followed are not unusual, the answers to these questions lie in thevery exact combination of the elements which make up the program, in the properties of thenutrients used in specific increments and in the increased proportions of these in exact ratio toeach other, as laid out in detail in the next chapters of this book.WARNINGThere is a warning which should be stressed in any description of this program. That is,simple and familiar as the outlined actions may appear:They must be followed exactly for the best possible results.12"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Because of the technical nature of the program, and because it is a strenuous program it mustonly be undertaken after a physical examination and written approval from a medical doctor.Anyone with a weak heart or who is anemic or who suffers from certain kidney conditions,for example, should not do this program but would require a similar but special program of amilder nature.Additionally, while doing the program people have reported reexperiencing various effects ofpast drugs, medicine, alcohol or other stimulants or sedatives—including full-blown drug“trips.” For this reason, and for its success on any individual, it is best done under the closesupervision of persons trained and experienced in its administration.Also, even with this tight supervision, one does not do the actions by himself but alwayscarries these out accompanied by a partner.13"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"How the PurificationProgram Works14"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"HOW DOES THE PURIFICATION PROGRAM WORK?Running is done to get the blood circulating deeper into the tissues where toxic residuals arelodged and thus act to loosen and release the accumulated harmful deposits and get themmoving.Very important, then, is that the running is immediately followed by sweating in the sauna toflush out the accumulations which have now been dislodged.Regular nutrition and supplemental nutrition in the form of megavitamin and mineral dosagesand extra quantities of oil are a vital factor in helping the body to flush out toxins and torepair and rebuild the areas that have been affected by drugs and other toxic residuals.A proper schedule with enough rest is mandatory, as the body will be undergoing change andrepair throughout the program.These actions, carried out on a very stringently monitored basis, are apparentlyaccomplishing a detoxification of the entire system, to the renewed health and vigor of theindividual.There is a more in-depth view to be taken of the entire process, however.A person who has taken drugs, in addition to the physical factors involved, retains mentalimage pictures of those drugs and their effects. Mental image pictures are three-dimensionalcolor pictures with sound and smell and all other perceptions, plus the conclusions orspeculations of the individual. They are mental copies of one’s perceptions sometime in thepast. For example, a person who had taken LSD would retain “pictures” of that experience inhis mind, complete with recordings of the sights, physical sensations, smells, sounds, etc.,that occurred while he was under the influence of LSD.Let us say an individual took LSD one day while at a fairground with some friends, and theday’s experiences included feeling nauseated and dizzy, getting into an argument with afriend, feeling an emotion of sadness, and later feeling very tired. He would have mentalimage pictures of that entire incident.Such mental image pictures can be reactivated by drug residuals, as the presence of thesedrugs in the tissues of the body can simulate the earlier drug experiences. This is known asrestimulation: the reactivation of a past memory due to similar circumstances in the presentapproximating circumstances of the past.Using the above example of the person who took LSD, sometime later—perhaps yearsafterward—the residuals of the drug that are still in his body tissues can cause a restimulationof that LSD incident. The mental image pictures are reactivated, and he experiences the samesensations of nausea, dizziness and tiredness, and he feels sad. He does not know why. Hemight also perceive mental images of the persons he was with and the accompanying sightsand sounds and smells.Therefore, on the Purification program we are looking at two things: one, the actual drugs andtoxic residuals in the body (and medical autopsies have shown that they are there); and two,the mental image pictures of the drugs and the mental image pictures of one’s experienceswith these drugs.These two factors are hung up—one playing against the other, in perfect balance. What theperson is feeling is the two conditions, one of them the actual presence of the drug residuals,the other the mental image pictures relating to them.15"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Probably the reason why the Purification program works is that it handles the one side of it—the accumulated toxic residuals—and thus fixes the person up so that the other side, themental image picture side of it, is no longer in constant restimulation. It is as simple as that.What, among other things, is happening on the Purification program is that you cause anupset of this perfect balance. Suddenly the balance isn’t there anymore so you don’t get thecross reaction anymore. The harmful and restimulative chemical residues have been flushedout—they’re gone. This does not mean the mental image pictures are gone. But they are nolonger in restimulation and they’re not being reinforced by the presence of drug residuals.By breaking up the balance of these two and handling the one side of it on the Purificationprogram we are restoring the person to better physical health and freeing him up as well formental and spiritual gain.16"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"17"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"A LONG RANGE DETOXIFICATION PROGRAMDrug residues can stop any mental help. They also stop a person’s life! While originallyaddressed primarily to the handling of the accumulation of drugs in the system, it appearsfrom the research results recorded and noted above that with use of this regimen many othertoxic substances accumulated by the body can be flushed out of the system.These substances must be eliminated if one is to get stable mental and spiritual improvement.The operating rule is that mental actions and even biophysical actions—methods of bringingan individual into better communication with his environment—do not work in the presenceof life-hostile elements.In rehabilitating an individual, only when we have accomplished a biochemical handling canwe then go on to the next step, the biophysical handling (improving the person’s ability tohandle his body and environment) and then on to mental and spiritual improvement.When one tries to move these around and put them out of sequence, one gets losses.The development of a program to handle drugs and drug and chemical deposits in the bodywas based on the fact that successful rehabilitation of an individual can only be accomplishedin the sequence outlined above.Apparent gain occurs by cleaning up the body and can be seen as an end-all in itself, thoughthat was not the original motivation.In view of what it evidently accomplishes, the Purification program might be termed a long-range detoxification program. But it should be identified as itself, since it is unique amongdetoxification programs, both in its procedure and reported results. To my knowledge, thereis no other known method by which these locked-in accumulations may be gotten out of thebody.FLUSHING OUT TOXINSOn the Purification program, in order to flush the drugs and other toxins out of the body, acombination of exercise, in the form of running, and sauna is essential. These are done for afive-hour period daily, in a ratio of approximately: twenty to thirty minutes of running, tofour to four and one-half hours sauna time.The ratio is emphasized hew as the bulk of the period is best spent in the sauna after thecirculation has been worked up by running. In other words, the five-hour period is not 50percent exercising and 50 percent sauna. The program gives best results with a much lowerpercentage of time exercising and a much higher percentage in the sauna.SAFEGUARD: WORKING WITH A PARTNERRunning and sauna sweat out should always be done with another person, as restimulation ofpast drugs, medicines, alcohol or even anesthetics can and does occur as the toxins getflushed out. This can include the restimulation of a full-blown “trip” from LSD or other drugsone may have taken.Pairing up on the program so that one is always doing the running and sauna steps with apartner or even a third person, provides a safety factor in the case of any of the aboveeventualities.RUNNING18"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The first action on the program itself is running. The purpose of this is not to generate sweatbut to get the blood circulating and the system functioning so that impurities held in thesystem can be released and pumped out.Running increases the circulation throughout the whole body, thus:a. it causes cell waste to be carried out more rapidly, andb. it causes the circulation to go deeper into the muscles and tissues so that those areaswhich have been stagnant can now get rid of the accumulation of biochemicaldeposits and, in the case of LSD, the “residual crystals which have been stored.Running is done on a daily basis once the person has begun the program.The running should be done on a gradient If one is so breathless that he can’t talk to anotherwhile running then he is straining too much, so the running should be taken on a lowergradient.19"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"SWEATING IN THE SAUNAThe second action, which directly follows the running, is sweating. A person goes into thesauna immediately after running in order to sweat. The impurities which have been freed upby the increased circulation can now be dispelled from the system and leave the body throughthe pores.Sweating in the sauna is done at temperatures ranging anywhere from 140 degrees to 180degrees. It is a matter of what temperature the person can take. Usually, but not always, aperson beginning the program will start at a lower temperature and work up to a highertemperature. Then as he progresses he will find he can take increasing degrees of heat.CLOTHINGRunning is usually done in a regular sweat suit. This is optional, however, depending uponthe geographical location, season or weather.In the sauna one would simply wear a swimming suit or swimming trunks or some similarlight apparel.And, while it may seem almost absurd to include the following datum here, it has beenincluded as the mistake was made (and swiftly corrected) in one area shortly following theinitial release of the Purification program:A sweat suit is never worn in the sauna. The reason for this is that a sweat suit acts asinsulation, much the same as when a diver wears a wet suit for insulation against the cold ofthe sea.Wearing a sweat suit would insulate one against the heat of the sauna and so inhibit andcurtail sweating.LIQUIDSWhile on this program, it is important that one drink plenty of water, which greatly assists influshing and cleansing the system. Additionally, with all the sweating done in the sauna itwould be dangerous not to replenish body fluids. So a good amount of water, and any othernonalcoholic liquids the person might choose, should be taken daily.RADIATION AND LIQUIDSOn the Purification program, findings seem to bear out that there is a factor related toradiation that produces the greatest exudation of it and that is the sweating itself.Radiation is apparently enormously water-soluble as well as water removable. According toresearchers, one merely has to take a hose to a building surface or a road to wash the radiationoff of it. This factor is well known to defense trained personnel.So where one is doing the Purification program, one should be very careful to ensure thatactual sweating occurs and in volume. A sufficient intake of water is therefore quite vitalwhen doing the program.This has a side effect, however, of washing a lot of minerals out of the system and perhapsvitamins, as well. Thus the intake of minerals and vitamins during the program is also anecessity.20"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"It is possible that the Purification program is not as workable when profuse sweating does notoccur, when liquid intake is not large enough to compensate for it and when vitamins andminerals of a water-soluble nature are not carefully and adequately replaced. (The commonvitamins taken on the Purification program which are not water-soluble are vitamins A, D andE.)This gives us three important points which must be in on a Purification program:1. Profuse sweating must occur.2. A person’s liquid intake must be large enough to compensate for the liquid lostthrough sweating.3. Vitamins and minerals must be taken in sufficient quantities to replace those washedout of the system through sweating.As mega-vitamin dosages are also a part of the Purification program, this mineral and vitaminintake is quite in addition to any other vitamin therapy ongoing at the time.OVERHEATINGOne could get overheated in the sauna if it is not taken on the right gradient.When a person gets too warm or begins feeling faint, should the body temperature get toohigh, the recommendation is to go out and take a cool shower and then go back into thesauna. People who are having a hard time spending consecutive hours in the sauna will beable to handle the sauna time if a cooling shower is taken when needed.SALT OR POTASSIUM DEPLETIONExtra salt (sodium chloride) is not mandatory for every individual on the program. But saltand potassium are lost in sweating. Thus, one must watch for any symptoms of salt orpotassium depletion and remedy the depletion at once, should it occur.The symptoms can be similar to those of overheating or, when extreme, similar to thesymptoms of heat exhaustion (clammy skin, extreme tiredness, weakness, headache andsometimes cramps, nausea, dizziness, vomiting or even fainting).Such manifestations would be handled immediately with extra salt or salt tablets, potassiumgluconate tablets, bioplasma, or “salt substitute” which is mainly potassium.A supply of these substances must be readily available at all times to anyone who is doing thePurification program. Ideally, supplies of these would be located right outside the sauna,clearly labeled as to what they are.It is a matter of good common sense that overheating and salt or potassium depletion can beprevented by sufficient salt, potassium or bioplasma taken periodically while in the sauna andby cooling off when it becomes necessary during the-sauna time. But should these symptomsoccur, they must be handled and not considered something the person must “go through.”Also, one must guard against falling asleep in the sauna, as overheating or salt or potassiumdepletion could occur while one was asleep.Salt or potassium depletion as a chronic condition must be handled as a separate factor by amedical doctor.21"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"HEATSTROKEIf perspiration ceases while in the sauna—the body suddenly stops sweating and the skinbecomes hot and dry—it’s an indicator that needs immediate handling. This is a clampingdown on the part of the body, a resistance to expelling, and it is the first sign of heatstroke.The Standard First Aid Personal Safety Booklet put out by the American National Red Crosscovers the symptoms of heat exhaustion and/or heatstroke and the immediate aid to be givenfor such.One would get the person out of the sauna at once and cool him off with a lukewarm or coolshower or sponging, or start with a lukewarm shower and gradually make it cooler. Fluidsand salt, potassium or bioplasma would be given.The first aid safety booklet must be kept on hand as a reference, readily available, in thesauna location.DRY SAUNA VERSUS WET SAUNAThus far, the use of a dry sauna has proved to be the most successful in inducing profusesweating in most people. It is possible that some may sweat more in a wet sauna; it has notyet been fully tested. It may be that it is an individual matter. There is no regulation on theprogram that outlaws the use of a wet sauna. Whichever type of sauna is employed, the wholeidea is to use the system which permits the person to sweat the most.Steam baths, at similar temperatures to the sauna, can be used by themselves when available.They serve much the same purpose as the dry sauna and it has been suggested that a steambath may even work faster, but this has not been confirmed. The steam bath produces asimilar effect. Thus, either can be used.The same precautions apply to the use of a steam bath as to the sauna.EUCALYPTUS OILA small quantity of eucalyptus oil is sometimes added to the steam in a steam bath orsimilarly used in some saunas.In a modern sauna or steam bath, the procedure is to simply put one or two capfuls ofeucalyptus oil in a bucket of water in the room. As it then evaporates (the oil will evaporatebefore the water does), more can be added as needed.Some people don’t like the smell of eucalyptus at all, while others find it pleasant. If thesolution is too strong it can cause watering of the eyes or nausea in some cases. Thus, onewould survey before using it and, if used, it should be in appropriate small quantities.Used correctly, eucalyptus has been reported to be beneficial in clearing up the lungs andclearing the sinuses. One person has reported his voice smoothing out as a result of usingeucalyptus oil in the sauna.It is not a mandatory step on the Purification program, but the data given here on the use ofeucalyptus oil in the sauna or steam bath, as an optional element, should be known.Whether or not eucalyptus is used, it goes without saying that a sauna or steam bath should bekept hygienic and free of odors by having the room scrubbed at least once, or oftener, daily.IMPORTANCE OF A PROPER SCHEDULE22"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"The properly ordered personal schedule required while one is on the Purification programconsists of:a. a sufficient amount of sleep daily.b. correct ratio of running time to sauna time, and the total prescribed period for theseadhered to daily.c. sticking to the program sensibly and not skipping days or skimping or short-cutting onthe prescribed daily schedule, nor doing any part of the program in a random fashion.Ideally, this includes getting in the exercise (running) and sauna time at approximately thesame time each day; and taking the vitamin and mineral nutrients at approximately the sametime each day, as when these factors are kept in predictably the program goes much moresmoothly.SLEEPThe need for adequate sleep should be emphasized here as it has been found to be a vital,vital factor in the application of the program. People function best when they are sufficientlyrested.Eight hours of sleep is considered the usual daily requirement. Some persons may need morethan this, but getting less than the regular amount of sleep one usually requires is not advised.Some tiredness has not been uncommon at certain intervals during the course of the programeven when the procedure was being carried out totally standardly. It can occur when theindividual first goes onto the program and is not up to doing a five-hour stint per day, inwhich case the person should build up to the full daily period on a gradient by doing a bitmore time each successive day until he is able to do the full five hours. It can also occur aspart of the restimulation in connection with medical or street drug residues or as part of therestimulation of an old illness, etc., any of which the person might run through while on thisprogram. There are cases on record of persons going through periods of tiredness or fatigueconnected with past illness and/or medical or drug experiences and coming through them farbrighter and more energetic.But it must be borne in mind that the Purification program can be strenuous. Trying to do iton too little sleep would be a severe violation of the regulations covering the program. Aperson obviously needs enough sleep and rest in order to cope with the changes taking placein his body and in order to assist the body in any needed rebuild of tissues or cellular repair.Per Program Case Supervisor reports, where a schedule for sufficient sleep has been violatedthe person has often wound up having a rough time of it, which is totally unnecessary. Quiteapart from any mere tiredness, any reactions which are there to be restimulated by drugresidues can, due to insufficient sleep and rest, produce unnecessary and non optimumreactions.One obviously cannot expect to make the gains that are possible on the Purification programunless this point is in.OPTIMUM DAILY TIME ON THE PROGRAMFrom the many cases interviewed and from data from those who have supervised theprogram, five hours exercise and sauna daily has been found to be ideal for the majority ofpeople doing the Purification program. The program apparently works like a bomb when thehighest percentage of this time is spent in the sauna and a lesser percentage in running.(Example: A good ratio has been found to be approximately 20 to 30 minutes of running to23"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"get the circulation up, followed by the remainder of the time spent in the sauna, for a total offive hours.)Not everyone has gone immediately onto a full five-hour stint right from the start. (And somehave successfully done the program on a shorter daily schedule.)In both the running and the sauna, where the right gradient was applied—particularly whenbeginning the program—it went very smoothly.AGE AND PHYSICAL CONDITION-FACTORS IN SCHEDULINGAge, physical condition and stamina can all enter into it, and these factors would need to betaken into consideration for each program participant individually when starting the personon the program.Among the many people surveyed on program results were those who had required a fewdays to work up to five hours daily. However, once up to the five-hour daily schedule, thatproved to be the optimum daily period for those persons, as it has for so many of the peoplewho have been through the program.Additionally, on such a schedule the Purification program can and has been completedeffectively in the shortest possible amount of time.Most people approached the five-hour daily program eagerly and enthusiastically.Some eager beavers were found apt to plunge in a bit too quickly at the start, and this washandled by having them work up gradually to where they could run 20 to 30 minutes withoutstrain while at the same time increasing the sauna time gradually up to the full prescribedperiod.One Program Case Supervisor reported a few people staying in tile sauna too long with nobreak and turning on headaches and other unnecessary reactions as a result. The purposeshould not be to see how long one can stay in the sauna for any one stretch of time—and thishad to be clarified with several such enthusiasts.What worked best was when the person had been in the sauna sweating for a while and had agood sweat going and then came out, got some fresh air and space and cooled off, as needed.Then he or she went right back into the sauna for more sweating. When plenty of liquids(many people take water jugs into the sauna with them) and enough salt, potassium andbioplasma were used, the sauna time went very well.HOW LONG DOES THE PURIFICATION PROGRAM TAKE?With each of the points of the program kept in and the regimen followed exactly, the programcan be completed by many at five hours a day in two or three weeks time.Some persons may take a bit more time than that; a few might complete the program in lesstime.NUTRITIONNutrition plays a vital role in the Purification program. But when we speak of nutrition inrelation to the program we are not talking only about food in the most common usage of theword. We are talking about vitamins and minerals as well.24"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"REGULAR EATING HABITSThere are no “special diets” required on this program.The person simply eats what he normally would, supplemented with plenty of vegetableswhich have not been overcooked and with the recommended dosages of vitamins andminerals.There is no thought here of putting the person on any kind of special diet at all. There are norestrictions on what one may eat. We are not even trying to preach against toxic foods orcampaign against diet abuses or junk foods or anything of that sort.We are only trying to handle the accumulation of impurities built up in the body. If onewanted to defend his body against all future impurities then that is another program and notpart of this one.To put a person on a diet different than that to which he is accustomed is to introduce asudden change in the midst of other changes he will be experiencing on the program. Achange of diet might be just one too many changes and would be an additive’ which couldinterfere with and affect the efficacy of the program.DIETS AND FOOD FADSI am not a food faddist and there is no idea of mixing any food fad into this program.However, there is plenty of food faddism going on in society and you can easily start such afad, so this must be watched when administering the Purification program. There is nointention to have people eating banana fronds split into diamonds and star shapes and blessedby some deity or other, or a fad of “three lettuce leaves criss-crossed with two slabs of peanutbutter as an absolute must eighteen times a day,” or something equally silly being touted as“the only food a person can have.”Food is subject to becoming very faddist and, frankly, most people know very little about it.Locating and remedying deficiencies and excesses in vitamins, minerals, enzymes, sugar,protein, oil and fats, carbohydrates and bulk fiber as well as other dietary supplements is thekeynote of dieting. No special substance or food or abstinence from it is a whole answer.Diets should be considered a subject where one seeks a balance of body support elements anddetermines quantity.Fasting, magic foods eaten to the exclusion of others and dozens of dietary fads alike tend tobe more harmful than beneficial.There is a vast difference between food-faddism and the subject of diets. Diets have becomeviewed as what a person is limited to in eating, whereas they should be viewed as what aperson must have as nutritional elements. This has become a problem because the true naturaldiet of man has not been isolated.THEORY OF A NATURAL DIETFood, lack of it, incorrect planning or consumption of it or substitution or alteration of it canvastly affect health.Man is not a primary converter of natural energy or masses but depends upon otherconverters for a primary conversion in most cases. (Except for vitamin D and one or two25"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"other items man, for instance, does not convert sunlight to energy, but, eating algae whichdoes so convert, is able to obtain and use the energy.)No real study of or search for the natural diet of man has ever been made or attempted.Studies are made of diets from the viewpoint of how to correct illnesses or maintain healthbut not what the basic food of the human body would be. Scarcities, availability’s, what canbe grown and preserved, the ease of growing, climatic and soil and water conditions, and howto make a profit are factors which have established diet instead of “What does the humanbody require?”The human body is a complex biological carbon-oxygen engine, one running at an operatingtemperature of 37 degrees centigrade and, being biological, has the ability to establish andrepair itself. To its food requirements then are added the elements required to build as well asto run the body.Almost all mammals live about six times their period of growth. Man lives only three andone-third times his growth period. As other mammals than man are under the same or greaterstress, but are usually uniform in diet while healthy, it can be assumed that man has departedfrom his natural diet.Some guesses have been made as to natural diet by an examination of teeth but this would notbe an adequate approach.The resolution of man’s natural diet as opposed to what he is eating might do a very greatdeal to improving racial health.Man’s mass efforts towards diet are targeted for quantity and profit. Efforts to establishquality are often resisted by various special interests in the mistaken idea that furtherknowledge of diet might reduce quantity and profit. However, it could be that new fooddiscoveries would vastly increase both production quantity potential and profit.No simple basis for research and discovery of the natural diet exists in known statement form.The necessary first steps to the discovery of man’s correct diet would be:a. The statement of a possibility that one might have existed or did exist.b. A formula for search and possible discovery of it.This section of the book has made (a) above.The following would be a formula for its discovery:Overweight: Residual elements of food, substances or gases which are not totally eliminatedor utilized by the body after ingestion.Underweight or debility: Inadequate or lacking foods, substances or gases which are neededfor the activity, maintenance or repair of the body.By listing all foods, substances or gases which are stored by the body, one would obtain a listof things ingested, part of which were not utilized or necessary. Simple recording of thoseitems which put on unwanted weight would be a part of this action. The examination ofoverweight persons and their diets would give another section of it. Further examination ofcadavers that had been overweight would round out the list. Which of these were the result ofbody conversion of what food would be noted.A study and listing of all deficiency diseases and malnutrition cases as contained in TheTextbook of Medicine, Beeson and McDermott, and in other papers and texts would give alist of items vital to the activity, maintenance and repair of the body.26"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The items in the overweight and debility lists could then be compared.One would have, as a result, the elements of a natural diet.A search for foods which contained only the elements which were used and vital could beundertaken.The result would be the elements of a possible natural diet.An examination of the ease of production and supply of such foods could then result in apractical natural diet.Zonal application in specific areas might require the repetition of the formula to take in racialor climatic or production variables.It is said that 80 percent of Americans are overweight. Their activity and intelligence arefailing. The populations of many countries are starving or suffering malnutrition.The wild animals, fish and fowl are ceasing to be a world source of food supply. There is noreason to go on killing off all life on the planet simply because no one knows, beyond opinionor taste, what man’s natural food was or could be.Fads and hobbies should not be the sole source of data on this subject.The problem could be intelligently solved and should be if we are still to have a populatedplanet.Probably the planet could support billions more than it does. Most of it is wasteland.A system to solve it by killing off populations through sterilizing and euthanasia is simplyimpractical, stupid and useless suppression.It would be far better to work out man’s natural diet.This is quite another subject of research which could be undertaken by others whose primaryfield it is, but the discovery of such basics and making these widely known could result in aplanet-wide program which would at some future time decidedly augment the basic principles and implementation of the Purification program.Meantime, it is not intended that dietary fads of any sort be included as part of thePurification program.OIL: TRADING BAD FAT FOR GOOD FATToxic substances seem to lock up mainly, but not exclusively, in the fat tissues of the body.The theory is that one could replace the fat tissues that hold these accumulations with fattissue which is free of such residues. It is a theory of exchange. It is based on the “Have-Waste” theory and formulas from my research in the 1950s, as described below.HAVE-WASTE THEORYHavingness is a term for a very fundamental principle which can be seen in operation inseveral different aspects of the Purification program.27"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Havingness has to do with a person’s considerations in regard to mass. It means, to state itsimply, the degree to which one is willing to experience mass—mass of any kind. One’sdegree of havingness is the degree that he is able to have or not have a particular thing, withno compulsion involved either way.In good shape, a being should be able to experience anything. His recorded experience,however, may dictate otherwise.His level of havingness is actually determined by his considerations on the subject. And hisconsiderations can be influenced by a combination of factors, past and present. But the basicinfluencing factors in this are abundance and scarcity.There is a little scale in operation here which was put to extensive test early in my work withpeople. While its application is broad, the simplicity of the scale, or formula, is just this:Before a being can have something, he must be able to waste it.If an individual can’t have something, it is a cinch he’ll waste it. And if he can’t even wasteit, it is a cinch he’ll substitute for it.We use this principle on the Purification program to effect the exchanges which are needed.While the research and formulas of “Have-Waste” go very extensively into the subjects ofbeing able to have, being able to waste and other aspects of these conditions, a very simplepremise on which this theory can be explained is that:Anything which is scarce becomes valuable.The body will actually tend to hold onto something it is short of. Thus, if you try to get rid ofsomething it is short of, it will resist giving it up.The answer is to provide an additional supply of the substance.Therefore, in the matter of fat, if the person takes some oil the body might possibly exchangethe bad fat in the body for the good oil. That is the basic theory.I am also indebted for material on this to a doctor in Portugal who, in conversation, told methat autopsies had found all sorts of grisly, used-up fat stored in unlikely places in people’sbodies. In other words, there is a lot of unusable fat a body can accumulate.The body will obviously hold onto a lot of fat and won’t let go of it. The effort is to get thebody to take good oil or fat in exchange for the bad, toxin-ridden At it is holding onto. If onewants somebody to clean up the fat tissue in the body, he had better give the body some fat inorder to make up for the fat tissues the body is now, on the Purification program, releasing orchanging.In this way we have some chance of getting the body to release fatty tissue which isimpregnated with toxic substances. We get the body to trade fat for fat.One should use a blend of oils which contains soy, walnut, peanut and safflower oil.Whether purchasing the oil in a health food or other type of store one should ensure it isfresh, not rancid.If this type of oil is not obtainable in health food stores or elsewhere, one could blend it fromthese four oils in the proper amounts. Any oil used must be cold-pressed and polyunsaturated,and must be kept refrigerated so it remains fresh.28"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The oil used on the program must also include lecithin. Lecithin appears to be an agentcapable of breaking fat into tiny particles which can pass readily into the tissues. It should betaken along with the oil on the Purification program, and is obtainable from most health foodstores in a granulated form. The amount of lecithin to be taken has been estimated to bebetween one and two tablespoons per day, depending on how much oil one is taking. In itsgranulated form, it can be mixed with other food such as milk, yogurt or juice.HOW MUCH OIL?Upon initial release of the Purification program, the exact daily quantity of oil needed by aperson on the program had not been definitely established, beyond the fact that it was verylikely somewhere between two tablespoonfuls and one-half cup, depending upon the individual. One tablespoon of oil is not going to accomplish much,as too little oil won’t let the body substitute good fat tissue for bad. If too much is given it cancause diarrhea.A medical doctor who has handled numerous people on the program has reported that themost standard oil dosage found to be required by most persons he supervised on the programwas between two and four tablespoonfuls a day. Others, particularly some 250-poundersunder his care on the program, were on considerably more oil than that.The recommendation of this medical doctor is that on an oil dosage of any quantity, onewould reduce the oil intake if the oil showed up in a bowel movement or in the body sweat,as in such case there is an excess of oil which is not being put to use but simply expelled.One way to test whether the person is on the right amount of oil would be to put him on ascale daily and keep a close check on his weight. (This should be done routinely, in anyevent, when a person is on the Purification program.) If the fat is being replaced in the body,then the weight will not go up despite the intake of oil. If the body is simply assimilating theoil, with no exchange in fat tissue, the weight will increase. Such a change in weight wouldtend to indicate the body was simply adding new fat tissue rather than exchanging old fattissue for new fat tissue.EVENING PRIMROSE OILEvening primrose oil is the oily extract from the crushed seeds of the evening primrose plant.According to researchers, it purportedly handles various food allergies and furnishes asubstance which seems to help break down dietary fat and fatty tissue. It is available in manyhealth food stores in capsule form.Pilots done on the use of evening primrose oil on the Purification program have shown that itappears to benefit persons with a history of an inability to metabolize fat (as evidenced by alack of weight loss when moderately dieting), and persons with heavy drug or alcoholhistories. Persons on these pilots were given six capsules (500 mg. each) of evening primroseoil per day—three capsules twice a day with meals— in addition to the usual amounts of oilon the program.Occasionally persons with a history of an inability to metabolize fat would seem to do betterif the amount of evening primrose oil was increased to nine or twelve capsules per day andthe regular oil dosage was reduced one tablespoon from what would be a normal dose for thatperson.One medical doctor reported that evening primrose oil also seemed to assist persons who hadtrouble metabolizing the normal dosages of oil on the Purification program. Although this isnot a common occurrence, this doctor found that when such a person was given six capsulesof evening primrose oil per day along with the normal oil dosage on the program, the personwas usually able to handle the oil.29"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"ALL BODIES HAVE SOME FATTY TISSUEAll people, be they fat or thin, have some fatty tissue in the body. Some, of course, have morefat stored in their bodies than others. On this program we simply want to get rid of the fat that contains the toxic substances. We are not trying to make people lose weight.Worth mentioning here, also, and of interest to thin people, is the fact that while toxicsubstances lock up mainly in fat tissue it does not mean that the person cannot have drugdeposits in other tissues.TAKING THE OILSome individuals reported difficulty taking the oil by itself, usually due more to the texturethan to the actual taste.As there seemed to be no reason why the oil could not be taken in orange juice or mixed withsome other food of the person’s choice and taken that way, this was the handling used forthose persons who had difficulty getting the oil down. This gave good results, provided theentire dosage of oil was consumed. Others simply took the oil alone. (In taking the oil dosagemixed with other food, the exception is that one would not cook food in the oil and thenconsider that that was the oil ration for the day!)WHEN TO TAKE THE OILOn the initial program, the oil dosage was taken at the same time as one of the regular meals.One doctor has suggested that, as the oil may coat the stomach and intestinal walls for acertain period (which could prevent the assimilation of other nutrients, especially the water-soluble vitamins), the oil is probably best taken before going to bed or at least at a differentmealtime than when the vitamins and minerals are taken. This was not put to stringent test onthe program and many participants did well when taking both oil and vitamins at the samemeal. The suggestion is included here as a point for consideration in a case where it appearsthe individual is not getting the full benefit that would be expected from the recommendedvitamin dosages.ADEQUATE OIL IS ESSENTIALAdequate oil intake is essential to successful implementation of the program. One could notexpect the desired results from the Purification program without a sufficient amount of oil ona daily basis.And the oil must be pure and stored properly so that it does not become rancid.OILS CAN GO RANCIDApparently oils such as those used on the Purification program can go rancid after a period oftime and can also go rancid if they are improperly stored or subjected to heat.This includes combinations of soy, safflower, peanut and walnut oils, vitamin A, vitamin D,vitamin E and wheat germ oil.According to published nutritional research, rancid fats (oils) destroy important vitamins inthe body and this can eventually result in a physical condition of swollen joints or cords ormuscles, known as “gout.”WHEAT GERM OIL30"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"An example is wheat germ oil. If you look at a bottle of vitamin E you will see that it ismainly wheat germ oil. Apparently wheat germ oil, after being pressed, will only last a weekbefore it goes rancid. Taking this oil after it has gone rancid could bring about, after exercise,agonizing cramps (or in severe cases, the condition of gout).If a person took rancid wheat germ oil while on the Purification program he might incorrectlyattribute these sore muscles to the exercise, when in actual fact it was the result of therancidity of the oil.RANCIDITY IN OVER OILSOne could find oil in other places that has turned rancid— such as that contained inmayonnaise that has not been properly refrigerated.According to Adelle Davis, some manufacturers even use rancid oils in the preparation ofmargarine’s, cooking fats and highly refined commercial vegetable oils. She recommends thatone consume only cold-pressed, unrefined oils. And even these must be stored properly orthey can turn rancid.STORAGE OF OILSApparently one factor that can cause these oils to go rancid is exposure to the sun orradiation. One person in charge of the Purification program in an area reported that a jar ofvitamin E, left out in the sun, went rancid within a matter of days. And if a bottle of oil, or acontainer of oil capsules (such as those in which vitamin A, D and E are often sold), is storedfor a long period of time instead of being used up, it could go rancid.The best thing to do is to keep these oils in a refrigerator and test them periodically to ensurenone of them have turned rancid.HOW TO DETECT RANCID OILThe simplest way to tell if an oil has gone rancid is to smell it. Rancid oil smells peculiar—itdoes not smell at all like the same oil when fresh.With a bottle of oil such as that used on the Purification program (a blend of four oils), onejust needs to open the bottle and smell it. And with capsules of oil, such as vitamin Ecapsules, you can simply poke a hole in one of the capsules and smell the oil to see if * israncid.OTHER FORMSVitamins A, D and E can be obtained in dry tablet form and it is quite okay for persons on thePurification program to take these in place of oil capsules of the specific vitamin. The adviseddosage would not change.One does, however, need to take the recommended oil dosage in its oil form, and this shouldbe a blend of the four oils—soy, walnut, peanut and safflower—plus lecithin. The intake ofoil is an essential part of the Purification program in order to effect the exchange of fat for fat.With vitamins, the important point is protecting them from sunlight, heat and oxygen—therefore vitamin containers should be kept closed and stored in a refrigerator. There is noreason one could not take vitamins such as A, D and E in oil capsule form as long as they areproperly stored and not permitted to go rancid.31"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"In summary, certain oils are essential to the effectiveness of the Purification program, andthus it is vital that adequate measures are taken to ensure that none of these oils are rancid.This is done by:1. Proper storage of oils, including not only bottled oils but also those oils contained incapsules, such as vitamin E. Oils should be kept refrigerated and not left out in thesunlight or near any heat.2. Oils should be checked regularly to see if they have turned rancid.3. Any oils that are rancid should be thrown out as soon as rancidity is detected.Research findings point to the possibility that rancid oils are a health hazard of a magnitudenot previously suspected. Oils used in cooking or commercial processing of food, where theyare not fresh, pure and free of rancidity, have been linked with digestive and muscular ills andeven cancer.One sees, therefore, the importance of ensuring that only fresh, non rancid oil is used, inone’s daily living as well as on the Purification program.CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM: THE “CAL-MAG FORMULA”Although both calcium and magnesium are included in the multimineral tablet used on theprogram, additional dosages of these are an integral part of the program because of theirparticular effectiveness in helping to handle the effects of drugs.CALCIUM: A BASIC BUILDING BLOCKCalcium is a must where any healing or exchange process is involved, as it is a basic buildingblock.More important, it is calcium that affects the nervous systemsI do not know the total relationship between calcium and toxic substances (and neither,apparently, does anyone else) but it actually exists.The rationale back of this is that calcium in deficiency sets a person up for spasms. Nervespasms occur in the absence of calcium; muscular spasms are caused by lack of calcium. Aperson who thinks he is in a state of high tension or something of the sort may simply have acalcium deficiency.CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM IN TANDEMCalcium would be administered in company with-magnesium. Nervous reactions arediminished with magnesium; magnesium itself has proven necessary to keep the nervessmoothed out. Both calcium and magnesium are helpful in preventing sore muscles. But theyare best administered together in a specific ratio.CALCIUM NEEDS AN ACIDIC BASEIn pairing up these two minerals, the main factor to be resolved in order to obtain positivebenefit from calcium dosages was this: Calcium does not go into solution in the body and is32"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"not utilized unless it is in an acid. That is the odd thing about calcium—it has to have anacidic base in which to operate.AND MAGNESIUM IS ALKALINE.If the system is too alkaline the calcium will not release the positive ions which makes itpossible for the calcium to operate in the cellular structure and go through the blood vesselwalls and the intestinal walls and so forth. In other words, in an alkaline system, calcium isineffective and inactive. Thus, some sort of resolution was required.DEVELOPMENT OF THE “CAL-MAG FORMULA”Working on the use of calcium and magnesium in 1973 for purposes other than the handlingof drug reactions, I found a means of getting calcium into solution in the body along withmagnesium so that the benefits of both could be achieved. The answer was to add vinegar,which would provide the acidic formula needed.The result was a solution which proved to be highly effective, which was named the “Cal-Mag Formula.”CALCIUM-MAGNESIUM RATIOThe proven ratio used in the Cal-Mag Formula is one part elemental magnesium to two partselemental calcium.As the Cal-Mag Formula calls for precise amounts of these elemental substances, somefurther explanation of these quantities should be given here.The Cal-Mag Formula is made using the compounds calcium gluconate and magnesiumcarbonate. Both of these come in white, powdery form. Each is a compound of differentsubstances. In other words, calcium gluconate contains other substances besides calcium; it isnot all pure calcium but contains only a percentage of pure elemental calcium. Similarly,magnesium carbonate contains other substances besides magnesium, and includes only apercentage of pure elemental magnesium.But it is the amount of elemental magnesium in correct ratio to the amount of elementalcalcium that is important in the preparation of the Cal-Mag Formula. This does not, not, notmean that you use pure magnesium or pure calcium when you make Cal-Mag. Use onlycalcium gluconate and magnesium carbonate.Magnesium Carbonate: The desired compound for Cal-Magr called magnesium carbonatebasic, contains 29 percent magnesium. (This compound is also sometimes called magnesiumalba.)There are different magnesium compounds with different percentages of elementalmagnesium, but using any kind other than that recommended here will give varying amountsof magnesium which will violate the needed ratio of one part magnesium to two partscalcium.It is magnesium carbonate basic, containing 29 percent elemental magnesium which is usedin making Cal-Mag. And it is essential to ensure that the magnesium carbonate basic which isused is fresh, not old.Calcium Gluconate: There is only one kind of calcium gluconate compound and 9 percent ofthat compound is calcium, so there is no problem in selecting the correct calcium gluconatecompound for the Cal-Mag preparation.33"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"THE CAL-MAG FORMULAThe Cal-Mag Formula, as released in the early 1970s, is repeated here.Note, again, that the ratio is one part elemental magnesium to two parts elemental calcium. Ifone wants to work this out precisely, one can work out the elemental amounts. The formulabelow has been given for the compound amounts.1. Put 1 level tablespoon of calcium gluconate in a normal sized drinking glass.2. Add 1/2 level teaspoon of magnesium carbonate.3. Add 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar (at least 5 percent acidity).4. Stir it well.5. Add 1/2 glass of boiling water and stir until all the powder is dissolved and the liquidis clear. (If this doesn’t occur it could be from poor grade or old magnesiumcarbonate.)6. Fill the remainder of the glass with lukewarm or cold water and cover.The solution will stay good for two days.34"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"METRIC SYSTEM EQUIVALENTSAnother statement of the quantity of each component of Cal-Mag could be made.By the terms tablespoon and teaspoon is meant the standard household capacity measuresused in the English system of weights and measures. These are precise measures and shouldnot be confused with the eating utensils of the same names. (Besides being imprecise asmeasuring spoons, the names of such eating utensils mean different capacities in differentparts of the world. For example, a “tablespoon” eating utensil in Australia is twice the size ofa “tablespoon” eating utensil in the United States.)For parts of the world which do not use the English system of weights and measures, themetric system equivalents will clear up any possible question as to the proportions to be usedin the formula.One tablespoon per the English system of weights and measures = 15 milliliters (14.8 ml. tobe exact) per the metric system.One teaspoon per the English system of weights and measures = 5 milliliters (4.9 ml. to beexact) per the metric system.These figures can be rounded off because the differences are so slight as to be negligible, andby rounding them off they remain in correct ratio.Substituting these metric equivalents would give a Cal-Mag Formula as follows:1. Put 15 ml. calcium gluconate in a normal-sized drinking glass.2. Add 2.5 ml. magnesium carbonate.3. Add 15 ml. of cider vinegar (at least 5 percent acidity).4. Stir it well.5. Add 1/2 glass (or about 120 ml.) of boiling water and stir until all the powder isdissolved and the liquid is clear. (If this doesn’t occur it could be from poor grade orold magnesium carbonate.)6. Fill the remainder of the glass with lukewarm or cold water and cover.Graduated cylinders with milliliter increments marked on them are available from laboratorysupply houses in different sizes, so one can get accurate measures whether a single glass or alarge batch of Cal-Mag is to be made.IMPORTANT: MAKE A PALATABLE CAL-MAGThere is a warning regarding Cal-Mag. Variations from the above can produce anunsuccessful mess that can taste pretty horrible. It can be made incorrectly so that it doesn’tdissolve and become the most unpalatable, ghastly stuff anybody ever fed anybody. Possiblywhen made incorrectly it is even unworkable.There is also the factor that one should mix the solution in exactly the correct proportions andapproach the dosage on the cautious side, as an overdose of magnesium can cause diarrhea. Idoubt, however, that as much as three glasses of properly mixed Cal-Mag would bring aboutthat condition.35"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Made correctly, Cal-Mag is a very clear liquid, pleasant to take and palatable. Thus thedirections should be followed very explicitly, to produce a proper Cal-Mag that is bothpleasant to take and beneficial.Cal-Mag has been found to have the added benefit of balancing out the vitamin B1 used onthe program, as vitamin B1 taken without calcium can cause serious teeth problems by settingup an imbalance of vitamins and minerals.NIACIN, THE “EDUCATED” VITAMINNiacin, as one of the B complex vitamins, is essential to nutrition. It is so vital to theeffectiveness of the Purification program that it requires some extensive mention here.It can produce some startling, and in the end very beneficial, results when taken properly onthe program along with the other necessary vitamins and minerals in sufficient andproportionate quantities and along with proper running and sweat out.Its effects can be quite dramatic so one should understand what niacin is and does beforestarting the Purification program.NIACIN RESEARCH AND RADIATIONI conducted some research using niacin in 1950. At that time we referred to niacin asnicotinic acid and the beginning dosage used was 200 mg. (milligrams).This research was very interesting. Odd manifestations occurred when this vitamin wasadministered to individuals. Its most startling effect was that it would turn on, in a red flush, asunburn on the person’s body in an exact pattern of a bathing suit! These were very neatpatterns. The bathing suit outline was unmistakable.What kind of “educated vitamin” was this that caused bodies to turn on a flush exactly like aprevious sunburn, showing the exact pattern of a bathing suit outline? And which left on thebody a pattern of an unaffected area which had been covered by a bathing suit some yearsbefore?Strangely, both the British and American pharmacopoeias advertised that this substance,nicotinic acid (niacin), turned on a flush and was therefore toxic in overdoses.What we found in 1950 was that if the niacin was continued—in what the pharmacopoeiawould term “overdoses—eventually one got no more flushes from it.The sunburn like flushes would eventually disappear at 200 mg., then at 500 mg. they wouldrecur but with less intensity. One might get a small reaction then at 1000 mg. for severaldays, after which one might administer 2000 mg. and find no more effects. The person wouldfeel fine, his “sunburn” would be gone, and he would experience no more flush from theniacin.But if niacin was toxic, how was it that the more you “overdosed” it the sooner you no longerexperienced the sunburn like flushes from it?NIACIN REACTION—1956In 1956 I put this vitamin to use again.36"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"At that time there was a lot of bomb testing going on and general radiation exposure. Wewere working with individuals who had been subjected to atomic tests, atomic accidents and,in at least one case, to materials that had been part of an old atomic explosion. We wereengaged in salvaging these people, handling the mental image pictures, stress and upsetattendant on these experiences and we succeeded.But in 1956 niacin was reacting differently on people than it had in 1950, and the effects weremore severe.People on the research program in 1950 had experienced only past sunburn flushes. In 1956people on the research program, while experiencing a flush, were also experiencing nausea,skin irritations, hives, colitis and other uncomfortable manifestations, on the same vitaminand in the same dosages as had been used in 1950.The vitamin formula in use minus the niacin did not produce the same effect. Therefore it wasobvious that it was the niacin causing these interesting manifestations.What was this?The behavior of niacin had been studied in 1950. In regard to sunburn like flushes we knewwhat it would do—continued long enough the sunburn like flushes seemed to discharge.Why, in 1956, was it producing a different manifestation? The niacin or nicotinic acid hadn’tchanged. The bodies we were testing hadn’t changed. We even tested some of the samepeople who had been on the research program in 1950, and they now had a different reactionto niacin. What about a case that had had all the sunburn discharged by niacin in 1950 whonow, given niacin in 1956, was turning on other sorts of things? Isn’t it interesting that justsix years later the same vitamin, niacin, was producing an entirely different manifestation?The similarity was that, with the dosages continued long enough, these new manifestationsalso discharged and disappeared.The writers of the pharmacopoeia or the biochemist may continue to think that niacin turnson a flush and that it will always turn on a flush in “overdoses.”But the interesting part of it is that it comes to a point where it doesn’t turn on a flush. Thisdoesn’t happen by conditioning of the body, that is not what occurs. It runs something out.What does it run out? We knew, from 1950, that it ran out sunburn, which is a radiation burn.And in 1956 the symptoms those on the research program were experiencing—the nausea,vomiting, skin irritations, colitis and nasal disturbances which accompany radiationsickness—were also discharging with the administration of niacin.Niacin in 1956 was no longer just running out sunburn. It was running out something whichexactly paralleled radiation sickness.Niacin, then, apparently seems to have a catalytic effect on running out radiation exposure. Itseems to give it a kick and run it through.It will often cause a very hot flush and prickly, itchy skin, which can last up to an hour orlonger. It may also bring on chills or make one feel tired.Medical thinking has been that niacin itself turned on a flush. Something called“niacinamide” was then invented to keep from turning on this flush. Niacin all by itself doesnot turn on any flush. What it starts to do is immediately run out sunburn or radiation. So theniacinamide that was invented to prevent this flush is worthless (at least for use on thePurification program).37"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"On the Purification program, because quantities of niacin are taken and because of the heat ofthe sauna, it is possible that it can have the effect of discharging a certain amount, possiblynot all, of the accumulated radiation in people.UNLEASHING DRUGS AND TOXINSTaken in sufficient quantities niacin appears to break up and unleash LSD, marijuana andother drugs and poisons from the tissues and cells. It can rapidly release LSD crystals into thesystem and send a person who has taken LSD on a “trip.” (One fellow who had done theearlier Sweat Program for a period of months, and who believed he had no more LSD in hissystem, took 100 milligrams of niacin and promptly turned on a restimulation of a full-blownLSD experience.)Running and sweating must be done in conjunction with taking niacin to ensure the toxicsubstances it releases actually do get flushed out of the body.Recently, doctors in megavitamin research have been administering niacin to get peoplethrough withdrawal symptoms or get them over bad drug kicks. They have been usingenormous doses of, for example, 5000 mg. of niacin.I have no personal knowledge that such enormous doses are necessary for handling drugs,though they well may be in some cases. It is very possible that, given the combination of allthe points on the Purification program, many people would be able to handle drugs withlesser amounts of niacin, something under 5000 mg.NIACIN THEORY: RUNNING THROUGH PAST DEFICIENCIESIn theory, niacin apparently does not do anything by itself. It is simply interacting with niacindeficiencies which already exist in the cellular structure. It doesn’t turn on allergies; itappears to run out allergies. Evidently anything that niacin does is the result of running outand running through past deficiencies.Caution: The manifestations niacin produces can be quite horrifying. Some of the somaticsand manifestations the person may turn on are not just somatics in lots of cases, in myexperience. For example, I have seen a full-blown case of skin cancer turn on and run out onniacin dosages. So it appears that a person can turn on skin cancer with this and, if that shouldhappen, the handling, by observable fact, has been to continue the niacin until the skin cancerhas run out completely.Other lesser manifestations that may turn on with niacin are hives, flu symptoms,gastroenteritis, aching bones, upset stomach or a fearful or terrified condition. There seems tobe no limit to the variety of phenomena that may occur with niacin. If the deficiency is thereto be turned on by niacin it apparently will do so with niacin.The two vital facts here, proven by observation, are:1. When the niacin was carried on until these things discharged they did then vanish, asthey will do. Sometimes people get timid about it and don’t finish the program, whichleaves them hung up in a deficiency that is creating a particular illness ormanifestation. This should not be allowed to happen.It is a matter of record that a reaction turned on by niacin will turn off whereadministration of niacin is continued.38"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":" 2. When the niacin dosage was increased and the whole lot of the rest of the vitaminsbeing taken was also increased proportionately, the niacin itself, taken in largeamounts, did not create a vitamin deficiency.CREATED NUTRITIONAL FAILUREOn the Purification program it is the progressive increase of the niacin dosages thatdetermines the proportionate increase of the other vitamins and minerals.Thus, what could slow down the Purification program and make it appear incomplete wouldbe a nutritional failure—a failure to flank the niacin on either side by sufficient amounts ofthe other needed vitamins and minerals in proportion and a failure to provide food intakewhich included vegetables (with their vitamin and mineral content) and oil.In such a case one would be looking at created nutritional deficiencies—not conditions whichwere there, necessarily, at the outset of the program.Not knowing these things is possibly what made medics earlier believe that niacin itself hadside effects. The side effects were probably somatics and manifestations of already existingdeficiencies only half run out and deficiencies created by not flanking niacin with the othervitamins and minerals and oils necessary to permit a rebuild.NUTRITION AND DEFICIENCIESMany people probably begin taking drugs because they feel terrible due to dietarydeficiencies. These then progressively worsen, as the drugs themselves cause wholesale’vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Recovery from drugs requires a full repair of thesedeficiencies.Having been an early discoverer and instigator of vitamin therapy I know whereof I speak onthe subject of nutritional deficiencies. Some of my work covering vitamins and deficiencies,stimulants and depressants and the field of biochemistry, goes back to the spring of 1950 andearlier. Studies made in those fields were highly contributive to evolving the Purificationprogram.MINERALS: KEY TO GLANDULAR INTERACTIONBetween 1945 and 1973 I studied the endocrine system. From this study it seemed apparentthat minerals and trace minerals operating in the bloodstream and circulated by other bodyfluids were a key to glandular interaction.The theory is: Every gland in the body specializes in one or more minerals and, actually, thatis how the glands make themselves interact with one another. In other words, the endocrinesystem of the body monitors itself apparently through minerals.As various drugs upset the whole endocrine system, one can see that the moment one startsadministering vitamins and extensive sweating and such actions, one is going to get a mineraldemand in the body. Therefore, there would need to be certain mineral dosages right alongwith the rest of this package.When one is conversant with the subject of nutrition and with the elements of the program, itis obvious that in the face of an unhandled vitamin or mineral deficiency the effectiveness ofthe procedure will suffer.Thus, nutrition and nutritional deficiencies are both vital topics for discussion in any text onthis program.39"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"DRUGS AND TOXINS CAUSE VITAMIN BURN-UPOne of the things that toxins and drugs do is create nutritional deficiencies in the body in theform of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. A vitamin C4 deficiency, a B1 deficiency, a Bcomplex deficiency and a niacin deficiency are brought about by drugs. There may be otherdeficiencies caused by drugs that we are not aware of at this time. But that list is certain.Also, alcohol, for example, depends for its effects upon the body being able to burn up B1.When it burns up all the B1 in the system the person goes into delirium tremens andnightmares.In the case of other toxic substances, the probability exists that other vitamins are burned up.What we seem to have hit upon here is that LSD and other street drugs burn up not only B1and B complex but also create a deficiency of niacin in the body and that they possiblydepend on niacin, one of the B complex vitamins, for their effect.In light of the discovery that toxic and drug residuals can remain in the body for years, it canbe assumed that these residuals, to the degree that they are still present, might have the sameand continuing effect on the body’s reserves of vitamins and minerals.40"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"DEFICIENCIES AND ILLNESSAny vital substances on which body support depends, when too reduced or omitted fromconsumption, can be depended upon to result in a non optimum physical condition.When very obvious, it becomes a “disease.” And when less obvious and even undetected, itbecomes a “not feeling good.”There is a distinct possibility that (after mental and spiritual factors) the largest contributivefactor in aging is the composite of cumulative deficiencies.Predisposition’s to other types of illness is in many instances occasioned by thesedeficiencies even when the precipitation is viral or bacterial.Prolongation of illness is guaranteed when deficiencies remain present and unremedied.Thus, a factor in the development of the Purification program was to handle any suchdeficiency with sufficient daily quantities of vitamins and minerals in addition to whateverwas supplied the person through his regular meals.The exact quantities of the substances used on the program are given in the next chapter ofthis book. As a part of the program itself, these then would be increased proportionatelyaccording to individual need.ARTIFICIAL DEFICIENCIESA vitamin or mineral does not work alone—it must be accompanied by other elements withwhich it combines to do its work.For example, when one gives B6, a complimentary amount of B2 has to be given for it to beeffective. It is all very well to say that B6 helps the nervous system and without it all sorts ofthings happen. But should one start giving a fellow B6 and then wonder why nothingspectacular occurs, it is because he isn’t also being given a complimentary quantity of B2.When large dosages of certain vitamins, minerals or foodstuffs are given, an artificialdeficiency can apparently be created of others not given. Increases in some elements, just bythe fact of their being increased, demand increases in others. When intake of some elementsis markedly increased, balance must be maintained by proportionately increasing others.Lacking needed elements in one area, the body will even rob bones, muscles and tissue toobtain the missing elements.Artificial deficiencies can be so created.This is a principle I hit upon as early as 1950 and proved it. You can actually create adeficiency in C by administering B and calcium. All you have to do is pump those things to afellow in very, very heavy dosages and he will develop the characteristics of C deficiency.His teeth begin to hurt. Then, when you give him C, the manifestations go away. In otherwords, an overdose of “X” and “Y” can apparently create a deficiency in “Z.”The reason for this is that a vitamin is making certain changes in the body and these changes,to occur fully, alsorequire the additional vitamin. But if that additional vitamin isn’t there, it gives themanifestation of being in deficiency.41"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"The principle here is that by giving one or two vitamins in excess amount you can create anutritional deficiency of another vitamin which isn’t being given or isn’t being given inenough quantity. This would apply to minerals as well.Thus, vitamin and Mineral rations would have to be taken in proportion to one another.This theory was a major element in the development of the Purification program and remainsa major element in its successful and effective delivery.NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTSTo repeat the point made in an earlier chapter, special diets and food fads are no part of thisprogram.What is part of this scene is that the person will need certain nutrition in the form of vitaminsand minerals in addition to his regular meals. One follows his normal eating habits; there areno deletions of certain foods required. There are, however, some additions to the normaleating habits. These consist of, in addition to the person’s regular meals:a. Plenty of vegetables which have not been overcooked. Vegetables contain a lot ofminerals and fiber as well as specific important vitamins.b. A quantity of the recommended oil—ensuring that it is fresh—taken daily. (Thiswould be an oil combining the four oils: soy, peanut, walnut and safflower oil, pluslecithin.)c. Vitamin and mineral supplements in the exact dosages recommended, increasedproportionately as the program progresses.d. One to three glasses of “Cal-Mag” (the calcium magnesium drink), daily, as advised.e. Plenty of water and other liquids taken daily, to help flush out the system.VITAMINS AND MINERALSAs a record of research, listed below are the approximate daily amounts of the variousvitamins and minerals taken by most persons when starting the program. It is important thatno one of these vitamins or minerals is taken to the exclusion of another or others.Niacin: 100 mg. (or less, depending upon individual tolerance at the start)daily.Vitamin B complex:approximately 2 tablets daily, each tablet containing the same amountsof B2 and B6.Vitamin B1: 250-500 mg. daily, in addition to the B contained in the B complextablet.Vitamin A: approximately 5000 IU daily.Vitamin D: approximately 400 IU daily. (This is usually taken in a capsule that is acombination of 400 IU of vitamin D and the 5000 IU of vitamin Alisted above.)Vitamin C: approximately 250-1000 mg. daily, depending upon individualtolerance.42"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Vitamin E: approximately 800 IU daily.Multi-Minerals: 1 to 2 tablets daily, each containing a balanced combination ofminerals.“Cal-Mag” Formula:at least one glass, or more as advised, daily.

See also folic acid and pantothenic acid.43"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"MINERAL TABLETThe multi-mineral tablet used in the initial research was one containing the following mineralamounts per each nine tablets. In other words, one tablet would provide only 1/s of thefollowing mineral amounts:calcium500 mg.manganese4 mg.magnesium250 mg.copper2 mg.iron 18 mg.potassium 45 mg.(protein complex)zinc 15 mg.iodine ..225 mg.(kelp)In the tablet used, the minerals (with the exception of the potassium and the iodine) are‘‘chelated’’ (bonded with) amino acids in a base of selenium, yeast, DNA, RNA, ginseng,alfalfa leaf flour, parsley, watercress and cabbage.The same mineral tablet, or one with similar content or additional minerals, is still usedeffectively on the program.HIGH MINERAL DOSAGESInitially, on the program, mineral dosages were started at one to two tablets daily. Then, asthe niacin and other vitamins were increased in proportion to each other, the mineral dosageswere increased accordingly in increments of two to three tablets, three to four tablets, four tofive tablets and five to six tablets taken daily.Later research then indicated that much higher mineral dosages than these gave mostoptimum results on the program.Large amounts of minerals are lost in sweating in the sauna. Thus, high, high quantities ofminerals must be taken to replenish those flushed out by sweating.Additionally, it is possible that as an individual progresses on the program there is often animprovement in the ability of the body to assimilate the minerals it needs.PROPORTIONATE VITAMIN/MINERAL INCREASESThe tables on the next pages provide the data on how the vitamins and minerals should beincreased, in ratio, as the person progresses on the program.It is the gradient increase of niacin which monitors the gradient increase of the other vitaminsand minerals given on the program. The niacin is increased correspondingly with the decreaseof reaction from the niacin, as covered fully in the next chapter. Vitamins B1 and Cparticularly have to keep pace with the niacin as it is increased in dosage, in order to preventcreating artificial vitamin deficiencies.44"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"The dosages in these tables show the variations of individual tolerances encountered and theranges of increase which have proven most effective in the majority of cases.VITAMIN TABLEThis table shows proportionate vitamin increases at various stages of the program.Stage Stage Stage Stage Stage1 2 3 4 5Niacin 100 to 500 to 1500 to 2500 to 3500 to400 1400 2400 3400 5000mg. mg. mg. mg. mg.Vitamin A 5000 to 20,000 30,000 50,000 50,00010,000 IUIU IU IU IUVitamin D 400 800 1200 2000 2000IU IU IU IU IUVitamin C 250 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to1000 mg.3 gm. 4 gm. 5 gm. 6 gm.Vitamin E 800 1200 1600 2000 2400IU IU IU IU IUVitamin B 2 3 4 5 6complex tablets tablets tablets tablets tabletsVitamin B1 350 to 400 to 450 to 750 to 800 to600 650 700 1250 1300mg. mg. mg. mg. mg.MINERAL TABLEThe following table shows the approximate mineral amounts now found to give best results atthe various stages of vitamin increase.Stage Stage Stage Stage Stage1 2 3 4 5 Calcium 500 to 1000 to 1500 to 2000 to 2500 to 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000Magnesium 250 to 500 to 750 to 1000 to 1250 to 500 750 1000 1250 1500Iron 18-36 36-54 54-72 72-90 90-108Zinc 15-30 30-45 45-60 60-75 75-90Manganese 4-8 8-12 12-16 16-20 20-24Copper 2-4 4-6 6-8 8-10 10-12Potassium 45-90 90-135 135-180 180-225 225-27045"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Iodine .225 to .450 to .675 to .900 to 1.125 to .450 .675 .900 1.125 1.350Cal-Mag 1-2 1-2 1-2 2-3 2-3glasses glasses glasses glasses glasses(All figures in milligrams except those for Cal-Mag)(Note: The number of mineral tablets to be taken would depend upon the strength of theparticular tablet used. The importance is that one gets the necessary amounts of the minerals.It has been found that large tablets may not be as easily broken down and absorbed into thebody as smaller tablets may be. Thus one might not get the same amount of minerals from alarge tablet as from several smaller tablets, even though the large tablet might contain thesame amount of minerals.)HOW TO READ THE TABLESAs a clarification, first of all, the figures on these tables designating points of increase (Stages1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) do not refer to the first, second, third, fourth and fifth days of the program.They refer to approximate “stages” of vitamin and mineral increase (in relation to the niacinincrease) that an individual goes through on the program.On the Vitamin Table, under Stage 1, the first figure given for each vitamin shoots the usualstarting dosage of that vitamin used for most individuals. The range then shown under Stage1 indicates how these starting dosages may be increased within a few days or within a weekor so, depending upon the niacin reaction the person is experiencing.On the Mineral Table, under Stage 1, the first column of figures (reading downward) givesthe usual starting mineral dosages for most individuals. The range under Stage 1 shows thepossible rate of mineral increase during this first phase of the program.The same applies to the increments shown at Stages 2, 3, 4 and 5 on both tables.Example: Person A starts the program on 100 milligrams of niacin plus the other beginningincrements of vitamins, per the Vitamin Table. His beginning increments of minerals, per theMineral Table, are approximately: calcium 500 mg.; magnesium 250 mg.; iron 18 mg.; zinc15 mg.; manganese 4 mg.; copper 2 mg.; potassium 45 mg.; and iodine .225 mg.He continues with these daily dosages until the niacin effects have diminished—in his casethis occurs on, let us say, the third day of the program. At that point his niacin dosage isincreased to 200 mg. daily, with the other daily vitamins and minerals increasedproportionately, and he continues on those dosages until the niacin effects have diminished.Progressing in this way, by the seventh day of the program his vitamin and mineral dosageshave been increased up to the levels given in Stage 2 of the tables. After the ninth day hisvitamins and minerals may have been increased all the way up to Stage 3 as shown on thetables. And he continues in this way all the way up through the levels of dosages at Stage 5.This varies from one individual to the next.Person B. for example, starts on 100 mg. of niacin and the accompanying vitamin andmineral dosages, and may then require a week or more to work up to the levels of vitamin andmineral dosages shown at Stage 2. He may then move rapidly through Stage 2, take anotherweek to move through Stage 3 and actually complete the program at some point on Stage 4.There is no rote pattern to be followed. It is totally a matter of standardly applying the datagiven as to when the niacin should be increased. (See Part One, Chapter 12, “Increasing theNiacin.”) That is the factor that may vary widely from one individual to the next.46"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"However, the tables given on the previous pages show the guidelines which were and are stillfollowed for increasing the vitamin and mineral increments proportionately at the times theniacin is increased.ADDITIONAL NOTES ON VITAMINSIt should be stressed here that individual tolerances were and always must be taken intoconsideration in each case.Quantities of vitamin C especially would need to be carefully increased according to theperson’s tolerance of it, as too much vitamin C can result in stomach upsets or diarrhea forsome people.At the same time, it is important that the vitamin C increase keeps pace, proportionately, withthe niacin increase. Records exist where vitamin C has become so deficient in a drug user thathe could use up tens of thousands of milligrams of C per day before he begins to eliminateany. A severe vitamin C deficiency can result in the disease called scurvy. “Live C” from rawonions or raw potatoes is sometimes necessary in addition to synthetic vitamin C. (Thesewere the traditional remedies for scurvy.)Vitamins and minerals should not be taken on an empty stomach, as they could causestomach burn. They should be taken after meals or, if taken between meals, with yogurt.NIACINAMIDEThe majority of vitamin B complex tablets on the market include niacinamide in smallamounts. This is the substance invented by someone to keep an individual from turning on aniacin flush. Because it does prevent a niacin flush, niacinamide is worthless.The likelihood is that the amount of niacinamide in a B complex tablet acts only to eliminateany flush from the niacin content in that specific tablet. Results from the piloting of thePurification program, where plenty of niacin flush was experienced on different dosages ofniacin itself (in combination with the flanking vitamins and minerals), indicate that theinclusion of niacinamide in the B complex had little if any effect upon the flush that resultedfrom the additional dosages of niacin taken. However, where a B complex tablet can be foundthat includes niacin rather than niacinamide, that would be the preferable tablet to use.It is also possible to have a B complex tablet especially made up that includes actual niacininstead of niacinamide, in amounts equal to the B1, B2 and B6 amounts, particularly if one isordering the tablet in fairly large amounts.Note: Where a B complex tablet that includes niacin is used, this adds that much more to thedaily niacin intake and this must be taken into consideration when increasing niacin and Bcomplex dosages.ADDITIONAL NOTES ON MINERALS: TRACE MINERALSMost multiple mineral formulas include the major mineral elements required by the body butnot all of the trace minerals.“Tracer minerals are those minerals which have been found essential to maintaining life, eventhough they are found in the body in very small, i.e., “trace” amounts.The main trace minerals currently include: cobalt, copper, iodine, manganese, molybdenum,zinc, selenium and chromium. Tin was also added as an essential trace mineral as late as1970.47"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Nutritional researchists are the first to admit that the work in this field is very far fromcomplete, and there will undoubtedly be other trace minerals added to the list as suchresearch is continued.Currently, also, there are fairly wide differences of opinion among nutritionists as to theminimum daily requirements of the various minerals and especially the trace minerals.Minerals are found in a wide variety of foods. Natural foods, undamaged by processing, arethe best sources of minerals as they exist in unprocessed foods in the combinations in whichthey are most effective. But minerals can also be lacking in foods grown in mineral-depletedsoil. Additionally, of course, there is no one food that supplies them all.Therefore, it may be necessary to use more than one type of multi-mineral tablet to ensureone is getting all of the minerals, including the trace minerals, that are required by the body.Note: The Vitamin and Mineral Tables given on the preceding pages do not include anyadditional vitamins or minerals which might be needed in cases of specific deficiencies anindividual might have. Any such particular deficiency would need to be determined by amedical doctor and remedied with the additional vitamin or mineral dosages recommended.As a guideline, four of the more informative books on the subject of nutritional vitamins andminerals are the following by Adelle Davis: Let’s Get Well, Let’s Eat Right to Keep Fit,Let’s Cook It Right and Let’s Have Healthy Children.The research data offered in this chapter is not to be construed as a recommendation ofmedical treatment or medication. It is given here as a record of food supplements in the formof the nutritional vitamins and minerals which were used in the development of thePurification program and which were found to be most effective in the greatest number ofcases.48"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Increasing the Niacin49"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"INCREASING NIACIN AND OTHER VITAMIN QUANTITIESMost persons who have done the Purification program started at 100 mg. of niacin (sometook lesser amounts at the start, depending upon tolerance) and increased the dosage as theyprogressed.The best results were obtained when niacin was taken all at one time, not split up during theday. Taken with water on an empty stomach it can be very upsetting. It is found to be besttaken after a meal, or with yogurt or milk.To increase the dosage, a specific quantity of niacin was administered each day until theeffect that dosage produced diminished. One would then, next day, up the dosage on agradient, say, in amounts of 100 mg. In this way you get an overlap of the old dosagebecoming useless and the new dosage being needed. This tended to speed up the actionconsiderably Then continued each time the effect of the dosage diminished.The other vitamins would have to be increased proportionately to niacin at the same time theniacin is increased, as they are interacting in the deficiencies and more are needed. It was found essential that C, B1 and other B vitamins need to be given in ratio to the niacinbeing fed. In other words, as you up the niacin you would up the B. and the B complex. Andalso as niacin is upped, the vitamin C would be upped. These things would have to be kept inratio.HOW AND WHEN TO INCREASE THE NIACINWithin the boundaries of the medical doctor’s advice for the individual, the most workablegradient in the majority of cases observed was generally found to be starting the person on100 mg. of niacin and increasing it in increments of 100 mg. until the person was up to 1000mg. daily. A steeper gradient was then used as one went up to higher dosages. It was foundthat many persons could take increases of from 300 to 500 mg. at one time when they reachedthe higher dosage ranges. Note that this does not refer to a daily increase, necessarily, butrefers to the gradient in which the dosage was upped when an increased dosage wasindicated.Any increase was always based on individual tolerance and there were exceptions to the“generally successful gradients described above. Certain individuals would and did requiremoving up on a lesser gradient according to their tolerances and according to medicaladvice’s.On the other hand, a “grinding” phenomenon was observed where the individual:a. held to a certain niacin dosage of, say, 500 mg. day after day, until nothingwhatsoever was happeningorb. held to an increase of only 100 mg. at a time in the higher ranges of niacin, eventhough he was getting only brief, mild results, was very able to tolerate these effectsand felt he could handle a steeper gradient.By “grinding” phenomenon is meant an effect similar to doing something over and over withthe person becoming irritated and frustrated with the program and feeling he is not makingthe progress he could be making.In these instances, it was observed that when the persons who could progress at a faster ratewith larger niacin increases (always with the other vitamins and minerals increased in thecorrect ratio and by individual tolerance) did so, they went smoothly along on the programhandling what did crop up.50"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"When to introduce an increase in niacin was found to be as important as the amount ofincrease.When niacin was increased:a. after the effect of a certain dosage had diminished (not vanished totally)andb. when any other manifestations and restimulation which had turned on at that dosagehad diminished or totally disappeared (as covered earlier in the stated procedure),good progress was made on the program on a one for one basis, providing all otherpoints of the program were standardly being applied.In other words, it was recognized that there would very likely be various reactions andrestimulations (as covered earlier), all of which would need to be taken into considerationwhen niacin amounts were increased.When this was done correctly, excellent results were obtained. Questions arising on suchincreases were handled according to the person’s individual medical approval to do theprogram and further medical advice’s as needed.CAUTIONIt should be mentioned here that, along with this research data, reports have been received ofpersons found taking niacin quietly on their own without being on the Purification programand without being under any supervision, medical or otherwise, just to see what it wouldhandle. This is not advised. It could result in artificially created deficiencies or in thingsturning on which are not then properly handled or resolved.POWDER VERSUS TABLETSome persons have reported more immediate and/or intense results when niacin was taken inpowder form. This difference was most often reported by persons who had reached the higherdosages, had little or no results from a large, highly compressed tablet, and then switched tothe same dosage in powder form and got more intense results.However, several people report that they got results when taking 100, 200, 300 and 400 mg.of niacin in tablets of 100 mg. each; then, when 500 mg. were taken in a single 500 mg.tablet, nothing occurred. However, the next day, when 500 mg. were taken in 5 tablets of 100mg. each, results were obtained at the 500 mg. dosage.Still others reported effective results from niacin tablets of any dosage, including the largertablets of higher dosage.What has been done effectively is to use tablets of 100 mg. niacin each until the 1000 mg.niacin dosage is reached and to use niacin in powder form thereafter. Where this is done, orwhere niacin in powder form is used exclusively, the measurement must be exactly done.The label on a powdered niacin container should carry instructions as to how to measure thepowder content. With the brands that have been used, 1 teaspoon provides 3,000 mg. of pureniacin. Note: This is per the English system of weights and measures. One would need to usethe standard measuring teaspoon. In areas of the world where the metric system is used (andwhere “teaspoon” sizes vary), an amount equivalent to a standard teaspoon measurementwould be 4.9 milliliters.51"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE END PHENOMENA OF THE PURIFICATION PROGRAMWhat Is Meant by “End Phenomena”?The end phenomena of any action could be said to be those indicators which are present whenthe action has been fully and correctly completed.The purpose of the Purification program is very simply to clean out and purify one’s systemof all the accumulated impurities such as drugs and other toxic chemical substances, e.g.,food preservatives, insecticides, pesticides, etc. For someone who has taken LSD or angeldust this would include getting rid of any residual crystals from the body.The end phenomena is reached when the individual is free of the restimulative presence ofresiduals of past chemicals, drugs and other toxic substances. He will no longer be feeling theeffects of these impurities going into restimulation and there is usually a marked resurgenceof overall sense of well-being.NIACIN DOSAGES AT COMPLETIONPer research data, there are a number of people who have completed the program to full endphenomena on dosages under 5000 mg. of niacin. Others have gone as high as that dosagebefore completing.There is no hard and fast rule laid down anywhere that says a person must work up to 5000mg. of niacin before he is complete.HOW TO RECOGNIZE VALID END PHENOMENAAs the person goes through the Purification program, one should be able to see animprovement in both his physical well-being and general outlook on life as he rids the systemof its accumulated toxins.Obviously if the person is still feeling the effects of past drugs or chemicals going intorestimulation, the program cannot be considered complete and must be continued until allsuch manifestations have turned off completely.Per research data collected, where a person was progressing well on the program one couldobserve him becoming more mentally alert and aware. He would start reporting exactly whatwas going on, what substance was turning on, what impurities and restimulations he wasrunning out. He could usually tell if he had hit a tolerance level on a certain vitamin. All ofthese are valid reactions throughout the program.As the person would run out whatever was there to turn on, the manifestations became lessday by day, and he would reach a point where no further manifestations were coming up. Hewould look and feel remarkably better, brighter and more alert; he would have come throughwith good wins and he would often know and state that he felt free of toxic residuals and theirassociated restimulative effects (though not necessarily in those exact words), and originateon his own that he had completed the program. With all those indicators, one could be prettysure he had completed it.The amount of vitamins and mineral nutrients, exercise and sweat out it has taken and willtake to accomplish this on the Purification program is an individual matter in each case.DRUG HISTORY AND COMPLETION52"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The fact of having a heavy drug history does not necessarily prolong the program, although itcan do so. More important than anything else is keeping all points of the program instandardly, maintaining a well-balanced personal schedule with enough rest and nutrients,and getting in the prescribed period of exercise and sauna on a routine daily basis.On such a schedule, persons of varying drug histories, some heavy, some light, havecompleted the program in eighteen to twenty days at five hours a day, reaching the endphenomena at amounts of niacin (and the flanking vitamin and mineral nutrients) whichdiffered with different individuals. Some have done so in less time, some have taken longer.FOLLOWING PROGRAM COMPLETIONA continuation of the vitamins, minerals, oil, vegetables and Cal-Mags at least at the rate ofthe minimum recommended daily requirements in balanced amounts is wise after theprogram has been completed. Otherwise, a sudden cessation of such heavy vitamin dosagescan produce a letdown. It is possible the person should come off on a steep gradient-ratherthan cease abruptly. Particularly where drug damage to the brain or nerves has occurred, thebody needs these things to rebuild itself. If one doesn’t continue the essential nutrients therecan be the of a letdown.Remember that the person has probably been leading an unhealthy life without propernutrition, sleep or exercise. Or, even where he has kept these health factors in, he has beensubjected to the pollutants and toxins which surround us daily. Thus, it would be a good ideato recommend moderate daily dietetic and exercise disciplines so he can stay healthy. Suchdisciplines are not therapy; they are simply a matter of good common sense.Note that upon completion of the program, it is not intended that one gradiently does less ofall the elements of the Purification program, e.g., less sauna, less exercise, less vitamins, etc.,each day, tapering down to cessation of these actions.The suggestion that is made is that one doesn’t abruptly simply cease the extra nutrients hehas been taking, but comes down from high dosages on a steep gradient to what would be amoderate normal daily requirement for him, per medical advice’s. And along with this, somemoderate daily exercise can help him maintain good health.Continuing all the elements of the Purification program would amount to continuing theprogram itself past the point of valid completion, and that is not the intention.WHAT COMES NEXT?Upon completion of the Purification program, the person is now in good shape to receivegains from mental or spiritual improvement programs and get optimum gain from them.Thus, we are not looking at an endless run on the Purification program. We are seekingsimply to handle the drug deposits and toxic residues in their restimulation and reinforcementof mental image pictures and vice versa. And by breaking up the balance of these two andhandling the one side of it on the Purification program, we are freeing up the person to beable to handle the other side of it, the mental image picture side of it.The latter would be accomplished on another and quite different program.The important thing, however, is that the person is now free to accomplish it, as he is nolonger caught up in the constant interaction between the mental recordings of the effects ofdrugs and toxins, and the physical effects of the residual deposits.53"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"GuidelinesforSuccessfulApplication54"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"ADMINISTRATION OF THE PURIFICATION PROGRAMThe procedure for administration of the Purification program laid out in this chapter is basedon the practical experience gained from the research and development of the technology ofthe program as well as large pilot projects during which it was delivered to some hundreds ofindividuals. This procedure is geared toward formalized delivery of the Purification program,however it is vital data for the individual doing the program as well. These regulations shouldnot be taken lightly nor disregarded.One may find that persons administering the program might tend to enter their own fads orhobbies into it, or, needing it themselves, avoid standard delivery of it.Examples of this might be: giving advice based only on one’s opinion or personal experiencewhich results in alteration of the researched program procedure, hobby horsing someparticular food fad or diet, injecting personal opinion as to the efficacy of certain vitamins tothe exclusion of others, neglecting the importance of maintaining the prescribed schedule andpermitting irregularities such as insufficient sleep or insufficient running or sauna time, oradvising mixing the Purification program with other procedures.It is important that those administering the program do so purely and exactly by theregulations governing such administration. If an individual reports difficulties on theprogram, it is essential to check to see if any such erroneous advice has been tendered bywell-meaning friends or by those handling the program in a purely administrative capacity.ORIENTING THE PARTICIPANTTo prepare an individual to participate in the Purification program the following steps aretaken:1. Inform the person that he must have medical approval to participate in the program,following a medical exam by an informed and licensed medical practitioner.2. Brief the person on the basic theory and main elements of the program.3. Ensure he understands the procedures to be followed, the need for keeping to a routineschedule, getting enough sleep and following the correct vitamin regimen.4. Ensure he understands that the program does not include medication, and that thevitamins, oils and minerals taken during the program are nutrition, i.e., that they arefood, not medicine or drugs.5. Educate the person on:a. the need for taking plenty of liquids to replenish liquids lost during sweatingin the saunaandb. how to prevent heat exhaustion and how to handle it should it occur.6. Brief the person on what niacin is, what it does, and what reactions he mightexperience during the program and why, without making promises as to results.7. Ensure he understands the importance of continuing the program to its completion,once started on it.55"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"8. Get his promise to follow instructions and complete the program and not abandon itbecause it becomes uncomfortable or out of laziness or because he/she has otherappointments or concerns.9. Have the person sign a release which covers the above and which clearly states he isundertaking the program on his own volition after having been duly informed as to thepurpose and procedure of the program and after having received medical approval todo the program.Handling any misunderstanding the person may have before he gets started on the programand emphasizing, at the outset, the standardness with which the program must be followed isan important factor in getting a person through it smoothly.MEDICAL APPROVAL REQUIREDBefore the participant is started on any part of the Purification program, he must first be givena medical exam and have written medical approval to do the program from an informedmedical doctor.Such an examination would include a check of the person’s blood pressure, and a check forany symptoms of a weak heart or anemia.The medical doctor also checks for any vitamin or mineral deficiencies the person may haveand advises whatever vitamin and mineral supplements he should be taking to correct this, inaddition to the vitamin/mineral regimen called for in the program.Persons with physical conditions which might preclude their doing the standard Purificationprogram (i.e., anyone who has a weak heart or anemia or even certain kidney conditions) maybe given a similar program to be done on a much lower gradient.PREGNANCY AND BREAST FEEDINGPregnant women should not be put onto the Purification program. During pregnancy there isa certain amount of fluid exchange between the mother and the fetus, via the placenta’sToxins which might have been lying dormant could, on the program, be released.Some of these toxins, instead of being eliminated, could be transmitted to the fetus in a flowof fluids from the mother to the unborn child. There is no reason to risk the possibility ofsubjecting the unborn child to the effects of such toxins which, even if present but remainingdormant, might not otherwise reach him.Similarly, mothers who are breast-feeding their babies should not do the program until thebaby is no longer being breast-fed, as toxins released could be imparted to the baby in themother’s milk.The Purification program would be done by the mother after the birth of the child and afterany final medical check which pronounced the mother in good health and capable ofundertaking the program. In the case of breast-feeding, the program would only be donewhen the baby had been completely weaned and was on his own formula.TESTINGA battery of tests can be done on the individual before and after the Purification program.These would include a personality test, IQ test, any available learning rate tests and otherswhich would give a before-and-after picture of the person. Such before-and-after tests (quite56"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"in addition to any statements from the person himself) will often show up dramatic changesthe person has made while on the program.Other data taken before the participant begins the program would include, of course, a historyof drugs, medicines or alcohol the person has had, his weight, blood pressure, any specificphysical complaints or mental anxieties, and general details as to the state of the person’soverall health. carefully on a daily basis, and this is done based on what the participanthimself reports as well as by actual observation of the participant, as needed.While on the program, the person is issued his vitamins, including niacin, minerals and oil,on a daily basis, and at the end of his running and sauna time each day he himself turns in afull written report of his progress. This is done on a daily report form provided him, whichcontains a checklist of items to be reported on. The daily report form would call for, at thevery least, the following data:1. How long he exercised.2. How long he sweated in the sauna.3. What vitamins were taken and in what amounts.4. How much niacin was taken (in milligrams).5. What minerals were taken and in what amounts.6. How many glasses of Cal-Mag were taken.7. Whether salt, potassium or bioplasma were taken and in what amounts.8. How many glasses of water or other liquid (other than Cal-Mag) were taken.9. Weight that day. (Include a note as to any weight gain or loss.)10. Any somatics, restimulations, sensations, emotions, physical changes or other changesor occurrences experienced.11. Any wins the person had on the program that day.An individual folder must be kept for each program participant. The daily report is handed into the Program Administrator who goes over it with the program participant to ensure that allpoints of the program were adhered to. The Administrator then places the report in theparticipant’s folder and sends the folder to the Program Case Supervisor.DAILY TIGHT SUPERVISIONThe Program Case Supervisor must verify each person’s daily progress and initial theperson’s report and any medical reports after he has inspected them. He then writes orders tocorrect any misapplication of any point of the program, such as skipping vitamins, not gettingenough sleep, etc., as well as noting any increase in vitamin/mineral dosages that is to bemade.The folder is returned to the Program Administrator who personally takes up with theparticipant any changes to be made, such as increasing the niacin or other vitamin or mineraldosages. The Administrator also carries out any orders for correcting the participant, such asgetting him back onto the proper schedule if he has gone off this, ensuring any errors arehandled, and handles any questions the participant may have at any particular stage of theprogram.57"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Correct administration would include ensuring the participant never exercises or goes into thesauna alone, but carries out these actions with a partner.Tight supervision would also include having blood pressure or other checks redone atintervals during the program, as needed.WITHDRAWAL FROM DRUGSThe Purification program is not administered to those actively on drugs, though such personsneed this program even more urgently, perhaps, than others. Thus, a workable withdrawalprogram must precede the Purification program for these individuals.Such a program must be drugless and would include a substantial nutritional regimen.Additionally, light counseling techniques (Objective Processes), developed in the 1950s toextrovert a person’s attention away from his body, have been put to effective use in helpingpeople to get through withdrawal from drugs with a minimum of pain.Also, quite in addition to the use of Cal-Mag in the healing and exchange processes involvedin the Purification program, calcium and magnesium provide a means of helping to handlewithdrawal symptoms for persons coming off drugs.WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMSThe most wretched part of coming off hard drugs is the reaction called withdrawal symptoms.These are the physical and mental reactions to no longer taking drugs. They are ghastly. Notorturer ever set up anything worse. People go into convulsions. These can be so severe thatthe addict becomes very afraid of them and so remains on drugs. The reaction can alsoproduce death.Until withdrawal procedures were developed, a drug patient had this problem:a. Stay on drugs and be trapped and suffering from there on out.b. Try to come off drugs and be so agonizingly ill meanwhile that he couldn’t stand it.It was a dead if you do, dead if you don’t sort of problem.Medicine did not solve it adequately. Psychotherapy certainly did not.HANDLING WITHDRAWALFortunately, at least three approaches now exist for this problem:1. Light Objective Processes can ease the gradual withdrawal and make it possible.2. Nutritional therapy, as sufficient vitamins and minerals assist the withdrawal.3. Calcium and magnesium, taken in the Cal-Mag Formula.So terrible can be withdrawal symptoms and so lacking in success have the medical andpsychiatric fields been in dealing with them, that the full data on the use of the Cal-MagFormula to counteract withdrawal symptoms should be broadly known.58"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The use of Cal-Mag, experimental in the early 1970s to help ease withdrawal symptoms, isnow long past the experimental stage. Cal-Mag has been used very effectively duringwithdrawal to help ease and counteract the convulsions, muscular spasms and severe nervousreactions experienced by an addict when coming off drugs. The success of its application forwithdrawal cases by drug rehabilitation centers such as Narconon has now been wellestablished. Cal-Mag has been reported as effective in withdrawal from any drug, itseffectiveness most dramatically observable with methadone and heroin cases.Methadone attacks bone marrow and bones so one usually encounters a severe depletion ofcalcium in methadone users, characterized by severe pain in joints and bones, teeth problems,hair problems. Getting calcium into the system (in the acidic solution in which it canoperate), along with magnesium for its effect on the nerves, helps to relieve these conditions.It has been reported that with use of Cal-Mag, a person can be withdrawn from methadoneanywhere from two weeks to three months faster than without its use. This may apply inwithdrawal from other drugs as well.Since drugs or alcohol burn up the vitamin B1 in the system rapidly, taking a lot of B1 dailywhen coming off drugs helps to avoid the convulsions which often attend this deficiency. TheB. must, of course, be flanked with other vitamin dosages to maintain a proper balance ofneeded nutrients. And, accordingly, sufficient quantities of Cal-Mag are needed, both toprevent created mineral deficiencies and to work its wonders in easing and relieving theagonies accompanying withdrawal.From 1 to 3 glasses of Cal-Mag a day, with or after meals, replaces any tranquilizer. It doesnot produce the drugged effects of tranquilizers (which are quite deadly).As calcium and magnesium are minerals, not drugs, one is not adding to the drug effects theperson is already suffering from. Rather, one is providing those minerals which are certain tobe in deficiency in such cases—and helping to provide some relief from the agonizing effectsof such deficiencies.59"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"More onNutrition andIndividualSchedule60"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"MORE ON NUTRITION AND INDIVIDUAL SCHEDULEThe following chapter contains data offered from a broad survey and review of cases in areaswhere the Purification program has been successfully delivered since its release.IMPORTANCE OF NUTRITIONWhat showed up throughout the survey data was the importance of the daily nutritionalvitamins, minerals, oil, Cal-Mag and vegetables, and the role that these nutritional elementsplay in handling the traumatic effects of restimulation of drugs and other toxins.In each area it was observed that dropping out any of these supplements while on theprogram, skimping on them or taking them only sporadically, contrary to the programregulations, could create or intensify deficiencies which would then throw a curve into theprogram that would show up in any number of ways—tiring quickly, lack of energy, upsetstomach, nausea, a general “not feeling good” or actually getting sick in some way, to name afew.Any omission of these standard elements was found to interfere with the progress andpurpose of the program.Many, many cases are now reported to have successfully completed the program under closesupervision on the nutritional vitamin and mineral increases within the ranges given in theoriginal research data.Many areas report it has also been helpful to have a good familiarity with the books onnutrition written by the late Adelle Davis mentioned earlier in this text: Let’s Eat Right toKeep Fit, Let’s Get Well, Let’s Cook It Right and Let’s Have Healthy Children (all originallypublished by Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 737 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10017).These are among the most useful and popular compilations on the subjects of diet andbiochemistry which have been published to date.DON’T IGNORE INDIVIDUAL TOLERANCESWhere individual tolerances were taken into consideration and any vitamin imbalance ordeficiency handled as stipulated in the regulations set forth in the program, the rangespublished from the original research were reported to be highly workable for most.In areas where the program has been successfully delivered, the person’s origination’sregarding his tolerance for or reactions to certain vitamins were never ignored. These wouldalways be looked into and a correct solution worked out in alignment with the theory andfactors of the program as originally researched.In reported cases where the person was having some difficulty and some nutrient imbalancewas the actual cause of the upset, where the vitamins and minerals were properly adjusted asabove there was invariably improvement.But it was necessary to first determine that the person actually was taking the vitamins andother nutritional elements he was supposedly taking and in what amounts, or if he was takingthem only sporadically.RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARTICIPANTIt is the responsibility of the person who has undertaken to do the program to keep thoseoverseeing the program well informed as to his daily actions and the results.61"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"From all the reported data, it is not unusual at certain points of the program for some toprotest a bit at the large quantities of vitamins to be taken. The protest is not in regard toresults or benefits but simply in regard to the quantities to get down. While the niacin wasalways taken all at one time, in several areas it was found most viable to take the remainderof the vitamins at various intervals during the day, after meals or with snacks. One medicaldoctor has suggested that absorption of the needed nutrients is better accomplished in thisway. The exception to this would be where one or more of the vitamins or minerals had beenspecifically suggested by the physician to be taken at certain set intervals.HIDDEN “DIET” FACTORAlso reported was the datum that there is a hidden factor to look for if a person is havingdifficulty and that is the person is not eating but is going along mainly on something likevitamins and niacin and yogurt alone. Or he has made some other major change in his eatinghabits. This was found in one area and totally explained why the person was having troubleon the program. It was then remedied by getting the individual onto regular and balancedmeals.VERBAL EXCHANGE CAN THROW THE PROGRAM OFFDepartures such as those above were found quite often to come about as the result ofexchange of verbal data or advice between participants on the program. This line must bewatched to ensure the procedure is being followed as given, not someone else’s version of itor some experimentation with it on his own.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON INDIVIDUAL SCHEDULINGCan the program be completed satisfactorily on less than five hours daily? Wherecircumstances honestly prevented some persons from doing the program for five hours daily,a shorter time period was piloted.It was found that the program could be completed effectively by some cases on less than fivehours per day, provided the person is getting benefit and change on the shorter schedule.The shorter schedules ranged from four hours down to a minimum of two and a half hourstotal running and sauna time daily. This period would then be spent as follows: twenty tothirty minutes of running and the remaining two hours or so in the sauna.The same gradients applied when the person was on or starting a two-and-a-half-hour dailyschedule as on any other schedule.The approval of the Program Case Supervisor would be obtained for one to do the programon this shorter schedule, as there are other factors which enter into it. Any medical advice ororder for the person to be on the shorter schedule would need to be followed.The program can, and in most cases has, taken longer to complete on a shortened dailyschedule, but survey results show that it can be done successfully by a good many people at aminimum of two and a half hours daily provided all other points of the program arestandardly maintained.Is the extent of a person’s drug history a factor in the time spent daily on the Purificationprogram? Per all the research and survey data assembled thus far, which is quite considerable,the extent of drug history is definitely a factor in determining how much time daily anindividual would spend on the program.62"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Surveys show beyond any doubt that those with heavy or even mediumly heavy drughistories benefited most from the five-hour daily schedule. This can apply to persons withheavy medical drug histories as well as to those who have had heavy street drugs.There are reports on record of persons with heavy drug histories who, though they had donefairly well at the beginning of the program on two and a half hours a day (with somephenomena turning on and dissipating) did not begin to turn on restimulation of actual “trips”and blow through them until they were put onto a five-hour daily schedule.Others reported that if something turned on while in the sauna they made it a point to stickcarefully to the sauna time (taking short breaks as necessary for water, salt or potassium or tocool off) until the manifestation vanished, and they then came out feeling good and refreshed.These same persons reported that if they short-cut the sauna time because somethinguncomfortable had turned on they came out feeling bad or dull and it would then take longerto go through the manifestation.People with very light drug histories, as well, reported feeling calmer and more alert andcheerful after a stint in the sauna which was long enough to permit them to get through anyrestimulation or discomfort that had turned on.There is everything to be said for putting a person on a schedule which will permit him tohandle these factors, and it was found particularly important that those with heavy ormediumly heavy drug histories were scheduled properly so that they were able to get fullreturn from the action and wind up with the expected end phenomena.Who determines the schedule? On any questions as to daily schedule, the Program CaseSupervisor would adjudicate as to the daily time period for the individual.In any case where the person is on a special medical program, the physician’s ordersregarding schedule must be adhered to.The first consideration regarding schedule would be what is going to give the person the mostgain. Wherever possible the person would do the program for five hours daily and mostpeople going through the program have done so on that schedule.In instances where a shorter daily schedule was actually required for best results on someindividuals, the schedule was adjusted accordingly.In cases where persons honestly had limited time, these were considered for the minimumtwo and a half hour daily time period, as it would be more important for them to do theprogram than deny it to them. But it was necessary to ensure that each person could and didmake progress on the shorter daily schedule as he continued it and, if not, to get him onto theregimen that was proper for him.Some who started at two and a half hours daily later requested to move up to the five-hourperiod. There have also been cases where persons on the shorter schedule were getting heavyrestimulation of drugs which they could not handle on the shorter period and, when switchedto the five-hour period, they did remarkably better. This can occur, apparently, with streetdrug or medical drug users and is something to be borne in mind. Whenever possible theheavier drug cases were put on the five-hour schedule to begin with.Again, correct gradient was the watchwords here, as in all other aspects of the program.The supervising of cases on the program would not be done rotely but would always be doneon an individual basis with the individual never pushed farther or faster than he could go. Todo otherwise would be a violation of the technology of the program and a violation of therequired gradients.63"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The successful action has been to get the person on a schedule where he is winning andgetting change and able to handle what comes up, and then ensure he gets in that amount oftime each day and preferably at the same time each day. Regularity of schedule plays a bigpart in completing the program smoothly and effectively.DEPARTURES FROM SCHEDULE REGULARITYOne of the factors examined closely in the course of this survey was whether or not there wasa common sauna time limit for most people (within the recommended five hours) after whichthe person got tired and got less return for the remainder of the period.By “less return” is meant simply nothing happening, but the person enduring the period on aKnow I am supposed to” basis even though tired and feeling he had done all he could for oneday.In those cases where the program was being carried out very standardly, there were no reportsof such tiredness setting in before the five hours were up (i.e., tiredness which was due tolength of time spent in the sauna). Several cases reported they experienced tiredness as part ofa restimulation of drug reactions, etc., but they were able to spot it as such and blow throughit within the five-hour period.However, there were a number of reports from individuals stating they did get tired in thesauna well within the five hours and got limited or no benefit from it beyond that tiring point.The daily time limits for gain reported by these cases varied widely from person to person,the reported limits ranging from four hours down to two and a half hours or less. Theindividual’s drug history did not seem to be a factor, as the reports came from persons whosedrug histories ranged from heavy down to few or no drugs, medical or otherwise.These cases were looked into carefully and when all the pertinent data was examined, whatshowed up were departures from the standard procedure of the program.The departures found were (in order of frequency):a. Not enough sleep.b. Insufficient salt or potassium or bioplasma taken while in the sauna or before running,or a combination of (a) and (b)c. Dropped out vitamins that day, skimping on vitamins or minerals taking thesesporadically.d. An undetected and/or unhandled vitamin or mineral deficiency.Correction of these factors brought about smoother progress and much improved results forthese individuals.REACTIONSAt best, any one of the above-listed factors or omissions could result in the person tiring tooquickly, experiencing unnecessary discomfort, getting limited gain per hour and prolongingthe program unnecessarily. The apparency would be that the program was not working whenin actual fact it was not being applied standardly.Where a person on any schedule reports he is tiring at a certain point and getting little or nobenefit per hour spent beyond that point, one would need to determine if an adjustment of thedaily time period was needed. But, as has been found, additionally and always one would64"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"carefully examine exactly what the person was doing on any section of the program and getany departures rectified.Regardless of whether the person is on the maximum or minimum daily schedule, departuresfrom other aspects of the procedure would decrease the benefits until these departures Werehandled.PROGRAM INTERRUPTIONProbably the biggest single factor found in keeping the person progressing smoothly onthrough to successful completion of the program was regularity of the actions. This includesregularity of the exercise and sauna schedule, nutrition and sleep.Where any one part of the procedure was being done erratically it would throw the other partsout, or give that apparency, and the effect could sometimes be quite puzzling to the ProgramCase Supervisor or the medical doctor and others assisting in the administration of theprogram.Per firsthand observation and data collected by report and survey, where people who hadotherwise been doing well began skipping a day here or there, skimping or cutting down onthe daily program time or missing sleep, it usually resulted in upset of some degree. Theybegan to report “feeling bad” or feeling “sickish” or actually getting sick following someirregularity or disruption of the routine. Where this occurred, the discomfort or upset wasmore severe among those with heavier drug histories.A possible explanation of this is that the process has been interrupted and one is getting abacklogging of the drug and other toxic effects rather than a routine release of these at thesame rate as when the person was on schedule. Therefore, the person could be subject to apiling up of the restimulative effects of these at a rate not easily handled by him, and thiscould be further compounded by any continuation of an erratic schedule.The handling was to get the person onto or back onto a proper and predictable daily regimenand maintain it through to completion of the program.What was stressed here was that in this, as well as all parts of the Purification program, it is amatter of the person following the normal and generally accepted rules for good health. Hewould then be in the best possible shape to attain the benefits which are available to him.QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS REGARDING PROGRAM COMPLETIONIn the course of the broad survey done several months after the Purification program was firstreleased, certain questions and situations arose as to valid completion of the program. Theseare included here so that the data may be broadly known.NIACIN REACTION AT COMPLETIONOne of the most common questions posed was:Can the program be considered complete if the person seems to have reached the endphenomena and is getting no more reaction or manifestation turning on or no other changeoccurring but still gets a slight result from 5000 mg. niacin?In such a case, the person could be hung up in some error in the early stages of the program,which would show up in a full review of his Purification program history. One could do a fullinspection of his folder, particularly in the area of minerals and vitamins, what effect they65"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"had, whether the dosages were standard and kept in the proper balance, whether the programhad been administered and followed standardly and regularly.The participant should be interviewed as well, and one might find departures from theregimen, such as that he “doesn’t like vegetables and never eats them,” he has difficultytaking the oil so he skips it, or other similar omissions.In other words, parts of the program could have been violated and this could be showing upin the manifestation described above. If the program hasn’t been done standardly throughout,one could get such a situation.It may be that he has a deficiency which has been overlooked and not handled and thus somesort of hang-up has been created. The point here is that there could be an unhandleddeficiency which won’t allow a complete discharge of the toxic residues.If the folder shows irregularities a medical check would be done to determine if a deficiencyexists and, if so, to get it remedied. Getting this handled and ensuring the program iscontinued with all of its regulations standardly in should then bring it to successfulcompletion.One must not overlook the possibility, however, that the person may simply have more to doon the program.OVERRUNThere is another possibility, and this may be the most common, which is that the person hasreached the end phenomena, has continued past it, and is now “overrunning” the action. If hehas done the program standardly and did, earlier, exhibit signs of valid completion whichwent unnoticed and unacknowledged, the chances are that he is complete on the programdespite the fact he is still getting some slight result from 5000 mg. of niacin.It is possible to overrun the program if one is not well aware of what is to be looked for in theend phenomena. There have been cases of overrun where the person was continued for someweeks at 5000 mg. (5 grams) of niacin with nothing more turning on than a very slight niacinflush effect. And there have been similar cases of overrun that occurred at less than 5000 mg.of niacin.The possibility exists here that if the point of completion of the program (all drug and toxicresiduals fully sweated out) is reached and bypassed the person could begin to dramatize aniacin flush. The condition tends to hang up because it is not acknowledged or signalized tohave ended. That is simply an educated guess as to one possible cause of the situation. But itis also borne out by careful study of several cases on record where bypass of the endphenomena and overrun did occur.After the person has been on the regimen for some time, has come through good changes andis exhibiting all the indicators of being complete, carrying him on the program for six orseven days with no further effects at any dosage is really an overrun. In some of these cases itappears that 5000 mg. niacin isn’t doing anything that 3500 mg. of niacin didn’t do.To repeat, completion of the program can and has been reached on dosages of 5000 mg.niacin and on dosages of lower than 5000 mg. of niacin. Once the drug and chemicalresiduals are handled, they’re handled. The person will feel the difference. Upping the dosagedoes not necessarily find more to be handled. And continuing the person past the validcompletion can hang the whole thing up and produce a slight effect as a dramatization, eithersporadically or each time the niacin is taken.This can then become confusing to the person himself and those supervising the program. Ifthe overrun is continued, you will see the person become less alert or dispirited, even if66"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"slightly. His general appearance and demeanor will be a bit less bright; he may becomedisheartened. He may now be attempting to produce some effect that isn’t there to be had andbegin to feel the action is interminable. Certainly the person will feel less enthusiastic aboutthe whole procedure and may begin to protest it. The picture now looks as if the program isincomplete, whereas what has happened is that he achieved the end phenomena, reached apoint where he felt great, was getting no further manifestations of any kind (if even only for aday) and the fact was not acknowledged but bypassed. Overrun phenomena then sets in. Thehandling is to acknowledge the person’s completion of the program and end it off.Overrun can also occur in quite a different way. One Program Case Supervisor reported hehad had cases where the person, from all indications, was complete and stated that he wascomplete but wanted to continue a bit longer “just to make sure.” Allowed to go on, thesecases promptly got into overrun phenomena. They were getting no more change and becamesomewhat dispirited. In each of these cases, the end phenomena had actually been reached atthe point the person stated he was complete.Thus, it appears that on the Purification program it doesn’t do to continue past the point ofgenuine completion. Should it happen, it is handled simply by having the person spot whenhe did complete, then fully acknowledging that and ending off on the program.Another question that has come up with some frequency is:What would account for a person who has genuinely completed the program with no niacinreaction at 5000 mg. (or less) then a short time later getting a reaction at lower niacindosages?Such a later reaction, where the person has actually standardly completed the program to itscorrect end phenomena, does not mean that the program is incomplete.To understand this reaction, one needs a good understanding of mental image pictures andhow they work. The specifics of what has happened in these instances can be quite variable,but what you are looking at here in general is that there has been an environmental shift orchange which produced another type of mental image picture restimulation.To begin with, we are living in a two-pole, two-terminal universe. It takes two terminals,positive and negative, to manufacture electricity. Magnets are also an example of the two-pole aspect of this universe: Every magnet has a north pole and a south pole which attracteach other and create a magnetic field. This phenomenon can be observed in the operation ofthe mind as well—a personas mental image pictures on their own do not react on himcontinually; this only occurs when a mental image picture has been restimulated by somefactor in the present environment which approximates part of that mental image picture.It takes a two-terminal situation to hang something up. On the Purification program we arelooking at a dual situation: one, the actual drugs and toxic residuals in the body and two, theindividual’s mental image pictures of the drugs and biochemical substances and their residuesand his experiences from their effects.As discussed in an earlier chapter of this book, the two conditions hang up in perfect balance,playing against each other.On the Purification program, we break up this balance by flushing the actual toxic depositsout of the body. With the toxic deposits gone, the hang-up between the two conditions nolonger exists. This then permits the constant restimulation of the mental image pictures tocease.But what if the person experiences a niacin reaction shortly after he has validly completed theprogram? What could cause such a phenomenon?67"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Purification program is designed to handle the actual toxic residues which may be lodgedin the tissues, which by their presence and restimulative effects could hinder or slow aperson’s mental and spiritual advancement.The Purification program is not meant to handle the individual’s mental image picturesrelated to drugs and toxic substances. After the program is complete, these may notnecessarily be in restimulation due to the presence of toxic residuals—but they are still thereand may yet be restimulated by other factors.As one example of this, a person who has finished the program but who is still taking niacindaily might restimulate mental pictures of a past sunburn by spending time out in the sun.With these mental pictures active once again, he may experience a flush when he takes hisdaily dose of niacin.This doesn’t automatically mean that the program was not really completed. It most oftensimply means that a mental picture or pictures have become active—nothing to be alarmed at,as they will in most cases simply become inactive again after a short while; from three to tendays is the most commonly observed interval. These mental pictures can be dealt witheffectively through Scientology counseling, but such handling is beyond the scope of thePurification program and this book.”RABBITING”Supervisors report there have been a few cases who “rabbited” (wanted to run away fromcontinuing the program to completion because it was uncomfortable, or out of otherconsiderations). These persons insisted they were complete after a very few days at lowniacin dosage when little or nothing had Vet turned on. But these cases were few and wereeasily detected and handled by bringing them to a better understanding of the program and itspurpose. In two such cases where the person was mistakenly allowed to attest to completionafter too brief and skimpy a run, both went into drug restimulation which should and wouldhave been handled routinely on the program. After full review of these cases, with medicalparticipation, they were put back on the program and completed it properly.Judging from reports, including the many personal reports received, by far the majority ofparticipants are eager to experience and handle and release those conditions which can showup on the Purification program. They report drugs, medicines, anesthetics, alcohol,restimulation of various other biochemical reactions, and somatics or other manifestationsturning on, discharging and vanishing, and they report them all enthusiastically and withgreat relief—and look for more! Such cases will often know and tell you when they’vehonestly reached the end phenomena.TRYING TO HANDLE “EVERYTHING”What also showed up on the program was the rare bird who would try or expect to handle onthis program everything that had ever been wrong with him and who looked for some resultabove and beyond what the program is designed to accomplish. Such a case would need to begiven a very thorough understanding of the program and its exact purpose, and his progresswould be very carefully reviewed throughout. It is possible that with toxic residuals releasedfrom the body, other bodily conditions the person may be suffering from might then betreated with good success.It was found important to make it real to any participant that all that is being looked for hereis the person free from drug and toxic residuals and their restimulative effects, so as to makereal mental and spiritual gains possible.It is up to the Program Case Supervisor to know each case under his care, to be familiar withthe progress of each case, to keep medical liaison lines in, and to know well the indicators to68"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"expect when the person has achieved the end phenomena so that it can be acknowledged andvalidated.OTHER HANDLING TIPSIn successful application of the program, any bad indicators, odd or strange indicators orupset would be always picked up and handled at once.If the person was in some heavy restimulation in the sauna and just wanted to get through itwithout interruption, he was not forced or badgered but permitted to go through it easily andgradually at his own rate and he would then come out the other side all right. Per reports,most people know when they are in a drug restimulation and will tell you.In a case where the cause of the upset wasn’t immediately obvious, the ProgramAdministrator would simply sit down with the person and talk it over to find out what wasgoing on.What worked well was to have the participant read over all points of the program, or to havethe Administrator take up each of these points with him, and the person himself would thenvery often spot and point out where he went off the rails. And, in most cases, he would proveto be right. It was very often found to be a matter of something having been altered or addedor dropped out and this would be resolved by getting him back on the correct regimen anddoing the program by the book.If it doesn’t appear to resolve, no guesswork or experimentation is done. The person must begiven a medical check and any needed adjustment of his regimen then put in.In summary, it has been found that there are any number of ways in which one can departfrom the correct-procedure and the effects of one such departure can be similar to or appearto be similar to those of another. This can make some cases look complicated indeed—andunnecessarily so. So it has also been found that it is vital to indoctrinate the participant on thestandard actions of the program at the outset and then do everything possible to preserve thatstandardness throughout.69"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"Drugs:Their Effects andManifestations70"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"DRUGS: THEIR EFFECTS AND MANIFESTATIONSVarious manifestations turn up on the Purification program and these can vary widely fromperson to person.Anything from an insect bite to a full-blown restimulation of an LSD trip may turn on andthese simply run themselves through and vanish as the program is continued.In order to fully understand these manifestations, it is first necessary to know what drugsreally do.DRUGS ARE POISONSDrugs are essentially poisons. The degree they are taken determines the effect. A smallamount acts as a stimulant. A greater amount acts as a sedative. A larger amount acts as apoison and can kill one dead. This is true of any drug. Each has a different amount at which itgives those results.Some drugs have a direct and specific effect upon a person’s mind. Marijuana, peyote,morphine, heroin, etc., apparently turn on the mental image pictures one is stuck in, and turnthem on hard. LSD, originally designed for psychiatric use, can reportedly makeschizophrenics out of normal people.Though drugs are considered valuable by addicts to the degree they produce some “desirableeffect,” a person on drugs is dangerous to others around because he has blank periods. He hasunreality’s and delusions that remove him from present time.DRUGS AND REGRESSIONDrugs tend to regress a person. That is to say, they tend to throw him out of present time andinto his past. They can actually stick the person in periods of his past experiences, often pastexperiences with drugs, alcohol or medicine.Drugs—LSD, marijuana, alcohol and the remainder of the long list—produce a threat to thebody like any other poison. The threat is to the body. The being reacts by pulling in a mentalimage picture. Threatened with loss of a body, he pulls in a picture to put something there.What he puts there is some mental image picture from the past, sometimes a combination offancy and fact. He can do this in some cases so hard that it becomes more real (and safer, inhis estimation) than his present time.Thus, under threat he goes out of present time. (What has actually happened is that he haspulled some of his mental image pictures from the past up into present time so these areaffecting him in present time. But however one wants to view this, the truth of the matter isthat he is at least partially acting and thinking and feeling not out of this moment but out ofsome moment in the past in which he is now stuck.)A person’s time track is ordinarily made up of the recorded moment-to-moment eventsexperienced as he moves along through time. But when the person on drugs has pulled inpictures from the past his time track for this period is not being made up only of present timeevents. Instead, what is being recorded is a composite of past events, imagination and presentevents.Thus, right there before your eyes he, apparently in the same room as you are, doing the samethings, is really only partially there and partially in some past event.He seems to be there. But really he isn’t tracking fully with present time.71"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"What is going on, to a rational observer, is not what is going on to him. Thus he does notduplicate statements made by another but tries to fit them into his composite reality. In orderto fit them in he has to alter them.He may be sure he is helping you to repair the floor when in actual fact what you are doing iscleaning the floor. So his actions (which seem logical and correct to him) are actuallyhindering the operation in progress. Thus, when he “helps you” mop the floor he introduceschaos into the activity. Since he is repairing the floor, a request to “give me the mope getsreinterpreted as “hand me the hammer.” But the mop handle is larger than a hammer, so thebucket gets upset, with suds and water splashed all over the place.That is a mild example—the kind of thing that doesn’t make the headlines. But what of theaccidents, the crimes, the despair that leads to all manner of tragedies that do make theheadlines?As a being can come up with an infinity of combinations, there would be an infinity of typesof reactions to drugs.What is constant, however, is that he is not running in the same series of events as others.This can be slight, wherein the person is seen to make occasional mistakes. It can be asserious as total insanity where the events apparent to him are completely different than thoseapparent to anyone else. And it can be all grades in between.It isn’t that he doesn’t know what’s going on. It is that he perceives something else going oninstead of the actual present time series of events that is going on.PAINKILLERSIn 1969 I made a breakthrough on the action of painkillers (such as aspirin, tranquilizers,hypnotics and soporifics).At that time it had never been known in chemistry or medicine (and I am not sure that it isgenerally known today) exactly how or why these things worked. Such compositions arederived by accidental discoveries that “such and so depresses pain.”The effects of existing compounds are not uniform in result and often have very bad sideeffects.As the reason they worked was unknown, very little advance has been made in biochemistry.If the reason they worked were known and accepted, possibly chemists could develop someactual compounds which would have minimal side effects.Pain or discomfort of a psychosomatic nature comes from mental image pictures. These areunknowingly created by the person himself and they impinges or impress against the body.By actual clinical test, the actions of aspirin and other pain depressants are to:A. Inhibit the ability of the being to create mental image pictures,and alsoB. To impede the electrical conductivity of nerve channels.With this, the person is rendered stupid, blank, forgetful, delusive, irresponsible. He gets intoa “wooden” sort of state, unfeeling, insensitive, unable and definitely not trustworthy, amenace to his fellows, actually.72"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"When the drugs wear off or start to wear off, the ability to create starts to return and turns onsomatics much harder. One of the answers a person has for this is more drugs. To say nothingof heroin, there are, you know, aspirin addicts. The compulsion stems from a desire to get ridof the somatics and unwanted sensations again. There is also some evidence of dramatizationof the pictures turned on from earlier drug taking. The being gets more and more wooden,requiring more and more quantity and more frequent use of the drug.To paraphrase an old adage, we used to have iron men and wooden ships. We now have adrug society and wooden citizens.If one were working on this biochemically, the least harmful pain depressant would be onethat inhibited the creation of mental image pictures with minimal resulting “woodenness” orstupidity, and which was body-soluble so that it passed rapidly out of the nerves and system.There are no such biochemical preparations at this time.The medical aspect is an understandable wish to handle pain. Doctors should press for betterdrugs to do this that do not have such lamentable side effects. Drug companies would beadvised to do better research. The formula of least harmfulness is that given above.BURN-UP OF VITAMIN RESERVESDrugs can also temporarily stimulate (before they ruin them) body glands. And they canproduce momentary feelings of well-being or what is known as “euphoria.” Part of this isprobably caused by the fact that they shut off, temporarily, the painful mental image picturesfrom the past.They can also speed up the burning of reserves of vitamins. A drug or alcohol rapidly burnsup the vitamin B1 in the system. Certain drugs also burn up all available niacin and vitaminC. This speeded burn-up can also bring about a temporary feeling of well-being; it adds to the“happy state.”But when the system is out of B1, the person becomes depressed. When the reserves aregone, the delusions called delirium tremens or the withdrawal symptoms that follow arenightmarish indeed.”IF YOU’RE NUMB NOTHING CAN HURT YOU”Drug users, from observation, are apparently sitting on the fallacy that “if you’re numbnothing can hurt you.” Drugs, then, are probably a defense against the physical universesThey do block off pain and other unwanted sensations. But there is a whole sector ofdesirable sensations and drugs block off all sensations.Sexually it is common for someone on drugs to be very stimulated at first. This is the‘‘procreate before death” impulse, as drugs are a poison. But after the original sexual‘‘kicks”, the stimulation of sexual sensation becomes harder and harder to achieve. The effortto achieve it becomes obsessive while it itself is less and less satisfying. In spite ofpropaganda to the contrary, even sexual sensation is blocked off with drugs and this is trueeven after drugs have apparently heightened it for one or two times. After that it is dead,dead, dead.EMOTION, PERCEPTION AND SOMATIC SHUT-OFFThose who have been long and habitually on drugs, medicine or alcohol sometimes sufferfrom emotional, perception or somatic shut-offs. They appear anesthetized (unfeeling) and73"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"sometimes have “nothing troubling them,” whereas they are in reality in a suppressedphysical condition and cannot cease to take drugs or drink or medicine.Any such case took up drugs, medicine or alcohol because of unwanted pain, sensation ormisemotion. The person looked on drugs, alcohol or medicine as a cure for unwantedfeelings.The only briefs that can be held out for drugs is that they give a short, quick oblivion fromimmediate agony and permit the handling of a person to effect repair. But even this isapplicable only to persons who have no other system to handle their pain.Dexterity, ability and alertness are the main things that prevent getting into painful situationsand these all vanish with drugs.So drugs set you up to get into situations which are truly disastrous and keep you that way.DRUGS VERSUS LEARNINGDrugs impede learning. In view of all the other things drugs do, one might easily deduce this.But the statement is more than simply a deduction, it is empirically fact. Learning rate—thelength of time it takes someone to learn something— has been proven to be slower in drugusers than others. Actual tests show that the learning rate of a person who has been on drugsis much lower than that of a person who hasn’t.Drugs, then, would prevent a person from becoming educated. Now let’s weigh this againstthe fact that drug usage among students is not only tolerated in many schools and colleges,but some drugs are even employed in certain schools— one example being psychiatristsadvocating and pushing the use of dangerous, addictive drugs as a means to handle what aretermed “hyperactive” children.This may, indeed, be the root of the foul-up of current education which has been so widelypublicized in recent years. Teachers have been cited, in various articles in the press and othermedia, for failure or inability to teach. But the problem, at its root, may not be the teachers atall.Whatever the actual statistics may be on that score, certain it is that drugs are prevalent inschools. And certain it is that drugs impede learning and thus impede education.And a civilization that cannot be educated, that cannot learn, cannot last. This means thiscivilization will be ended unless we do something about it.LEARNING RATE AND CRIMINALITYWhere drugs are impeding learning, discipline would also be nonfunctional.The memory of a person who is on or has been on drugs is often such as to remove him fromfear of consequences for any of his actions. The answer, one might think, is discipline. Butdiscipline is enforced learning. If attempts to simply teach the value of ethics fail in the faceof impeded learning, attempts to teach by discipline and justice actions—enforced learning—fail even harder. The person who can’t learn and who is then subjected to attempts to forcelearning by disciplinary action simply becomes criminal.What good does it do a government to try to get police and justice actions into effect in asociety that cannot learn? Governmental threats, in a society that cannot learn, would be of nouse. The society would not learn from them; therefore it wouldn’t matter what measures the74"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"government took. A society that could not learn that was then subjected to attemptedenforced learning would, in the end, become criminal.MANIFESTATIONSAs a person sweats out the residual drugs in his system on the Purification program, anynumber of manifestations can occur. Such manifestations can be the result of one’s use of orexposure to any chemical substance or drug which has then lodged, in whatever minuteresidual amount, in the cells or tissues of the body.Incoming reports and medical case histories abound in statements from participants on theprogram where the person identified the reactions he was getting with past on-the-jobexperiences or occurrences in his life in general.They include, for example, reports of toxic exposure to vinyl paints, insecticides, paintthinner, a wide variety of industrial chemicals, preservatives, plant sprays and the like. Somehave turned on sensations which they recognize or identify with previous dental experiences,X-ray treatment, dental anesthetics such as Novocain or anesthetics for various operations, orany of the sensations accompanying various physical ills or injuries for which some type ofmedicine or drug was used.This includes, of course, in no small measure, experiences with street drugs or what are nowtermed in some quarters “recreational” drugs, such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hashish,LSD, etc. If there are drug residues to be flushed out it is no, uncommon for the person toexperience a restimulation of the exact effects from the drug or medicine when he first tookit.Thus, one might expect to encounter manifestations related to medical or pharmaceuticalchemicals, patent medicines, industrial or household chemicals as well as from anyexperience he may have had with hard street drugs. And this apparently can extend to anynutritional deficiency, or illness as a result of such deficiency, which has been caused by theingestion or absorption of any of these chemical substances.ACHES, PAINS, SOMATICSOld injuries or old somatics may turn on, flare up for a brief spell and then vanish. These maybe sharply defined and easily recognized by the individual as related to some formerexperience, or simply vague feelings of discomfort which are not identified as relating to anyone specific illness or injury or accident. They might range from headaches, to muscularspasms, muscular aches, swellings, skin rashes, hives, bronchial symptoms or any of anumber of other aches, pains or somatics.SENSATIONSParticipants have reported the following sensations while sweating out residuals in the sauna:Light, “cloudy” feelings in the head, floating sensations, dizziness, feelings of being “spaced-out,” numbness—often in the mouth and around gums or in some instances in the limbs orextremities, “hung-over” feelings, or any of the feelings accompanying street drugs.Periods of intoxication—drunkenness—have reactivated briefly for some individuals while inthe sauna, and then dissipated and vanished. Persons who have experienced radiation whileliving in areas of atomic bomb testings or fallout, and some who were in the armed servicesin Vietnam who were subject to the defoliant, Agent Orange, have done the Purificationprogram with some very interesting results and tremendous relief reported.75"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"SMELLS AND TASTESVery often the person will reexperience the smell or taste of some particular substance. Someof those described by program participants are: a metallic taste, an ether-like smell, the tasteof Novocain, “a bitter taste,” a “medicine-like” taste, a “chemical-like” taste, a marijuanasmell, to name just a few of those which have been reported.These can show up, too, as unusual body odors emitted during periods of sweating in thesauna.An example is one participant who had worked for some time as a lifeguard at a swimmingpool containing chlorinated water. For a certain period on the program, while in the sauna, heexuded sweat with such a strong and overpowering smell of chlorine that others had totemporarily leave the sauna!EMOTIONSEmotions which have been shut off or suppressed may start to reappear. The person may gothrough emotional reactions connected with past biochemical experiences and these reactionswill then dissipate. The individual may also go through a period of dullness or stupidity and,as he comes through it, become more aware. He may find he can then do actions more easilyand consequences may start to take on a new meaning for him. Memory can return.DIFFERENCES AND CHANGES IN INTENSITYFrom reports based on direct observation, apparently what can happen in some cases (not all)is that the residuals of several past drugs and other chemicals (sometimes every drug ormedicine the person has taken) can restimulate simultaneously and turn on heavily in the firstweek or ten days of the program at lower dosages of, say, up to 1000 mg. of niacin.Others will experience these effects in a more graduated sequence, one following the other.It doesn’t always happen in an orderly fashion and in some instances it can be more severethan in others. But as the person sweats out the drug residuals and goes through anyaccompanying manifestations, the effects tend to become lighter and eventually no effectswill show up even on the higher amounts of Niacin.A given manifestation may turn on, may or may not intensify, and then vanish wholly orpartly in any one day. Then it may turn on again the following day, but less intensely. If oneincreases the vitamin and mineral dosage at this time, he manifestation is likely to turn onagain, but it will be milder. These things don’t become more and more severe day by day;they become less and less so day by day, providing the Purification program is continuedproperly.At length the vitamins, minerals and other program actions no longer turn the manifestationon at all; it is gone. There is evidence that no amount of vitamin and mineral dosage above acertain final level for that individual will turn the manifestation on again.CORRECT GRADIENT IS THE KEYThe trick is to take a proper gradient with the vitamins and mineral dosages. When these areadministered in too steep a gradient a manifestation can turn on awfully hard, so the correctgradient must be kept in. And one must not “chicken out” and discontinue the program withmanifestations still occurring, either.76"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"From the original research and piloting of this program, from reports of those subsequentlydelivering it and from personal reports of those who have completed it, one can expect an)variety of manifestations to come up, not all of them comfortable by any means. There seemsto be no set limit as to the variety of effects which can appear as the toxic residuals arereleased.However, where the person was on a sensible and well-kept schedule, with correct nutrientdosages and all other parts of the Program followed, these manifestations would deintensifyand disappear without hanging up and without undue discomfort for the person. In otherwords, an individual will experience the effects caused by any nutritional deficiencies as wellas the restimulative effects of the toxic substances as they become active and discharge, buthe comes through these periods satisfactorily on a standard program.As long as the precautions listed earlier are well taken and the procedure followed exactly asgiven, the solution to any manifestation that turns on is to continue the program as outlined,with the manifestation diminishing—becoming less frequent, less intense—until it ceasesaltogether.77"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Appendix78"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"AN EXAMINATION OF PURIFICATION PROGRAM RESULTSCompiled by the EditorsSince 1979, when L. Ron Hubbard fully developed the breakthrough he called thePurification program, two major factors—indeed trends—have been contributing to thephenomenal popularity of the program. The first is the growing public awareness of thealarming extent to which we are faced with chemical bombardment and long-term toxic anddrug residue build-up in our bodies. The second factor is the program’s results. Fromtestimonials to scientifically controlled experiments, the benefits claimed by people from allparts of the world who have experienced the program are routinely spectacular and wellworth reporting.The editors have assembled a sampling of just some of thousands of reports from people whohave completed the program.There is no claim made regarding what the program will specifically do for any one person.However, such things as enormously increased energy, faster learning rate, new levels ofmental concentration, freedom from dependence on chemicals, substantially better perceptioncapabilities, a greater feeling of general well-being as well as improvements in a broad rangeof health categories, are the types of reports that are commonplace among the tens ofthousands of people who have completed, the Purification program.I remember what I was like prior to taking drugs. I was full of life and energy anddreams. Life was very c/ear and uncomplicated. I had a very good family life—one inwhich I loved and trusted my parents. I also had close friends that I enjoyed realrelationships with as I was growing up. More than anything I wanted to be happy andhave a game to play in which I would win.But something happened along the way. I got involved with drugs. I was not trying todestroy myself—drugs were the “in” thing—to many people in my generation theywere considered part of the “answer.” It was too late by the time I realized that drugswere destroying my life. I had become “spaced out” from drugs, detached very muchfrom Life itself. Those things that I had held precious in my youth— family, moralityand honest friendships—were a thing of the past. Really caring about life and otherpeople were beyond my grasp. What relationships I did have became superficial.I remember wondering if I could ever really care about someone again. I was scared,as I realized that I was not the same person I had been before drugs. I was not assharp, my mind was a fog. I was bitter and untrusting. If there was one part of my lifethat I wanted to change it was the fact that I had done drugs. There was not a day thatwent by that I did not worry about this. This only heightened my despair as I knewthat I couldn’t turn back time. Even after quitting drugs entirely I remained aware ofthe fact that I was not the same person that I had been before. The guilt, bitternessand sorrow was staggering.Then I did L. Ron Hubbard’s Purification program. I have now handled the effects ofthe drugs that I had taken. I got my energy back and I am no longer walking aroundin a fog. I can think clearly and my mind is quick and decisive again. I have my driveback and I’m a part of life. I feel real emotions again that have been shut off foryears. I can confront having real and honest relationships with others and I’mrestoring those which I lost. In fact I feel as if I have to make up for lost time as I havewasted away years of my life. Now I want to be able to do something constructive withevery minute.I only hope that everyone else who has been involved with drugs, be they street drugs,medicinal drugs, etc., has the same opportunity as / have had and that they do this79"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"program. It will change their lives for the better, and there is an awful lot of good thatcan be done with one’s life to have that ruined by drugs. L. Ron Hubbard’sPurification program performed a miracle for me. It gave me back my life and I amliving proof of that. B.D.Ability to Think ClearlyI feel totally in present time and totally in control of my attention—no morewandering thoughts or broken attention spans. Mental computations are now crystalclear and lightning fast. I.D.Yes! I have finished the Purification program. The greatest thing about it was I knew Iwas finished. The symptoms are unmistakable—thinking clearer, feeling light andenergetic, even handled my insomnia problem to a considerable degree. Quality ofsleep vastly improved! EL.I definitely feel the Purification program has been a great help to me physically,mentally and emotionally. I haven’t felt this good in quite a while. I am able to think alot clearer, sleep better and get along with my fellow man better. This has been agiant step in my recovery from drugs. R.G.Increased EnergyI cannot believe it!!! My body is energetic, I am no longer dependent on coffee, sugaror any other stimulant (I had a terrible problem of physical ups and downs before theprogram and felt dependent on some type of stimulant). I am much more calm andrelaxed, and my whole outlook on life has changed; it seems almost unbelievable. Iam happier than I’ve ever been. This is the first time in seven years I feel like I can(and I want to) really create my future. I feel like a new person. Seven years ago waswhen I first had a large amount of “heavy” drugs (actually I never was a heavy druguser—the heaviest being only marijuana, codeine for tonsillitis and Novocain. But itwas after that point that I was never quite the same. The marijuana had a bad effecton me and those things that turned on never left . . . until now. [Now I am calm,relaxed, ready to create and expand a new life. A.S.It’s just amazing how you can go along day to day and think you are functioningoptimally when actually you are dull and not up to par at all—it is so subtle that youreally don’t realize what is affecting you until you do the Purification program andfind out what it feels like to no longer be under the influence of anesthetics. If anyonehad told me that I was going around half-unconscious all the time I wouldn’t havebelieved them. But that’s the state l was in. Actually from the first time I had ananesthetic as a child—ether when I had my tonsils removed and then each operationafter that just built up the anesthetics in my system. Sometimes it was an effort to beactive, and [since completing the Purification program] that is totally gone. What aprogram— when you think of how many people are out there walking around feelingsort of dull and listless and just thinking they are just getting old or this and thatreason for it—it’s really incredible. Prior to the Purification program I used to getperiods of being very tired and always attributed it to working too hard, etc. With theanesthetics totally out of my system l have not had any occurrence of this “tired old”feeling I am bright and feel that my thinking processes are at their optimum. L.H.Before I started the Purification program I was tired most of the time I needed a lot ofsleep and my body was always tired and out of tune ‘ Now, after the Purificationprogram, I always feel energetic I get up earlier and I always am rested.

But I think the most spectaculargains were not physical. I feel brighter, more enthusiastic about life. My memory hasimproved. I don’t feel confused or jumbled up.

You keepstraining to see, you stop and rub at it with a cloth, you just can’t get it clean so youkeep going, hoping you’ll be able to see. What a relief to get the glass really clean, soyou can really see out! The Purification program is just like that, for your body. Itremoved chemicals and drugs from more than twenty years back that have had theirunpleasant, recurring effects on me all this time. One of the best and most surprisingresults of this program is that my near-sightedness has actually improved—I have toget less powerful lenses for my eyes. It’s like getting a new body.My vision has become brighter and improved. My taste is much sharper and somethings even taste completely different now, through a purified body. I wouldrecommend the Purification program HIGHLY to ANYONE. M.CI just completed the Purification program and I feel fantastic. My body moves easilyinstead of being sluggish. I no longer have those “pictures” which used to confuseme. Now they’re gone and there’s nothing between me and what I observe. I amhappier and more self-confident. L.M.Along with the many other changes and benefits I experienced from the Purificationprogram is one very important thing. My eyesight is improved, especially my nightvision. Before, I feel I was 80 percent blind at night. Now it may be only 15 percent.I’m not a doctor but I’m the guy who has to look out of these two eyes and it isimproved. R.H.After completing the program all my main senses seemed improved—hearing, smell,taste, touch. And I have more strength in my hands than I used to have. I am a lotmore stable, and more myself than ever before. PG.Mental AcutenessSince having finished the Purification program my ability to study has increasedabout double plus. My ability to spot and handle things I don’t understand has gottenvery acute. There is a lot less hesitancy to dive into some theory or do some practicaldrill that I have never done before or am not familiar with, due to the fact of seeingthings more clearly and just seeming to have a quicker ability to compute andduplicate correctly what it actually is I am studying L.M.81"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"It is much easier to concentrate on the study materials.

With the program nowdone, I feel I’m better at studying. It’s easy for me to understand anything. I grasp themeanings of things in an instant I even feel more intelligent and I have become one ofthe best students on my courses. CD.Feeling Clean and HealthyI recently completed the Purification program and 1 must say it was the bestcleansing program I’ve ever been on. Before doing the program I had been on dietsdone exercise programs and fasted in an effort to cleanse my body of the toxins andimpurities. But on all these programs, the residual deposits of drugs in the body werenever addressed and so I continued to be affected by them. For instance, I’d gorunning and jog loose some residual effects of sodium pentothal from a previous toothextraction and I’d feel faint for a few seconds at a time intermittently over the nextfew weeks. On the Purification program my circulation improved greatly and Isweated out all residual drug deposits. The proof of this to me is how I feel now. Noneof the previous ”side-effects” of drugs occur anymore when I exercise and am heavilyactive! I feel really healthy! M.M.There is no doubt in my mind that this Purification program has made considerableimprovements in my body in spite of the abuses to it during the past 67 years! L.T.Physically I feel much better since being on the Purification program. My appetite isunder my control. Before, I would go on eating binges. Now I don’t I eat what I wantbut it’s not too much and I eat more healthful foods. My skin, which broke out badlythe first time I came off drugs, has cleared up a lot. It’s now on the road to recovery. Ifeel much better about myself and my body. S.U.At first when I started the Purification program I didn’t think much would happen—and the first few days nothing much did happen. Then all of a sudden I got sick for noapparent reason one night and it felt really good to go into the sauna the next day andsweat it out, plus the change in vitamins gave my body more of a chance to handlegetting sick I could actually feel the toxic poisons and past drugs I had taken comingout of my body. The nauseousness headaches aches and pains, usually didn’t last verylong and as long as I didn’t stop doing my normal routine they would come out anddissipate with no problems. The main thing is that every time I would feel just a littlebit (or a lot) stronger, healthier, cleaner—it was like growing a new body. L.WRecovery from DrugsI have just participated in a miracle. I would never have believed that I would everfeel this good again. The Purification program saved my life, my soul, and in additionhas made me a better human being. T.K.My Purification program is finally complete and without a doubt I’d call it a completesuccess. I originally did it because I wanted to kick the drug scene, as well as myinability to do good in school. What I’ve gotten out of it is much, much more. I cannow face up to everyday life and its problems without having to depend on a “crutch”to get me through the day.

World champion motorcyclistRadiation: Case HistoriesReports have also been received which detail the results of the Purification program onpeople with a history of radiation exposure. One physician reported this when he completedthe program:Prior to starting the Purification program, I had a history of moderately heavyradiation exposure. This consisted of long periods of sun exposure through childhoodand college and frequent X-ray exposure from working around X-ray machines withpatients for some seven-odd years. I had no physical problems or complaints uponstarting the Purification program. My drug history had been very fight During theprogram J had several episodes of extreme flush, splotchy rashes accompanied bynausea and a very solid, wooden feeling At times, there was an electrical kind ofdischarge from the body especially to the arms and hands. Interesting enough, afterthe program I realized several low-grade somatics that I previously had ignored weregone Small things, like occasionally unexplained nausea or mild aches in the musclesand joints. Consequently some attention is freed from the body and the abovesomatics have not particularly reoccurred in the two years since finishing theprogram. From my viewpoint as a physician, this raises several questions on whateffects low-grade radiation of different types over a lifetime can have on a being orhis body—probably more significant than is currently recognized. GD.84"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"One individual worked on a contamination clean-up crew at the atomic research center inHanford, Washington. He had worked inside nuclear reactors and once reported inhalinghighly contaminated dust. He said he recalled working in one specific area that was so “hot”he was only permitted one minute of work in the area per day. Other areas he’d worked inhad longer “burn-out” time such as ten minutes or thirty minutes. He later underwent thePurification program.Before the program I felt “massy” around the head. I thought I was doing okay but Iknew it wasn’t quite right. I felt as though something needed to be handled. Whiledoing the program I went through periods of blankness for days. I just couldn’t seemto remember things. Also, I went through about one week of not being able to catchmy breath. You know I didn’t even realize I had had a problem with it, but now I canrecall shortness of breath while mountain climbing, but only when the weather washot. After the program, I am in great shape. I feel sharp, alert and ready to face life. Isure do feel better about life and myself now. B.H.Two particular cases focused on the US atomic testing in the 1950s.One such case involves a person who grew up in Utah and as a child was exposed to theradioactive fallout from the US government’s nuclear tests in neighboring Nevada. Hecompleted the Purification program in February of 1980 and described some of hisexperiences:It should be noted what happened one night in the sauna. After I had been in there forsome three hours I turned on a tremendous amount of radiation. There was noredness with the niacin, merely the tremendous heat and pain I felt when I got a gooddeal of radiation from atomic blasts in 1953. I almost died from radiation burns atthat time. I received a great deal of atomic radiation from drinking water that hadbeen filled with fallout. In the sauna I experienced the full return of that moment. I feltthe grief and the anger and the pain and the swelling of the face and the blisters andthe pain through to the bones. I then went back into the sauna and was able to “blowoff” a good deal of this feeling by further sauna exposure.I feel I have now run out all the drugs and the extreme radiation that I was exposed toin this lifetime. I regained my affinity for people and have a greater love andtolerance for them as a result of the drugs being removed. There have been times onthis program when I felt such exhilaration and felt the way I felt when I was a kid . . .My energy level has picked up tremendously.My friends that I grew up with have not been so fortunate. The atomic tests or thefallout from those tests in Nevada, falling on Utah, have done such a great deal ofdamage to so many lives. Some of my friends in Utah are dead as a result of thosetests. My life would have gone by the boards if I had not had this program. There is adeep sense of gratitude to L. Ron Hubbard for this program. H.J.Another case was a man who was one of 2,100 marines who received orders to participate innuclear weapons testing at the Nevada test site. He witnessed two atomic detonations in Juneand July of 1957. The second explosion, 77 kilotons,” was the largest atmospheric blast testever conducted within the continental limits of the United States. He was in an open trench 3miles from the explosion. Shortly afterwards, he was sent in to within 300 yards of “groundzero.” He once described to a newspaper reporter his recollection of the first blast.We were told to bend down in the ditch and cover our eyes with our forearms. When thatblast went off, I could see the bone in my arm through my closed eyes... We were thrownback and forth in that ditch. It was like a stampede of cattle went over us.

He said he went to thirty-six doctors but they couldn’tdetermine what was wrong with him. Years later people had told him about the program andin 1983 he decided to try it. He reported his observations:My improvements were multifaceted. When I began this program I had reached thepoint where I felt that a return to well-being was highly improbable if not impossible.During the first thirteen to fourteen days of the program I continued to believe thatimprovement was out of the question for me. And then— WHAMO! Somethingmiraculous happened! Damned if I didn’t begin to feel better. A little better at first insubtle yet noticeable ways. For instance, my stamina increased; my feelings oftiredness began to dissipate slowly and grudgingly. Towards the end of the program Irealized that I had more vitality than at any time in the last seven or eight years.Emotionally, I felt up. Depression lifted and I could once again feel exhilaration whensuch moments occurred. There is new hope for radiation victims! I’m the living proofof it! IS.Chemical Exposure: An Occupational Case HistoryOne which was particularly noteworthy involved a woman who went to her physiciancomplaining of chemical exposure. Among her complaints were a constant feeling oftiredness, skin problems, and a general feeling of “feeling terrible all the time.” She said shewas exposed to toxic chemicals during her employment at an electronics manufacturingcompany. Each night she cleaned filters in a system designed to entrap soot and otherparticles. She washed them with already contaminated water which she described as blackishand oily.After several interviews with medical experts, an occupational health specialist suggested sheundergo L. Ron Hubbard’s program under his care. She decided to do so.Four days into the program she reported “black junk” coming from her pores that resembledwater she used at work. This was noted on the arms, neck, face. The outpouring of this Flacksoily material continued throughout the program though in lesser and lesser amounts until shewas done.Her physician, a diploma in occupational medicine and a medical doctor for over twentyyears, who also holds a Masters of Public Health degree, reported his observations whichincluded the following:I saw her for a post-treatment evaluation. Subjectively, she was feeling fine . . . Shenoted specifically a great increase in her energy level, felt that her eyesight was muchimproved, that her skin had cleared considerably, including improvement in the gumproblems that she had noted, hair less oily, and other subjective improvements suchas better outlook on life, decrease in the lymph gland’s swellings and a generalimprovement in her feeling of well-being . . .In summary, this patients has had a very successful response to the Hubbard programof detoxification. She feels well and is ready to return to full employment of any typewhich she can find.I am convinced that the Hubbard program of detoxification is the only mechanismnow available to rid the body of fat-soluble toxic substances. I believe this case willamply demonstrate that it is indeed, effective.Agent Orange: Case HistoriesIn the last several years, one of the most controversial if not explosive toxic contaminationtopics has been Agent Orange, the herbicide-defoliant sprayed by United States military86"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"aircraft in the jungles of Vietnam. The key ingredient in Agent Orange is dioxin, a deadlychemical reported to store in body tissues and which even in minute quantities can causeserious adverse health effects.There have been several cases where individuals who claimed they had been exposed toAgent Orange completed the Purification program. While no facility delivering thePurification program makes claims for the elimination of Agent Orange symptoms, thefollowing reports are examples that do offer great hope.Prior to the Purification program something was wrong Objectively, I was actinganalytically but from time to time subjectively I would experience psychosis andneurosis in specific areas of my life which tended to hamper me as a being. I am anex-Marine who had fought in the Vietnam War from 1968 to 1969.Besides the constant fighting, I also was exposed to deadly poisonous gases andtoxins, especially Agent Orange and some sort of nerve gas, while in the service andin the Vietnam War. Through the Purification program these toxins were fully flushedout. They had actually prevented me from thinking straight and logically; inhibitedmy perceptions and control of my body. Boy, was I ever in for a surprise during theprogram and after completion!I literally erased an incident which had me stuck on “the track,” dramatizing it inpresent time, that I wasn’t aware of. I had considered my environment dangerous—Imean really dangerous as it was in the jungles of South Vietnam. But would youbelieve that I was still “in” South Vietnam though I left it in 1969? I was fully broughtout of it as well as oriented to my present environment by the Purification program.It really undercuts everything. I mean, these were such very simple actions to do butpowerful insofar as the results and gains I had. Both objectively and subjectively, thePurification program has changed my life, my physical well-being and my attitudetowards a much better existence of survival. I no longer have to look over myshoulder for “the enemy” (which wasn’t there) or walk carefully through any grassyareas (looking for land mines which don’t exist) so that I can five another day.It has opened a door for me—a door through which I can experience life. My physicalbeing is much better insofar as its coloration and pigment. Many other people havecommented on how healthy I look I feel healthy and I am aware that I am in control ofmy body which had been hampered prior to the Purification program by those toxins,especially Agent Orange. As a Vietnam vet, I can say that life is definitely worthwhileto experience and create. There is hope for those Vietnam vets who are still in theVietnam War syndrome after being out of the war. WB.Here is another report, from a man who enlisted in the Army in 1962. In 1964, he wasairlifted to Saigon, Vietnam, and from there on to Thailand. In a legally sworn affidavit, hetells his story:During that year, October 1964 to October 1965, I noticed that aircraft wouldsometimes spray the jungle just outside the base I was on. During one of thesesprayings the wind was blowing in my direction and some of the spray mist landed onmy skin in the area of my neck and upper chest. A corporal had told me that thespraying was done to keep the jungle from growing too high. Within a week or so ofthe spray coming in contact with my skin, I had developed open sores that bledslightly. These were just in the area that the spray mist had touched.I went to the field hospital to have this condition checked as I was afraid of what washappening These sores did not heal at all and seemed to be getting worse. I wasexamined at that field hospital and the sores were diagnosed as acne; very acuteacne. I was told to wash better and was given some peroxide to use to clean the sores.87"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"I did exactly as told and the sores got deeper. One was so deep that I could put a “Q-Tip” all the way into it and past the cotton swab on the end of the “Q-Tip.” I must sayI felt very apathetic about this condition.I was due for return to the United States and release from the service in October1965. I went again to the field hospital for my medical release and again was told Idid not wash good enough and still had the acne. I was not and am not a doctor so Ibelieved what I was told and took my release and returned to the United States whereI was discharged.From October 1965 until sometime in 1978 I had these sores. They were always openand sometimes bleeding slightly. Sometimes I would also be upset mentally.During 1978 I was a parishioner at the Church of Scientology Mission of FortLauderdale, Florida. One of the services offered at the mission at the time was aprogram designed to handle the harmful effects of drug residues stored in the body.This program was called the “Sweat Program.”Within two weeks after starting the “Sweat Program” besides the spiritual benefit Iwas feeling, the sores had cleared up and I felt good again although the sores had nottotally disappeared.The “Sweat Program” was later refined and improved upon and was replaced by thePurification program. During 1981 I did the Purification program and the soreshealed totally. It was while on this program that I finally realized that the sores camefrom the Agent Orange that I was exposed to in 1965.The experience related above was not unique. Another man served with a Marine Air TrafficControl Unit in Vietnam from August 1967 to August 1968. He was sure he was exposed toAgent Orange as they sprayed the defoliant within two or three miles of his base.Upon returning from Vietnam, I had continual problems with rashes all over my body.I later found out this is termed chloracne. 1 also had liver problems, continuousheadaches (migraine) and an inability to tolerate much liquor without getting ill.Additionally, my wife had two miscarriages and had since not been able to getpregnant.About a year ago, I completed the Purification program. I no longer am troubled withthe chloracne. I still have white spots on my body where I had had rashes in the past.I seldom have headaches and the headaches I do have are rarely of the intensity of theones I previously had.My wife is now pregnant again and is over four months along The longest she wasable to carry a pregnancy in the past was less than three months. I attribute thesechanges in my physical health directly to having done L. Ron Hubbard’s Purificationprogram.This ex-Marine wrote his report in December of 1981. The child he was expecting at the timewas born healthy, a baby boy. And his family has grown since then, as the couple went on tohave another child, a healthy baby girl.Scientific TestingThree years after the program was released, it was independently tested on a group of peoplewho were contaminated with a fire-retardant chemical (polybrominated biphenyl’s or PBBs).They were residents of the state of Michigan where millions of people were exposed to thechemical during a massive agricultural contamination in the early 1970s. Previous studies had88"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"already established that it takes ten to twenty years or more for the stored residues of PBBsand similar chemicals, such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl’s, components which arefound in industrial coolants) to be reduced naturally by just one half In light of this, the groupof researchers designed a study to measure their fat levels of PBBs, PCBs and several otherchemicals before, immediately after, and four months following Purification program.
