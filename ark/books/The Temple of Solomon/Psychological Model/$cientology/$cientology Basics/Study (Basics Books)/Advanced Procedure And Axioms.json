If the material becomes confusing or you can'tseem to grasp it, there will be a word just earlier that you have not understood. Don'tgo any further, but go back to BEFORE you got into trouble, find the misunderstoodword or phrase and get it defined. There is a glossary at the end of this book.IntroductionThere are three points of address in any case. These are THOUGHT, EMO-TION and EFFORT.The use of these three is established by the estimation by the auditor of thepreclear on the tone scale. In any relatively high-level case all three may be usedinterchangeably.There are five types of cases. The types are high tone, normal, neurotic,dramatizing psychotic and computing psychotic. These are bracketed successivelyfrom 5.0 down the scale to below 2.0.There are two case aspects. These are wide open; occluded. Every case hasone or more computations, one or more service facsimiles, one or more dramatiza-tions, one or more sympathy exciters, one or more present-time problems, one ormore future goals, and only one emotional curve since this is common to every case.These data combine into any aspect of any case and solve any case.An outline, definition and description of these data is the subject of this briefmanual.Self-Determinism ProcessingThe key to the processes outlined in this book lies in the self-determinism ofindividuals.Man has arrived at a place where he is capable of controlling his environmentto an extent much greater than he has ever realized.The results of self-determined action and the action itself may be modified bythe environment, which, by space, gravity and such matters, limits the action of thehuman being. BUT this does not alter the fact that the mind attempts full self-determinism and to a very marked extent achieves it.Along each and every dynamic the mind makes a self-determined effort. Self-determinism is positive and strong in its native state.The only thing which can actually alter self-determinism and reduce it is self-determinism itself. One can determine to be used or worked upon by the environ andits people but until one makes a determination to do so, one is not so affected."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS5Each and every aberration of the human mind and the human body has an ini-tial postulate to be so aberrated. Engrams are effective only when the individual him-self determines that they will be effective.Every individual has what is called a service facsimile. This is actually part of achain of incidents which the individual uses to invite sympathy or cooperation on thepart of the environment. One uses engrams to handle himself and others and the en-viron after one has himself conceived that he has failed to handle himself, others andthe general environ.At first an individual is completely aware that he is using engrams. Then theuse of them itself becomes a curtain to that awareness and proceeds toward anautomatic (but nonetheless self-determined) use of the engrams.When one fails as himself, he explains that failure even to himself by con-sciously, at first, choosing his service facsimile. Thereafter his own body and mentalcondition become subject to it.The first self-determinism which leads to aberration is the decision to be hu-man. The affinity, reality, and communication indulged in by a human being is neces-sary to being human. One determines to exert ARC. One then becomes subject towhat he has determined. ARC with individuals in a very aberrated state is necessarilya very low ARC. It is not that ARC is bad but that ARC with low-toned individuals isbad.Any individual under processing can be discovered to be using service fac-similes. Everything which is wrong with him he has selectively and particularly cho-sen to be wrong with him.Every thought or computation has behind it a physical observation or effort orcounter-effort. But there is also a free source of theta which is itself continually self-determining or is capable of being so. Thus it is not necessary to exhaust efforts andcounter-efforts since the individual has FREE CHOICE in his use of those efforts orcounter-efforts.Every aberration, every service facsimile is non-survival. The individual evalu-ated a situation, found it necessary, in order to go on living to use a service facsimile.But the moment it was used he became ever afterwards subject to it.In such wise an individual became the effect of his own causes.It is the role of the auditor to discover, with the preclear, the moments whenthe preclear postulated conclusions of any kind on any subject. These conclusionsare occasionally smothered by mis-emotion, such as sympathy, and by general ARC.They can also be smothered by physical pain.The running of engrams is itself a therapy. Self-determinism processing andemotion processing are finer and more complete levels of processing since theyreach all cases which can be gotten into present time communication. The engram isnever effective until the individual chooses to use it.It is interesting that choosing to use an engram on any dynamic also includes,when the operation fails, all other dynamics. Thus any non-survival wish or action, if itfails, recoils upon the user. One postulates a non-survival action for a group or foranother person or a life form and, if it fails, is subjected to it himself: again by his own"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS6choice! Thus, trying to stop somebody from coughing by being annoyed will result, ifthe effort fails, in starting one coughing. Here is a mechanism interposed in the cycleof stimulus-response restimulation which demonstrates that whereas surface obser-vation says that restimulation can occur, deeper study shows that an interim step ofself-determinism is necessary for ANY restimulation to take place. Man is so aber-rated at this date that it took considerable processing to discover this interim factorand to discover that the interim factor is far more important than the mechanism ofrestimulation and that restimulation ceases by picking up the inner postulate betweena source of restimulation and being restimulated.The extent of free choice is remarkable. The amount a case can be improvedby self-determinism processing is even more remarkable.It may be hard for one to realize at first that he wished himself ill. But recall thetime when you tried to get out of school or work. In such a wise one wished all hisailments upon himself.There is also, with self-determinism, the emotion of intention. That emotionwith which one enters an incident greatly influences the effort and can be run asemotion. Running \"determinism\" as an emotion, whether to see or to get rid of a psy-chosomatic illness, produces broad results. Run the emotion of \"determinism\" off alifetime and one picks up all non-survival courses. The effort itself falls away, un-touched but canceled.JusticeHuman beings have a very high native sense of justice. Justice could be calledthe adjudication of the relative rightness or wrongness of a decision or an action.(See Logic 7.)Infinite rightness would be infinite survival. How wrong can a person be?Dead!When the individual is small he cannot enforce justice except by using rela-tively low-scale ARC. Instead of forthright action, then (a thing which he will attemptbut which will fail), he is capable of making the aberrated effort of gaining sympathyto prove his point.All service facsimiles are used out of an effort to stay in ARC, however lowscale. The individual, failing in his childish lack of strength to effect justice when hehas been wronged, retains the facsimile of the injustice and everything consequentupon it as living proof of the wrong which has been done him. Thus one finds AA'sand birth rather commonly in restimulation, but only after they have been called intoplay by the individual himself. Men recover from injuries but they do not recover,short of processing, from their own self-determinism.The major service facsimile keys are then to be found in an area of injusticewhich is crass and blunt, and which is very much in the awareness of the preclear.They occur, these key incidents, anytime from two to ten or even later. The individualanswers the injustice by wishing off the injury or illness upon another. This failing, hetakes it himself. Later sympathy for the purveyor of poor justice and general ARCself-determinism can occlude these service facsimiles of injustice."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS7The resolution of the service facsimile depends then upon getting up enoughself-determined postulates and enough sympathy and other emotion to lay bare inclarity a part of the chain. Then one breaks up the chain.The difference between Homo sapiens and Homo novis is that Homo sapiensis uniformly using a service facsimile or the whole chain and does not realize that heis using it but explains it as disease or mental illness or psychosomatic illness, whileHomo novis is not using the service facsimile and knows what he can occasion withhimself.In relatively skilled hands it is a 25 to 50 hour process to advance a Homosapiens to a Homo novis. This compares to a 200 to a 2,000 hour process of runningengrams. The engrams do not need to be run but become ineffective when the de-terminism to have them is cleared away.Justice and injustice should be kept in mind throughout the process.The Role of the AuditorThe auditor is essentially a technician.Existing techniques are such as to determine a scathing fact: An auditor whocannot achieve results does not know his tools.Existing techniques are tools. Any tool requires intelligent handling and a deft-ness in application.The user of any tool, whether it be a stone axe, an adze or a Geiger counter,must acquire confidence in that tool and confidence in his ability to use that tool.An auditor is most successful when he has achieved an inexorable self-confidence in himself, in his tools, in his attitude toward the preclear and in the resultshe means and determines to achieve.Any science is to some degree an art. The less variation in its results, the lessit is an art. A perfect and \"invariable\" science still would contain the variable of its ap-plicator. However, for the first time in the history of Man, we have achieved minimalvariation of application for we can restore the native ability of the individual applicatorto be self-confident. There is no argument about the exactness of our processes.Nothing, tritely and truly, succeeds like success in auditing. Restored confi-dence in self aided by success in results markedly shortens for the auditor the timehe will have to spend on any preclear and increases his level of success.An auditor should attain personal and general self-confidence. He should thenattain a good theoretical knowledge of his tools. He should have a period of applica-tion wherein he gains an excellent practical knowledge of those tools. He should thenhave several signal successes. If these steps are followed, an auditor's use of hisscience should be certain and broad.The Evolution of ManMan evidently began as a monocell, without inter-cellular relation problems.He developed by counter-efforts to a degree which banded together many cells with"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS8one central control center. He joined then with a second control center and, dual,evolved organically into Man.The problems of the monocell by itself were strenuous but uncomplicated,having relationship only with the environment in its grossest form – pure MEST.These problems included such phenomena as the explosion of cosmic rays.The problems of a cellular colony under one control center were yet similar tothose of the monocell. The protagonist had but one personality and one antagonist –MEST. Vegetable and invertebrate problems are found in this period.The problems of the dual control stage began severely and continued in con-fusion.Interpersonal relations, when in difficulty, have their foot in the elementaryproblems of the dual control problems wherein the current control center confuses itsancient problems with its partner center with the problems the organism may havewith other individuals in the environment.The evolution of Man presents many fascinating aspects but all have basicsimplicities. There are, essentially, only two sets of problems: The problems betweenthe control center of the mind and the elements; the problem of the control center ofthe mind with its alternate control center.An auditor need only resolve, in any case, the essential basic confusions ofthe preclear in each of these two sets.The evolution of Man is to date organic. At this date we have introduced an-other evolution level – thought.The auditor is causing any preclear he processes to evolve into a higher planethan was hitherto reached on the evolutionary scale. He is NOT re-establishing apast norm. His goal is the establishment of the potential control center as the self-determined center of control of the mind. The work of the auditor is not related to anypast \"ology\" but to evolution itself. It is not medical nor biological nor psychological,no matter if these enter incidentally as by-products of processing. That which theauditor is doing has no past standards. But it has its own standard, its own operation,as precise as building any bridge. The goal must not be violated or lessened.Advanced Procedure(See Glossary, also Axioms, for definitions of technical terms)The auditor and preclear are a group.To function well a group must be cleared.The clearing of a group is not difficult. It requires but little time.The relationship of the auditor and preclear is not parity. The auditor lendshimself to the group as the control center of the group until the preclear's sub-controlcenter is established under his own control center's command. The role of the auditorceases at that moment.The auditor necessarily owns the preclear. He owns the preclear on a lessen-ing basis until the preclear owns himself."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS9If the auditor wishes to successfully own, to the end of NOT owning the pre-clear, he must not use the preclear to the service of the auditor for this establishesand confirms the ownership and inhibits the preclear from owning himself.THE FIRST ACT of the auditor concerns himself. He assesses the task ratherthan the preclear and assesses the matter within himself. He establishes whether ornot he desires the preclear to become established under the preclear's own center ofcontrol. To do this the auditor may find it necessary to straight-wire himself for theremoval of any reason why he does not want this preclear to be owned by the pre-clear. He then postulates to himself what he wants to happen with this preclear andpostulates as well that he can do this task with this preclear. He must feel thesepostulates solidly. If he cannot he must discover why he cannot. Thus the first ses-sion's first minutes with the preclear are concerned with the auditor himself. Heshould take time out from the preclear until he himself is established in his task andthen readdress the preclear.THE SECOND ACT in addressing the preclear is to clear the preclear of pastpostulates which may have concerned some one with whom the preclear may havethe auditor confused.THE THIRD ACT consists of cleaning present time facsimiles for the preclearso that the environment is not confused.THE FOURTH ACT is the establishment of accessibility of the preclear withhimself. This may include a thorough address to past auditing and auditors. It in-cludes PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE PROBLEMS.No further action than these can be successfully accomplished until thesehave been accomplished.In the case of psychotics, the second, third and fourth acts may be changed intheir order but they are vital. They are so thoroughly vital that one might say that apsychotic case, computing or dramatizing, will be broken only by following out thesefour acts and, conversely, that the use of these four acts will themselves break a psy-chotic case.Until these four acts are accomplished, and they must be accomplished withany case, no matter the tone of the case (save only in emergency use of \"assists\"),no further act is attempted. If a further act is attempted without first using the firstfour, the recovery of the case of his own control center will be prolonged or entirelyinhibited.It should be borne in mind that these considerations are of the highest me-chanical practicality and are in no way tinged with any mystic quality. They rest onprecision reasons of the same order as having to put water near a source of heat toget it to boil.THE FIFTH ACT is the auditor's assessment of the preclear. The auditor cate-gorizes the preclear in three echelons of classification as follows:(A) What is the quality of the preclear's reasoning about himself and his envi-ronment, about people? This establishes, and seeks only to establish, the degree thepreclear's thoughts are controlled by the environment including other people. Literal-ness of response to phrases, commands and sudden sounds establishes the pre-clear on the tone scale. What the preclear does about motion, the preclear's muscu-"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS10lar tension and the preclear's reaction time all serve to establish the preclear'sTHOUGHT.(B) What is the quality of the preclear's emotion? This is established by the re-sponse of the preclear to the auditor's mood, the voice quality of the preclear, thestability of the preclear's moods. What is the preclear's endocrine state?(C) What is the state of the preclear's body? Here the auditor is looking forglaring defects in structure. What is the quality of the preclear's sight; of his hearing?What is the tonus of the skin and muscles? How are the limbs formed? Is there anychronic psychosomatic illness?This assessment places the preclear on the tone scale. It tells the auditorwhether he can use straight-wire, repetitive straight wire, lock scanning or full effort. Ittells him as well what counter-efforts he is most likely to find. See copy of ToneScale.1THE SIXTH ACT consists of the establishment of the service facsimile chain.That service facsimile the auditor must necessarily release can be located by esti-mating how old the preclear appears to be. The last of the chain is at that age. Ageflashes are requested and occlusions are scouted.THE SEVENTH ACT consists of establishing whether or not the preclear iscurrently running on his genetic control center. (See the History of Man2.) In short, isthis a left hander who has been made right handed? Fifty per cent of all human be-ings, roughly, are running on the wrong control center. By effort, emotion and thoughtprocessing the individual can be re-established in his right control center.THE EIGHTH ACT consists of straight-wire of the times a person tried to start,stop, change or move other entities on all dynamics, or when he inhibited them.THE NINTH ACT consists of running emotional curves until the preclear hasthe curve of one attempt-failure-engram cycle. This is done until the service facsimileis located; returned on track.THE TENTH ACT consists of running out, by effort, emotion, and thought, theservice facsimile.THE ELEVENTH ACT consists of running out ALL sympathy on everyone andanyone in this lifetime, every dynamic. This is done by running the sympathy as alock for its duration over and over until the sympathy is erased. This includes sym-pathy for self, for every part of the body, for children, for sexual partners, for eachparent, for every member of the family, for every ally, or every friend, for every group,organization, state or country, for Man in general, for matter, for energy, for space, fortime, for trees and any vegetable life, for bacteria, for cells including sperm, for dogs,cats, horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, game birds, game animals, for souls, spirits, idols,clairvoyants, saints, for the Supreme being.THE TWELFTH ACT consists of running successively any and all emotion onall the dynamics one after the other. This includes happiness, fear, anger, boredom,grief (with or without a tear discharge) and apathy.   1 For Tone Scale by L. Ron Hubbard, see Science of Survival.2 A History of Man, by L. Ron Hubbard."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS11THE THIRTEENTH ACT consists of attempting, with thought, to clear the caseof all postulates, evaluations, goals and judgments in the current lifetime.THE FOURTEENTH ACT consists in rehabilitating the proper control center.THE FIFTEENTH ACT consists of rechecking from the fifth up through thefourteenth acts in sequence.It is apparent that the auditor, so far, has done minimal effort processing. Itshould also be apparent that most auditors are too ambitious to attack efforts. Expe-rience should tell the auditor that the thorough eradication of the use of a service fac-simile chain is not accomplished by nullifying one of the facsimiles on that chain.However, as an estimate, by the time the auditor has reached the tenth act, thechronic somatic of the case should be out of evidence and should stay out except fornew problems and consequences in the environment.It should also be apparent that with Act Fifteen we have not tapped the reser-voirs of the genetic chain. We have not established full memory. We may not haveestablished full perception. The auditor, by the time he has accomplished Act Fifteen,should find himself confronted with a better product than man has been before. It isdefinitely in the devotion of the auditor and within the limits of his time, whether or nothe carries his preclear beyond Act Fifteen.It should be noted that beyond Act Fifteen potentialities and techniques areeither unknown or not established at this time. Up to Act Fifteen we are on very safe,proven, thoroughly workable ground.A preclear thoroughly carried through these processes should be classified asa \"Fifteen\". A preclear carried through to a chronic somatic release should be knownas a \"Ten\" solely for qualification.THE ESSENCE OF ADVANCED PROCEDURE IS TO FOLLOW IT STEP BYSTEP. DO NOT SKIP ANY ACT. DO NOT GO ON TO A FURTHER ACT UNTILYOU ARE SATISFIED YOU HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THE ACT IN ACTION. DOEVERY ACT THOROUGHLY AND ONLY THEN ADVANCE TO THE NEXT ACT,THIS SHOULD BE SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT A PRECLEAR,KNOWING ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND FINDING AN ACT HAS NOT BEENCOMPLETED OR AN ACT SKIPPED, SHOULD JUDGE HIS AUDITOR A SUB-CENTER AT BEST AND GET ANOTHER AUDITOR.(Note: The control-center – sub-control center relationship makes husband-wife teams highly inadvisable. Husbands and wives should appear to each other asinviolate personalities, not as auditor and preclear. Three-way teams are far moresuccessful than two-way interchanging teams.)Precautions1. Do not audit a preclear with a technique above his tone scale level.2. Do not audit a preclear with broad techniques until you have resolved theinaccessibility that preclear may have. (This is covered in the accessibility section.)3. Do not audit a preclear when he is very tired.4. Do not audit a preclear who is hungry."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS125. Audit preclears who are apparently deficient nutritionally only when you givethe nutritional supplements. (This applies to straight-wire and any other process.)6. Do not audit preclears late at night.7. Do not evaluate your preclear's data for him.8. Never back off from a process you have begun.9. Never give a preclear a second order while he is still attempting the first yougave him.10. Always be orderly and routine in your commands.11. Never let your preclear control you. Always be at a level of force short ofhis objection point.12. Act like a control center. Never be confused, doubtful or bewildered. Use aminimum of effort processing and then only on service facsimiles.Use a minimum of effort processing And then only on services faksimilesThoughtThought is the phenomenon of combining, imagining or postulating theta fac-similes for the estimation of future physical efforts.All thought is preceded by physical effort except prime thought, the decisionmoving the original potential being from the state of not beingness to the state of be-ingness.Thought is modified by natural purpose.Natural purpose may or may not be modified, in one lifetime, by past actionand efforts. (In other words, thought obeys prime static in any one lifetime and canobey it at any moment in that lifetime. Thought is not necessarily stimulus-response.)Prime thought occurs at the beginning of the genetic line. Prime thought canoccur at any moment during any lifetime, moving the individual from the state of notbeingness to the state of beingness. A common name for this phenomenon is neces-sity level, although this term is incomplete.Two broad general processes are indicated:PROCESS ONE: Causing the preclear to rise, in present time, from the stateof relative not beingness to the state of vital beingness;PROCESS TWO: Clarifying sufficient emotion and effort as well as thought inthe past to permit the individual to achieve a shift from the state of relative not being-ness to the state of vital beingness.In processing thought, several mechanical processes are used: STRAIGHT-WIRE: (See other publications.)REPETITIVE STRAIGHT-WIRE: Straight-wire to one incident done over andover until the incident is de-sensitized."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS13LOCK SCANNING: (See other publications.)3GOAL PROCESSING: (Covered elsewhere in this manual.)EmotionEmotion is the control system used by thought to monitor effort.The endocrine system stands between \"I\" and the existing or potential effort ofthe physical being.The products of the endocrine system catalyze or inhibit the combustion of thecarbon-oxygen motor system which is the physical organism.Emotion is a direct index of the state of beingness.When badly aberrated, the physical being gives the appearance of monitoring,through emotion, \"I\".When in acceptable condition, the organism is monitored through the endo-crine system by its control center.Emotion was evolved by motion. Motion of the physical organism is monitoredby emotion.Emotion can be processed directly in its own echelon. During such processingthe preclear strays into thought and effort.Sympathy is commonly accepted to mean the posing of an emotional statesimilar to the emotional state of an individual in grief or apathy. This is a secondaryreaction and has its own peculiarity but is nevertheless on the tone scale between 0.9and 0.4. Sympathy follows or is based upon overt action by the preclear.Sympathy can be mechanically considered as the posing of any emotion so asto be similar to the emotion of another. This, in view of popular usage, should have aspecial designation, comparitism.The emotional curve is the drop from any position above 2.0 to a position be-low 2.0 on the realization of failure or inadequacy. It is easily recovered by preclears.It leads straight into service facsimiles. It should be handled as an emotion lock andrun over and over until de-sensitized wherever it can be found.The reverse curve is the emotional curve rising from below 2.0 to above 2.0. Ithappens in a short space of time. It is important because it locates allies.Appreciation of existence depends upon the free use, by \"I\", of emotion. Emo-tional states, no matter how rapidly, should be postulated by \"I\".Freeing the emotion on any case is a vital and necessary operation. The pre-clear does not have to be tripped into severe secondaries, into engrams or evencomputations to free his emotion.   3 For further data on Lock Scanning, see Science of Survival by L. Ron Hub-bard."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS14EffortEffort is divided into the effort of the individual himself and the efforts of theenvironment (physical) against the individual.The individual's own effort is simply called effort. The efforts of the environ-ment are called counter-efforts.There is a physical effort behind every computation except prime thought.The static of life handles motion. It is capable of starting, stopping and chang-ing motion. These starts, stops and changes are each one physical efforts.All the counter-efforts the body has ever received are evidently in store. Everyphysical effort of the organism has been at some time a counter-effort.Counter-efforts are not necessarily inhibitive to survival. To hold any counter-effort requires the self-determinism of the organism.It is not the purpose of processing to exhaust all counter-efforts from the or-ganism.The purpose of processing is to rehabilitate the self-determinism of the organ-ism about counter-efforts.So long as an organism can employ in its survival a counter-effort, thatcounter-effort is not aberrative.Counter-efforts become aberrated only when they have been chosen for non-survival usages by the organism or when the organism was unable to employ themfor survival as in the genetic blueprint and experience.Excess counter-efforts are those which have not been employed and could notbe handled by the organism. These are not classed with death efforts as death efforts(counter-efforts) are primary genetic data all along the track.Excess counter-efforts present themselves easily. They can be processed out.But they are of no primary concern to the auditor.The only reason an auditor processes effort is to regain aberrative postulates.The only efforts the auditor processes are in the service facsimile chain.Effort ProcessingIt should be clear that there are three distinct levels of processing. The first isthought, the second is emotion, the third is effort. Each has its own particular skill.Thought is done by straight-wire, repetitive straight-wire and lock-scanningand is directed towards concepts of conclusions or evaluations or actual precise mo-ments where the preclear evaluated or concluded.Emotion is done by straight-wire, lock scanning and lock and engram and sec-ondary running, with the total address to emotion. A moment of sympathy, of deter-minism, of defiance, of agreement is run just as though the incident were an en-gram – which is to say, the preclear is made to re-experience the emotion and, inci-dentally, a few perceptics over and over from beginning to end until the emotion is offthe lock."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS15Effort processing is done by running moments of physical stress. These. arerun either as simple efforts or counter-efforts or as whole precise incidents. Such in-cidents as those which contain physical pain or heavy stress of motion, such as inju-ries, accidents or illnesses, are addressed by effort.It should be seen, then, that we have three levels of operation. The most inti-mate is thought. An individual evaluates or concludes a certain thing. He is thereafterbound by his conclusion. He has caused an effect of which he is the recipient. If sucha thought is recalled over and over until it is thoroughly de-sensitized, emotions andefforts resulting from such a postulate fall away. The individual lets go of the facsimileand it is no longer effective upon him if the postulate tended to use a facsimile tomake it effective.Thought communicates its decisions to body and environment by use of theemotion. Thought is intimately in contact with the trigger mechanisms of emotion andmight be said to rule through emotion. Via emotion thought causes physical actionand reaction to take place. To accomplish such physical action and reaction, thoughtuses earlier experiences – facsimiles – and utilizes their motion, effort and counter-effort to cause activity on the part of the body and environment.Thus emotion is a bridge which is used by thought to effect effort. Take awayor de-sensitize the emotion and one has again disconnected facsimiles, of any kind,from the organism, and the organism and its thought are not affected longer by thefacsimile.Thought can seem to be smothered in emotion in that it is necessary in mostcases to unburden emotion from the case in order to discover many major and vitalevaluations and conclusions. By unburdening the case of emotion, evaluations andconclusions long lost to view – but still effective – come to light and are de-sensitized.Thought, self-determined originally, may postulate conflictingly from time to time withresultant failures, sympathies and other mis-emotions. Mis-emotion then \"smothers\"the motor control panels and hides the postulates. Thus the running of emotion isdone to lay bare past postulates and evaluations which are the actual sources of ab-erration and the suspended pain, which has been called in the past psychosomaticillness and is called, in Dianetics, chronic somatics, somatic meaning physical state.A heavy, painful facsimile need not itself be exhausted for it is held in placeprimarily by the preclear's desire (past postulate, not agreeing with present environ-ment) and this postulate is smothered by emotion. Run the emotion, discover and de-sensitize the postulate, and the facsimile ordinarily drops away and does not furtherconcern the preclear. Further, he does not substitute another ache or pain for it be-cause the original reason for the facsimile (past postulate) is gone.Effort processing is applied to heavy facsimiles. It happens occasionally thatthe effort on a facsimile is so heavy that it occludes the emotion, which in turn oc-cludes the thought. Thus, enough effort must be recovered to lay bare the emotion soas to get at the postulates and de-sensitize them. A heavy facsimile is thus treated byeffort processing in order to free the emotion and thus the postulates. The facsimile isnot treated to complete exhaustion but only to the point where the emotion andthought are reached. It then should fall into disuse, and it does not matter that effortis left on it."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS16The last thing which is done to the heavy facsimile is, of course, to pick up thepreclear's agreement with the auditor to run it and the emotion of determinism in-volved in the running itself. Otherwise the facsimile may remain somewhat in force.This is done by lock running or lock scanning.A heavy facsimile used to be known as an engram. In view of the fact that ithas been found to be stored elsewhere than in the cells, the term heavy facsimile hasnow come into use. A heavy facsimile is an experience, complete with all percep-tions, emotions, thoughts and efforts, occupying a precise place in space and a mo-ment in time. It can be an operation, an injury, a term of heavy physical exertion, oreven a death. It is composed of the preclear's own effort and the effort of the envi-ronment (counter-effort).The emotion of a heavy facsimile is marked by the thoroughness with whichthe counter-efforts have overcome the preclear. Thus, total overcoming of the pre-clear's own effort by the counter-effort is apathy. Less thoroughly overcome, the pre-clear's own effort is in grief. Even less thoroughly overcome, the preclear is in fear.Even less counter-effort and more preclear effort results in anger. When the pre-clear's own effort is greater than the counter-efforts the emotion is antagonism. Asthe counter-effort is slighter and more diffuse but the preclear's effort is not punitive,boredom results as the emotion. When the preclear's own effort is punitive and suc-cessful against counter-efforts, we have varying degrees of happiness and effective-ness.Thus the tone of any individual or any heavy facsimile is established by the re-sponse to the environmental effort and this response varies from no effort, allcounter-effort to all effort, slight counter-effort. This is made up into a tone scalewhich goes from 0.0 for the lowest condition to 20 at optimum condition and thendwindling activity to 40 for a top static, the bottom static being death.An individual may be so involved in combating a heavy facsimile which ischronically with him that he is chronically ill. Holding on to a chronic facsimile, thepreclear has certain pattern responses and aberrations. In a facsimile where he isoverwhelmed by motion he is listless and apathetic. In one where the forces balancehe is in anger.The auditor, in an occluded case, may find it is helpful to open the case byrunning effort. He looks at his preclear to discover some obvious physical aberration.This is held in place by a counter-effort. The auditor simply asks, \"If your (head) werebeing pushed, which way would it be moving?\" Or a leg or some deformed area. Thecounter-effort is right there, waiting. The preclear answers with a direction. The audi-tor then asks the preclear to feel his head moving against the counter-effort. A so-matic will turn on. The auditor simply continues to ask for the various efforts andcounter-efforts. Perceptions quite ordinarily fall out of the effort. A whole incident maycome to view. This is the heavy facsimile and also the chronic facsimile. It is also aservice facsimile. There is no sending the preclear around on his time track. He isright there in the heavy facsimile.The facsimile thus uncovered is run until its emotion can be recovered. This isthen scanned off until the postulates appear and these are then de-sensitized. Thepreclear's own thoughts and postulates are the aberration source. What is said to himis simply evaluation causing him, at times, to postulate. The auditor has no concern"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS17for what is said, for repeater technique or for perceptions save only in that they mayslightly aid the recovery of the emotion.There are many tricks in effort processing. An auditor can ask for the effort todo or be anything and the preclear can work it out. There is an automatic responsemechanism which gives forth the proper effort for the question, an interesting andreliable phenomenon. An auditor could take a dictionary and simply begin asking forany and all efforts suggested to him by the dictionary. However, using effort to thisextent is neither indicated nor even broadly useful.Every effort is in a non-survival direction in that it was once a counter-effort.One can get the effort within the effort within the effort and have his preclearback into the genetic line at a swift rate. For efforts and counter-efforts are the stuff ofwhich the blueprint of the human body itself is made. These are two cellular linesgoing back from the shellfish stage, for at this stage two cell lines become a team.The ancestors of this stage, before this point, go back into two separate experiencestages. One can take a preclear, all unsuspecting of anything but the \"lived only oncetheory\", and throw him back with efforts within efforts into some remarkable experi-ences. This is a biologist's dream, for he can look at original forms and trace geneticlines in individuals who may not even know of evolution. The genetic facsimiles of thewhole evolution chain are on file and have thus been discovered. This should not betoo surprising, for the blueprint had to be somewhere and, in efforts, it has been dis-covered and a trail blazed along its track. The problems of the initial photon convert-ers, the \"missing link\" between the vertebrate and invertebrate stages, can be lo-cated, amongst other items of interest. The simple locating of efforts to make effortsthrows anyone back down the long line. In ordinary processing this is vast beyondcount, and contains the whole physical experience. The body is composed of effortsand counter-efforts. In theory, if they were all run out, the preclear would vanish.Fortunately this is not necessary for processing.The basic efforts are not to be, to be. These resolve into the efforts to start, tostop, to change, not to start, not to stop and not to change.The basic goals are to remain in a state of rest against counter-effort and toremain in a state of motion against counter-efforts.Newton's laws would apply and we would have stimulus-response thinking ex-cept for the ability of the mind to interpose self-determined action and motion despitestimuli or disregarding it.There are efforts to have affinity, efforts to have communication, efforts tohave agreement and reality. There are efforts to see and not to see, to hear and notto hear. There are efforts to do or not to do anything.When the preclear switches from his own valence to another valence, he isactually taking the position of a counter-effort against himself. In his own valence heexerts his own efforts. In a counter-effort valence, he exerts counter-effort againsthimself. By valence is meant identity. In a dental operation under general anesthetic,the preclear's own effort becomes so nulled that he takes the counter-effort. Then herecalls the incident out of valence (as the dentist or the nurse or, quite irrationally,even the dental tools or the bed) and hurts himself. (Self-auditing is done ordinarilyout of valence and results in the preclear expending counter-efforts against himself.Thus he succeeds only in hurting himself.)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS18The no effort state is the state in which counter-effort is overwhelming the indi-vidual. Thus the auditor finds the case in apathy at a no effort point. Every heavy fac-simile has points for any point on the tone scale and thus the preclear can hang up ina place where he can have no effort of his own. The auditor solves this by runningout the counter-effort until it is sufficiently null to rehabilitate the preclear's own effort.Some testing still remains on this particular point of effort processing.A service facsimile is very resistive to effort processing, ordinarily. The auditormust remember to run the emotion as soon as possible and get the matter into goodrecall so that the postulates can be run. That should be the end of the service facsim-ile or at least one of its chain. Effort processing is not an end in itself, but an end to-ward recovering emotion so that one can recover thought. Effort processing shouldbe thoroughly understood by an auditor and should then be minimally used.A preclear who cannot re-experience an effort can be educated into the abilityby causing him to make a present time effort and then recalling it. He will shortly dis-cover that efforts can be re-experienced. Various efforts can then be run.It is sometimes much easier to get a case to run emotion than to run effort.This should be done by all means, for emotion is closer to thought than is effort. Donot use efforts on low-toned preclears.The only thing of value to recover from an engram is the effort; the only reasonone recovers the effort is to recover the postulates the individual himself made duringthe engram and the only engrams one processes are on the service facsimile chain.It is not necessary to process any more of these than necessary to permit the pre-clear to let go of the chain.If one sees an obvious deficiency in the preclear (glasses, deafness, baldness,thinness, etc.) he can request the effort the preclear must make to be deficient (havepoor eyesight, hearing, baldness, etc.)The only aberrative efforts are non-survival efforts. Efforts exist within the ef-forts within the efforts within the efforts, much on the order of a picture of a picturewithin a picture within a picture, etc.By calling for efforts to have efforts, the preclear can be taken all the way backon the time track to prime thought.A preclear can be trained into feeling efforts by coaxing him to make one inpresent time and then to re-experience it.The auditor must know about efforts and counter-efforts. He can do much withthem, and much of what he can do is startling and bizarre. Efforts contain perceptics.If you run an effort long enough, you can recover perceptics from it in most cases.You will find it difficult to run an effort against the postulate to keep the effort.There are countless billions of efforts and counter-efforts in any case.The main thing the auditor can do wrong about effort is to run too much effort,or to think effort is more important than thought, which it is not.You cannot rehabilitate an organism chemically to any degree. You cannot re-habilitate it with effort; this is the wrong side of the board."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS19The only efforts are to start, stop and change, not to start, not to stop, not tochange.Happiness is applied individual effort. Apathy is no effort, all counter-effort.Other efforts and counter-efforts range the tone scale in the degree that the individualis handling the current effort in the service facsimile.PostulatesA postulate is that self-determined thought which starts, stops or changespast, present or future efforts. Postulates alone aberrate the individual.By setting forth any postulate, the individual a moment later is being affectedby his own case. The postulate becomes unworkable in a radically changed environ-ment but may remain effective.Old people are generally considered to be set in their ways. It would be moreaccurate to say that they were set in their own postulates.The only reason an individual uses service facsimiles lies in his self-determined postulate to use them.It is necessary to make postulates. To make postulates and handle them, it isnecessary to handle past postulates.A postulate may spring from past effort or prime thought. A prime postulate isthe decision to change from a state of not beingness to a state of beingness.A prime postulate can occur at any time without regard to past or present effortsince theta is always present in a non-facsimile condition.Except for a very strong prime postulate, early postulates are effective overlater postulates.A prime postulate has the effect of cancelling not only past postulates but thepast individual as well – when it is strong.A negative postulate is the postulate not to be. It cancels past postulates and italso cancels, in greater or lesser degree, the entire individual. The track, earlier thana negative postulate, is largely occluded. It is as virgin as a prime postulate.An individual who has made a postulate on a subject experiences \"failure\"when he has to make an opposite postulate later. The opposite postulate has the ef-fect of a negative postulate. The opposite postulate is distinguished from a negativepostulate because it depends upon effort which a negative postulate does not neces-sarily have to do. Any preclear can be quickly shown, when he has reached thefourth act, that he himself determined his own condition. This is not done accusa-tively.The auditor can show the preclear in many ways that the preclear is capableof postulating himself into changed condition. The preclear ordinarily, at the veryleast, can recall when he postulated himself ill to get out of going to school or out ofan engagement.Postulates, whenever made, are responsible for the condition of the preclear,bad or good."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS20Because postulates are made in moments of physical stress at times and arevery forceful when so made, engrams occasionally must be entered but becauseprime postulates occur it is not necessary to go too early to get effective postulatesfor this lifetime de-sensitized from a case.Postulates made by a preclear are a pattern. It is necessary to reach the earli-est postulates by touching the later ones and running them back with straight-wire.Postulates surrender just like any other lock, or, in engrams, just like any otherperception in an engram.Auditing a preclear forcefully against postulates he has made to the contrarymakes him subject to opposite postulate and drives him into apathy. Thus such pos-tulates are a matter of first address. These include postulates not to be treated bydoctors and postulates not to change.Agreement to be processed is a postulate which must be picked up eventually.Postulates are made and are effective on every dynamic. Postulates are re-duced systematically for every dynamic. The postulates the auditor wants are thoseappertaining to the retention and use by the preclear of his service facsimile chain.EvaluationPostulates are made because of evaluations. Postulates ordinarily do not liftunless the reason why is also contacted. This is brief but very important.Types of CasesPast, Present and FutureEvery calculation of effort made by the mind is directed toward future.The individual compares conditions in the past to observations in the presentin order to calculate efforts in the future.A high-tone individual thinks wholly into the future. He is extroverted towardhis environment. He clearly observes the environment with full perception uncloudedby undistinguished fears about the environment. He thinks very little about himselfbut operates automatically in his own interests. He enjoys existence. His calculations(postulations and evaluations) are swift and accurate. He is very self-confident. Heknows he knows and does not even bother to assert that he knows. He controls hisenvironment.The so-called normal is used here to be at around 2.5 to 3.0 on the tone scale.He is partially extroverted, partially introverted. He spends considerable time with hiscalculations. He evaluates slowly even when he has the data, and then postulateswithout realizing too much about his postulation. He has much in the past which hedoes not care to recall. He has much in his present which gives him concern. His fu-ture goals are rather well nullified by future fears. He is Homo sapiens. He is in terri-ble condition, taken from the viewpoint of Homo novis. He is in excellent conditionfrom the viewpoint of past \"ologies\". He controls some of his environment but ismainly controlled by that environment. He is somewhat of a liability in interpersonal"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS21relations, demanding ARC and feeling he cannot live without it. He understands thathe understands some things.The neurotic is considered to be below 2.5. The neurotic has thorough con-cern about the future to the degree that he has many more fears about the futurethan he has goals in the future. He spends much of his time pondering the past. Heacts and then wonders if he has acted correctly and is sure he has not. Thoughts tohim are as solid as MEST. He is overwhelmed by sudden counter-efforts. He is oper-ating on a sub-control center which has been itself very blunted. He is ill much of thetime to a greater or lesser degree. He has colds. He brings \"bad luck\" and disaster.He is Homo sapiens at his \"rational worst\".The dramatizing psychotic is not always looked upon as insane. Whether ornot he is classified as insane depends upon whether or not he is of obvious menaceto other Homo sapiens. He is fixed in one facsimile which he plays over and over tothe environment around him. He is controlled by his environment to the extent thatanything in his environment turns on his dramatization. He is disastrous to havearound. Inaccessible persons passing for normals are sometimes dramatizing psy-chotics who dramatize infrequently – perhaps only once or twice a day. The drama-tizing psychotic lives mainly in the illusion of his own facsimile with its surroundings,not actual surroundings. He is definitely not in present time at any time.The computing psychotic passes quite commonly for a normal. Here the indi-vidual is taking dictation solely from a facsimile of some past moment of pain and isacting upon the advice of that \"circuit\" and is calling it thought. The psychotic person-ality is distinguished by its irrationality and its perversion of values. An inaccessible\"normal\" is usually a computing psychotic. Thoughts are MEST to the computingpsychotic. To take away or relieve a computation is like removing physical matterfrom the person. The computing psychotic lives wholly in the past and has no future.He cannot be interested in future goals. Often he does not have future fears. Hisconcerns are with past decisions but he cannot even make a decision for the past.Most computing psychotics are not in institutions or under any restraint. Only thosecomputing psychotics who are obviously and dramatically dangerous to their fellowHomo sapiens are labeled psychotic by past \"ologies\". Many esteemed and re-spected Homo sapiens in many professions are yet computing psychotics who oper-ate, puppet-like, on installed knowledge. The distinguishing characteristic of the com-puting psychotic is his utter inability to change his mind. He may even make a cult ora virtue out of consistency. The most common mistake an auditor can make in hisevaluation of a preclear is to misdetermine a computing psychotic as a normal. Theclue that he has made a mistake is his discovery of the difficulty he has in getting thecomputing psychotic to get up any locks. Another clue is inaccessibility. Intelligenceis no clue to the computing psychotic, neither is dress, manners nor learning, sincethese can also be used by the circuit. Inaccessibility and heaviness of locks are themain clues. The degree of extroversion of the preclear and, with that, his ability toface future threats and reach toward future goals determine his height on the tonescale.Above 2.5 the preclear thinks about the future. From there down to 1.0 hethinks mainly about the present and has some dread of both future and past. Below1.0 he is wholly concerned with the past. During any one session the auditor runs apreclear all over the tone scale. He should leave him extroverted. Any lock chain, for"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS22instance, should be scanned only to extroversion on that chain – scanning furtherdrops the preclear into another chain, thus re-introverting him. The temporary extro-version and introversion is momentary and incidental. The auditor is principally con-cerned with chronic aspect as outlined above.Wide Open and OccludedThere are two major subdivisions of cases wide open and occluded.At this time it is imperfectly understood why there is such a difference. Thereare many clues and much data, but a static conclusion is not advisable at this time.The wide open case is possessed of full perception except somatic, which isprobably light even to the point of anesthesia. Wide open does not refer to a hightone individual but to one below 2.5 who should be easy to work but is often inacces-sible and who finds it difficult to regain a somatic but simple to regain perception.It is pointed out that perceptions are rather easily drained from facsimiles,leaving the effort still in place. It is also pointed out that the wide open case is oftenincapable of much effort in present time. Thus the perceptions of the wide open casemay be, simply, curtained in some fashion, from his effort. The wide open case canbe a computing psychotic. This matter is dangerous to the auditor for he may think awide open case is a high-tone case with full perception.The wide open case can be stuck in an arduous facsimile and, by runningheavy incidents, may be driven wholly psychotic. This is almost the only danger inthis science. The wide open case is handled by an address to thought and emotion,not to effort. It should be scouted carefully to find out if the case will lock scan. This isdetermined by the case of running one lock. An auditor can lock scan a wide opencase into a heavy effort facsimile and stick him there.The wide open case is very literal, as is any low-toned case, to words. Wordsand any other symbols are almost MEST. The wide open case often makes a fetishfrom symbols. This is an escape mechanism. \"Dream therapy\" and so forth are thedreams of low-toned cases.The occluded case is fixed, most likely, in the effort of a heavy facsimile.Thought and emotion, rather than effort, are best applied to this case until a compu-tation is reached.The occluded case is using a service facsimile so heavily that it is in constantrestimulation, and that service facsimile is occluded by heavy effort. In contrast, theservice facsimile of the wide open case may be concentrated on perception with itseffort avoided.The occluded case complains of illness, ordinarily. The wide open case com-monly insists upon how well he is. Both are errors.ComputationsEvery Homo sapiens is running on aberrated computations. The computationtechnically is that aberrated evaluation and postulate that one must be consistently ina certain state in order to succeed. The computation thus may mean that one must"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS23entertain in order to be alive or that one must be dignified in order to succeed or thatone must own much in order to live. A computation is simply stated. It is always aber-rated It is commonly in conflict with basic goal.Basic goal is that goal native to the personality for a lifetime. It is second onlyin importance to survival itself. It is incident to the individuation of the person. A childof two knows its basic goal. It is compounded from genetic generations of experi-ence. It can be found and reduced in some long past heavy effort facsimile such asdeath. It is neither advisable nor inadvisable to tamper with it. Much experiencealigns on it. De-sensitized, it would be supplanted by another basic goal.A computation is generally a present lifetime affair, and it is intimately con-cerned with the service facsimiles of this lifetime.Some computations are so thoroughly irrational that they vanish at a glance.These include \"I have to be late to be early\", \"I have to be angry to people to beliked.\" They are contradictory.A computation is as insidious as it pretends to align with survival – or, in otherwords, as it seems to match the environment.No computation is compatible with skill and data. A computation compatiblewith skill and data is basic goal.A man whose every ability lies in a dignified and smooth area may yet have acomputation that he must be a clown. One with the basic goal of entertaining may yetfeel he must be dignified. Contradictoriness is essence in computations.All computations are non-survival.The computation lies in earlier postulates of this lifetime or this lifetime's post-basic goal. It is treated for the lifetime only in order to achieve a Fifteen.Computations are established by noting activities or ideas of the preclear outof agreement with his skills and abilities.Computations clarify by address to service facsimiles. Computations are heldin place wholly to invalidate others.Service FacsimilesThe main goal of the auditor is to locate and release service facsimiles for thislifetime.There is ordinarily but one actual service facsimile on a case but this one isaccompanied by before and after heavy facsimiles and locks.A service facsimile is that facsimile which the preclear uses to apologize for hisfailures. In other words, it is used to make others wrong and procure their coopera-tion in the survival of the preclear.If the preclear well cannot achieve survival, he attempts an illness or disabilityas a survival computation.The workability and necessity of the service facsimile is only superficially use-ful."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS24The service facsimile is an action method of withdrawing from a state of be-ingness to a state of not beingness and is intended to persuade others to coax theindividual back into a state of beingness.The service facsimile has a complete and explicit anatomy. It begins with aneffort to control along any dynamic, with a failure to control, with a recognition of thefailure, with a postulate to be ill, injured or unable, continues with an illness, injury orinability and may or may not end (short of processing) in days, weeks, years or anentire lifetime.Hysterical deafness, blindness, colds, any chronic somatic, any aberrated be-havior pattern are the content of service facsimiles.The inception of the earliest service facsimile for this lifetime is usually be-tween six months and three years of age. It has many locks.It is located by running the emotional curve. It is then exhausted with completeprocessing which includes thought, emotion and effort. Its companions later on thechain are then similarly reduced.All that is wrong with any case is a service facsimile. Discover and reduce theservice facsimile and its chain, and the auditor changes the nature of man and pro-motes him. An individual who has no service facsimile will not accumulate facsimilesto his harm or become restimulated by others. The heart of auditing is the servicefacsimile.DRAMATIZATIONSThe individual still possessed of service facsimiles dramatizes them. He maydramatize them in or out of valence.A dramatization is like a record which can be played over and over.Dramatizing is an apology for failure.SYMPATHY EXCITERSA sympathy exciter is any entity on any dynamic for which the individual hasfelt sympathy of the variety between 0.9 and 0.4.Sympathy is an excellent occluder and valence shifter. It also involves andfreezes the emotion of the individual.The ordinary course of action leading to sympathy is action against the entitywhich will receive sympathy or action against an entity earlier than the sympathy ex-citer.Sympathy is a non-survival apology for action against entities on any dynamic,which action has failed.A sympathy exciter is easily located in any case. There are many in everycase. The auditor can enter the sympathy chain from many angles. One is to locate\"to whom the individual has been mean\". Another is, \"When did you fail to controlanother by action?\" Another is simply, \"For whom have you felt sympathy?\""},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS25Sympathy exciters are most commonly parents, allies and pets. Childhood sto-ries are cunningly laid traps for sympathy and such stories, poems or songs affect acase strongly but are locks for actual control efforts (which have failed) on the part ofthe child against any entity on any dynamic. Sympathy should be run from such sto-ries.Sympathy is run as a heavy facsimile. It is run without verbalization. It is runwithout accompanying effort. It is always run with the reason one was sympathetic. Itis run over and over until the preclear extroverts. It may be run from late to early orearly to late wherever it can be found.Sympathy must be taken wholly off the case.PRESENT-TIME PROBLEMSAll cases have one or many actual present-time problems. It is most compati-ble with low-tone cases to \"strip\" a present-time problem as the first (Step Four) ac-tion in actual processing. The neurotic has most of his concentration on the present.He is afraid of it. His concentration is so heavily on the present that he cannot re-search the past, and he certainly cannot bear much of the future, either, as to itsfears or goals.The neurotic case is therefore entered with the mechanism of stripping a pre-sent-time problem at the point of Act Four.Stripping present time is a simple operation. Once one has established com-munication with the preclear, he is invited to discuss his present time. All by itself thisis \"therapeutic\". Simply permitting a man to tell you of his operations is \"therapeutic\"even if it compares in value with actual processing to collecting a grain of sand whenone can sweep the Sahara.The \"confessional\" is simply the address to present-time problems and, al-though the recipient of the confession does nothing more than assure that all is for-given, the individual feels better. This, by the way, is the only cross between this sci-ence and past efforts at therapy.The action of stripping is done by taking every aspect of every factor in theproblem and running it back to the postulate the preclear made to be concernedabout that aspect of the factor.The auditor must beware being too monotonous with his \"When did you firstdecide that - .\" He should take pains to vary his patter. \"Let's see if we can find someearlier material on this.\" \"Did you ever know anyone who is like your wife?\" Be hu-man, even if human novis. The auditor is interested in the current travail of this Homosapiens.The preclear will not unburden if he thinks the auditor will violate his confi-dence. He will not unburden if the auditor has no regard for the possible severity ofthe problem.The auditor's main concern is adroitly preventing the preclear from wanderingoff the actual factors of the problem. The preclear is liable to ramble. The auditorshould not fear to interrupt this rambling."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS26The auditor does not give advice or straighten out the preclear's present time.He makes the preclear's present time bearable by de-sensitizing the past it restimu-lates.The cleverness of the auditor is devoted alertly to the calculation of the actualproblem and leading the preclear into past similar concerns and his postulates tomake it a problem.The address to the present-time problem should be discontinued immediatelywhen the preclear is obviously less concerned with it. The present-time problem willnot wholly vanish. The auditor is simply using the mechanism to get the preclear intobetter swing of processing.Addressing the present-time problem (problem, for short) is a therapy in itself,if we desire therapies. Get at the factors of real concern, get a postulate or two offabout them, run a little emotion, use some MEST processing about the factors andprepare, thus, the case for the Fifth Act. Resolving the present-time problem makes abetter Homo sapiens. It does not much advance a case in view of how far that casecan be advanced. However, a clever and quick auditor could probably make his for-tune using only this technique and by it prevent divorces, cure colds, save jobs, de-crease accidents and illnesses. It is only a very minor miracle and should be re-garded as such.Problem processing can be dwelt upon overlong by the auditor and should beused only long enough to prevent the preclear from being too distracted from themain task by his environment.Past ProblemsThe psychotic is suspended in a decision, unmade, about a past problem. Theunwillingness to make this decision and the conflict of factors thus results in a confu-sion in the past severe enough to cause a failure in decision or an absence of postu-late. Here the problem is one of coaxing the preclear to make an evaluation on eachof the factors involved in the past problem and then, finally, a conclusion on theproblem.This is very simple to resolve. It may not be simple to locate. Simple ARC isused until the problem presents itself.The auditor does not advise an evaluation or a conclusion. When he does sohe is locking on top of every other advice which the preclear has received. The audi-tor is simply trying to get the preclear to use his own computer. Computations areeffected first by evaluation and then by conclusion. If the auditor does more thanlead, the preclear has not used his own computer and has not resolved the problem.This in essence, by the way, is why hypnotism does not, never has worked as a ther-apy and never will work, since it is the environment (the hypnotist) making a series ofdecisions for the subject. Your preclear, when he is hung up in a past decision failure,is in an hypnotic state anyway, for he has to be that low on the scale to be so con-fused.In handling men you can put them in an hypnotic, automaton state by posingrapidly a series of factors they then see they cannot of themselves evaluate, thengetting them to a point where they are in an anxiety for you to make the decision."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS27Depress them low enough in this wise and they obey like robots. Thus do not ruinyour preclear.Future GoalsA man without future goals is a worried and sick man. The reason an individ-ual cannot approach a future goal or even strongly postulate one lies in his inability toresolve the present or to make a decision in the past.The future goal may be cancelled by fears for the future. A case can beworked by alternately seeking to discover the preclear's future goals and then locat-ing the fears that these goals cannot be attained, and by locating and reducing thepostulates and emotions which cause the fears.A case which will not tell you at least in part a future goal or ambition is psy-chotic. Even a neurotic will have some fragments of future goals and will discussthem. A case which will not discuss future goals is hung up in a past decision conflictand should be worked in that area – the past – as the case isn't even in present timeno matter how it may seem to conform or converse or \"be charming\".The auditor who discovers this condition in a preclear can make the error ofseeking to strip postulates which inhibit postulating future goals or create future fears.He can also err when confronted by this condition by trying to process present time.This preclear has enormous apparent present-time problems, certainly. They are allhung up on a past failure to decide.The goalless case has shuddered so far away from decision that he is alsodeparted from reality. He may believe he caused a death. He may believe he mur-dered someone although he cannot say who or how. It is the auditor's task to recoverthe past failure in decision.The partially obstructed case on the subject of future goals can be helped bythe auditor.It is not the role of the auditor to postulate for the preclear. Postulating by theauditor results in a momentary upsurge and then a relapse. Encouragement is rou-tine in life. It is not very therapeutic. Data on a new viewpoint can help evaluation, butthis is the role of a teacher.Future goals take care of themselves when the preclear moves out into being-ness. The future is always full of traps. Where would we ever get randomity and ad-venture if it were not? It is a matter of facing the future confident and unafraid despiteobstacles that distinguishes the superior being. The blunt question about how thepreclear actually feels about dying tests his condition. If he does not care, he is afool. If he doesn't want it but isn't afraid of it, he will do.The Emotional CurveIf the auditor must know anything backwards, forwards, upside down, asleepor awake, it is the emotional curve.The auditor can neglect everything and anything on a case. He may even usea past \"ology\" or indoctrinate his preclear into the worship of golden calves or profes-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS28sors. He can be pompous, idiotic or a Homo sapiens. So long as he understands,uses and reduces the emotional curve he will succeed in accomplishing at least partof his mission.Hence, attend! The emotional curve is that drop or rise on the tone scalecaused by failure to control on any dynamic or the receipt of an ally on any dynamic.The drop falls from above 2.5 down to apathy in a steep curve. It occurs inseconds or minutes or hours. The speed of its fall is an index of the severity of thefailure.Death of an ally is received as a failure to keep the ally alive. This is followedby entering into the facsimiles of the ally and trying to jar him into life again, which isa second failure and which occludes the ally because the preclear is now living as anally.The emotional curve is a period with an exclamation point to the past. One'sown death would be an emotional curve.The flight down the emotional curve is as follows: State of beingness, antago-nism against not beingness, fear of not beingness, grief about not beingness, ac-ceptance of not beingness. These consecutive steps may be so swift that they jaminto a blur which seemed to contain only a sudden shift from beingness to not being-ness.Beingness is a supposed or actual control of the environment. Not beingnessis an acceptance of control by the environment and abdication even of control of self.An early curve was \"I'll eat you\", \"I'm fighting you\", \"I'm losing\", \"I've lost. Eatme\".An earlier curve was \"I'm alive\", \"I'm wiped out by MEST and therefore I amMEST\".The curve is addressed for this lifetime. It is located by getting the preclear torecall a time when he was happy and suddenly was made sad. He is then persuadedto re-experience this curve as an emotion. He is run through that incident until it isde-sensitized (which may be at once or after several runs). Another such curve islocated. One after another curve incidents are taken from the case. Suddenly orgradually the service facsimile chain is in view and is run, one incident or another,until a whole service facsimile reduces. Then other service facsimiles of the chain arerun until the preclear is clearly in possession of his own ability to postulate at will onhis health or state.Running the emotional curve will get the preclear into grief discharges, feardischarges or anger discharges. These can be run, verbalized or not verbalized, overand over, as emotion.The auditor should prepare to be extremely thorough about the emotionalcurve.Running the curve in reverse locates the false supports and identities the pre-clear has assumed. This is done by finding a time when the preclear was sad orapathetic and running up to a time when he was in control of his environment again.This recovers the arrivals of the U.S. cavalry and has given false value to that cav-alry. The preclear will not get rid of emotional attachments or even disclose allies"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS29unless the reverse curve is run. A preclear who has been lifted up by such supportsclings for ever afterwards to those supports and fetishes which remind him of thosesupports.A typical reverse curve: Disobedience, punishment begun, intervention ofgrandma. Bawl out by non-com, rescue by officer. News of possible death, cancella-tion of news by word of survival.When the emotional curve went down, the preclear considered himself deadand his own past occluded. When the emotional curve went up, the preclear consid-ered himself part of the identity of the rescuer.We want the preclear as a new self-determined self.When the preclear is advanced to the Ninth Act the running of emotionalcurves is fast and simple. The preclear fairly flies into higher and higher self-possession.When the running of emotional curves is concluded, the preclear should bewell advanced toward being in valence and not caring whether he is or not. Percep-tics should be on.It should be noted that the rising curve follows the down curve when the risingcurve exists. A service facsimile is a down emotional curve, a counterfeit dying and aresurrection on a rising curve.An Analysis of Self-DeterminismThe goal of the auditor with his preclear is not the release of a psychosomatic,not the improvement of appearance, not greater efficiency or better interpersonal re-lations. These are incidental. The goal of the auditor with the preclear is the rehabili-tation of the preclear's self-determinism.In order to understand this goal, let us examine some data and have a thor-ough understanding of what self-determinism is. Before Dianetics there were vaguepushes in that direction but the state itself lacked definition and definitely had nobridge built to it.Self-determinism is that state of being wherein the individual can or cannot becontrolled by his environment according to his own choice. In that state the individualhas self-confidence in his control of the material universe and the organisms within italong every dynamic. He is confident about any and all abilities or talents he maypossess. He is confident in his interpersonal relationships. He reasons but does notneed to react.On the tone scale, we have at the optimum level, I am, at the lowest level, Iam not. Between we have, from the optimum level down, varying degrees of I am andI am not. The lower one goes, the more I am not there is and the less I am. Here isthe graph of the the state of beingness and the state of not beingness. Not beingnessis death. This is a range from 20.0 down to 0.0. Full self-determinism along everydynamic is found at 20.0. A complete other-determined individual is at 0.0. A gradientscale lies between."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS30There is a parallel column on the tone scale to the I am, I am not gradientscale. This is the I know, I know not scale. I know is at 20.0. I know not is at 0.0. Be-tween these lie, as one descends, I understand, I am trying to understand, I will notunderstand, I am afraid to understand, I cannot understand, I know not.Another parallel scale would be, I have trust at 20.0 and I trust nothing at 0.0.As one descends, one reaches less and less trust and more and more distrust untilwe have death.The mystic for millenia has been talking about faith. He never built a bridge toit. He made a fundamental error in converting faith into have faith. When he saidhave faith he invited understanding, then confusion of understanding, because onedoes not understand faith. One is faith. The source, content of and contact with faithis you. The result of this mystic error – and it is a very gross error – was to place indi-viduals so far down the tone scale that \"love\" and propitiation became bywords andhocus pocus the order of the day. Here is a 1.1 religion. It is afraid to understand be-cause it has to have faith, but it is not faith because faith is not understanding. Hencethe general confusion at 1.1. A by-product of this is the fact that individuals who thushave faith are running too slow. You get esp, hypnotism, mixed-up facsimiles withothers, martyrdom, physical illness and all manner of unwanted things at this slowspeed. It is too close to the static of death at 0.0, and its people are awfully dead,ineffective and irrational.People who are trying to have faith are not faith. Thus they fear (1.1) and pro-pitiate (1.1) and are generally confused. One will not buy unreason at 20.0. They be-gan by knowing faith and then became confused by having faith explained.Because of spectacular successes (rare as rarity), the mystic continued tostrive for something he already had because he had no way to get back to where hewas. The enormously successful points of being faith in the sea of unsuccessfulhaving faith kept the mystic striving. It is possible now to achieve faith, or regain whatone has lost.I am, faith, I know are at 20.0 on up. At 20.0 on the gradient scale they are atoptimum unity with MEST (the physical universe) but as they rise from 20.0 they be-come less and less effective on MEST until top static is reached at 40.0. The scale isa circle. 40.0 and 0.0 are the same, so it is possible to go two ways towards death.One is less well off at 21.0 than he is at 20.0 since the MEST is dwindling away. Theaustere but spindly and weak mystic who dwells upon abstracts is less able to know.There is an entire scale above 20.0, which matches the scale below 20.0 in undesir-ability. The organism slows down above 20.0. The static is thoroughly unobtainablewith one's body, evidently, for the static at the top in a pure state 40.0 is, for onething, a -270 degrees C. A person who relaxes to not being in body is at first assailedby counter-efforts and then begins to chill. The various phenomena of mysticism arein the main explained by this scale. When one forsakes individuality on the way up,he, of course, can commingle with thoughts and other individualities. When he slowsdown below toward 0.0 he is again getting confused in his individuality, shifts va-lences easily, is hypnotic and is in a generally undesirable condition.Another prime error has been made and is part of our culture, both religiousand scientific, and that is the error of single source. At 1.1 single source looks to bethe case. Also at 39.0. At neither point, however, is there any clear view. All life formsare not from a single source. The ideas of Nirvana, Valhalla, Adam, the original cell,"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS31each is now rather completely disproven. There is a source for every genetic line. Bythis is meant both a theta (thought static) and MEST form. There are as manysources as there are living organisms, each line distinct and individual. The similarityof form in a species is due to similar environments and age of the class, not singlesource. A negative proof lies in the finding that health, sanity and effectiveness existwhere the greatest self-determinism can be rehabilitated. A positive proof is that, if itwere single source, the discovery of the genetic line facsimiles, the blueprint of thebody, should permit just one individual to go back and clear the original upsets for thewhole human race. It has been tried several times. It affects none but the preclear.His source is the very model of self-determinism.What then are you trying to do with your preclear? You are rehabilitating himfrom a state of partially I am not to I am, from understand to know, from distrust totrust.If you only concentrated upon distrust in others of him and his distrust of oth-ers, his enforced faiths on others and the enforced faith of others on him, and with histrust and distrust on all dynamics, particularly self, and de-sensitized such facsimiles,your preclears would be at around Ten at least. Occluded cases may be only brokentrust cases for the preclear cannot trust himself, thus cannot trust his recalls. Runtrust-distrust, and enforced and broken \"know\" and \"I am\" and \"faith\" in Act Four.ResponsibilityIn the Fourteenth Act, the proper control center is rehabilitated. This is done byan indoctrination of the principles of responsibility and the running of responsibility.An auditor, thus, must understand this subject thoroughly. The preclear will make hislargest leap ahead with the Fourteenth Act.DEFINITION: Responsibility is the ability and willingness to assume the statusof full source and cause for all efforts and counter-efforts on all dynamics.There is no compromise with full responsibility. It lies above 20.0 on the tonescale and is descended from in order to effect randomity but is descended from withthe full knowledge of its assumptions. It means responsibility for all acts, all emotionson every dynamic and in every sphere as one's own. It includes such \"disrelated\"data as the death of an individual one has never met on a highway on which one hasnever travelled at the hands of a stranger no matter how culpable. One does notsend to find for whom the bell tolls without full willingness to have tolled it and to havecaused the cause of its tolling.There is a scale of responsibility between full responsibility and full other-responsibility where the former is above 20.0 and the latter is at 0.0. Complete nega-tion of responsibility is complete admission of being under the complete control of theenvironment. Assumption of full responsibility is a statement of control of the envi-ronment and persons within it without necessity of control.There is a cycle of responsibility. One acts and seeks to negate his responsi-bility for such action by placing the \"reason\" at another's door. This works as long asone succeeds in making another accept responsibility for the action. The moment thisaction fails and another does not accept it, the entire action comes back at one. It isthen a matter of fault and fixed (by another) blame and stirs the emotion of guilt. Be-"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS32fore this cycle begins, there is no aberration, no matter what has been done, nomatter what has happened to anyone. The action occurs but is no cause for discus-sion or justice until one seeks to shunt cause elsewhere than self.This starts the cycle and eventually comes back as fault. Full responsibility isnot fault; it is recognition of being cause. Rationalization is wholly an attempt to shuntresponsibility. Whatever occurs to one is actually his own responsibility, as the stu-dent will realize as soon as he re-evaluates the factors involved and as soon as hesees the enormous effect of this process.The highest common denominator so far reached on occlusion is the respon-sibility factor. One is occluded on whatever he has tried not to be responsible for. Herefuses responsibility for the incident, thus he has no control or responsibility for thefacsimile of the incident. One can control nothing without assuming full responsibilityfor it.Let us survey fundamentals. Self-determinism, self-confidence, I know, I am,lie along 20.0. All knowledge is known at source, as witness the theta manufacture ofcomplex compounds not yet touchable by chemists. One, thus, by extrapolation, didnot agree to survive. One had a free choice to survive, quite obviously. The agreeviewpoint is occasioned by postulating obedience to the Supreme Being, which pos-tulate is demonstrably not workable as it poses a low-scale point for the eighth dy-namic which would drag down all the other dynamics at once to zero and would con-tinue them there, and life would become impossible. Notwithstanding this point whichmay or may not be acceptable, there are points which are inexorable.Overall life through all tracks is a continuous survival through many deaths.Succumb is only relative. Total succumb would be a discontinuance of the theta line,which demonstrably has not happened in any line on earth today and which, by ex-trapolation and by the nature of the life static, will not happen tomorrow for onlyMEST has time. Theta changes the organism form by varying efforts and counter-efforts and natural selection and planned development in MEST.Development of rationalization (negation of responsibility establishing conflictfor development) establishes randomity; and randomity is apparently vital in order toeffect a conquest of MEST (our closest approach to why survival, being a conquest ofthe material universe by theta). One is obviously conceived after free choice. Oneobviously seeks and selects randomity on free choice.Every individual is possessed of an urge for survival on every one of the eightdynamics. He can exercise free choice for the survival of every one of the eight. In-deed, since he has existed prior to any existing situation, he had the free choice to dosomething about it and thus had free choice about any existing situation. At least theproblem resolves itself in this fashion. Its proof is that preclears soar up the tonescale on acceptance of full responsibility and the proposition is thus credited by itsworkability.Running back any happenstance before the cycle of blame-failure-guilt isstarted will discover that the preclear had full responsibility for anything done to himor by him or, reaching far back, for anything done to anybody by anything or any-body. Full responsibility as AA's occurs if only in choosing conception. Anyone alivetoday had responsibility in creating our social order."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS33A soldier shot on the field of battle may \"blame\" the sniper, the SelectiveService, the stupidity of government, but he nevertheless had full responsibility notonly for being there and getting shot but for the sniper, Selective Service and the stu-pidity of government.You may locate any rationalization cycle merely by finding any mis-emotionsuch as antagonism, anger, fear, grief or apathy on the part of the preclear for any-thing or anybody. You will find then a cycle wherein the preclear considered himselfaffected by environment, blamed environment (and environment contains all dynam-ics including self), failed to make the blame stick and received the consequences,thus losing self-determinism, thus getting controlled by environment, thus getting ab-errated, thus getting and using the service facsimile.The auditor is not seeking the point where the preclear accepts the harmwhich came to him as his fault. The auditor is seeking the point where the precleardecided it was not his responsibility and then the earlier point of refusal of responsi-bility. Get the fault acceptance point and you will find apathy since here is agreementwith accusation – wrong point. Get the first instant of rationalization and then the ear-lier generalization of negated responsibility and you will find the postulates whichdeny full responsibility. A postulate of illness so as not to attend school is not the pri-mary postulate on the chain. The primary postulate on this chain is refusal of full re-sponsibility for school.Occlusions are resolved by full responsibility on the subject. This includes oc-cluded persons. Dub-in is resolved by a full responsibility resolution, for the dub-in isfar more active in rationalization than an occluded case.The preclear, understanding all this, may yet wonder when he discovers in hispast a person who avowedly had full responsibility, is always right and yet made himunhappy. Let the preclear look in this person for the actuality of full responsibility andthe person in question will be found to have suspicions, antagonisms and rationaliza-tions and is thus discovered to be lacking in full responsibility after all.The environment starts to control the individual the moment he rationalizesaway his inherent full responsibility. The individual becomes \"unable\" to handle anyfacsimile of any incident for which he has not assumed full responsibility, thus he be-comes subject to facsimiles \"handling\" him.Attempting to invalidate someone is attempting to negate full responsibility forthat person. The person who insists it is \"your fault\" is invalidated on a low-tone levelby insisting it is not your fault. Thus, assuming \"fault\" seems to validate the accusa-tion of the person so claiming. Assumption of full responsibility is also assumption ofthe accusative person as a responsibility.For definition, the responsibility scale drops to its next level to \"I am responsi-ble and I must do something about it\". This dwindles down through \"I won't be re-sponsible\", \"I am afraid of responsibility for it\", \"I don't care, it's no use being respon-sible\". The lowest rung is no responsibility for anything.Past deaths are occluded because one does not take their responsibility, suchdeaths being contrary on a shadow level in an aberrated society, to survival. Thuspast deaths are sometimes hard to explain to people for they would not have any re-sponsibility on their own and therefore refuse it on the subject."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS34Using symbols for actuality is negating responsibility. Several group experi-ments, including teaching every man on a naval vessel that he was responsible foreverything, have been made which validated these postulates. A negative series wasalso made with opposite results, again demonstrating these postulates. How irre-sponsible can one be? Refusal of full responsibility for dying and its survival value.Cause and EffectAn individual is evidently designed to be cause. When one speaks of respon-sibility he means \"the determination of the cause which produced the effect\".The goal of full responsibility is not attained simply by making a new postulate.It is attained by discovering and reducing the preclear's assignment of cause.Ordinarily people call the assignment of cause \"blame\". If one assigns causeto something, he delivers to that entity power. This is not mystical. It is a new discov-ery of hitherto unknown phenomena. By it strange visios and occlusions resolve.A swift survey of emotions demonstrates that a gradient scale from causedrops down to effect. Cause is the life static itself. Full Effect would be MEST, or adead body.An organism seeks to be cause without becoming effect. Cause is above 20.0;effect is at 0.The gradient scale goes downward in this wise: One is cause, he begins mo-tion and is able to change it. He is committed to motion and becomes less able tochange it. He comes into a range of being the effect of motion. He seeks to hold mo-tion to keep from being an effect at 1.5. He is unable to hold motion and begins tofear motion at 1.1, propitiating it. He regrets anything about motion and is in grief asan effect at 0.5. He becomes and recognizes that he has become effect at 0.1.A strange visio on a case will vanish if regret is scanned up from it. Occlusionswill turn off if blame is scanned off the occluded object or person including self.This operates on any of the eight dynamics. That which one blames becomesa power and is occluded as unexaminable including self. That which is in stationaryvisio is that which one regrets having caused.There is a cycle on any chain on any dynamic as follows. One causes some-thing. He fails. He postulates blame (1.5). He establishes sympathy and regrets.Each new blame thrusts him further, on that chain, into an apathy. Find a thing onany dynamic (including the first dynamic) which one blames and the auditor will dis-cover at the bottom of the chain a cause and failure of magnitude. He need only scanblame and regret from the chain to recover the basic incident. Then he should ex-haust from that incident its emotional curve. This recovers any computation on acase.Effort can be run on cause and effect but the effect, of course, is apathy, andshould probably be run as counter-effort.Full responsibility resolves only in this wise."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS35Definitions, Logics and AxiomsThese are the definitions, logics and axioms of this science.

An assist saves lives and materiallyspeeds healing.AUDITOR:One who listens and computes. A technician of this science. BROKEN:Slang used in the wise of \"breaking a case\", meaning that one breaks the holdof the preclear on a non-survival facsimile. Used in greater or lesser magnitude suchas \"breaking a circuit\" or \"breaking into a chain\" or \"breaking a computation\". Neverbreaking the preclear or his spirit, but breaking what is breaking the preclear.CENTER OF CONTROL:The awareness of awareness unit of the mind. This is not part of the brain butpart of the mind, the brain being physiological. The mind has two control centers pos-sible, by definition, the right and the left. One is an actual, genetic control center, theother is a sub-control center subservient to the control center.CLEAR (verb):The act of desensitizing or releasing a thought impression or a series of im-pressions or observations in the past, or a postulate, an emotion, an effort or an en-tire facsimile. The preclear either releases his hold on the facsimile (memory) or thefacsimile itself is desensitized. The word is taken from electronic computers or com-mon office adding machines and describes an action similar to clearing past compu-tations from the machine.CLEAR (noun):"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS54A much misunderstood state of being. The word has been used before withother meanings. It has been mistaken as an absolute. It is still used. It is used hereas electronics slang and can apply to a chain, an incident or a computation.COMPUTING PSYCHOTIC:One who is running on a circuit, a circuit being a pseudo-personality out of afacsimile strong enough to dictate to the individual and BE the individual.DRAMATIZING PSYCHOTIC:One who dramatizes one type of facsimile only.DYNAMICS:The central drives of an individual. They are numbered from one to eight asfollows: 1. Self survival; 2. Survival through children (includes sexual act); 3. Survivalby groups including social and political as well as commercial; 4. Survival throughMankind as a whole; 5. Survival through Life including any species, vegetable oranimal; 6. Survival through MEST; 7. Survival through theta or the static of Life itself;8. (Written as infinity). Survival through a Supreme Being. Each individual is survivingfor all eight.EFFORT:The physical force manifestation of motion. A sharp effort against an individualproduces pain. A strenuous effort produces discomfort. Effort can be recalled and re-experienced by the preclear. No preclear below 2.5 should be called upon to use ef-fort as such as he is incapable of handling it and will stick in it. The essential part of apainful facsimile is its effort, not its perceptions.EMOTION:The catalyst used by the control center to monitor physical action. The relaysystem, via glands, interposed between \"I\" and self and, by thought, others. The mainemotions are happiness in which one has confidence and enjoyment in his goals anda belief in his control of environment; boredom, in which one has lost confidence anddirection but is not defeated; antagonism wherein one feels his control threatened;anger wherein one seeks to destroy that which threatens and seeks without gooddirection beyond destruction; covert hostility wherein one seeks to destroy while re-assuring his target that he is not so seeking; fear wherein one is catalyzed to flee;grief in which one recognizes loss; apathy in which one accepts failure on all dynam-ics and pretends death. Other emotions are a volume or lack of volume of thosenamed. Shame or embarrassment are emotions peculiar to groups or interpersonalrelations and are on a level with grief, denoting loss of position in a group. Emotion isthe glandular system parallel of motion and each emotion reflects action to gain orlose to motion. At a high level one is sending back motion, at a mid level one is hold-ing motion, at a lower level, motion is sweeping through and over one.ENVIRONMENT:The surroundings of the preclear from moment to moment in particular or ingeneral, including people, pets, mechanical objects, weather, culture, clothing or theSupreme Being. Anything he perceives or believes he perceives. The objective envi-ronment is the environment everyone agrees is there. The subjective environment isthe environment the individual himself believes is there. They may not agree."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS55FACSIMILES:A facsimile is a memory recording for a finite period of time. It is consideredthat memory is a static without wave length, weight, mass or position in space (inother words, a true static) which yet receives the impression of time, space, energyand matter. A careful examination of the phenomena of thought and the behavior ofthe human mind leads one to this conclusion. The conclusion is itself a postulateused because it is extremely useful and workable. This is a point of echelon in re-search, that a facsimile can be so described. The description is mathematical and anabstract and may or may not be actual. When a thought recording is so regarded, theproblems of the mind rapidly resolve. Facsimiles are said to be \"stored\". They actupon the physical universe switchboard called the brain and nervous and glandularsystem to monitor action. They appear to have motion and weight only because mo-tion and weight are recorded into them. They are not stored in the cells. They im-pinge upon the cells. Proof of this matter rests in the fact that an energy which be-came a facsimile a long time ago can be re-contacted and is found to be violent onthe contact. Pain is stored as a facsimile. Old pain can be re-contacted. Old pain, infacsimile form, old emotion in facsimile form, can re-impose itself on present time insuch a wise as to deform or otherwise physically affect the body. You can go back tothe last time you hurt yourself and find there and re-experience the pain of that hurt,unless you are very occluded. You can recover efforts and exertions you have madeor which have been made against you in the past. Yet the cells themselves, whichhave finite life, are long since replaced although the body goes on. Hence the facsim-ile theory. The word facsimile is used as bluntly as one uses it in connection with adrawing of a box top instead of the actual box top. It means a similar article ratherthan the article itself. You can recall a memory picture of an elephant or a photo-graph. The elephant and the photograph are no longer present. A facsimile of them isstored in your mind. A facsimile is complete with every perception of the environmentpresent when that facsimile was made including sight, sound, smell, taste, weight,joint position and so on through half a hundred perceptions. Just because you cannotrecall motion or these perceptions does not mean they were not recorded fully and inmotion with every perception channel you had at the time. It does mean that youhave interposed a stop between the facsimile and the recall mechanisms of yourcontrol centers. There are facsimiles of everything you have experienced in your en-tire lifetime and everything you have imagined.FIFTEEN (noun):A designation to denote a finished case. Solely for case recording to designatea case advanced to current completion. This is a Foundation number system for pre-clears. A case is noted on record by the act number to which it has been advanced.GENETIC:By line of protoplasm and by facsimiles and by MEST forms the individual hasarrived in the present age from a past beginning. Genetic applies to the protoplasmline of father and mother to child, grown child to new child and so forth.LOCK SCANNING:A process which starts the preclear from a point in the past with which he hasmade solid contact up through all similar incidents without verbalization. This is doneover and over, each time trying to start at an earlier incident of the same kind, until"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS56the preclear extroverts on the subject of the chain. BOIL-OFF often results whereinthe preclear seems to go to sleep. Avoid boil-off for it is not therapeutic and willeventually result in reduced tone. BOIL-OFF is a lazy auditor's excuse to be idle andfacsimiles in such severe conflict that they will not resolve without resolving postu-lates first. Lock scanning is a standardized drill, started on signal and ended with thepreclear saying he is again in present time. It can be done on any subject. ABOVE2.0 only.MEST:A compound word made up of the first letters of MATTER, ENERGY, SPACEand TIME. A coined word for the PHYSICAL UNIVERSE. THETA IS NOT CONSID-ERED AS PART OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE BUT IS NOT CONSIDERED AB-SOLUTELY AS NOT PART OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE.PAST POSTULATES:Decisions or conclusions the preclear has made in the past and to which he isstill subjected in the present. Past postulates are uniformly invalid since they cannotresolve present environment.PERCEPTIONS:By means of physical waves, rays and particles of the physical universe, im-pressions of the environment enter through the \"sense channels\" such as the eyesand optic nerves, the nose and olfactory nerves; the ears and aural nerves; inter-body nerves for inter-body perceptions, etc., etc. These are all perceptions up to theinstant they record as facsimiles at which moment they become recordings. Whenrecalled they are perceptions again, being again entered into sense channels fromthe recall side. There are over half a hundred separate perceptions all being recordedat once.POSTULATE (verb):To conclude, decide or resolve a problem or to set a pattern for the future or tonullify a pattern of the past.POSTULATE (noun):A conclusion, decision or resolution made by the individual himself on his ownself-determinism on data of the past, known or unknown. The postulate is alwaysknown. It is made upon the evaluation of data by the individual or on impulse withoutdata. It resolves a problem of the past, decides on problems or observations in thepresent or sets a pattern for the future.PSYCHOSOMATIC ILLNESS:A term used in common parlance to denote a condition \"resulting from a stateof mind.\" Such illnesses account for about seventy percent of all ills, by popular re-port. Technically, in this science, a chronic or continuing painful facsimile to which thepreclear is holding to account for failures. Arthritis, bursitis, tendonitis, myopia, astig-matism, bizarre aches and pains, sinusitis, colds, ulcers, migraine headaches, tooth-ache, poliomyelitis deformities, fatness, skin malformations are a few of these legionof chronic somatics. They are traceable to service facsimiles.PSYCHOTIC:"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS57An individual who is out of contact to a thorough extent with his present timeenvironment and who does not compute into the future. He may be an acute psy-chotic wherein he becomes psychotic for only a few minutes at a time and only occa-sionally in certain environments (as in rages or apathies) or he may be a chronic psy-chotic, or in a continual disconnection with the future and present. Psychotics whoare dramatically harmful to others are considered dangerous enough to be put away.Psychotics who are harmful on a less dramatic basis are no less harmful to their envi-ronment and are no less psychotic.PRECLEAR:One who has entered processing enroute to becoming a fifteen. RECOVERY:Recovery of one's own ability to determine one's existence.RELEASE (verb):The act of taking the perceptions or effort or effectiveness out of a heavy fac-simile or taking away the preclear's hold on the facsimile.REPETITIVE STRAIGHT-WIRE:Attention called to an incident over and over amongst other incidents until it isde-sensitized. Used on conclusions or incidents which do not easily surrender.SERVICE FACSIMILE:A definitely non-survival situation contained in a facsimile which is called intoaction by the individual to explain his failures. A service facsimile may be one of anillness, an injury, an inability. The facsimile begins with a down emotional curve andends with an upward emotional curve. Between these it has pain. A service facsimileIS the pattern which is the chronic \"psychosomatic illness.\" It may contain coughs,fever, aches, rashes, any manifestation of a non-survival character, mental or physi-cal. It may even be a suicide effort. It is complete with all perceptions. It has manysimilar facsimiles. It has many locks. The possession and use of a service facsimiledistinguishes a Homo sapiens.SERVICE FACSIMILE CHAIN:The entire chain of similar incidents which comprise the total repertoire of theindividual who is explaining thus failure and thus seeking support. STRAIGHT-WIRE:A process of recalling, from present time, with some perception or at least aconcept, a past incident. The name straight-wire derives from the MEST communica-tions process of connecting two points of a communications system. It is essentiallymemory work. It is applied to postulates, evaluations, incidents, scenes, emotions, orany data which may be in the storage banks of the mind without \"sending the pre-clear\" into the incident itself. It is done with the preclear sitting up, eyes open or shut.The auditor is very alert. Straight-wire is done rapidly. The preclear is not permitted towander or reminisce. He responds to questions on the part of the auditor. MANYPRECLEARS DISLIKE BEING QUESTIONED. THE AUDITOR MUST THEN FIRSTRESOLVE THE POSTULATES AGAINST BEING QUESTIONED; this would becalled \"clearing for broad straight-wire.\"TEN:A case advanced to the point of released service facsimile."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"ADVANCED PROCEDURE AND AXIOMS58THETA:The mathematical symbol for the static of thought. By THETA is meant thestatic itself. By \"facsimile\" is meant THETA which contains impressions by percep-tion.THOUGHT:The facsimiles one has recorded of his various environments and the facsimi-les he has created with his imaginings, their recombination and evaluations and con-clusions for the purpose of determining action or no action or potential action or noaction. THOUGHT is used also to mean a progress treating awareness level record-ings as distinct from non-awareness level recordings.L. Ron Hubbard"}]
