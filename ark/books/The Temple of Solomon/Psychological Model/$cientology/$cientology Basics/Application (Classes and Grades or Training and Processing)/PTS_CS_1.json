Such people are known to have anti-social tendencies. When the legal or political structure of a country becomes such as to favor such per-sonalities in positions of trust, then all the civilizing organizations of the country become suppressed and a barbarism of criminality and economic duress ensues. Crime and criminal acts are perpetuated by anti-social personalities. Inmates of institu-tions commonly trace their state back to contact with such personalities. Thus, in the fields of government, police activities and mental health, to name a few, we see that it is important to be able to detect and isolate this personality type so as to protect society and individuals from the destructive consequences attendant upon letting such have free rein to injure others. As they only comprise 20% of the population and as only 2½% of this 20% are truly dangerous, we see that with a very small amount of effort we could considerably better the state of society. Well-known, even stellar, examples of such a personality are, of course, Napoleon and Hitler, Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Christie* and other famous criminals were well-known examples of the anti-social personality. But with such a cast of characters in history we ne-glect the less stellar examples and do not perceive that such personalities exist in current life, very common, often undetected. When we trace the cause of a failing business, we will inevitably discover somewhere in its ranks the anti-social personality hard at work. In families which are breaking up we commonly find one or the other of the persons involved to have such a personality. Where life has become rough and is failing, a careful review of the area by a trained observer will detect one or more such personalities at work.   * Editor’s note: John Dillinger, famous American bank robber, 1902-1934; Pretty Boy Floyd, famous American gangster 1904-1934; Christie: English serial killer from the middle of the 20th century."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 2 HCOB 27.9.66 PTS CS-1 2 06.02.10 As there are 80% of us trying to get along and only 20% trying to prevent us, our lives would be much easier to live were we well-informed as to the exact manifestations of such a personality. Thus we could detect it and save ourselves much failure and heartbreak. It is important then to examine and list the attributes of the anti-social personality. In-fluencing as it does the daily lives of so many, it well behooves decent people to become bet-ter informed on this subject. ATTRIBUTES The anti-social personality has the following attributes: 1. He or she speaks only in very broad generalities. “They say...” “Everybody thinks...” “Everyone knows...” and such expressions are in continual use, particularly when im-parting rumor. When asked, “Who is everybody...” it normally turns out to be one source and from this source the anti-social person has manufactured what he or she pretends is the whole opinion of the whole society. This is natural to them since to them all society is a large hostile generality, against the anti-social in particular. 2. Such a person deals mainly in bad news, critical or hostile remarks, invalidation and general suppression. “Gossip” or “harbinger of evil tidings” or “rumormonger” once described such per-sons. It is notable that there is no good news or complimentary remark passed on by such a person. 3. The anti-social personality alters, to worsen, communication when he or she relays a message or news. Good news is stopped and only bad news, often embellished, is passed along. Such a person also pretends to pass on “bad news” which is in actual fact invented. 4. A characteristic, and one of the sad things about an anti-social personality, is that it does not respond to treatment or reform or psychotherapy. 5. Surrounding such a personality we find cowed or ill associates or friends who, when not driven actually insane, are yet behaving in a crippled manner in life, failing, not succeeding. Such people make trouble for others. When treated or educated, the near associate of the anti-social personality has no sta-bility of gain but promptly relapses or loses his advantages of knowledge, being under the suppressive influence of the other. Physically treated, such associates commonly do not recover in the expected time but worsen and have poor convalescences."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 3 HCOB 27.9.66 PTS CS-1 3 06.02.10 It is quite useless to treat or help or train such persons so long as they remain under the influence of the anti-social connection. The largest number of insane are insane because of such anti-social connections and do not recover easily for the same reason. Unjustly we seldom see the anti-social personality actually in an institution. Only his “friends” and family are there. 6. The anti-social personality habitually selects the wrong target. If a tyre is flat from driving over nails, he or she curses a companion or a non-causative source of the trouble. If the radio next door is too loud, he or she kicks the cat. If A is the obvious cause, the anti-social personality inevitably blames B, or C or D. 7. The anti-social cannot finish a cycle of action. Such become surrounded with incomplete projects. 8. Many anti-social persons will freely confess to the most alarming crimes when forced to do so, but will have no faintest sense of responsibility for them. Their actions have little or nothing to do with their own volition. Things “just hap-pened”. They have no sense of correct causation and particularly cannot feel any sense of re-morse or shame therefore. 9. The anti-social personality supports only destructive groups and rages against and at-tacks any constructive or betterment group. 10. This type of personality approves only of destructive actions and fights against con-structive or helpful actions or activities. The artist in particular is often found as a magnet for persons with anti-social person-alities who see in his art something which must be destroyed and covertly, “as a friend”, proceed to try. 11. Helping others is an activity which drives the anti-social personality nearly berserk. Activities, however, which destroy in the name of help are closely supported. 12. The anti-social personality has a bad sense of property and conceives that the idea that anyone owns anything is a pretense made up to fool people. Nothing is ever really owned. THE BASIC REASON The basic reason the anti-social personality behaves as he or she does lies in a hidden terror of others. To such a person every other being is an enemy, an enemy to be covertly or overtly destroyed."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 4 HCOB 27.9.66 PTS CS-1 4 06.02.10 The fixation is that survival itself depends on “keeping others down” or “keeping peo-ple ignorant”. If anyone were to promise to make others stronger or brighter, the anti-social personal-ity suffers the utmost agony of personal danger. They reason that if they are in this much trouble with people around them weak or stupid, they would perish should anyone become strong or bright. Such a person has no trust to a point of terror. This is usually masked and unrevealed. When such a personality goes insane the world is full of Martians or the FBI and each person met is really a Martian or FBI agent. But the bulk of such people exhibit no outward signs of insanity. They appear quite ra-tional. They can be very convincing. However, the list given above consists of things which such a personality cannot de-tect in himself or herself. This is so true that if you thought you found yourself in one of the above, you most certainly are not anti-social. Self-criticism is a luxury the anti-social cannot afford. They must be RIGHT because they are in continual danger in their own estimation. If you proved one WRONG, you might even send him or her into a severe illness. Only the sane, well-balanced person tries to correct his conduct. RELIEF If you were to weed out of your past by proper search and discovery those anti-social persons you have known and if you then disconnected, you might experience great relief. Similarly, if society were to recognize this personality type as a sick being as they now isolate people with smallpox, both social and economic recoveries could occur. Things are not likely to get much better so long as 20% of the population is permitted to dominate and injure the lives and enterprise of the remaining 80%. As majority rule is the political manner of the day, so should majority sanity express itself in our daily lives without the interference and destruction of the socially unwell. The pity of it is, they will not permit themselves to be helped and would not respond to treatment if help were attempted. An understanding and ability to recognize such personalities could bring a major change in society and our lives. THE SOCIAL PERSONALITY Man in his anxieties is prone to witch hunts. All one has to do is designate “people wearing black caps” as the villains and one can start a slaughter of people in black caps."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 5 HCOB 27.9.66 PTS CS-1 5 06.02.10 This characteristic makes it very easy for the anti-social personality to bring about a chaotic or dangerous environment. Man is not naturally brave or calm in his human state. And he is not necessarily vil-lainous. Even the anti-social personality, in his warped way, is quite certain that he is acting for the best and commonly sees himself as the only good person around, doing all for the good of everyone – the only flaw in his reasoning being that if one kills everyone else, none are left to be protected from the imagined evils. His conduct in his environment and toward his fellows is the only method of detecting either the antisocial or the social personalities. Their motives for self are similar – self-preservation and survival. They simply go about achieving these in different ways. Thus, as Man is naturally neither calm nor brave, anyone to some degree tends to be alert to dangerous persons and hence, witch hunts can begin. It is therefore even more important to identify the social personality than the anti-social personality. One then avoids shooting the innocent out of mere prejudice or dislike or because of some momentary misconduct. The social personality can be defined most easily by comparison with his opposite, the anti-social personality. This differentiation is easily done and no test should ever be constructed which iso-lates only the anti-social. On the same test must appear the upper as well as lower ranges of Man’s actions. A test that declares only anti-social personalities without also being able to identify the social personality would be itself a suppressive test. It would be like answering “Yes” or “No” to the question “Do you still beat your wife?” Anyone who took it could be found guilty. While this mechanism might have suited the times of the Inquisition, it would not suit modern needs. As the society runs, prospers and lives solely through the efforts of social personali-ties, one must know them as they, not the anti-social, are the worthwhile people. These are the people who must have rights and freedom. Attention is given to the antisocial solely to protect and assist the social personalities in the society. All majority rules, civilizing intentions and even the human race will fail unless one can identify and thwart the anti-social personalities and help and forward the social personali-ties in the society. For the very word “society” implies social conduct and without it there is no society at all, only a barbarism with all men, good or bad, at risk. The frailty of showing how the harmful people can be known is that these then apply the characteristics to decent people to get them hunted down and eradicated. The swan song of every great civilization is the tune played by arrows, axes or bullets used by the anti-social to slay the last decent men."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 6 HCOB 27.9.66 PTS CS-1 6 06.02.10 Government is only dangerous when it can be employed by and for anti-social person-alities. The end result is the eradication of all social personalities and the resultant collapse of Egypt, Babylon, Rome, Russia or the West. You will note in the characteristics of the anti-social personality that intelligence is not a clue to the anti-social. They are bright or stupid or average. Thus those who are extremely intelligent can rise to considerable, even head-of-state heights. Importance and ability or wish to rise above others are likewise not indexes to the anti-social. When they do become important or rise they are, however, rather visible by the broad consequences of their acts. But they are as likely to be unimportant people or hold very lowly stations and wish for nothing better. Thus it is the twelve given characteristics alone which identify the anti-social person-ality. And these same twelve reversed are the sole criteria of the social personality if one wishes to be truthful about them. The identification or labeling of an anti-social personality cannot be done honestly and accurately unless one also, in the same examination of the person, reviews the positive side of his life. All persons under stress can react with momentary flashes of anti-social conduct. This does not make them anti-social personalities. The true anti-social person has a majority of anti-social characteristics. The social personality has a majority of social characteristics. Thus one must examine the good with the bad before one can truly label the anti-social or the social. In reviewing such matters, very broad testimony and evidence are best. One or two isolated instances determine nothing. One should search all twelve social and all twelve anti-social characteristics and decide on the basis of actual evidence, not opinion. The twelve primary characteristics of the social personality are as follows: 1. The social personality is specific in relating circumstances. “Joe Jones said...” “The Star Newspaper reported...” and gives sources of data where important or possible. He may use the generality of “they” or “people” but seldom in connection with attrib-uting statements or opinions of an alarming nature. 2. The social personality is eager to relay good news and reluctant to relay bad. He may not even bother to pass along criticism when it doesn’t matter. He is more interested in making another feel liked or wanted than disliked by others and tends to err toward reassurance rather than toward criticism. 3. A social personality passes communication without much alteration and if deleting anything tends to delete injurious matters."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 7 HCOB 27.9.66 PTS CS-1 7 06.02.10 He does not like to hurt people’s feelings. He sometimes errs in holding back bad news or orders which seem critical or harsh. 4. Treatment, reform and psychotherapy particularly of a mild nature work very well on the social personality. Whereas anti-social people sometimes promise to reform, they do not. Only the social personality can change or improve easily. It is often enough to point out unwanted conduct to a social personality to completely alter it for the better. Criminal codes and violent punishment are not needed to regulate social personalities. 5. The friends and associates of a social personality tend to be well, happy and of good morale. A truly social personality quite often produces betterment in health or fortune by his mere presence on the scene. At the very least he does not reduce the existing levels of health or morale in his asso-ciates. When ill, the social personality heals or recovers in an expected manner, and is found open to successful treatment. 6. The social personality tends to select correct targets for correction. He fixes the tyre that is flat rather than attack the windscreen. In the mechanical arts he can therefore repair things and make them work. 7. Cycles of action begun are ordinarily completed by the social personality, if possible. 8. The social personality is ashamed of his misdeeds and reluctant to confess them. He takes responsibility for his errors. 9. The social personality supports constructive groups and tends to protest or resist de-structive groups. 10. Destructive actions are protested by the social personality. He assists constructive or helpful actions. 11. The social personality helps others and actively resists acts which harm others. 12. Property is property of someone to the social personality and its theft or misuse is pre-vented or frowned upon. THE BASIC MOTIVATION The social personality naturally operates on the basis of the greatest good. He is not haunted by imagined enemies but he does recognize real enemies when they exist."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY 8 HCOB 27.9.66 PTS CS-1 8 06.02.10 The social personality wants to survive and wants others to survive, whereas the anti-social personality really and covertly wants others to succumb. Basically the social personality wants others to be happy and do well, whereas the anti-social personality is very clever in making others do very badly indeed. A basic clue to the social personality is not really his successes but his motivations. The social personality when successful is often a target for the anti-social and by this reason he may fail. But his intentions included others in his success, whereas the anti-social only appreciate the doom of others. Unless we can detect the social personality and hold him safe from undue restraint and detect also the anti-social and restrain him, our society will go on suffering from insanity, criminality and war, and Man and civilization will not endure. Of all our technical skills, such differentiation ranks the highest since, failing, no other skill can continue, as the base on which it operates – civilization – will not be here to continue it. Do not smash the social personality – and do not fail to render powerless the anti-social in their efforts to harm the rest of us. Just because a man rises above his fellows or takes an important part does not make him an anti-social personality. Just because a man can control or dominate others does not make him an anti-social personality. It is his motives in doing so and the consequences of his acts which distinguish the anti-social from the social. Unless we realize and apply the true characteristics of the two types of personality, we will continue to live in a quandary of who our enemies are and, in doing so, victimize our friends. All men have committed acts of violence or omission for which they could be cen-sured. In all Mankind there is not one single perfect human being. But there are those who try to do right and those who specialize in wrong and upon these facts and characteristics you can know them. L.

Very possibly this is the first time the mechanisms which bring about insanity have been fully viewed. I must say that it requires a bit of confronting. The alleviation of the condition of insanity has also been accomplished now and the footnote in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health concerning future research into this field can be considered fulfilled. The things a C/S should know about insanity are as follows: HIGHER PERCENT About 15% to 20% of the human race apparently is insane or certainly a much higher percent than was estimated. The truly insane do not necessarily act insane visibly. They are not the psychiatric ob-vious cases who go rigid for years or scream for days. This is observed only in the last stages or during temporary stress. Under apparent social behavior the continual crimes knowingly committed by the in-sane are much more vicious than ever has been catalogued in psychiatric texts. The actions of the insane are not “unconscious”. They are completely aware of what they are doing. All insane actions are entirely justified and seem wholly rational to them. As they have no reality on the harmful and irrational nature of their conduct it does not often register on an E-Meter. The product of their post duties is destructive but is excused as ignorance or errors. As cases in normal processing they roller coaster continually. They nearly always have a fixed emotional tone. It does not vary in nearly all insane people. In a very few it is cyclic, high then low."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"PSYCHOSIS   2   HCOB   28.11.70   PTS CS-1 10 06.02.10 All characteristics classified as those of the “suppressive person” are in fact those of an insane person. The easiest ways for a C/S to detect the insane are: 1. Pretending to do a post or duties, the real consistent result is destructive to the group in terms of breakage, lost items, injured business, etc. 2. The case is no case gain or roller coaster and is covered under “PTS symptoms”. 3. They are usually chronically physically ill. 4. They have a deep but carefully masked hatred of anyone who seeks to help them. 5. The result of their “help” is actually injurious. 6. They often seek transfers or wish to leave. 7. They are involved in warfare with conflicts around them which are invisible to others. One wonders how they can be so involved or get so involved in so much hostility. TYPES The German psychiatric 1500 or so “different types of insanity” are just different symptoms of the same cause. There is only one insanity and from it springs different manifes-tations. Psychiatry erred in calling these different types and trying to invent different treat-ments. DEFINITION Insanity can now be precisely defined. The definition is: Insanity is the overt or covert but always complex and continuous determination to harm or destroy. Possibly the only frightening thing about it is the cleverness with which it can be hid-den. Whereas a sane person can become angry or upset and a bit destructive for short peri-ods, he or she recovers. The insane mask it, are misemotional continuously and do not re-cover. (Except by modern processing.) THE NATURE OF MAN Man is basically good. This is obvious. For when he begins to do evil he seeks to de-stroy his memory in order to change and seeks to destroy his body. He seeks to check his evil impulses by inhibiting his own skill and strength."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PSYCHOSIS   3   HCOB   28.11.70   PTS CS-1 11 06.02.10 He can act in a very evil fashion but his basic nature then makes it mandatory that he lessens himself in many ways. The towering “strength” of a madman is a rarity and is compensated by efforts at self-destruction. Man’s mortality, his “one life” fixation, all stem from his efforts to check himself, obliterate his memory in a fruitless effort to change his conduct and his self-destructive habits and impulses and losses of skills and abilities. As this rationale proves out completely in processing and fits all cases observed, we have for the first time proof of his actual nature. As only around 20% are insane, and as those who previously worked in the mental field were themselves mainly insane, Man as a whole has been assigned an evil repute. Govemments, where such personalities exist, listen to the opinion of the insane and apply the characteristic of 20% to the entire hundred percent. This gives an 80% wrong diagnosis. Which is why mental science itself was destruc-tive when used by states. TECHNIQUES The only technique available at this writing which will benefit the insane is contained in all the overt-motivator sequences and Grade II technology. At Flag at this writing new improvement on this exists but it is so powerful that slight errors in use can cause a psychotic break in the insane. It therefore will only be exported for use by specially trained persons and this programming will require quite a while. Meanwhile it helps the C/S to know and use these firm rules: Always run Dianetic Triples. Never run Singles. The overt side (Flow 2) is vital. If you only run Flow 1 Motivators, the pc will not recover fully. Further running Flow 1 (Motivator only) any psychotic being processed will not recover but may even trigger into a psychotic break. If one never ran any-thing but motivators, psychotic manifestations would not erase. Depend on Expanded Grade II technology to ease off or handle the insane. Don’t keep asking what’s been done to him as he’ll trigger. A new discovery on this is that when you run out the motivator the person gets a higher reality on his overts. If you ran out all his motivators he would have no reason for his overts. If these are not then run out he might cave himself in."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"PSYCHOSIS   4   HCOB   28.11.70   PTS CS-1 12 06.02.10 PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR The apparent pattern of insane behavior is to come in (ask for processing, go on staff, etc) with the advertised intention of being helped or helping, then mess up either as a pc or on post, then state how bad it all is and leave. It looks obvious enough. He came, found it bad, left. That is only the apparent behavior. Apparent reasons. Based on numerous cases, this is the real cycle. Hearing of something good that might help these hateful awful rotten nasty people, the psycho comes in, wrecks this, upsets that, caves in this one, chops up that one and When somebody says “No!” the psychotic either (a) Caves himself in physically or (b) Runs away. The psychotic is motivated by intent to harm. If he realizes he is harming things he shouldn’t, he caves himself in. If he is afraid he will be found out, he runs. In the psychotic the impulse is quite conscious. CONCLUSION None of this is very nice. It is hard to confront. Even I find it so. Freud thought all men had a hidden monster in them for he dealt mainly with the psy-chotic and their behavior was what he saw. All men are not like this. The percentage that are is greater than I supposed but is a long way from all men. Sometimes one only becomes aware of these when things are getting worked on and improved. They stay on as long as it can be made bad or there is hope it can be destroyed. Then when attention is given to improvement they blow. Artists, writers often have these types hanging around them as there is someone or something there to be destroyed. When success or failure to destroy or possible detection ap-pears on the scene they blow, often as destructively as possible. Orgs are subjected to a lot of this. A psychotic sometimes succeeds in blowing off good staff. And then sooner or later realizes how evil he is acting and sickens or leaves. The society is not geared to any of this at all. The insane walk around wrecking the place and decent people think it’s “human nature” or “inevitable” or a “bad childhood”. As of this writing the insane can be handled. The proof of any pudding is the process-ing. And this is successful. It is also rather swift. But, as I say, it is so swift the special tech-nique has to be done by the specially trained flubless auditor."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"PSYCHOSIS   5   HCOB   28.11.70   PTS CS-1 13 06.02.10 For a long while I’ve realized that we would have to be able to handle insane people as the psychiatrist is fading. I have had opportunity to work on the problem. And have it han-dled. Until it is fully released, the C/S will benefit greatly from knowing the above as these come on his lines far more often than he has suspected. The insane can be helped. They are not hopeless. I trust this data will be of use. L.

The process called Search and Discovery requires as well a good knowledge of Ethics. One must know what a Suppressive Person is, what a Potential Trouble Source is and the mechanism of how and why a case Roller Coasters and what that is. All this data ex-ists in Ethics policy letters and should be studied well before one attempts a “Search and Dis-covery” or further study of this HCOB. Ethics is not merely a legal action – it handles the whole phenomena of case worsening (Roller Coaster) after processing and without this tech-nology an auditor easily becomes baffled and tends to plunge and squirrel. The only reason a case Roller Coasters after good standard auditing is the PTS phenomena and a Suppressive is present. THREE TYPES There are Three Types of PTS. Type One is the easy one. The SP on the case is right in present time, actively sup-pressing the person. Type Two is harder for the apparent Suppressive Person in present time is only a res-timulator for the actual suppressive. Type Three is beyond the facilities of orgs not equipped with hospitals as these are en-tirely psychotic. HANDLING TYPE ONE PTS The Type One is normally handled by an Ethics Officer in the course of a hearing. The person is asked if anyone is invalidating him or his gains or Scientology and if the pc answers with a name and is then told to handle or disconnect from that person the good indicators come in promptly and the person is quite satisfied. If however there is no success in finding the SP on the case or if the person starts nam-ing Org personnel or other unlikely persons as SP the Ethics Officer must realize that he is"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"SEARCH AND DISCOVERY 2 HCOB 24.11.65 PTS CS-1 16 06.02.10 handling a Type Two PTS and, because the Auditing will consume time, sends the person to Tech or Qual for a Search and Discovery. It is easy to tell a Type One PTS from a Type Two. The Type One brightens up at once and ceases to Roller Coaster the moment the present time SP is spotted. The pc ceases to Roller Coaster. The pc does not go back on it and begin to beg off. The pc does not begin to worry about the consequences of disconnection. If the pc does any of these things, then the pc is a Type Two. It can be seen that Ethics handles the majority of PTSs in a fast manner. There is no trouble about it. All goes smoothly. It can also be seen that Ethics cannot afford the time to handle a Type Two PTS and there is no reason the Type Two should not pay well for the Auditing. Therefore, when Ethics finds its Type One approach does not work quickly, Ethics must send the person to the proper division that is handling Search and Discovery. TYPE TWO The pc who isn’t sure, won’t disconnect, or still Roller Coasters, or who doesn’t brighten up, can’t name any SP at all, is a Type Two. Only Search and Discovery will help. SEARCH AND DISCOVERY The first thing to know is that case worsening is caused only by a PTS situation. There never will be any other reason. As soon as you doubt this datum and think about “other causes” or try to explain it some other way you no longer prevent cases from worsening and no longer rescue those who have worsened. The second thing to know is that a suppressive is always a person, a being or a group of beings. A suppressive is not a condition, a problem, a postulate. Problems and Counter-Postulates come into the matter but the SP as a being or group must always be lo-cated as a being or a group, not as merely an idea. As the technology is close to and similar to that of a service facsimile, a poorly trained auditor can get confused between them and pro-duce a condition he says is the cause. Persons who cannot confront and who therefore see persons as ideas not people are the ones most likely to fail in doing Search and Discovery. The third thing to know is that there can be an actual SP and another person or being similar to the actual one who is only an apparent SP. An actual SP actually suppresses another. An apparent SP only reminds the pc of the actual one and so is restimulated into being a PTS."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"SEARCH AND DISCOVERY 3 HCOB 24.11.65 PTS CS-1 17 06.02.10 The actual SP can be in present time (Type One PTS) or is in the past or distant (Type Two PTS). The Type Two always has an apparent SP who is not the SP on the case, is confusing the two and is acting PTS only because of restimulation, not because of suppression. Search and Discovery as a process is done exactly by the general rules of listing. One lists for persons or groups who are or have suppressed the pc. The list is complete when only one item reads on nulling and this is the item. If the item turns out to be a group, one does a second list of who or what would repre-sent that group, gets the list long enough to leave on nulling only one item reading, and that is the SP. An incident is not a person or a group. A condition is not a person or a group. And a group is not a person, what you want is one being. The E-Meter signs are unmistakable and the good indicators come in strongly when the actual SP is found. This is the entire action. It is liable to the various ills and errors of writing and nulling a list, such as overlisting, underlisting, ARC Breaking the pc by by-passing the item or getting an incomplete list. These are avoided by knowing one’s business as an Auditor and being able to handle an E-Meter with skill and confidence. When one goofs on a Search and Discovery and finds the wrong actual SP the signs are the same as those where a Type Two is handled as a Type One – not sure, no good indica-tors, Roller Coasters again, etc. The actual SP can be back track but it is seldom vital to go far out of PT and usual for a lifetime person to turn up. Done correctly the pc’s good indicators come in at once, the pc cognites, the meter re-acts very well with Blowdowns and repeated long falls, and the pc ceases to Roller Coaster. Care should be taken not to get too enthusiastic in going far back track on the pc as you run into whole track implants etc, easily handleable only at Level V. The pc can get “over whumped” if you go too far back and you’ll wish you hadn’t. This normally happens how-ever, only when the pc has been ARC Broken by the Auditor, when the right item has been by-passed and the list is overlong, or when 2 or 3 items are still reading on the list (incom-plete list). Locating a Service Facsimile is quite similar to Search and Discovery but they are dif-ferent processes entirely. Only the doingness is similar. In Search and Discovery the end product is a being. In Service Facsimile the end product is an item or concept or idea. Don’t get the two mixed."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"SEARCH AND DISCOVERY 4 HCOB 24.11.65 PTS CS-1 18 06.02.10 HANDLING TYPE THREE The Type Three PTS is mostly in institutions or would be. In this case the Type Two’s apparent SP is spread all over the world and is often more than all the people there are – for the person sometimes has ghosts about him or demons and they are just more apparent SPs but imaginary as beings as well. All institutional cases are PTSs. The whole of insanity is wrapped up in this one fact. The insane is not just a bad off being, the insane is a being who has been overwhelmed by an actual SP until too many persons are apparent SPs. This makes the person Roller Coaster continually in life. The Roller Coaster is even cyclic (repetitive as a cycle). Handling an insane person as a Type Two might work but probably not case for case. One might get enough wins on a few to make one fail completely by so many loses on the many. Just as you tell a Type Two to disconnect from the actual SP (wherever found on the track) you must disconnect the person from the environment. Putting the person in a current institution puts him in a Bedlam. And when also “treated” it may finish him. For he will Roller Coaster from any treatment given, until made into a Type Two and given a Search and Discovery. The task with a Type Three is not treatment as such. It is to provide a relatively safe environment and quiet and rest and no treatment of a mental nature at all. Giving him a quiet court with a motionless object in it might do the trick if he is permitted to sit there unmo-lested. Medical care of a very unbrutal nature is necessary as intravenous feeding and soporif-ics (sleeping and quietening drugs) may be necessary, such persons are sometimes also physi-cally ill from an illness with a known medical cure. Treatment with drugs, shock, operation is just more suppression. The person will not really get well, will relapse, etc. Standard Auditing on such a person is subject to the Roller Coaster phenomena. They get worse after getting better. “Successes” are sporadic, enough to lead one on, and usually worsen again since these people are PTS. But removed from apparent SPs, kept in a quiet surroundings, not pestered or threat-ened or put in fear, the person comes up to Type Two and a Search and Discovery should end the matter. But there will always be some failures as the insane sometimes withdraw into rigid unawareness as a final defense, sometimes can’t be kept alive and sometimes are too hectic and distraught to ever become quiet, the extremes of too quiet and never quiet have a number of psychiatric names such as “catatonia” (withdrawn totally) and “manic” (too hectic). Classification is interesting but non-productive since they are all PTS, all will Roller Coaster and none can be trained or processed with any idea of lasting result no matter the temporary miracle."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"SEARCH AND DISCOVERY 5 HCOB 24.11.65 PTS CS-1 19 06.02.10 Remove a Type Three PTS from the environment, give him or her rest and quiet, do a Search and Discovery when rest and quiet have made the person Type Two. (Note: These paragraphs on the Type Three make good a promise given in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health to develop “Institutional Dianetics”.) The modern mental hospital with its brutality and suppressive treatments is not the way to give a psychotic quiet and rest. Before anything effective can be done in this field a proper institution would have to be provided, offering only rest, quiet and medical assistance for intravenous feedings and sleeping draughts where necessary but not as “treatment” and where no treatment is attempted until the person looks recovered and only then a Search and Discovery as above under Type Two.

DEFINITION Per HCO Policy Letter of 7 May 69, a PTS ... (meaning a Potential Trouble Source) Type A is a person ... “intimately connected with persons (such as marital or familial ties) of known antagonism to mental or spiritual treatment or Scientology. In practice such persons, even when they approach Scientology in a friendly fashion, have such pressure continually brought to bear upon them by persons with undue influence over them that they make very poor gains in processing and their interest is solely devoted to proving the antagonistic element wrong.” A SOURCE OF TROUBLE Such persons with antagonistic family members are a source of trouble to Scientology because their family members are not inactive. In fact from direct experience with Inquiry after Inquiry into Scientology, it has been found that those who have created the conditions which brought about the Inquiry in the first place and those who testified before same have been the wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, or grandparents of some Scientologist. Their testimony has been full of such statements as, “My son completely changed after he went into Scientology – he no longer was respectful to me.” “My daughter gave up a wonderful ca-reer as a hairdresser to go into Scientology.” “My sister got these funny staring eyes the way all Scientologists have.” Their testimony was illogical and their descriptions of what occurred were untrue, but the point of the matter is that such persons DID cause Scientology, Scientology Orgs and fel-low Scientologists a great deal of trouble and difficulty. DON’T CREATE ANTAGONISM Many Scientologists in their misunderstanding and misapplication of Scientology create the conditions that bring about the antagonism in the first place. A few illustrations of how this is done are as follows: Scientologist to mother: “I now know where you are on the Tone Scale – 1.1. Boy are you sneaky” (Evaluation and invalidation.) Father to Scientologist: “Now I don’t want you to borrow the car again without my permission. I have told you time and time...” Scientologist to father: “Okay! Fine! Okay! Good! Thank you! I got that!“ (Not an acknowledgement but an effort to shut up the father.) Scientologist to older brother: “You murdered me in a past life, you dirty dog’“ (Evaluation and invalidation.)"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PTS TYPE A HANDLING 3 BPL 5.4.72RC I PTS CS-1 25 06.02.10 Mother to Scientologist: “Whatever are you doing?” Scientologist to mother: “I’m try-ing to confront your dreadful bank.” (Invalidation.) There are so many ways to misuse tech and to invalidate and evaluate for others in a destructive fashion to bring about bypassed charge, ARC Breaks and upset that they can not all be possibly listed. The idea is not to do so. Why create trouble for yourself and for your fellow Scientologists as nothing will have been gained but ill-will? THE WHY Per HCO Policy Letter of March 7, 1965, it is a crime to be or become a PTS without reporting it or taking action, or to receive processing while PTS. Further as per HCO Policy Letter of October 27, 1964, a PTS may not be trained. This means that a person who is PTS may not receive processing or training while PTS and it also means that they had better do something to handle their condition. As per older, now cancelled policy, the PTS individual was required to handle or disconnect from the an-tagonistic family member before he or she could continue with their training or processing. Many took the easy course and merely disconnected as such disconnection was only temporary for the time of their training or processing and so they did not in actual fact handle the condi-tion in their life which was upsetting to them as Scientologists. Scientology executives have had to promise the New Zealand government that the pol-icy of disconnection from families would be cancelled. This was done. But since that time, we have had more PTS trouble than before. Therefore, what is needed is a legal and more sensible way to handle. Using recent technology contained in the Data Series Policy Letters, a new procedure is possible. Each PTS individual should report to Ethics and with the assistance of Ethics, find a WHY as to their familial antagonism and then set about actually handling the situation. The WHY could be that his parents wanted him to be a lawyer and so blame Scientology that he is not one, rather than the fact that he flunked out of law school and couldn’t stand the thought of being a lawyer. Or perhaps the WHY is that the Scientologist keeps writing her parents for money or the WHY could be that the mother has just read an entheta newspaper article. In any case the WHY should be found and the PTS individual should then do whatever is necessary to handle. See the Data Series PLs (must be word cleared on the user) to find out how to find a Why. This is not mandatory – for doing the PTS-SP Detection Checksheet (BPL 31 May 1971RG)."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"PTS TYPE A HANDLING 4 BPL 5.4.72RC I PTS CS-1 26 06.02.10 HANDLING The person who is PTS should be declared as such by Ethics and should not receive Scientology training or processing until the situation has been handled. (The exception to this is a full PTS Rundown done in the HGC.) The handling could be as simple as writing to one’s father and saying, “I do not com-plain that you are a janitor, please do not complain that I am a Scientologist. The important thing is that I am your son and that I love and respect you. I know you love me, but please learn to respect me as an adult individual who knows what he wants in life.” Or it could be as follows, “I am writing to you, Daddy, because Mother keeps sending me these dreadful news-paper clippings and they are upsetting to me because I know they are not true. You do not do this and so it is easier for me to write to you.” Again there are as many ways of handling as there are Whys found. Each case is indi-vidual. Remember, too, there is always the possibility of a NO situation. And if the person thinks he’s PTS and isn’t, he can get sick. Or if he insists he isn’t and is, he can also get upset. So find if there IS a situation first. It is the purpose of Ethics to ensure that the situation is handled. CS-G for L. RON HUBBARD Founder Revised by LRH Tech Expeditor Revised 29.12.78 by L.

The following LRH tips on handling PTS Type A situations have been excerpted from an LRH lecture as additional data for your use. “I coached a pc one time as to how to talk to his parents. I coached him very, very carefully. This is a sort of an MAA job, not a C/S job. I made him repeat everything after me, very carefully. ‘And when your mother says to you so and so and so and so what are you go-ing to say?’ It was just good roads and good weather. I forced on him at pain of being squashed, to follow this exact patter with his parents. ‘Hello Mama, how are you? How’s Papa?’ etc., simply good roads and good weather. And she says ‘Yeow yeow yeow yeow yeow yeow’ and you ‘...wha wha wha wha wha’. Why just say ‘well alright, alright’, and don’t answer back and don’t engage in any argument of any kind whatsoever. Give it an ac-knowledgement. I told him ‘You are calling them up just because you’re passing through and you were interested in how they are, and that is your whole story.’ And he did, and that was the end of the whole situation. The pc came back to battery. Relationships with the parents went totally normal. In other words, he was keeping it going by his worry, his upset, his let-ters, trying to answer their questions, his conversation with them. Whereas I cut it all into just the pattern of something on the order of about a Tone 3.5 straight across the boards. That was the end of the PTS condition. “A PTS condition also has outside handling steps. But you as an auditor, or you as a C/S are possibly limited by the fact that you don’t have an MAA, or you do not have some-body who is sufficiently skilled in order to do this job for you, and it winds up blowing eve-rybody’s head off. In such an instance, just get hold of the guy, coach him in exactly what he’s going to say. ‘Oh but no she’d never listen, she won’t. She hasn’t talked to me for seven years. She won’t talk to me in any way shape or form.’ ‘Well alright, alright, alright, that’s fine, good.’ Then you get a little bit inventive and you say ‘Well, when is her birthday? ‘, or something like that, and the pc says ‘Well as a matter of fact, it was a month or two ago,’ and you say ‘Well alright, why don’t you send her a birthday card, Remember to tell her it’s a belated day card, and that you remembered her birthday and always had kind thoughts of her?’ Now the incoming comm may blow his head off, and you just cool him off. Don’t en-gage in any corner of this. This is not the game you’re playing. You simply acknowledge any nice part that you can find. ‘Papa went hunting, and you’re a dirty dog, and I’ve never seen the like of you, and you’re an ungrateful brat and so on, and why don’t you be like your Great"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"HANDLING PTS SITUATIONS 2 BTB 11.11.77 PTS CS-1 28 06.02.10 Uncle Oscar who is now doing time in Sing Sing and will be executed next week?’ And so forth, and you say ‘I hope Daddy had a fine hunting trip.’ It’s the only part of it you answer. You coach him into a two-way comm that is well above 2.0 on the tone scale. That mostly consists of acknowledgments and mild interest in what’s going on. You will find out these conditions will evaporate, if you can prevent the backflash from being responded to by the PTS person. In other words there are ways to handle this in real life. “You will find a great many people who are ‘PTS’, are antagonizing the people. They’re antagonizing them beyond belief, and they’re telling them what’s wrong with them, and they’re telling them this and they’re telling them that and so on, and the person eventually gets very resentful. Well even that can be patched up. You are not doing anything at the other end of the line. You cool off the PT scene sufficiently, one way or the other, so that the person can sit in the auditing chair.” LRH (Compiled from LRH Taped Lecture 7511C20) Julie Gillespie A/CS-4 Approved by LRH Pers Comm Authorized by AVU for the BOARDS OF DIRECTORS of the CHURCHES OF SCIENTOLOGY BDCS:AH:KU:JG:pat"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":" PTS CS-1 29 06.02.10 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 24 APRIL 1972 Remimeo DofP Auditors Ethics Officers Issue I C/S Series 79 Expanded Dianetics Series 5 PTS INTERVIEWS (Reference HCO B 17 April 72, C/S Series 76) Interviews to discover a PTS condition are done on a meter with all reads marked. The Interview asks (a) about persons who are hostile or antagonistic to the pc, (b) about groups that are anti-Scientology, (c) about people who have harmed the pc, (d) about things that the pc thinks are suppressive to the pc, (e) about locations that are suppressive to the pc and about past life things and beings suppressive to the pc. In doing the Interview the Interviewer must realize that a sick person is PTS. There are no sick people who are not PTS to someone or a group or something somewhere. A somewhat suppressive pc will find the good hats suppressive. This does not relieve his condition. He is PTS to SP people, groups, things or locations, no matter how SP he is. He can have been audited by someone he knew in an earlier life and who goofed the session. A few auditors have since been declared. Not because they goofed but because they were SP. However, some PTS pc will make trouble for good people because that is what PTS means (Potential Trouble Source). So do not buy all the good people he is PTS to. Further, when you do get the person or group or thing or location the PTS person will F/N VGI and begin to get well. The PTS condition is actually a problem and a mystery and a withdrawal so it is some-times hard to find and has to be specially processed (3 S&Ds) to locate it. Usually it is quite visible. Don’t have a sick, rollercoaster pc appear for Interview and then say “not PTS”. It’s a false report. It only means the Interviewer did not find it. The pc sometimes begins to list in such an Interview and such an Interview where a wrong item is found has to be audited to complete the list or find the right item.

These data are: 1. That all illness in greater or lesser degree and all foul-ups stem directly and only from a PTS condition. 2. That getting rid of the condition requires three basic actions: A. Discover. B. Handle or disconnect. Persons called upon to handle PTS people can do so very easily, far more easily than they believe. Their basic stumbling block is thinking that there are exceptions or that there is other tech or that the two above data have modifiers or are not sweeping. The moment a per-son who is trying to handle PTSs gets persuaded there are other conditions or reasons or tech, he is at once lost and will lose the game and not obtain results. And this is very too bad be-cause it is not difficult and the results are there to be obtained. To turn someone who may be PTS over to an auditor just to have him mechanically audited may not be enough. In the first place this person may not have a clue what is meant by PTS and may be missing all manner of technical data on life and may be so overwhelmed by a suppressive person or group that he is quite incoherent. Thus just mechanically doing a proc-ess may miss the whole show as it misses the person’s understanding of why it is being done. A PTS person is rarely psychotic. But all psychotics are PTS if only to themselves. A PTS person may be in a state of deficiency or pathology which prevents a ready recovery, but at the same time he will not fully recover unless the PTS condition is also handled. For he became prone to deficiency or pathological illness because he was PTS. And unless the condi-tion is relieved, no matter what medication or nutrition he may be given, he might not recover and certainly will not recover permanently. This seems to indicate that there are „other ill-nesses or reasons for illness besides being PTS”. To be sure there are deficiencies and ill-nesses just as there are accidents and injuries. But strangely enough the person himself pre-cipitates them because being PTS predisposes him to them. In a more garbled way, the medi-cos and nutritionists are always talking about „stress” causing illness. Lacking full tech they yet have an inkling that this is so because they see it is somehow true. They cannot handle it."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"PTS HANDLING 2 HCOB 10.08.73 PTS CS-1 32 06.02.10 Yet they recognize it, and they state that it is a senior situation to various illnesses and acci-dents. Well, we have the tech of this in more ways than one. What is this thing called „stress”? It is more than the medico defines it – he usually says it comes from operational or physical shock and in this he has too limited a view. A person under stress is actually under a suppression on one or more dynamics. If that suppression is located and the person handles or disconnects, the condition di-minishes. If he also has all the engrams and ARC Breaks, problems, overts and withholds audited out triple flow and if all such areas of suppression are thus handled, the person would recover from anything caused by „stress”. Usually the person has insufficient understanding of life or any dynamic to grasp his own situation. He is confused. He believes all his illnesses are true because they occur in such heavy books! At some time he was predisposed to illness or accidents. When a serious suppression then occurred he suffered a precipitation or occurrence of the accident or illness, and then with repeated similar suppressions on the same chain, the illness or tendency to accidents be-came prolonged or chronic. To say then that a person is PTS to his current environment would be very limited as a diagnosis. If he continues to do or be something to which the suppressive person or group objected he may become or continue to be ill or have accidents. Actually the problem of PTS is not very complicated. Once you have grasped the two data first given, the rest of it becomes simply an analysis of how they apply to this particular person. A PTS person can be markedly helped in three ways: (a) gaining an understanding of the tech of the condition (b) discovering to what or to whom he is PTS (c) handling or dis-connecting. Someone with the wish or duty to find and handle PTSs has an additional prior step: He must know how to recognize a PTS and how to handle them when recognized. Thus it is rather a waste of time to engage in this hunt unless one has been checked out on all the mate-rial on suppressives and PTSs and grasps it without misunderstoods. In other words the first step of the person is to get a grasp of the subject and its tech. This is not difficult to do; it may be a bit more difficult to learn to run an E-Meter and considerably more difficult to learn how to list for items, but there again this is possible and is much easier than trying to grope around guessing. With this step done, a person has no real trouble recognizing PTS people and can have success in handling them which is very gratifying and rewarding. Let us consider the easiest level of approach: I) Give the person the simpler HCO Bs on the subject and let him study them so that he knows the elements like „PTS” and „Suppressive”. He may just cognite right there and be much better. It has happened. II) Have him discuss the illness or accident or condition, without much prodding or pro-bing, that he thinks now may be the result of suppression. He will usually tell you it is"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"PTS HANDLING 3 HCOB 10.08.73 PTS CS-1 33 06.02.10 right here and now or was a short time ago and will be all set to explain it (without any relief) as stemming from his current environment or a recent one. If you let it go at that he would simply be a bit unhappy and not get well as he is discussing usually a la-te lock that has a lot of earlier material below it. III) Ask when he recalls first having that illness or having such accidents. He will at once begin to roll this back and realize that it has happened before. You don’t have to be auditing him as he is all too willing to talk about this in a most informal manner. He will get back to some early this-lifetime point usually. VI) Now ask him who it was. He will usually tell you promptly. And, as you are not really auditing him and he isn’t going backtrack and you are not trying to do more than key him out, you don’t probe any further. V) You will usually find that he has named a person to whom he is still connected! So you ask him whether he wants to handle or disconnect. Now as the sparks will really fly in his life if he dramatically disconnects and if he can’t see how he can, you persu-ade him to begin to handle on a gradient scale. This may consist of imposing some slight discipline on him such as requiring him to actually answer his mail or write the person a pleasant good roads good weather note or to realistically look at how he estranged them. In short what is required in the handling is a low gradient. All you are trying to do is move the PTS person from effect over to slight gentle cause. VI) Check with the person again, if he is handling, and coach him along, always at a gentle good roads and good weather level and no H E and R (Human Emotion and Reaction) if you please. That is a simple handling. You can get complexities such as a person being PTS to an unknown person in his immediate vicinity that he may have to find before he can handle or disconnect. You can find people who can’t remember more than a few years back. You can find anything you can find in a case. But simple handling ends when it looks pretty complex. And that’s when you call in the auditor. But this simple handling will get you quite a few stars in your crown. You will be amazed to find that while some of them don’t instantly recover, medication, vitamins, miner-als will now work when before they wouldn’t. You may also get some instant recovers but realize that if they don’t you have not failed. The auditor can do „3 S&Ds” after this with much more effect as he isn’t working with a completely uninformed person. „3 S&Ds” only fail because of wrong items or because the auditor did not then put in triple rudiments on the items and then audit them out as engrams triple flow. A being is rather complex. He may have a lot of sources of suppression. And it may take a lot of very light auditing to get him up to where he can do work on suppressives since these were, after all, the source of his overwhelm. And what he did to them might be more important than what they did to him but unless you unburden him he may not get around to realizing that."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"PTS HANDLING 4 HCOB 10.08.73 PTS CS-1 34 06.02.10 You can run into a person who can only be handled by Expanded Dianetics. But you have made an entrance and you have stirred things up and gotten him more aware and just that way you will find he is more at cause. His illness or proneness to accidents may not be slight. You may succeed only to the point where he now has a chance, by nutrition, vitamins, minerals, medication, treatment, and above all, auditing, of getting well. Unless you jogged this condition, he had no chance at all: for becoming PTS is the first thing that happened to him on the subject of illness or accidents. Further, if the person has had a lot of auditing and yet isn’t progressing too well, your simple handling may all of a sudden cause him to line up his case. So do not underestimate what you or an auditor can do for a PTS. And don’t sell PTS tech short or neglect it. And don’t continue to transfer or push off or even worse tolerate PTS conditions in people. You can do something about it. And so can they. L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH:nt.rd"}]
