Neglect of this Pol Ltr has caused great hardship on staffs, has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out Inter-national effort to restore basic Scientology over the world. Within 5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. “Quickie grades” entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this Policy Letter are High Crimes resulting in Comm Evs on administrators and executives. It is not “entirely a tech matter” as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a two-year slump. It is the business of every staff member to enforce it. ALL LEVELS KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING HCO Sec or Communicator Hat Check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on. We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technol-ogy. The only thing now is getting the technology applied. If you can’t get the technology applied then you can’t deliver what’s promised. It’s as simple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what’s promised. The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is “no results”. Trouble spots occur only where there are “no results”. Attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are “no results” or “bad results”. Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 2 HCO PL 7.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 2 16.12.09 So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists of: One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the “reasonable” attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too- bright have a bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront, good or bad, and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad. Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 3 HCO PL 7.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 3 16.12.09 In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide open for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to “eat crow”. On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology”. By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as “unpopular”, “egotistical” and “undemocratic”. It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don’t see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable – only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact – the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called “new ideas” would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved worka-ble mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve – psychia-try, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infinitum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 4 16.12.09 So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’s not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell – and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by “public opin-ion” media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It’s the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the Bank that says we must fail. So just don’t play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of “new technology” and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor’s report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 5 16.12.09 still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B’s own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be “too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases”. All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That Process X didn’t work.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s your audi-tor’s report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?” Then the Pc wouldn’t have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. “Of course his model session is poor but it’s just a knack he has” is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he “overcompensated” nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at “set”. So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student “got such remarkable TA”. They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 6 16.12.09 Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don’t wait until next week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him. If you can’t graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they’ll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse – never permit an “open-minded” approach. If they’re going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they’re aboard, and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the same terms as the rest of us – win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It’s a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive – and even they have a hard time. We’ll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don’t make students into good Scientologists and that lets eve-rybody down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist. Now we’re going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you dead than incapable.” Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 7 16.12.09 But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of “unworkability”. They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance. Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past. Don’t muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten.

Here more than any other points, alteration can enter. Altering, doing something else, is a sufficiently serious problem to destroy a course and all the benefits of Dianetics in a whole area. Early on, during the development of the Standard Dianetics Course, we were suddenly getting case failures. These were traced by Case Supervision to wild variations from Standard Dianetic procedure. These variations were traced to an examiner who during student check-outs was giving „advice“. As soon as this was handled, case gains immediately resumed. Over the many years of Dianetic use, I think we must have seen all possible variations of auditing. „New“ phenomena were often discovered and used and eventually the whole sub-ject wandered off into never-never land and ceased to produce uniform results. What has happened here in Standard Dianetics is that the exact actions that produce results on all cases have been isolated and used as the procedure. The procedure is a thin narrow walkway through a huge field of potential alterations. There are no different cases. Built in to the Standard Dianetic procedure are the remedies. For instance early Dianetics was plagued by several problems: 1. Lack of visio – an inability to see pictures. This was solved by getting date and dura-tion. 2. Perception shut-off. Not required in total now to produce results. Sonic, ability to hear the sound in pictures, is not needed at all. Impression is sufficient. 3. Somatic shut-off. Not now required to be solved but its source (drugs and alcohol) has been discovered. 4. Rough sessions. Solved by TRs. 5. Lack of auditor judgement in diagnosis. Solved by the E-Meter."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"KEEPING DIANETICS WORKING IN AN AREA 2 HCOB 20.5.69 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 10 16.12.09 In these years of research I have been able to wrap up these and other things. There have been more cases run on Dianetics than could easily be counted. So the re-search data is very broad. This is no new subject. It has been close to 39 years under research. Thus what you are told on the Standard Dianetics Course is the essence of all this work and experience. There are no unsolved problems, there is only varied application where there should not be. The whole object of the course is to train people to get good results, and train people to give a course that results in good auditors. That’s the whole thing. We could also teach over 50,000,000 words about things that don’t get results or train auditors. The essence of a brilliant subject is a simple subject. Therefore anything that varies the data of a Standard Dianetics Course can send it out into unworkability. I’ve seen auditors also use „peyote“ (a drug), CO2 and drugs „to help auditing“. I’ve seen many different meter types used. I’ve looked over a thousand different ways to run a session. And I’ve seen all these things fail. The four points of greatest potential failure are 1. A Course Supervisor who interprets data and alters it in order to satisfy some student’s offbeat quest. 2. An Examiner who throws curves into data by means of invalidating the right data. 3. A Case Supervisor who does not simply and only put the auditor back onto the main line and who seeks to „solve“ cases by altering data. 4. An Auditor who, not knowing his data in the first place, alters the data and, because in an altered form he fails, starts off on a wilder alteration of data and fails harder. Under Supervisor come the Course and Cramming Supervisor both. So you see, that to get real Standard Dianetic results going in an area you have to be very alert to hold the exact data line as contained in the HCO Bs. Where you begin to find case failures, look to 1 to 4 above and to student failure to just simply study and drill. ____________________ For the first time you have an exact subject in the field of the „humanities“.

Excellent Auditor training is now in the reach of every Academy. And these are the only things in the long run that will count. When I see an Organization staff panting after newspaper publicity or going mad on the subject of dissemination, and at the same time turning in to me bad results and poor stu-dent quality, I know somebody has their targets mixed up. Quality is the only thing that counts. If quality in training and processing is not given first rank and constant priority by Secretaries or Executive Secretaries, then all the admini-stration in the world will not make the grade for any Central Org. Deliver the goods. That’s a crude way to put it. But if you want a new and better civi-lization you won’t get it by advertising or worrying what people think of you. You will get it only by releasing and clearing people and sending them out into the society to get the show on the road in all branches of human activity, including Scientology. I know we have been a long time without clearing people. But we’re clearing them now. What does it take to clear people? It takes highly skilled and tightly supervised auditing. It takes good technology. It takes good technical application. If you’ll forget about how easy it is to mob students all up in a class and actually con-front each student as an individual, make sure he knows every essential step he has to know, make sure all his questions get answered, you’ll have auditors that can audit. Will you please put attention on raising technical skill in the HGC, releasing people, clearing people, and on the quality of training in the Academy to the end of getting every stu-dent capable of all the steps necessary to release people. I have made the grade technically in the field of research. Now it’s time to drop all the booboo’s and nonsense.

Administration is no unimportant function. On the contrary, I had to work in Scientol-ogy a long time before I found out that in the absence of good administration, technical qual-ity is impossible. At first I counted on high calibre business men to do it. Then I found, after 1954, that they didn’t have a clue and that their use had led us on a bad course. So we had to develop and learn administration and we are winning on it. An administrative personnel is there to keep the lines moving and the function of his post operating. Administrative personnel gets Scientology to the public, keeps the public happy and the organization solvent. Administrative personnel are there to keep Administration out of technical hands and let technical work. Administration gets the public in and out, keeps communication going, gets the data to tech and keeps the Org from going broke. Administration is, however, owed something by technical. If Administration gets peo-ple in for service it is only right that that service, when rendered by technical, be the highest possible quality. For if Administration in all departments is not backed up by quality technical achievements, then administration is betrayed. If one keeps, as in accounts, collecting money for service rendered by technical, then accounts has a right to demand that it was good service or else the accountant, in collecting, betrays. Therefore, Administration may at any time, just as technical may demand good Admin, demand of technical that it produce and hold its own. As of this moment there is no excuse of any kind for any technical failure in any Cen-tral Org. The moment we got all the tools, it showed up that technical often had not understood any of the tools it already had. A clear cut, simple routine as it now exists makes Auditing and Training a problem in black and white. Either it is done or it isn’t.

That would be the sort of thing it would take to keep Scientology from working on every case. The errors are gross, never slight, if a case doesn’t move. All right. Admin personnel do their job. Therefore they have a right to expect tech will do its job. The whole source of low units is tech failure. Bad tech makes it almost impossible to get pcs or students in. Therefore Admin has a right to raise hell over bad tech. A graph drops. ARC breaks gleam clear to anyone. Admin, working at a less interesting job, has the right to scream loud enough to be heard on Arcturus. Because that took a fantastic, large technical goof to achieve. None can now say all is changing in Tech. The only thing that’s changing is the com-munication and information to get tech to do its job. Low units, lack of enough personnel, lack of new executive personnel all trace to tech failure in the past. Now is the time to make good. We can release people easily. Why not do it? We can clear people. Why not do it? A high executive in a Central Org who had had a tech department that was failing, failing, failing owned up the other day to ”having all the data but being too busy to study it.” He meant, obviously he was too busy to do his job. And a Joburg Security Check found out why. All staff members, Tech and Admin, of a Central Org, each one or altogether, has a right to demand that every tech person knows his business and does the job.

All staff personnel has a right to demand practical and functional releasing and clear-ing 1. of staff 2. of executives and 3. of the public who buys our service.

Remimeo All Hats BPI SAFEGUARDING TECHNOLOGY For some years we have had a word „squirreling”. It means altering Scientology, off-beat practices. It is a bad thing. I have found a way to explain why. Scientology is a workable system. This does not mean it is the best possible system or a perfect system. Remember and use that definition. Scientology is a workable system. In fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone, Man never evolved a workable system. It is doubtful if, in foreseeable history, he will ever evolve another. Man is caught in a huge and complex labyrinth. To get out of it requires that he follow the closely taped path of Scientology. Scientology will take him out of the labyrinth. But only if he follows the exact mark-ings in the tunnels. It has taken me a third of a century in this lifetime to tape this route out. It has been proven that efforts by Man to find different routes came to nothing. It is also a clear fact that the route called Scientology does lead out of the labyrinth. Therefore it is a workable system, a route that can be traveled. What would you think of a guide who, because his party said it was dark and the road rough and who said another tunnel looked better, abandoned the route he knew would lead out and led his party to a lost nowhere in the dark. You’d think he was a pretty wishy-washy guide. What would you think of a supervisor who let a student depart from procedure the su-pervisor knew worked. You’d think he was a pretty wishy-washy supervisor. What would happen in a labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in a pretty canyon and left her there forever to contemplate the rocks? You’d think he was a pretty heartless guide. You’d expect him to say at least, „Miss, those rocks may be pretty, but the road out doesn’t go that way.” All right, how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his pre-clear eventually clear just because the preclear had a cognition? People have following the route mixed up with „the right to have their own ideas.” Anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitions – so long as these do not bar the route out for self and others."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"SAFEGUARDING TECHNOLOGY 2 HCO PL 14.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 19 16.12.09 Scientology is a workable system. It white tapes the road out of the labyrinth. If there were no white tapes marking the right tunnels, Man would just go on wandering around and around the way he has for eons, darting off on wrong roads, going in circles, ending up in the sticky dark, alone. Scientology, exactly and correctly followed, takes the person up and out of the mess. So when you see somebody having a ball getting everyone to take peyote because it restimulates prenatals, know he is pulling people off the route. Realize he is squirreling. He isn’t following the route. Scientology is a new thing – it is a road out. There has not been one. Not all the sales-manship in the world can make a bad route a proper route. And an awful lot of bad routes are being sold. Their end product is further slavery, more darkness, more misery. Scientology is the only workable system Man has. It has already taken people toward higher IQ, better lives and all that. No other system has. So realize that it has no competitor. Scientology is a workable system. It has the route taped. The search is done. Now the route only needs to be walked. So put the feet of students and preclears on that route. Don’t let them off of it no mat-ter how fascinating the side roads seem to them. And move them on up and out. Squirreling is today destructive of a workable system. Don’t let your party down. By whatever means, keep them on the route. And they’ll be free. If you don’t, they won’t. L.

Reason: The effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades. The pres-sure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly an-swered by just not delivering. The correct way to speed up a student’s progress is by using two way comm and ap-plying the study materials to students. The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not. The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions. Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to any recovery. The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs. When the product vanishes, so does the org. The orgs must survive for the sake of this planet. L.

To people who have no personal reality on the results of processing it is especially easy to be ”reasonable” about no results. The public is not result conscious. This is proven by a century of botched up psychia-try and psychology. At no time in that century has a government or a society recognized or demanded results. The evidence that this is a fact is very plain. Psychiatry and psychology have never achieved a positive lasting result of any benefit but on the contrary downgrade, injure and kill. Yet they are still functioning as professions. Now this seems to be an invitation or justification for an org not to try for any results. But the truth is that the public is with you just so long as results are achieved. As soon as they aren’t achieved, areas become upset. And as for psychiatry and psychology, they are functioning but resultless, are in seri-ous trouble and are despised. So there is no tradition of or any general belief in results in the society or its govern-ments. Thus an org can become sloppy as there is no visible demand for results. There is only an invisible hope. And a definite reaction when they don’t occur. We can and do achieve results beyond anyone’s hopes. So long as we continue to do this our area control will expand. When we don’t it will contract. In view of the above lack of demand, it is up to us to hold up our own standards. Qual-ity is a matter we must give constant attention. We must produce: 1. Students who can audit. 2. Pcs who have achieved gains in auditing."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"TECH DOWNGRADES 2 HCO PL 26.10.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 23 16.12.09 A very high-handed attitude, based on truth, is what is required of us. Example: Pc has had triple grades but can’t talk. All right, so we don’t let him go. We say, ”We’re sorry but you must redo your grade zero.” We get a Folder Error Summary, repair it, really set him up, get him through a Comm Course and redo zero with further processes. Example: The OCA graph of a pc ”completing” his Dianetics is all below the line – unacceptable. We don’t kid ourselves, pay a completion bonus to the auditor and let the pc go. We say, ”Sorry. You haven’t made it. This takes more auditing.” Example: A student ”graduates” from the Academy yet doesn’t audit. We call him back, find out why, word clear him, drill him, demand he interne. As long as a student or pc thinks his failure to make it is all right with you, you will have a bad repute in his area. Privately he will think the subject doesn’t work and that you are frauds. The moment you say to somebody who hasn’t made it, ”You have not met our stan-dards” truth and respect go in. Reversely, the moment you say to somebody who has made it that he has, the truth of your skill is apparent to him. To tell people that haven’t made it that they have is to establish a lie and earn con-tempt. To tell people they haven’t made it when they have is to get back hostility and a bad repute.

Additives made things unworkable. After 1966 when I left the post of Executive Director WW, a new condition set in. Checksheets, processes, intensives, grades began to be cut down. This we can dub a cutative impulse to coin a word. So persuasive were its advocates that even I was persuaded to agree to some points of it so you need not feel bad if you were gulled into buying the idea of shortening things in or-der to produce a quicker result. No one really saw where the trend was going. In 1970 a survey I have just completed has shown that this effort was so complete that the following had been broadly accomplished: A. Training no longer included enough Scientology materials to make an effective Scientology auditor in many places. B. Grades had been shortened from 50 hours 0 to IV to 2½ minutes. C. The End Phenomena of grades and processes were discarded. The end result has been: 1. Few skilled auditors. 2. Shrunken and struggling Scn orgs. 3. A field that is disappointed in results – for they think they have had grades and haven’t. 4. People coming into Advanced Orgs to be cleared who have NO lower grades ac-tually run and so they can’t make any upper grades. In effect Scientology was thrown away. From total workability it was cut down to oc-casional result. I saw the first impulse of this in an executive long since dismissed from Saint Hill as a constant overt no-case gain case who agitated constantly to remove tapes from the Saint Hill Course. As 90% of the data on the SHSBC is on tape I merely thought he had gone over to the enemy and ignored him. Some others, however, had the same idea and started labeling basic books and bulletins “Mere Background Data” or saying “We don’t use that now” or “That’s"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"CUTATIVES 2 HCO PL 30.5.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 27 16.12.09 old and you only look at it for interest”. Thus the laws of listing and other phenomena were thrown away. Recently I found the reason Case Supervisors failed is that they just don’t know “The Original Thesis” and “Evolution of a Science” or “Scn 8-80” or “Scn 8-8008”. When I de-manded they study these books they became capable of handling cases. They did not know what they were handling – the mind – and so how could they be sensible in ordering what was to be run on a case? Back in 1950 we used to have a small bunch of goony birds, ex-psychologists, ex-lunatics. They were constantly demanding a 2 second action that totally cleared someone. Behind this was an inability to concentrate attention or even to work. These were people striv-ing for total effect instantly. Yet they couldn’t run with reality on any process heavier than “How are you?” and they never saw a wall – they saw a mock up of it! So the impulse of do it all now now that destroyed any sanity of psychiatry is always around. A student with a one item checksheet who does it in one minute is the ideal course to such. A preclear run for 2½ minutes to total top grades becomes an ideal auditing session to such. Such things just aren’t real. And such unreality got into the lines too hard and is being escorted right back out right now. The following policies are in full force and are to be backed up fully. 1. Course checksheets may not be cut, edited or reduced after a fully approved checksheet is issued for use on any course. 2. No grade may be awarded for which all processes of that grade have not been run and where the end phenomena of that grade is not attested to singly and fully by the preclear before an examiner. 3. Anyone found relegating basic materials to unimportance, by reason of age or vol-ume is to lose his post and certificates. 4. Any statistic claimed which is achieved by downgrading materials or grades or falsely pretending an end phenomena has been achieved for pcs, or skill by audi-tors shall result in the dismissal of the division head presenting it. 5. No suppressive person with a fat ethics file and no case gain may hold any execu-tive position in a Scientology org. ___________________ If you in any org or franchise are having any field or financial trouble you need not look further than errors pointed out in this Policy Letter. “Dianetic Triples” awarded after 1½ hours of processing, “multiple declares” after 10 minutes from 0 to IV, using checksheets from which all basic material has been cut, the fail-"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"CUTATIVES 3 HCO PL 30.5.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 28 16.12.09 ure to realize gains and abilities and success have to be worked for to be true, are at the bot-tom of any trouble any org or franchise is having.

The word has been used to designate rundowns that were not completely and fully done. It is not a slang word. In the dictionary you will find “Quickie also quicky: something done or made in a hurry. Also: a hurriedly planned and executed program (as of studies).” What happens in auditing, for instance, is a “Grade Zero Expanded” is “done” by just doing a single flow to its first F/N. That is obviously “quickie”. A more subtle one is to do a “PTS Rundown” with no Ethics action to begin and no check for stability, holding gain and not ill a week or two after the RD. Only if both these actions were done would one have a “Complete PTS Rundown” as it would give a PROD-UCT = A PC no longer PTS. So what makes a Quickie “completion” quickie? Is it length of time? Not necessarily. Is it fewness of processes? Not necessarily as Power can be done quickie simply by not hanging on for the EP and only going to F/N. To define complete gives us the reverse of Quickie. “Complete: To make whole, entire or perfect; end after satisfying all demands or re-quirements. “ A Completion is “the act or action of completing, becoming complete or mak-ing complete”. So “completing” something is not a loose term. It means an exact thing. “End after sat-isfying all demands or requirements” does not mean “doing as little as possible” or “doing what one can call complete without being detected”. Anything that does not fully satisfy all requirements is quickie."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"“QUICKIE” DEFINED 2 HCOB 19.04.72 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 31 16.12.09 So “quickie” really means “omitting actions for whatever reason that would satisfy all demands or requirements and doing something less than could be achieved”. In short a quickie is not doing all the steps and actions that could be done to make a perfect whole. Standard auditing actions required for ages that auditors cleared each word of each command. Yet when they went quickie they dropped this. When this was dropped, gains on 75% of all pcs lessened or vanished. We are right now achieving spectacular wins on pcs just by clearing up commands and words on all lists. We are finding that these pcs did not recover and never before had been in session even though previously “audited” hundreds of hours. By omitting an essential action of clearing commands, processing did not work be-cause the pc never understood the auditing commands! So quickie action did not save any time, did it? It wasted hundreds of hours! Quickie Programs are those which omit essential steps like Vital lists or 2wcs to get data. FESs for past errors are often omitted. To slow down the torrent of quickie actions on clearing commands HCO P/L 4 Apr 72 Issue III “ETHICS AND STUDY TECH” has Clause 4 “An auditor failing to clear each and every word of every command or list used may be summoned before a Court of Ethics. The charge is Out Tech.” Ethics has to enter in after Quickie Tech has gotten in. Because quickie tech is a symptom of out ethics. HCO P/L 3 April 72 (Est O Series 13) “Doing Work” and HCO P/L 4 Apr 72 (Est O Series 14) “Ethics” are vital know-how where a C/S is faced with Quickie ac-tions – or flubby ones that will not cure. Essential Quickie Tech is simply dishonest. Auditors who do it have their own Ethics out in some way. To be sure their confront is down. There are numerous remedies for the quickie impulse. The above mentioned Policy Letters and plain simple TR 0 are standard remedies. TR 0 properly done and completed itself usually cures it. Quickie study in ‘67 and ‘68 almost destroyed auditing quality. LRH ED 174 Int which really pushes in Study Tech will achieve the primary reason for quickie-the auditor didn’t understand the words himself. Wherever Quickie tendencies or false stats (the quickest quickie possible) show up, the above P/Ls had better be gotten into full use fast. L.

There are no Dianetic or Scientology single or «Quickie» lower grades anymore. DIANETIC CLEAR: The state of Clear can be achieved on Dianetics. It is not however attained by feeding people cognitions; Clears are made through au-diting. . . . A Dianetic Clear must not be run on engrams, R3RA or any version of R3R or Dianet-ics.

He can be given Touch or Contact Assists (as can Clears and OTs), but not a Dianetic Auditing Assist nor any Dianetic auditing. A Dianetic Clear does the Purification Rundown and the Survival Rundown if he has not had these. He is given the Scientology Drug Rundown (unless he has previously com-pleted a full NED Drug Rundown or other Dianetic Drug Rundown). He is run on Expanded ARC Straightwire and Expanded Grades 0-IV, to full Ability Gained for each Grade not previ-ously standardly declared. When each Grade has been fully handled to Ability Gained, the next step is the Solo Auditor Course at a Saint Hill or Advanced Org. A Dianetic Clear is not run on Power, R6EW or the Clearing Course, but, upon com-pletion of the Solo Auditor Course, goes directly onto OT 1. CLASSIFICATION CHART: This chart «Classification and Gradation Chart» has been reissued many times. All is-sues are more or less valid. All the processes listed in the Processes Run Column and more are used in Expanded Lower Grades. The chart is valid. QUICKIE GRADES: Persons were too demanding to be done quickly. On many cases these grades as given were valid but a large number of cases needed Expanded Lower Grades. 20 minutes from Grade 0 to IV and 5 minutes Power was far more than many could stand up to.

It was a growing cultural disinclination to do things thoroughly. “Fast, quick results” was interpreted as seconds or minutes. In old psychotherapy as practiced in the 19th Century it required One Year of weekly consultation to see if anything could be done about a case and Four More Years to produce a meager superficial result. Compared to that two or three hundred hours of processing was nothing. As we began to dominate this field in terms of persons handled and results obtained, psychiatry invented ”instant psychiatry” by which no result was gotten in no time. Speed became the primary consideration of the culture. Jet planes, fast cars “saved time”. But an old Chinese, when told by a driver that he had saved 4 minutes in speeding back from town asked, “What are you going to do with the 4 minutes?” Time itself is a basis of aberration. Dropping time out is the consideration of factory managers of production lines as “the faster something can be made the more you have of it”. But look at this again. Something can be done so fast it isn’t done at all! The difference be-tween a very fine camera and a cheap one is speed of manufacture. Cheap cameras don’t get their parts carefully machined or matched – they don’t fit together – they break, cease to work. A fine gun can be told by the lack of tool marks on the hidden places. A cheap gun’s inner bolt is a mess of scars. It isn’t smooth in operation. It didn’t take much time to make but it also jams and freezes up when you try to use it. Maybe you’ve heard of “hotter than a 2 dollar pistol”. A 2 dollar pistol is “hot” because it’s so quickie made it usually blows up and blows off a hand. There is a point where Speed is simply a cover for a cheap worthless product. Let us take a filthy room. A lazy housekeeper comes in and sweeps a few bits of dust under the carpet, leaves soot all over the windows and garbage on the mantle and says it’s clean. Somebody else not afraid of work spends an hour at it and leaves a really clean room."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"SUPERFICIAL ACTIONS 2 HCOB 21.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 37 16.12.09 SHORT PGMS A short pc program is economically and efficiently for the birds. In the first place a C/S has to know the extent of his tech well to be able to think up light processes in quantity. If one heard a C/S say, “But I don’t have time to spend an hour doing a long program for the pc,” one is listening to something peculiar. If one spent an hour or two doing up a real long 20 action program to repair the pc, then for the next 20 C/Ses it takes only a few minutes to look over the session and order the next action on the list. If one had no program one would have to study the folder each time. One actually saves C/S time by doing long programs both to repair and to get the pc back on the Class Chart where he’d gotten to. Further, auditing is sold by the hour and it wastes money and income and pcs to short program them. “Yes but we sell result! If we can get 200 pcs done in 100 auditing minutes we would make £18,233 clear profit... ” Well the cruel answer to that was when orgs began to do that on lower grades they didn’t attain the result on the pc and stats went down! Power was once priced against the fact of 50 to 100 hours of auditing. It retained the price and by cutting out all End Phenomena or real gain it was at last being given in 20 min-utes. And after just so many years of this economic dishonesty, SHs crashed! They had sold out the real value of the product for a quick buck. The “field” became “ARC Broken” and few takers came to an SH. It is a very long hard road back. And it is a very costly one. “Quickie Grades”, instead of making fortunes for one and all, crashed the whole Sci-entology network. Because quickie results are lazy and dishonest. Let’s just face up to the facts of life! Selling out the integrity of the subject for a buck wrecks the subject. SUCCESS The real stat of an org is Success Stories. Honest grades and time spent in C/Sing and in auditing to obtain them add up to suc-cess for the individual, the org, its field, the country and the planet. The time it takes to process somebody is how long it takes to get each single result available. It is not how slowly or quickly it is done. A book is not a good book if it takes 7 years to write. And a bad book isn’t always written in 2 weeks. It takes as long to write a"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"SUPERFICIAL ACTIONS 3 HCOB 21.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 38 16.12.09 good book as you get a good book. The result is the result and time is just an entered arbi-trary. A person who overwhelms at Grade IV is an easily overwhelmed person. It might take 50 hours just to repair the case and the person’s life. That might be 20 or 30 steps on the pro-gram. If the C/S can’t dream up 8 or 9 ways to repair past auditing and 15 or 20 ways to re-pair a life, then it’s time to go back and read THE ORIGINAL THESIS, EVOLUTION OF A SCIENCE, DMSMH, 8-80, 8-8008 and listen to a hundred or so SHSBC tapes. “Yes, but I have no time to.” Well, that’s also saying “It can’t be done well.” But there is time. If anyone looked over his area he would be able to throw out the time-wasting actions if it comes to that. “Look. I’m the C/S, the D of P and have to audit 3 ...” That’s a statement that the job has already been done so badly that no persons show up to take over the extra hats! And the no-result programs cripple the economics and that be-comes no help. I have seen Mary Sue take over an HGC that had tons of unsolved cases and too few auditors and have watched her solve one case at a time and within 2 weeks have 35 auditors and no backlogs and in six weeks no unsolved cases! She was using the “old”, “historical”, “background”, “we don’t use them anymore” processes! So it not only can be done, it is the thing to do. That org’s stats soared. It became solvent. It ran at a high run and was a happy org. SICK PCs When there are sick people on a list one doesn’t just “give a Dianetic Assist” and send to a doctor and write them off. If one knows his tech, there was a reason the person got sick. One also knows a sick person goes into overwhelm easily. One can do a touch assist, a contact assist, two-way comm, ruds on the accident, ruds before the accident, Dianetic Assist, medical treatment, life ruds, HCO B 24 July ‘69, two-way comm on suppression, 3 S & Ds, assessment for area of illness, prepcheck on area, ruds on area, hello and okay with the affected area, reach and withdraw from area, two-way comm, recall on persons similarly ill, location of the postulate that caused it with itsa earlier itsa, prepcheck on the body or its part, more HCO B 24 July ‘69, more ruds, assessment of failed purposes, two-way comm on the sickness."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"SUPERFICIAL ACTIONS 4 HCOB 21.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 39 16.12.09 That’s not a program.

The missing knowledge is “gradient scales”. Stairs and ladders have steps and rungs. It takes Time to climb a tower. The magical complex thinks of processes as incantations or charms. A person C/Sing would always be trying to find the process the pc should be run on. The think is that the proc-ess, once discovered, would take no time at all and the pc would magically become well! Pardon me, but that’s pure goofiness. And it would set the C/S up for constant failure. One sees such a person scrambling through processes, trying to guess “which one which one which one. Oh there’s one! Now we run it for 3 minutes on the pc. Oh dear. It didn’t work. He isn’t well. Let’s see what’s here still. Scramble scramble. Oh, here’s one. This green paper is probably the right color. Auditor! Run this on the pc. Oh dear, it didn’t work. He isn’t well yet. So! We will take these 5 major processes and run them all in one ses-sion and add six grades. Do that! Do it! It’s a desperate situation. Oh dear, the pc blew. Well I guess the subject doesn’t work or I’m a failure... ” That is not how one should C/S. If a workman was supposed to cure an ox hide and was told salt would do it and he had a magical complex, what would he do. Well, he might take a small salt shaker and sprin-kle the corner of the hide (thinking the right thought) and find that the hide rotted in a few days. He could then conclude salt didn’t cure ox hides. If someone kept hammering at him to cure ox hides with salt and he kept sprinkling the corner (knowing it wouldn’t work) he’d get a very odd idea about his orders! But who would suspect that this workman thought it was magic! An honest rubbing of salt all over and into the ox hide is the meaning of “salt will cure ox hides”! But that would take work. It would take Time! It would have to be honestly and thor-oughly done. But one would have cured ox hides and gotten shoes and a profit and pay and everything for one had a product. Magical thought in auditing isn’t likely to give anyone a product of really able people!"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"SUPERFICIAL ACTIONS 5 HCOB 21.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 40 16.12.09 SHORT-CUTTING PROCESSES Processes can be short-cut as well as programs. Take an early (means basic, useful, useable) version of Rising Scale. There are 18 pairs. Each pair should be run to F/N, Cog, VGIs. An auditor told to run Rising Scale can run along the 18 pairs until one F/Ns. And leave it. The process has been short-cut. And with that shortcut went its ability to restore fertil-ity! So one hears Rising Scale will sometimes restore fertility or change eyesight. Orders it done. It is done to 1 F/N. No real result occurs. Or take Dianetics. Dianetics can be chopped ”to save Time”. First feeble flutter of an F/N, no Cog, no VGIs, auditor barking ”Did it erase? Did it erase?” Final result, no real gain. There goes the subject. Half an hour to run the chain, no extra 30 seconds for the real F/N, the Cog, the VGIs. So one wastes a result for the sake of saved time. THE AGE It is a symptom of the age that there is no time. But in the Data Series PLs one finds that ”omitted time” is a basic insanity. That a body lives only about 70 years puts an awful limit on Man. Man’s Empires endure at most only about 300 years if that. 70 years is not enough time to make a real career and 300 years is not enough time to even groove in a civil service. Man pays for it with poor lives and rotten governments. But it doesn’t take 70 years or 300 years to process a pc. A year maybe up to homo novis. A few years to OT. Even traveling it casually slow. 25 hours to repair someone’s life and 50 to 100 hours to get him up to no somatics with Dianetics is pretty satisfactorily fast. What’s this take? A week to repair. 2 to 4 weeks for full Dianetics. At 25 hours a week. That’s very little. And it’s enough to tell him to get trained so he can have all he wants."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"SUPERFICIAL ACTIONS 6 HCOB 21.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 41 16.12.09 SPEED LIABILITY When speed is the consideration, not results, you get a very cheap camera or car.

You get no students that way and that’s the heavy org income. You get no expanding field. And you won’t ever get a cleared planet. We’ve learned all this the hard way. So let’s not let it go unheeded. The place to handle the situation is with C/Sing. And to gain the co-operation of C/Ses to make results real results by insisting that speed is the fast road to poverty in the long run. If the C/S burden is too heavy, start pushing training. Then you’ll get help. Honest C/Sing gives an honest result. It takes as long to correct a case as it takes. It takes as long to make a person well as it takes. It takes as long to get a real lasting grade result as it takes. And that’s a lot longer than the time spent on it in the late 60’s. All pcs ”have to be OT tomorrow”. Why let them C/S their case by demanding it only take 2 minutes? Self C/Sing is no more effective than self auditing. Registrars as well as pcs try to grab the C/S hat. “I will sell you a marital intensive be-cause you have such a bad cold.” And Execs, “Run this staff member on money...” Well, a C/S’s hat is the C/S’s. And he should wear it for honest results. And damn oth-ers trying to C/S and wreck his job.

Overshooting would be defined as going beyond a completion or completing a com-pletion. In such a circumstance the pc for instance reaches an F/N VGI point in Review and then the C/S decides to handle the case in Review. Example: 2 or 3 sessions have been goofed. Review patches them all up to F/N VGIs all okay. Then a C/S C/Ses to Review the case to repair the errors. The case feels invalidated, caves in, needs further repair. I have seen more than one folder where this cycle has been done three times! In one of these an action had to be taken to patch up a goof so the pc could go back onto a grade. The goof was patched up to F/N VGIs. The correct action would have been to put the pc back on the incomplete grade. But no, a new Review cycle was laid out, audited, pc caved in. A new cycle to repair this was entered in upon. It was successful. The pc got F/N VGIs at Exam.

Studying what was wrong with the cases I found the above. I ordered an assessment of a list, got ”unnecessary actions” and got the cases back onto the incomplete cycle of the grade and they did fine. This can be done with a grade. It was the fault of early Power. Undershooting would be to leave a cycle incomplete and go off to something else. Example: Case sent to Review or given a Review session to repair goofs. One goof is handled but there are three to handle. Case returned to the grade before being set up. This can be so bad that the case never made any grade at all. The modern Repair (Progress) Pgm as outlined in this C/S series takes care of this.

Unless there was an orderly program to complete his case level by level on the Class and Grade Chart. It would take a Repair (Progress) Pgm and then an Advance Pgm that included each grade to completion. He would have to have his ruds put in, any flubs at once handled session to session, just to complete Dianetics. Finally, his chronic somatics gone, he would F/N on the Health Form and that would complete his Dianetics with his attestation. And so on right on up the Grades, each one done fully to the voluntary declare for that grade as per the Grade and Class Chart. In doing Dianetics, Grades, etc you still have to get in ruds and handle the case so it is set up for each major action and repair the flubs at once when they occur. While completing an action you have to keep the case running, not audit over ARC Brks, PTPs, W/Hs and flubs. The best answer is No Flubs. But when they occur they must be repaired in 24 hours. When repaired (and not re-repaired and re-re-repaired with overshoots) you get the case back on the same cycle that was incomplete.

By handle is meant finish off, complete, end cycle on. To give you an idea of the reverse – in admin we sometimes find terminals that refer despatches to others, let them drift, give excuses why not. This all adds up to not handling. This is the basic reason for DEV-T (Developed, meaning excessive, traffic). Like the station-ery company writes somebody in the org to please specify the number of sheets wanted. So whoever’s hat it is refers it to somebody else who refers it to another who fails to answer. In this way, the org can look industrious while accomplishing nothing. Nobody handles it. You can get a similar situation going with pcs. Nobody handles the pc. And if you keep this up, your whole area fills up with unhandled pcs, the org’s repute goes down and stats eventually crash. The org is being paid to handle pcs. It is not being paid to put them off or explain or let them drift away. Here is an example from the early 1960s. An org had it going that anybody who was feeling bad and demanding help got a review. The review consisted of a Green Form to F/N. While this would clean up an ARC Brk or PTP or a poor prior session, it sure wasn’t about to remedy a feeling of nausea. So a pc would come in with a feeling of nausea. He would be sent to Review, get a Green Form and F/N on an ARC Break. Then Review would shrug off the fact that the pc was still nauseated by saying all it could do was a GF! In short, it wouldn’t handle the pc. Another recent case – pc with migraine headaches. Got some (evidently poor) Dianetic Auditing. No change. When the pc’s friend complained, he was told it was ”the illegal life she was living” and no action was taken. So the pc went to another org and there they refused auditing due to painkillers (instead of waiting 2 or 3 days until it wore off)."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"HANDLING WITH AUDITING 2 HCOB 15.1.70 II CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 64 16.12.09 These are cases of not handling. The idea of non-handling can also go into fees. A pc once paid a Franchise for audit-ing to be done in an org. The Franchise did not forward the fee so the org sent the pc back home. Service and Handling are the same thing. When you give service you handle. There are thousands of ways of not handling. Letting backlogs occur in Tech and Qual is probably the most serious to org income and to field repute. Also if a person is goofed up in Tech he probably is suffering and to be put off in Qual for any reason at all is a severe blow to the org. A 3 hour Qual backlog is too long. So, part of Handling cases is handle n–o–w! I recall a Qual backlog I once found of 10 pcs. They were of all varieties – but the main fault was just nobody had the idea except the pcs that they should be handled now. And handled. I sat down and did four of them in the next four hours and grabbed off auditors from Admin and Exec areas and handled the rest. Within 6 hours of finding this backlog, they were all handled, happily, finally and wholly satisfied. What was required was (a) a determination to handle cases, (b) a surety they could be handled and (c) the actual handling. All three points are needful. Only two things prevent the above. When the help factor is low in the org or its audi-tors, there is no real determination to handle cases. A commercialism enters where the pay-ment of the money is more interesting than the delivery of the service. This is self-defeative. One has to have the money but one won’t continue to get money unless one is vitally inter-ested in actually delivering service – which means actually handling the cases. The certainty that one can handle cases depends in the main upon good training and exact application of the technology. There can be an awful lot of tech to apply but the point is to apply the tech that is applied with exactness. ”Squirreling” is not really different processes – it is careless, incomplete, messed up auditing procedure. An auditor auditing a process that reads with excellent TRs to an F/N with good indicators seldom has any loses. But even given good procedure, one occasionally gets a lose. This tends to reduce one’s certainty that he can get a result on a pc. Usually it isn’t one’s own pcs that cause this – it’s hearing about some pc who didn’t get a result, but not hearing the whole story. If one’s command of the subject of auditing is poor he doesn’t recognize why there was a lose. A pc lies about having eaten or slept or is being audited on someone else’s deter-mination or some such thing and because of these, the pc gets a lose. This causes the auditor to have a lose. Some auditors can get 20 wins and 1 lose and then mourn only about the 1 lose. What is missed here – with pc loses – is that it is almost always a short-term lose. They lost in this one but nobody thinks to keep at it with Dianetics and Scientology until it’s a win."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"HANDLING WITH AUDITING 3 HCOB 15.1.70 II CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 65 16.12.09 I’ve seen somebody audited for years before he finally and forever lost his chronic trouble. He would get better and then relapse, never quite so bad. And finally he recovered totally. So there must be some idea extant amongst auditors that all ”wins” in auditing must be fast, total and appreciated volubly. This isn’t always the case. In fact, it is in the minority. So an auditor’s and an org’s certainty should depend only on being certain of eventual permanent result and to be very extra happy when it is fast, total and appreciated. To handle a case one keeps at it. So the pc got an intensive. So the pc wasn’t handled in that intensive. Well, one doesn’t just dust it off and say that’s it forever. The Case Supervi-sor looks harder and gets the Registrar to get more auditing bought. If Dianetics didn’t handle, Scientology will. If this process didn’t handle completely, that process may. This is the winning attitude. I know one case that’s still goofed up after a decade. The medics put a steel pipe in his leg bone. He won’t get it taken out and insists on auditing only. So every few months somebody tries again. Sooner or later this case will be handled. The point is to keep trying to handle, not dream up reasons it can’t be. Auditors brought up with the idea that 5 hours of auditing should always resurrect a decayed corpse haven’t been brought up right. Some SP around them has been making de-mands of the subject and auditing that build in loses. Girl with migraine, 15 hours of Dianetics, still has migraine. Okay. So we don’t brush her off. We get her to buy a good long Scientology intensive and do a full ”GF 40”. Still has migraine. So we now do another Dianetic Intensive. We don’t mislead her. We say, ”Okay, you want to get rid of your migraine. So we’ll stay with you if you’ll work along with us as long as it takes. It might happen fast, it might happen slow. You might have to go all the way to OT Grades. But we’ll try all the way.” A Registrar that promises instant miracles is cutting the Tech Sec’s throat and the GI as well! The condition can be handled. The whole point is, for the good of the pc and the org it eventually must be handled. There are literally thousands of processes and approaches available for use. The pc expects the condition to be handled. So one way or another one gets the pc handled. To do otherwise is to court disaster for the org. Now and then a pc gets away, nearly always because of errors that get the pc upset with the subject of auditing, never when the org wasn’t still trying to handle. A session was goofed and not repaired, somebody in the org inferred the condition couldn’t be handled, that’s the sort of thing that loses pcs."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"HANDLING WITH AUDITING 4 HCOB 15.1.70 II CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 66 16.12.09 Keep on trying to handle and you will succeed.

This is not an Admin point I’m making. It is a technical point. Every so often a pc is found hung up in not having declared and attested the state at-tained. A Declare Completes his cycle of action and is a vital part of the action. One never forces or feeds one to the pc. I recall one org where the entire tech and in-come structure crashed, the C/O and several personnel had to be removed because they were forcing “clear cogs” on their Dianetic pcs who hadn’t had them (and then telling them they couldn’t be audited further on Scientology) (Connie Broadbent, ASHO, March ‘70). So this goes two ways. The pc or pre OT who knows he made it must be sent to exams and C & A to at-test. The pc or pre OT who hasn’t made it must never be sent to exams to declare and attest. This gives us a third: Pcs and pre OTs who haven’t made it must be handled until they have made that specific declare, even though it means signing up for more auditing. Truth is the keynote, the essence, the point here. All the “PR” (slang for promotional talk) in the world will not supplant truth. The pc knows he made something. Therefore he must be sent to declare it whether it’s a standard grade or not! The pc who hasn’t made it knows he hasn’t and so when forced to declare or ordered to attest tends to cave in. His concept of the validity of the org and honesty of Scientology depends on this, and really on this alone. The correct declare or not declare decision of the C/S is a vital C/S action. L.

This fact tells you at once why you cannot do three major actions in a row in the same ten minutes. This was the bug behind “Quickie Grades” (0 to IV in one session. This also occurred in Power when it was run all in one day). The auditor would attain a bona fide full dial F/N. The pc was still cogniting, still in a big win. The auditor would “clear the next process com-mand”, he would see an F/N. He would “clear the next process command”, and see an F/N. But it was the same F/N! Result was that processes 2 and 3 were never run on the case. This is really what is meant by “Quickie Grades”. In 1958 we got real Releases. You could not kill the F/N for days, weeks. Several processes had this effect. Today’s real Clear also goes this way. You couldn’t kill the F/N with an axe. By running a lot of Level Zero processes, for instance, you can get a real swinging unkillable F/N. It not only gets to the Examiner, it comes in at the start of the next day’s session! Now if in one session you ran all of Level Zero and went on up to Level One, you would just be auditing a persistent F/N. The pc would get no benefit at all from Level One. He’s still going “Wow” on Level Zero. If you ran Level Zero with one process that got a big wide floating F/N and then “ran” Level I, II, III and IV, you would have just a Level Zero Release. The pc’s bank was nowhere to be found. So next week he has problems (Level I) or a Service Fac (Level IV) and he is only a Grade Zero yet it says right there in Certs and Awards log he’s a Grade IV.

GRADUAL WIDENING In running a Dianetic chain to basic in triple you will sometimes see in one session a half dial on Flow 1, 3/4 of a dial on Flow 2, a full dial on Flow 3. Or you may have 4 subjects to two-way comm or prepcheck in one session. First ac-tion 1/3 dial F/N. Then no F/N, TA up. Second action l/2 dial F/N. Then no F/N. Third action 3/4 dial F/N. Fourth action full dial-wide floating swinging idling F/N. You will also notice in the same session-long time for 1st action, shorter, shorter, shorter for the next three actions. Now you have an F/N that anything you try to clear and run will just F/N without af-fecting the case at all. If you audit past that you are wasting your time and processes. You have hit an “unkillable F/N”, properly called a persistent F/N. It’s persistent at least for that day. Do any more and it’s wasted. If an auditor has never seen this he had better get his TR0 bullbait flat for 2 hours at one unflunked go and his other TRs in and drill out his flubs. For that’s what’s supposed to happen. F/Ns on pcs audited up to (for that session) a persistent F/N always get to the Exam-iner. If you only have a “small F/N” it won’t get to the Examiner. However, on some pcs maybe that’s good enough. May take him several sessions, each one getting a final session F/N a bit wider. Then he gets an F/N that gets to the Examiner. After that, well audited on a continuing basis, the F/N lasts longer and longer. One day the pc comes into session with a dial-wide floating swinging F/N and any-thing you say or do does nothing whatever to disturb that F/N. It’s a real Release man. It may last weeks, months, years. Tell him to come back when he feels he needs some auditing and chalk up the remain-ing hours (if sold by the hour) as undelivered. Or if sold by result, chalk up the result. If the F/N is truly persistent he will have no objections. If it isn’t, he will object. So have him come back tomorrow and carry on whatever you were doing.

Only change – [page 79] word „arrived“ corrected to „aimed“. Correction in this type style.) C/S Series 6 WHAT THE C/S IS DOING In Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health considerable stress is placed on the words and phrases in engrams. This is still functional. However as I did further research I found that (a) many pcs were unable to get the words in the engram and (b) the apparent force of the words was derived wholly from the pain, emotion, effort contained in the engram. In Standard Dianetics the words in an engram play no major role in the auditing. The use of the words to de-aberrate and concentration on phrases in engrams is valid but junior in force to the pain, misemotion, etc in the engram. Thus if you run out the force the words drop into insignificance. This is often how the pc gets cognitions: the words and meaning concealed in the engram are changing value and devaluating. The pc can then think clearly again on a subject previously pinned down by the force. Get the force out and the words take care of themselves and need no special handling. The meaning of things plays a secondary role in processing to forces. Thetans find counter-forces objectionable. Almost all chronic (continual) somatics have their root in force of one kind or another. In that the handling of things with bodies involves force to greater or lesser degree, in-capability and derangement of mental values is proportional to the thetan’s objection to force. This objection descends down to a wish to stop things. It goes below that into over-whelmedness in which propitiation and obsessive agreement manifest themselves. LOW TAs The low TA is a symptom of an overwhelmed being. When a pc’s TA goes low he is being overwhelmed by too heavy a process, too steep a gradient in applying processes or by rough TRs or invalidative auditing or auditing errors. A low TA means that the thetan has gone past a desire to stop things and is likely to behave in life as though unable to resist real or imaginary forces. HIGH TA Chronically high TAs mean the person can still stop things and is trying to do so."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"WHAT THE C/S IS DOING 2 HCOB 16.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 74 16.12.09 However, all one has to do is restimulate and leave unflat an engram chain to have a high TA. High TA is reflecting the force contained in the chain. An „over-run“ means doing something too long that has engrams connected with it which means an engram chain with too many engrams on it being restimulated by life or au-diting. Hence Over-run. If this overrun persisted unhandled eventually the pc would be overwhelmed and one, in theory, would have a low TA. MENTAL MASSES Mental masses, forces, energy are the items being handled by the C/S on any pc. If the C/S loses sight of this he can wander off the road and go into the thickets of sig-nificance. Engrams, secondaries, locks all add up to mental masses, forces, energies, time, which express themselves in countless different ways such as pain, misemotion, feelings, old percep-tions and a billion billion thought combinations buried in the masses as significances. A thetan can postulate or say or reason anything. Thus there is an infinity of signifi-cances. A thetan is natively capable of logical thought. This becomes muddied by out-points held in by mental forces such as pictures of heavy experiences. As the masses and forces accumulated and copied from living build up, the logic po-tential becomes reduced and illogical results occur. PC SEARCH The pc is continually searching for the significance of a mass or force – what is it, why is it. The C/S is easily led astray by this. All forces in the bank contain significances. All forces can be unburdened and lightened up by the various procedures of auditing. The search of the pc is for significance. The action of the C/S is reduction of forces. THE E-METER The E-Meter records what force is being discharged in every slash, fall and blowdown. The amount of TA per session is the C/S’s index of gain. Note that a discharged process no longer gives TA and gives case gain. The amount of significance recovered or realized by the pc only shows up as cogni-tions. As the TA works off the case, then one has two indicators: 1. There is needle and TA action."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"WHAT THE C/S IS DOING 3 HCOB 16.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 75 16.12.09 2. The pc cognites. One shows that force is coming off. Two shows that thought is releasing from force. BACKWARDS C/Sing If a C/S processes toward significance only he will get cases that do not progress. The needle action detects not so much significance as where the force is. Diving toward significance the C/S winds up shortening grades, looking for „magic one-shot buttons“ and overwhelming cases by shooting them on up the grades while levels remain loaded with force. RELIABLE INDICATORS When a pc gets no more TA action on Level I he will have made Level I and will know it. He will therefore attest to „No problems“. The reliable indicators are TA action and cognitions while a level is still charged. Diminished TA action and cognitions mean the purpose of the level has been reached. A feeling of freedom and expansion on a subject is expressed in a normal TA and a loose needle. The pc will now attest to an ability regained. F/N ABUSE To process only to F/N and even chop off the cognitions on a process abuses the indi-cator of the F/N. You can find many pcs who bitterly resent F/N indications. They have been: A. Not run on all the processes of a level; B. Still have force on the subject; C. Were chopped off before they could cognite. The ARC Break in this is unfinished cycle of action. The proper End Phenomena for a process is F/N Cognition VGIs. Now look at that carefully. That is the proper end phenomena of a process. It is not the end phenomena of a level or even of a type of process. Let us say there are 15 possible Scientology processes for orienting a pc in his present location. To run one of these 15 and say, „F/N that’s it. You’re complete,“ is a Quickie impa-tient action that rebounds on the pc eventually. If there are 15, run 15! Possibly the pc on no. 12 will cognite he’s really right where he is. Only then could you cease to work at it. An F/N Cog VGIs tells you a process is finished, not a whole class of actions!"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"WHAT THE C/S IS DOING 4 HCOB 16.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 76 16.12.09 Thus 2½ minutes from 0 to IV is not only impossible, it is murderous. It will result in an overwhelm, a low TA or a high TA eventually. Level I says, amongst other things, „Problems Processes“. There are certainly half a dozen. Each would be run to F/N Cog VGIs. When these and the other processes of the Level are run, the pc will come to have no further reaction to problems and will be able to handle them. A cognition in lower levels is not necessarily an ability regained. Thirty or forty cog-nitions on one lower level might add up to (and probably would) the realization that one is free of the whole subject of the level. It is safe to run more processes. It is unsafe to run too few. PC ABILITIES It is not enough for the pc to have only negative gains of deleting force. Sooner or later he will have to begin to confront force. This comes along naturally and is sometimes aided by processes directly aimed at fur-ther confront. „What problem could you have?“ sooner or later is needed in one form or an-other. What force can the pc now handle? All auditing in a body – and any living in a body – makes a being vulnerable. Bodies break, suffer, intensify pain. Sooner or later a pc will go Exterior. The Interiorization Rundown must be ordered as the next action or you will have a pc with a high TA. 2-way comm Ext-Int must be given in a following session (not the same one) so the full cognitions will occur. After this the pc is less subject to the body and his ability to confront force will im-prove. Do not be too worried or surprised if after this the pc has some minor accident with the body. Exterior he forgets its frailty. However, such things are minor. He is „learning how to walk“ a new way and will run into chairs! He gets this figured out after a while. Pcs sometimes improve their ability to handle force while interior so as to have myste-rious headaches or new body pressures. Inevitably they have been exterior and need Interiori-zation run. They were just using too much force while still inside! Thus force is the thing, significance very secondary. Force of course is made up of time, matter, energy, flows, particles, masses, solids, liquids, gasses, space and locations. All this gets inherently handled in processes published long since. The pc tends to dive for the thought imbedded in the force. He will tell you he’s being processed to find out who his parents were or why he is sterile or who did him in, etc, etc. The C/S who chases after this is a deerhound illegally chasing mice!"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"WHAT THE C/S IS DOING 5 HCOB 16.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 77 16.12.09 C/S PURPOSE The C/S is there to make certain that the pc makes gains and attains the actual abilities of the level.

When proc-esses are fully run to EP, and each process or action of a Grade is run to the full Ability Gained, pcs get gains even beyond their expectations. Not only do they write Success Stories but they stop people in hallways and on street corners and talk about their wins. They promote and disseminate to both friends and strangers, and demand that others get auditing so that they will get the same gains too. We’ve seen this for years in Dianetics and Scientology. Anything less than this has invariably traced to misapplication or non-application of the Tech. Over the past few months, folders have been reviewed from various orgs in several parts of the world. In many of these folders there was evident quickying, and there were false declares. This is a poor show indeed, as these persons have been denied the full benefits avail-able from their processing on the Grades and other rundowns. Very often the pc doesn’t know this, and is under the impression that that is all that there is to the Grade or Level. Quickying a pc on a process or, worse yet, on a series of processes, prevents the pc from having the cog-nitions and gains that the processes would have resulted in. Falsely declaring a pc or pre-OT to be complete on a Grade or Level, not only denies gains but it also leaves the person with the false idea that there isn’t anything more to be gotten from that process, Grade or Level.

(As a technical note, these case histories are examples of cases and how they were handled. It is not intended that they serve any other purpose than to act as examples. Every case is C/Sed per the C/S Series and Grade Chart and one would never C/S or program a case without full use of all technical references covering the subject.) Case History #1: This folder arrived for review with the pc just having caused considerable upset to those around her, and feeling that she would have to blow as she wasn’t doing anything con-structive nor contributing toward the aims of Scientology. The pc had attested to Clear and up through Grade II, but these are contrary to her behaviour, and her folder was studied to find what was actually run and whether or not these processes had been completed. Prior to Scientology the pc had been hypnotized and when this came up in a session it BD’d (showing that it was heavily charged), but it had never been run out. Hence it is possi-ble that the person is still prone to dramatize whatever post-hypnotic commands were laid in during the hypnotism. (See DIANETICS: THE MODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH.) The pc had been receiving covertly hostile letters from her father which would upset and restimulate her. This means that she is in the condition of being PTS (Potential Trouble Source), and would not be able to retain the gains that she did make in auditing and training. (See THE VOLUNTEER MINISTER’S HANDBOOK and the book WHAT IS SCIENTOLOGY? There are also more mate-rials contained on the „PTS/SP DETECTION AND HANDLING COURSE“.) In early auditing, the pc was apparently in some kind of games condition with others about „how fast“ she „could get through“ the Grade and continually asserted that she felt it was all „unnecessary“ and just wanted to get on to something higher. This shows that the pc was not in session (Definition of IN SESSION: interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor), and was getting auditing for some other reason than to make case gain. (But why else would one get auditing other than to make case gain?) Had the auditor and case supervisor known their HCOBs, they would not have let this situation continue but would have found out what was going on with this pc and gotten her into session and making case gain. Instead, due to pc assertions that it was „all unnecessary“ and out of a very misguided idea that the pc would „feel invalidated“, they let the pc attest without the pc actually having been run on this action, nor having made the gains nor the Ability Gained from this action. This false declare not only did a disservice to the pc, it was also an invalidation or degrade of the action itself (as it gives the false impression that that is all there is to it). The PC had some Objective processes begun on her, but these processes were quickied too, and the poor pc, not making gains from the processes as they were not run long enough, soon started to invalidate the workability of these processes and to assert that she felt"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"EXAMPLES OF QUICKYING AND 3 HCOB 27.8.80 FALSE DECLARES CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 81 16.12.09 that they too may be unnecessary By now the PC was figure-figuring as to what was wrong with her or her case and, either on her own or suggested to her by another, hit upon the idea that she might be a Dianetic Clear. The Objective processes never were flattened nor com-pleted and so the PC didn’t get the gains available from them. (SEE HCOB 12 MAY 80 DRUGS AND OBJECTIVE PROCESSES.) The PC was then put onto a DCSI (Dianetic Clear Special Intensive) but the case supervisor erred badly here by not having studied her folders and not seeing that this PC had not been making case gain in auditing. There was no evidence in her folders to show that she may have gone Clear. And while being audited on the DCSI, the PC was confused about what the state of Clear was, as she had heard a lot of verbal data on it. The main concern was that someone else might beat her to declare on it! There was no resurgence of gains during the DCSI as there was no state of Clear to be rehabilitated. Puzzled by this the pc then hit upon the idea that it must be something else, and wondered if she could be a natural Clear, and even began to assert this to be so. On ARC Straightwire, the processes didn’t run right and the pc had a hard time doing them (of course, as by now the case had several false declares, and hadn’t run the earlier proc-esses on the Grade Chart which would have given her the ability to run these processes). A wrong conclusion was then made that the reason for the trouble was that the pc didn’t need these processes and, despite the PC not having reached the Ability Gained of that Grade, she was allowed to declare. The „success story“ was mainly to the effect that it was „good to have the action completed“, which is a very sour statement when compared to the gains and abili-ties usually achieved on ARC Straightwire. The PC got an improvement in her ability to re-call (and it would be very difficult not to get such an improvement on these processes), but that is not much compared to what could have and should have been achieved on the Grade. Grade 0 was a similar story in that the pc had difficulty doing the initial processes of the Grade and instead of the C/S realizing that this was due to earlier outnesses on the case, she was allowed to declare because by now the pc was asserting that she already had the abil-ity of Grade 0, before the Grade had been run. Due to a fear of „invalidating her reality“ or something like that, she was allowed to declare Grade 0. This of course was a very incorrect solution as the reason she couldn’t run the Grade 0 processes was not because there was no charge on them, but because the pc, not having run the earlier processes on the Grade Chart, was not up to being able to run Grade 0. The same story repeated on Grade I and on Grade II. The pc was not able to run the processes successfully, started to assert that she „had already made it before“ and was allowed to declare. Then due to her inability to communicate, inability to handle problems, and overts and withholds in life, she got involved in difficulties and made a mess of her life. This seemed puzzling to others around her, and even seemed puzzling to the auditor and C/S. But an in-spection of her earlier Grades revealed that she had not attained them, and had dropped down to pretending Grades and states not attained. The handling for a case in this condition is already covered in the C/S (Case Supervi-sor) Series HCOBs – especially C/S Series 1-10.

The first session after this folder study was a light two-way communication session of the level of Life Repair, and it changed the course of the pc’s entire life and future for the better. Case History #2: This pc had hardly had any auditing at all, had attested to Native State, Serenity of Be-ingness, Static, Natural Clear, Cleared Theta Clear, Clear OT, and all Grades at once in a mul-tiple declare. (Definition of Multiple Declare: declaring Grades 0 to IV all at one time mostly without any mention of the end phenomena of the Grade. Technical Dictionary) All of the above declares were found to be false in that the pc by folder inspection had not in fact attained any of them, and didn’t even understand the meaning of some of these states, except in a dim sort of manner. The pc had consistently from early on in her auditing asserted that she had already at-tained the Grade before the process had been run, that each process was unnecessary, and was in fact on a heavy status kick. (Note that the necessity to assert that one has already made it, before the process has been run, is actually an unwillingness to permit anything to have an effect on self, and an attempt to be total cause. This is low on the Effect Scale. See SCIENTOLOGY: 0-8.) Several of the Case Supervisors on this pc’s case had permitted her to declare or attest to these states through their own mis-understoods on estimating a pc’s case level, and out of the mistaken idea that it would be bet-ter not to upset the pc by not permitting these false declares. In actual fact, these errors denied the pc most of the case gain that she could have gotten, and must have resulted in an attitude that there wasn’t much to get out of auditing. The pc’s actual auditing history started with two flubbed sessions on Dianetics, after which the pc started to assert that she must be a Dianetic Clear (as she wasn’t able to run R3RA). This of course is not the basis for deciding that someone is Clear! The reason the pc was not able to run R3RA was that she had taken heavy street drugs, had not done the Purifi-cation Rundown, nor had she been audited on Objective processes. The pc was not yet up to being able to confront a mental image picture. Yet someone suggested to her that her next step was the AO! The pc was falsely declared Natural Clear and other states and has not run a single process in session since, but „rabbits“. (Definition of Rabbit: A person who runs from everything including his bank. Technical Dictionary) The pc had the misfortune of having auditors and case supervisors who felt that they had to „validate“ her, but were in fact validating the bank, not the being. There was an attempt to run ARC Straightwire, but the processes that were run were quickied and not all the processes of the Grade were run, but the pc was permitted to declare it complete."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"EXAMPLES OF QUICKYING AND 5 HCOB 27.8.80 FALSE DECLARES CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 83 16.12.09 After this the pc started to consider that Grades 0-IV would probably be unnecessary too, though she hadn’t had any of these run. (A person who has been declared complete on a Grade not run and not attained could easily start to get the idea that all Grades were not „nec-essary“ or that he might not get anything out of them either.) The pc started to originate that she wanted to do the OT Levels next (without Grades), probably in the desperate hope that somewhere on the Grade Chart she would make a case gain, and became fixed on the idea that the answer bad to lie higher up on the Grade Chart. Then the pc originated that maybe she had had all the Grades in her last life. The pc had no recall of having been audited on any of these processes in her last life, and attributed it to „knowingness“. And then the pc had a non-standard, out tech session to „rehabilitate her last life releases“. Although no processes were recalled and no release point could be found, the pc was assumed to have run and released on all the Grade 0-IV processes in her last lifetime and was declared „Grades Release“. (A viola-tion of HCOBs and policy on Multiple Declare.) (Note: This does not mean that it is not possible for a person to have been audited on the early Dianetic and Scientology procedures in last lifetime. Several cases have been found where the person was in Dianetics and Scientology in the last lifetime. Such cases respond quite differently than the case described above, and processes run in such last life auditing can be found and either flattened, or rehabbed if they were run to release. These respond to the usual standard actions, in the standard way.) The pc was gotten through the Purification RD and she was going to start the Survival Rundown, but because she thought that her next step was OT Levels, she went into a protest about it. The handling for such a case is to clean up any protest and assertions, including get-ting off any withhold about having pretended Grades or states not attained, and do the Sur-vival Rundown. When the effects of drugs have been fully handled on the case, then get the pc back onto and up the Grade Chart per C/S Series 1-10. It isn’t difficult to do. It’s a matter of standardly applying the Tech, running each process to its end phenomena, and not omitting any. Then the pc will get all the case gains the Tech, as it will have been applied. In subsequent sessions a SCN CS-l was started, and although a CS-1 had been „done before“ in about 30 mins, common rudiments terms and the word „Scientology“ were found to be misunderstoods and clearing these produced TA action and had pc interest. Case History #3: This case had not had any Grades. He had done the Purification Rundown and had had some very quickied Objective processes. After this the case supervisor was concerned that he was not a product. He was programmed for and given extensive reviews. During these reviews the pc continued to figure-figure about his case and auditing and wonder what was wrong. The reason for this is that he was now being audited on subjective or thinkingness processes, over unflat Objective processes. Case-wise he was not able yet to confront and handle mental image pictures. So these various repair actions such as a C/S 53,"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"EXAMPLES OF QUICKYING AND 6 HCOB 27.8.80 FALSE DECLARES CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 84 16.12.09 ruds on various subjects and Prepchecks were all too steep a gradient and were not addressing what was wrong with the case. Folder study showed that he had only been run on CCHs 1-4 for 1 hr, 23 mins, S-C-S on an object for 0:30 mins, S-C-S on the body for 0:23 mins, SOP 8-C for 0:25 mins, Op Pro by Dup for 1 hr 20 mins. He exhibited the case characteristic of figure-figuring, which the Objective processes would have handled. The handling for this case was to fly his rudiments and then put him through the Sur-vival Rundown. This way the pc will get the Objective processes flattened, giving him the full gains available from them, including coming up out of figure-figure and being able to con-front and as-is mental charge. (See 1957 HCOBs on Objective processes and the book, CREATION OF HU-MAN ABILITY.) Case History #4: Another case who had had quickied Objectives on the Survival RD and frequently red-tagged thereafter. Extensive efforts to repair the case using subjective or thinkingness proc-esses wore not working, and folder inspection revealed both quickied Objectives and figure-figure. The handling for this case was simply to do the Survival RD Correction List (which revealed that the pc had thought his Objectives were unflat all along), and then get these run and flattened on the Survival Rundown, which he immediately started making gains on. Case History #5: This is the case of a person who had been supervising some of the cases above. His case was looked into to find out if there was any similar out tech on his case. His own Objectives had been quickied too. (CCHs 1-4, 0:20 mins; CCH 5, 0:15 mins; CCH 6, 0:10 mins; and so on) He had been declared natural Clear (although he wasn’t), and had attested to Clear OT (also a false declare). He was on his OT Levels, but he shouldn’t have been allowed to start on Advanced Courses as his case had not been properly set up for these. Consequently he didn’t run well on OT Levels, and frequently ran into BPC in these Solo sessions. Instead of getting the BPC cleaned up by using the appropriate correction list, the Solo auditor and the case supervisor went unusual, and did what is called „rabitting“. He did not run OT II to its end phenomenon, but got the idea that he may have completed it already and might be overrunning it, as an ex-planation for the difficulty. But he had not run well on the Level and had BPC. He was given a consultation about it, and F/Ned on the idea of relief about getting off the Level and was permitted to declare. But this is not an F/N on the Level itself. On OT III, he had even more difficulty, and only did four sessions which is extremely quickied. In the last session he started altering the procedure and ended up quite confused and"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"EXAMPLES OF QUICKYING AND 7 HCOB 27.8.80 FALSE DECLARES CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 85 16.12.09 massy. Once again an incorrect assumption was made that the cause of the difficulty was due to having already completed and overrun the Level. The actual BPC was not handled as the appropriate correction list was not done, and he was allowed to attest to OT III after a „rehab“ of something that was not the end phenomenon for the Level. The folder thereafter is a succession of difficulties, illnesses and complaints of not do-ing well, both personally and on post. He dramatized the quickie impulse on pcs and students that he was supervising. Regarding his own case he had gotten into the frame of mind that what was wrong with him must belong on the next Level up. The handling for this case was to indicate and cancel the false declares. Then get him through the Non Interference Zone (C/S Series 73 THE NO-INTERFERENCE AREA), so that he can then get the outnesses on his case fully handled, and a Return Program done that would include the Survival Rundown (as he has done the Purification Rundown), the OT Drug Rundown, then full case repair per C/S Series 95 „FAILED“ CASES, and unflat Grades or Levels then taken to the full end phenomena and full abilities gained, per the Grade Chart. The case was returned to Solo on OT III and started making progress again. Case History #6: This pc had earlier had some of the Objective processes run but some of these were quickied. She had had quickied Grades 0-IV. She had attested to natural Clear, and had some-how gotten the idea that she was ready for Solo and OT Levels. Subsequently she had done the Purification Rundown, and was about to start the Survival Rundown but balked as she thought it might not be necessary and that she might be able to persuade someone to let her just start Solo and OT Levels (without being set up for them). There was just one thing both-ering her – she was introverted much of the time, and having difficulties with someone in her environment. (Introversion would have been handled by Objective processes run to their end phenomena, and interpersonal relations, especially the ability to communicate, are handled on the Grades.) The handling on this case was to repair a misrun process that had been interjected into her earlier Objectives, and to handle the protest about misrun Objectives, which resulted in quite a win for the pc. Then the unflat Objective processes would be flattened (but those that had been run to EP would not be run again), followed by an Scn Drug RD, repair and comple-tion of Grades 0-IV to their full Abilities Gained. Then this person could go onto Solo, prop-erly set up and would get all the wins available from OT Levels. ____________________ By contrast the following two case histories illustrate the difference it makes when Scientology Tech is fully and correctly applied.

Then the Survival Rundown was done with each process actu-ally run to its EP, and a very good result on the Survival Rundown. Following this the pc was begun on a standard NED program. He is currently on his NED Drug Rundown and doing very well. Several of the R3RA sessions ran for 3-4 hours which is not uncommon in well run Dianetic chains. But each chain was correctly run to its full EP of F/N, VGIs, Cognition, Era-sure and the basic postulate blown. The first NED session completely changed the pc’s life and his outlook about it, for the better. Currently the pc is winning in both auditing and life and making gains every session. Case History #8: This case had had quickied Objectives, followed by numerous „repairs“ – which of course didn’t repair anything. Then the pc did the Purification Rundown to its EP, the Survival Rundown (during which all the earlier quickied Objectives were fully flattened), and then was begun on NED. This case, too, is making huge gains and resurgences in every session on NED. The chains are being run to their full EP and the pc is well on the way up and out of the conditions he was in prior to Scientology. He is making great case gain every session. And that’s the way it should be! ____________________ It must be noted that while each of the cases who had been quickied and/or falsely de-clared on states not attained had missed out on the full gains available from their processing, each of these still had made some gain. So powerful is the Technology of Scientology that it has to be very misapplied (or not applied at all) to get a „no results“ situation. Some of those cases didn’t even know what gains they were missing out on! But getting just some gains is not our business. Dianetics and Scientology produce fabulous results when fully applied.

Knowing what factors have led to quickying and false declares enables both Tech/Qual personnel and Executives to be on guard against them. It gives examples of handlings that have been done successfully on Tech/Qual person-nel and the results, and provides a list of references that can be used by anyone encountering Quickying and False Declares, and enables you to help Keep Scientology Working. „2WC-ING TO EP” „2WC-ing to EP” is really an expression of an impossibility, as one cannot „2WC a process to its EP“. It means that instead of running the process to its EP, somebody rabbited, stopped running the process, and tried to get the EP of the process by 2WC-ing. Yet the only thing that will get the EP of the process is continuing to run the process until its EP is reached. Trying to „2WC Objectives to EP“ is covered in HCOB 19 Mar 78 QUICKIE OBJEC-TIVES, but there are still instances of this showing up in folders. Sometimes it is called „veri-"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"HOW TO HANDLE THE QUICKIE IMPULSE 2 HCOB 28.8.80 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 88 16.12.09 fying“ or „rehabbing“ Objectives. The only valid EP on an Objective process is when that process has been run and continued until its EP has been reached while running that process. In earlier years auditors would never have thought of starting to run an Objective proc-ess and then putting the pc on the meter to 2WC or discuss the process, get an F/N, and call that the EP of the process. The same holds true for other processes as well. On repetitive processes, it is the proc-ess that is run to its FP. Not a 2WC or discussion of the process to an F/N. That’s an entirely different F/N. It’s an F/N on a discussion, not an F/N on the process! There have even been examples of a person Solo auditing on an OT Level, and with-out any EP having been attained in the actual Solo auditing on that Level, the person given a consultation and „2WCed“ to an F/N and this considered the EP. But it is not the EP of the Level, nor was such an F/N attained while running the Level. (Lest anyone get the wrong idea, an F/N isn’t the EP for any Solo Level anyway.) But, there have been instances of this sort of thing occurring and the Pre-OT sent to declare. That is of course a quickied Level and a false declare. It is the reason there are persons who are „OT III“ yet can’t communicate, have prob-lems, get easily overwhelmed, etc., etc. HCOB 20 Nov 73 Issue II, C/S Series 89, F/N WHAT YOU ASK OR PROGRAM is a key reference. The main technical violation described above is „changing the process“, or „failure to flatten a process“, and is actionable per HCO PL 19 Apr 65 ETHICS – TRAINING AND PROC-ESSING REGULATIONS. (It is also a breach of the Auditor’s Code.) The same rule of course is true when rehabbing. You can’t rehab a process that hasn’t been run to EP, as there is no EP on the process to rehab. Often one sees in folders an auditor „2WC“ a process, get an F/N on the 2WC, and consider that the process has been rehabbed. If the process has been run, and the EP occurred while running the process, then that EP on that process could be rehabbed. LACK OF R-FACTOR Lack of sufficient R-Factor can put a pc into mystery about a process or why it is be-ing run. Thus the pc is not fully in-session on the process, may protest it, or even start assert-ing that it is unnecessary. And sometimes pcs have already been given false or confusing „R-Factors“ by friends or acquaintances spouting Verbal Tech about processes they know noth-ing about. The most basic R-Factor is the Gradation Chart, and copies of these should be on dis-play and made known to preclears. HCOB 5 Apr 69 (reissued 26 May 70), NEW PRECLEARS – THE WORKABILITY OF SCIENTOLOGY, is to be applied to educate the public. And very importantly, a thorough Dn CS-1, and a thorough Scn CS-1, must be done on preclears, as neglect of these actions results in a preclear being audited over misunderstoods, which is a Code Break."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"HOW TO HANDLE THE QUICKIE IMPULSE 3 HCOB 28.8.80 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 89 16.12.09 EVALUATIVE, SUGGESTIVE OR „LEADING“ QUESTIONS Evaluative, suggestive or „leading“ questions are all breaches of the Auditor’s Code, Clause #1, as they are both: (a) Evaluation, and (b) telling the preclear what to think about his case. While most auditors do not evaluate outright, there have been recent instances of audi-tors evaluating covertly by asking the pc suggestive or „leading“ questions, feeding cogni-tions or EPs under the guise of „clearing definitions“ or „showing the pc references“. When this is done with the intention or result of telling the pc what to think about his case, or with the intention or result of feeding a cognition or EP, it is Evaluation, is a breach of the Audi-tor’s Code and is actionable in Ethics. One notorious SP even fed confidential data to a lower level pc, under the guise of „references“ and „clearing words“! That is an extreme case of this and is suppressive. But sometimes auditors are tempted to „help“ the pc by evaluation or suggestion. Not only does it not help the pc, it is not Scientology, and is akin to what was done in earlier de-structive mental practices. The way to get cognitions and EPs on cases is by running the process, Grade or Level. And if you are trying to rehab a process or state, if the pc had the EP or cognition while run-ning the process, he will know about it. Otherwise the pc didn’t have the cognition or EP and there is nothing to rehab. NOT CLEANING UP BPC OR ASSERTIONS If you by-pass charge on a case and fail to clean it up the PC will become less and less in-session, may try to find ways to get out of the session or process, or in extreme – blow the session. Pcs audited over by-passed charge often start protesting or asserting and it is a grave mistake to rabbit from handling this by seeking to pass it off as „process over-run“, „by-passed a win“ or „by-passed a state“, when those are not true. The only solution is to handle the truth, and if it is by-passed charge or protest or assertion, then that is what will handle it. The most extreme version of this is asserting that the process „isn’t necessary“ or that the per-son „had already made it“ without the process having been run at all It is sometimes necessary to clean up all the protests, assertions and considerations that the pc has had (or has gotten from others), in order to get the pc into session. But if that is needed to get the pc to run the process (and get the gains from it!), then it must be done. Oth-erwise it would violate the three basic laws from DIANETICS: THE ORIGINAL THESIS, as a pc asserting or protesting is contrary to „pc plus auditor is greater than the bank“. It sure is a fast way to false declares though, to rabbit from BPC by failing to repair it and flatten the process. And when there is no EP on running the process, pretending that there was or that the pc must be a „natural Clear“, is no answer at all. Only finding and handling the correct BPC will handle.

LOWERED TECHNICAL INTEGRITY This whole matter of quickying and false declares comes down to an ethics situation on the part of those who did it, those who condoned it and those especially who did nothing about it. Enquiries into why the various C/Ses and auditors, Examiners and Dir Vals and other Tech/Qual personnel either quickied processes or whole Grades, sent people to falsely declare or went along with these, revealed the following: a) Some claimed that they didn’t know what else to do if the pc asserted he didn’t need a process or Grade or asserted that he had already made it or that he wanted to declare to a particular state. (Yet the answer to this is contained in C/S Series 1-10, 46, HCO PL 31 Jul 65 PURPOSES OF THE QUALIFICATIONS DIVISION and the HCO PLs in part 2 of OEC Vol 5, the KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING Section.) As these issues are broadly known amongst Tech/Qual personnel it is really more an inability to confront a preclear and his reactions (= out TR 0). b) Another reason given was „not wanting to ARC break or upset the preclear“ and/or feeling that they „had to ‘validate’ the pc“. This reason was quite common. While it is under-standable, it is very short-sighted as it ARC breaks a person much more to be left in an unflat process, in an incomplete Grade or hung up in a false declare. (See HCO PL 26 Oct 71 TECH DOWNGRADES.) As this is already adequately covered in policy and HCOBs, this reason too is really an inability to confront a preclear and his reactions (= out TR 0). c) The most common reason given is because „everyone else is doing it“ and varia-tions of that such as „if we don’t let them quickie and skip Grades and Levels or don’t let them attest to these weird states, they’ll go to another org who will! and so on. One can find many variations of justifying compromised Technical Integrity, and selling the results of Sci-entology down the drain, just because some other person has done so or is doing it! This too is an inability to confront and an inability to hold a position (= out OT TR 0). Also per HCOB 3 Feb 79 Issue II CONFRONT TECH HAS TO BE PART OF THE TR CHECKSHEET, „The inability to confront is basically caused by withholds and where a person cannot be drilled into confronting, he has to have his withholds pulled.“ The dwindling spiral exposed here is that Tech/Qual personnel with withholds (espe-cially Tech O/Ws) (1) lose their ability to hold a position and confront (2) lower their Techni-cal Integrity further by doing or condoning Out Tech (3) develop more withholds, and thus due to a lowered ability to confront (4) lower their Technical Integrity further and so on. Just because others have gone down this route is no reason to follow them! The solution is very easy and obvious. Get off their Tech O/Ws and get all Tech/Qual personnel through the Professional TRs Course, Upper Indocs, Objective processes and a Drug RD."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"HOW TO HANDLE THE QUICKIE IMPULSE 5 HCOB 28.8.80 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 91 16.12.09 EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITY Any executive who thinks that the quality of Tech in his org doesn’t have anything to do with him, ought to take a look at what products his org produces and exchanges with its public. And he should study HCO PL 26 May 61 (reissued 21 Jun 67), QUALITY COUNTS and HCO PL 25 Jan 80 EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE. Of what value are Paid Comps if they are false declares? COMPULSION TO „VALIDATE“ One of the most common reasons found for a person permitting and agreeing to quickying and false declares could be described as a compulsion to „validate“ others. So when a pc mistakenly asserts that he feels that a process is „overrun“ or is „unnecessary“ or that he „had already made it before the process or Grade was even run“, (or even suggests that he had „run all the Grades or OT Levels last lifetime“), auditors and C/Ses who are inclined toward propitiation could make the big mistake of „validating“ a lie, rather than maintaining their Technical Integrity. The answer to this is contained in C/S Series 46, DECLARES, in HCO PL 31 Jul 65, PURPOSES OF THE QUALIFICATIONS DIVISION and in HCO PL 20 Nov 65, THE PROMOTIONAL ACTIONS OF AN ORGANIZATION (under the section on Qual Div 5). The word „valid“ means: „sound; fulfilling all the necessary conditions“, so it is not possible to validate something that isn’t true. It simply adds another lie or alter-is to the case. TECH/QUAL PERSONNEL WITH THE SAME OUT TECH ON OWN CASE It is an observed fact that a person can tend to dramatize the Out Tech on his own case, on others. A person does not always do so though, as such a dramatization is pretty low toned and also certainly never has been an extenuating circumstance. But all too often when an auditor or case supervisor or examiner has been involved in a false declare or quickying, an inspection of that person’s folders has revealed that he/ she was quickied and had often falsely attested to Grades, Levels and states. Thus, not having made real case gains themselves and operating over a pretense of Grades or Levels not attained, they haven’t even got a subjective reality themselves of the fabulous wins and gains available from processing. This tends to lessen the overt of denying others gains through quickying and false declares. The handling is to get such a person’s own integrity in, cancel the false declares, get the case repaired and honestly making case gain and moving up the Grade Chart. Tech and Qual personnel are also required to make good case gain themselves, and failed cases and no-case-gain cases should be handled before being allowed on Tech/Qual lines, if allowed on Tech/Qual lines at all."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"HOW TO HANDLE THE QUICKIE IMPULSE 6 HCOB 28.8.80 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 92 16.12.09 SOMEONE ELSE PROGRAMMING THE CASE „To people who have no personal reality on the results of processing it is especially easy to be „reasonable“ about no results. „The public is not result conscious.“ (HCO PL 26 Oct 71 TECH DOWNGRADES) There have been many examples of the above in recent folders where the pc’s insis-tence was simply on being allowed to declare and get onto the next Grade or Level without any real result, and, even worse, where the pc’s insistence was that he be allowed to skip stan-dard Grades or processes on the basis that these were „unnecessary“! This is the pc C/Sing or programming his own case. Sometimes registrars have gotten into C/Sing or programming the case. Examples of this are registrars suggesting that the pc might be a Clear and thus „not need“ New Era Dianetics, or that the Grades might not be „necessary“, or that the person „doesn’t need“ any case set-up before a major Grade or Level. There have also been instances of games condi-tions between orgs on special deals and promising quickie by „arranging“ for the pc to get quickie Grades instead of Expanded Grades, so that the pc could „get through in less hours of auditing“. Of course these examples are both Out Tech and cut the Registrar’s and org’s stats in the long run, as well as doing a disservice to Tech/Qual personnel and the pc. Registrars are forbidden to C/S or program cases by HCO PL 28 Sep 71, SELLING AND DELIVERING AUDIT-ING. I have also seen and heard of some pcs resorting to using a control mechanism of „If you ... I will red-tag“, „...get my auditing at another org“, etc. Such a person is not being self-determined but is acting at the dictates of his bank and trying to get others to do so too. (Under those circumstances both the person’s motivation and earlier Out Tech on the case should be looked into and handled right away.) If Tech/Qual personnel do not hold their ground and stick to their HCOBs, they can go effect and even PTS to such demands and give in to quickie, false declares and betraying the trust placed in them. Cases are C/Sed and programmed by case supervisors in accordance with Standard Tech, never by the demands of pcs, registrars or executives. An org can become sloppy as there is no visible demand for results. There is only an invisible hope. And a definite reaction when they don’t occur. We can and do achieve results beyond anyone’s hopes. So long as we continue to do this our area control will expand. When we don’t it will contract. SAMPLE CRAMMING ORDERS ISSUED The Cramming Orders issued on the various Tech/Qual personnel are published here as samples of Cramming Orders that may be used to handle Quickying and False Declares. Cramming Order #1:"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"HOW TO HANDLE THE QUICKIE IMPULSE 7 HCOB 28.8.80 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 93 16.12.09 This was issued on the auditors, C/Ses and Examiner responsible for declares of vari-ous states such as: Natural Clear, Clear-OT, „Past Life Grades Release“ (a multiple declare) and at the time when the folder was inspected a declare of „overall Objective EP“ was being considered. This was a case that had not done any OT Levels, or Grades, and had had very little auditing. There had been a non-standard „rehab“, in that no process was rehabbed nor was any specific release point found to be rehabbed.

(Cramming Order #1 above). I got Comm Eved and removed from post back in April and I got pretty stuck into it. I realized the main thing that stuck me was that I never got a correct technical indication of what I did wrong. „But the indication of a whole broad scene of quickying pcs and false declares was the why at the time. And I did deserve the Comm Ev. I was not able to end cycle on it until now. But as a result of the Cram and resultant corrections all the pieces fell into place and my cer-tainty and responsibility are back.“ ___________________ „This Cram changed my whole viewpoint as a Tech person and indicated to me the major out tech in this entire area. „Also I spotted when I first ran up against this whole body of data regarding false de-clares.“ ___________________ „The first thing about ‘states’ and falsely declaring states I realized, is that it is a symptom of a quicky, druggy ‘age’ in which anyone who can’t confront something experi-ences a huge ‘keyout’ similar to a false drug high and goes off to attest to some super state such as ‘Totally at cause over the universe’. The fact is that the original false data got laid into this society by the drug culture which promoted the benefits of being ‘spaced-out’ (i.e.,"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"HOW TO HANDLE THE QUICKIE IMPULSE 10 HCOB 28.8.80 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 96 16.12.09 out of PT), due to the poisons in the body. ‘Elation’ as an Awareness Level is way down be-low ‘Hallucination’. So there is a societal tendency toward ‘feeling high’ rather than face re-ality. I first ran into this in college, when I was first exposed to the drug society. „Recently I seem to have picked up a lot of False Data on ‘by-passed states’ as the key case remedy. A pc who was in trouble was thought to have ‘undeclared states’ , which is an alter-is of a proper rehab of a real release. I saw one ‘state attained’ declared as ‘Perfection as a Being’. This crept into my thinking that unless you declare a lot of states on a pc, the pc would bog. „I see now that this in effect has prevented pcs from running processes. A pc at the lower level of the Effect Scale, would be most likely to want to declare huge states as an ef-fort to blow from the bank!“ ___________________ „I feel more honest as a Tech person and have learned that if you align the data (Chart of Human Evaluation, Effect Scale), you will see the real scene. „I blew some False Data and cleared up misunderstoods that made me afraid to ‘in-validate someone’. But if you’re honest and call it like it is, that is the only way. „I had a lot of realizations and a lot of Basic Tech aligned for me. I feel more certain about handling cases in general.“ ___________________ „I realized that you attain states and releases by doing the processes in auditing and not by rabbiting, being polite, or using PR. A good win!“ ___________________ „My own technical perceptions have increased by doing this Cram and my ethics level on the point has markedly changed as well. The point is to simply really duplicate the case and not attest states not attained as you hang the being at that point.“ ___________________ „This Cram handled a basic reasonableness for me, and it feels very good. It is clear to me why it is that you cannot keep Tech in passively, that continued diligence is the way to do this, and that any other way invites your own failure and the failure of others around you.“ ___________________ „I have been having tremendous Tech wins and results since that Cram. It came up on a GF that a process had been overrun, and when asked the PC said ‘Objectives’. From this I checked which process. I got it down to the session it was overrun in and rehabbed. It was very simple, but had I not been crammed, I may have rehabbed ‘Objectives’ and caused the case endless trouble."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"HOW TO HANDLE THE QUICKIE IMPULSE 11 HCOB 28.8.80 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 97 16.12.09 „Next I got a Grades pc who was C/Sed for Grade II to be continued. I studied the folder and saw that on Grade I the PC didn’t run anything ‘because it was all handled’ , yet on Grade II the PC had problems each session. I also noted that the PC had originated she went release on ‘Objectives’ and all Objectives on her were skipped! I sent the folder back to the C/S. „Then we went in and started from scratch. We had to flatten an unflat CCH, another Objective was unflat, and we ran the ones not run, and then got onto S-C-S (which had been run be-fore). It produced change like crazy. In the first session of S-C-S the PC went anaten, turned on circuits, couldn’t execute the command, you name it. Finally she had a big valence shift and said she felt herself now and in control! I ended there to let her have her win. „I am finally getting a real reality on what Standard Tech is all about, and how you really go about handling cases!“ ___________________ CRAMMING CAUTIONS Remember that in order to get Tech in after it has been out it may be necessary to get Ethics in first and that the purpose of Ethics is to get Tech in. HCO PL 1 Sep AD15 Issue VII, ETHICS PROTECTION. It may be necessary to get O/Ws of Quickying and of False Declares off Tech/Qual personnel and Executives involved in order to be able to effectively Cram and call a halt to these forms of Out Ethics. This can be done in an O/W write-up provided it is meter checked for completeness or it can be done in a confessional. The various Qual Corrective actions such as CRMU, Cramming Repair List and espe-cially False Data Stripping must be used where needed. ETHICS CAUTION Once Tech has gone in, the scene has reverted and Tech and Scientology are being fully applied, do not continue to take Ethics actions (as happened in one area), as Tech is now in and Scientology is being applied. TO WHOM DO THESE POLICIES APPLY? The Policies mentioned in this issue apply to every Scientologist whether pc, student, staff member or executive and they apply from here on out. It is not just up to someone else to keep Tech in and Keep Scientology Working. It is up to every Scientologist to do so.

Auditing is one of the most valuable services that there is to a being. The reason we get auditing is to make case gains and to advance up the Bridge to Clear and onward to higher states. It is therefore wise to know how not to miss out on gains from auditing. DEFINITIONS AUDITING: The application of Scientology processes and procedures to someone by a trained auditor. Auditing gets rid of unwanted barriers that inhibit, stop or blunt a person’s natural abilities as well as gradiently increasing the abilities a person has so that he becomes more able and his survival, happiness and intelligence increase enormously. (Technical Dic-tionary) CASE GAIN: The improvements and resurgences a person experiences from auditing. Any case betterment according to the pc. (Tech Dictionary) ABILITY GAIN: The pc’s recognition that pc can now do things he could not do before. (Tech Dictionary) QUICKIE: In the dictionary you will find „Quickie also quicky: something done or made in a hurry. Also: a hurriedly planned and executed program (as of studies).“ Anything that does not fully satisfy all requirements is quickie. So „quickie“ really means „omitting actions for whatever reason that would satisfy all demands or requirements and doing something less"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"HOW NOT TO MISS OUT ON GAINS 2 HCOB 29.8.80 FROM YOUR AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 100 16.12.09 than could be achieved.“ In short a quickie is not doing all the steps and actions that could be done to make a perfect whole. (Technical Dictionary) QUICKIE GRADES: A derogatory term denoting grades „run“ without all the processes of the grades each to full end phenomena thus reducing the effectiveness of Scientology by fail-ure to apply it properly. (Technical Dictionary) END RESULT FOR A GRADE (OR LEVEL): A cognition in lower levels is not necessarily an ability regained. Thirty or forty cognitions on one lower level might add up to (and probably would) the realization that one is free of the whole subject of the level. It is safe to run more processes. It is unsafe to run too few. (HCOB 16 JUN 70 WHAT THE C/S IS DOING) RELEASE REHABILITATION ERROR: The most laughable error commonly being made in Release Rehabilitation is one in which the auditor discounts the value of his own auditing, keys out a lock in a pre-Scientology period and tells the pc he was a Release sometime before he was audited. Of course if you key out a major lock you may today get a Release State. The pc today, with better understanding through auditing, can attain Release by keying out an in-cident which made him worse than normal. I’ve never seen a „natural floating needle“ in the absence of auditing. I never expect to. (HCOB 7 NOV 65 RELEASE REHABILITATION ERROR) WHY QUICKIE? The reasons why people get into quickying are covered in the HCOBs and HCO PLs on the subject of „Quickying“ as listed under the title of this issue. The individual reasons found on some cases studied recently are as follows. „LACK OF TIME“ In a desperate race to get up the Grade Chart by yesterday, some persons have thought they didn’t have time to run all the processes and grades on the way. Unfortunately if one does not follow and run each of the processes and actions as developed, one never does get up the Grade Chart. The Grade Chart shows the processes, actions and the sequence of these, that enable a person to climb from aberrated humanoid up through Clear to OT. This has never, throughout the many trillenia of the whole track, been possible until the techniques and the route out of aberration and up to OT were developed in Dianetics and Scientology. Now the whole track is very long indeed and so it is no wonder that after so long, long a period of aberration, people are eager to get Clear and OT. And in fact this is the normal or natural state for a thetan to be in anyway, so of course all want to get back up to those states. But if you omitted Tech in the interests of speed and carried this to the extreme, then you would end up getting nowhere, even though it didn’t take you any time! Actually in view of the length of the whole track and the fact that until Dianetics and Scientology it never was possible to attain the state of Clear or OT, it is really a very fast route indeed – it only takes a few years in one lifetime!"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"HOW NOT TO MISS OUT ON GAINS 3 HCOB 29.8.80 FROM YOUR AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 101 16.12.09 The states of Clear and OT are so desirable, so well worth achieving, and so infinitely preferable to staying aberrated, that any time spent on actually and factually attaining these states is very well worth it. STATUS Sometimes people get into a wrong importance about status by desiring to be better than or beat someone else. When this affects one’s auditing and case progress it is a very mis-placed importance indeed. Auditing is not a game of beating someone else, nor of attesting to a higher state than someone else. Auditing could be said to be a game of beating the bank or one’s case, and a game of getting better and increasing one’s abilities. Getting auditing with the purpose of trying to out-do another, or seeking to attest to a higher state than another is off-purpose, and could deny one the gains and abilities attainable from auditing. Approach auditing with the purpose of making gains and new abilities; after all, that is what the auditing is for; it is your auditing and you who will benefit. LOWER HARMONICS Many of the states on the route up through Clear and OT have lower harmonics. (For further data on this hear SHSBC lecture 6608C16 SH Spec 75, „RELEASES AND CLEARS“.) For example, a person who is unable to communicate and can’t conceive of the idea of communicating, let alone being able to do so, would in processing come up scale to a point where this person began to realize that communication exists and that it is possible and that he could become able to communicate. This in itself would be a release state. It is not Communi-cations Release as the person is not yet able to communicate. But it is a release state, and far preferable to the condition the person was in prior to the auditing. One would not declare the person a Grade 0 Release. One would continue the auditing until the person had the full abili-ties of Grade 0 – Communications Release. Similarly, a person can get quite a release in processing when he keys out sufficiently and gets the idea of what it would be like to be Clear, OT, or even gets the idea of what it would be like to attain Native State, or Static. This could be accompanied by the realization that one actually could attain these states, and this would be accompanied by a resurgence of hope about getting out of the dwindling spiral. Obviously the person has not yet attained any of these states, and should not be sent to declare or attest that he has. While it is a lower har-monic of the actual state, it is still very good that the person has achieved this heightened real-ity and hope. If the person were sent to, or allowed to, declare that he had made any of these states of Clear, OT, or Native State when he had not yet done so, then it could actually act as a stop on the person’s forward progress up the Bridge. False declares give the person the false impression that he has already made it, and so there is nothing higher to achieve! (This gives the person a very incorrect idea of the value of these states, and to others seeing this it acts as a degrade of both these states and of Scientology.)"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"HOW NOT TO MISS OUT ON GAINS 4 HCOB 29.8.80 FROM YOUR AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 102 16.12.09 The answer is not to mistake the lower harmonic for the real thing, but to recognize the difference, and acknowledge these lower harmonics or release points as they indicate pro-gress toward the real thing. Continue on with the auditing and the genuine state will be at-tained. NATURAL CLEAR AND „NATURAL OT“ In recent times there have been quite a number of people who have wondered if they might be natural Clears, and some who have thought they might be „natural OTs“. In HCOB 5 MAR 79R DIANETIC CLEAR FALSE DECLARES, it is stated: „Technically a very few thetans have never been anything but Clear.“ It should be noted that such instances are rare, so one can ask: Why then would so many people sometimes feel that they are natural Clears? To understand this one needs to understand the basic nature of a thetan. (Definition: „The awareness of awareness unit which has all potentialities but no mass, no wave-length and no location.“) (HCOB 3 Jul 59) („The person himself – not his body or his name, the physical universe, his mind, or anything else; that which is aware of being aware; the identity which is the individual. The thetan is most familiar to one and all as you.“) (Technical Dic-tionary) Before a thetan became aberrated in the first place he was an OT. (OT = Operating Thetan, definition: „highest state there is.“, Technical Dictionary) In other words he was op-erating at his full potential as a thetan. This is so much higher than the condition that people are in today, that it can be difficult to imagine what that would even be like. But, despite how far Man has come down from the natural or normal state for a thetan to be in, it never seems „normal“ or „natural“ for him to be aberrated either. After all he is basically himself, a thetan. During processing when a preclear gets rid of an aberration, he returns that much more toward being fully himself again, and it always seems perfectly natural to him to be this way. It is more natural, too! For example, if a preclear had an aberration of „being afraid of the water“ and this was so strong that the person felt extremely restimulated at the sight of a river, then in auditing the preclear got rid of this aberration, it would not seem anything but normal or natural for the person to now feel at ease about or even like the sight of a river. The person correctly knows that this is the natural way for a thetan to be. But that doesn’t mean that he was always this way – he wasn’t until that auditing session in which the aberration was han-dled! Similarly, when a person goes Clear, it seems perfectly natural for him to be Clear, and it is. As a Clear does not dwell on earlier misfortunes, it can often seem that he or she „has always been this way“. Thus it is not at all unusual for a person to consider that he/she is a natural Clear. It certainly is natural for the person to be Clear, and it is closer to the thetan’s original state. But here again it doesn’t mean that the Clear was always this way."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"HOW NOT TO MISS OUT ON GAINS 5 HCOB 29.8.80 FROM YOUR AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 103 16.12.09 So it is not uncommon for a Clear to go through a period of feeling that he/she has „always been Clear“. It requires a slightly higher awareness to also be aware that it wasn’t always that way, and that usually comes a little later on. None of this means of course that anyone should contradict or invalidate someone for feeling that he is a natural Clear, nor to try to change his mind about it. It doesn’t make any difference to his auditing program either, as all do the steps and actions on the Grade Chart, anyway. The main point is whether the person is Clear or not. Going Clear is a very important point, and a very valuable achievement, both for the person himself, and as a validation of Dianetic and Scientology processing. PRETENDING Pretending, while an ability, is a low scale activity and usually accompanied by with-holds, even if it is only the withhold that one is pretending. There have been instances of a pc resorting to pretending to have had a cognition (sometimes someone else’s cognition that was told to the pc) or pretending to have attained a grade or state not really attained. The only person who actually suffers from this is the pc – and then, only until the truth of the matter is made known. It can and has prevented case gain. One of the early maxims of Scientology is: „If it is true for you, it is true for you.“ Pre-tending violates this, as one really knows that it isn’t true. It is far better to get off the withholds of pretending gains or states and any other with-holds on the case, as then real case gains can be made. MONEY OR ECONOMICS Some have thought that the faster they got through their auditing, the cheaper it would be. This is actually a false economy. Quickied auditing and false declares invariably result in a case bog sooner or later. Then, it is not only necessary to repair or review the quickied au-diting, but it is also necessary to correctly run and flatten the processes, grades and levels that were missed or quickied. By experience with many cases, it is invariably cheaper to do it thoroughly the first time. FOLLOWING A BAD EXAMPLE On some cases studied the pc actually started wanting to quickie or assert states not truly attained, by copying the bad example set by others. In some areas this has led to quicky-ing and such attests becoming popular or the thing to do. Just because one person insists and asserts having attained the „state“ of „perfection as a being on all Dynamics“ (while acting in a most aberrated manner) or wants to attest to being a „natural superliterate“ without doing the study course (in actual fact the person was having trouble studying and sought to get out of confronting learning how to study) or says he’s „at-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"HOW NOT TO MISS OUT ON GAINS 6 HCOB 29.8.80 FROM YOUR AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 104 16.12.09 tained“ the state of natural Clear, or that he or she did all the Grades and OT levels last life-time, or is already full OT and doesn’t need to go up the Grade Chart; none of these is a valid reason why anyone else should follow such a bad example, and get their cases messed up too! Of course when one hears that others are zipping through their processes or grades in very little time, one could get the idea that he or she is slow case gain, or at least that there is something wrong with himself or herself, by comparing speed of progress with others. It is an incorrect comparison as each process does in fact take as long as it takes on each case, and this is a variable. The actual end phenomena of the processes and Abilities Gained of Grades are not variable, and it is these which the processes and grades are run for. The actual mechanism of feeling bad or inferior due to others falsely claiming states or grades or abilities, is described in HCOB 18 DEC 57 PSYCHOSIS, NEUROSIS AND PSYCHIA-TRISTS. The whole point here is that it is an error to base one’s own reality regarding his case or auditing on what another or others do – far better to be true to oneself. VERBAL DATA There have been examples of some persons doing the severe disservice of feeding cognitions or end phenomena to others, despite how illegal and actually suppressive this is. Such recipients who are dishonest may think that they can then reiterate it themselves in order to get out of running a process or in order to be allowed to attest. It can make matters more difficult for Tech and Qual personnel as they have to deter-mine whether the pc has had the cognition himself or whether another told it to him. It is even a disservice to a person honestly trying to get auditing for case gain as it can then give him cause to wonder whether he is having the cognition himself or whether it is because he has already been told what it is. And very often persons who are low enough to feed cogs or EPs to others, have very poor confront and duplication themselves, thus they generally alter the cognition or end phe-nomenon anyway, and further hang others with their alter-ised version! This occurrence can be easily cleaned up and handled on a case as an Evaluation, but persons who do this should be reported to Ethics. AN UNUSUAL SOLUTION TO BPC BPC (bypassed charge) is often difficult to confront (unless one has done the Profes-sional TRs Course). One could easily prefer to blow from the BPC rather than confront it. When bypassed charge becomes severe a person can become unwilling to be audited further, and may seek to find ways to avoid the BPC or even further auditing. In some folders an unusual solution was adopted of seeking to find or assert that the process had been overrun, or was unnecessary, or that the person had already released on it or had attained some state. The hope being that by so doing the person would be able to attest to"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"HOW NOT TO MISS OUT ON GAINS 7 HCOB 29.8.80 FROM YOUR AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 105 16.12.09 something and never have to confront that session or process again. Of course this is no solu-tion as the person stays stuck in that BPC until the matter is confronted and handled. It is an established technical rule that if a process or procedure is overrun past its end phenomenon, the pc can become upset until this is established and the release point on that process is rehabilitated. But this is only where the release point or end phenomenon has oc-curred, and then been bypassed. It is an entirely different matter to consider that a process has been overrun, or „was unnecessary“, when the end phenomenon of the process has never occurred in the first place, or worse yet the process hasn’t even been run at all! This is easily detected though because if the end phenomenon hasn’t occurred, or the process hasn’t been run, then the answer is to locate and indicate the actual BPC using an appropriate correction list, and flatten the process to its full result. DRUGS Persons who have taken drugs, especially heavy street drugs or other toxic chemicals or some medicines, frequently confuse hallucinatory euphoric states of mind (sometimes known as „drug highs“ or „drug releases“), with actual states of release. This has become in-creasingly more prevalent since the early 60s, and is thoroughly covered in HCOBs on the subject of Drugs and Drug Rundowns Persons so affected by drugs can mistakenly think that they are in or have attained a very high state of existence when it is only a drug in restimulation, and because one of the effects of drugs is that of lowering the person’s ability to confront (often to a point where the person can’t confront a mental image picture at all), itis not uncommon these days to see fold-ers where persons have even considered themselves to have been released on the grades al-ready, or to be Clear or even OT, or even some invented delusory state. These of course are not backed up by the person’s performance in life. The handling is very easy. The Purification Rundown, the Survival Rundown and the Drug Rundown fully handle this phenomenon and make it possible for the person to make case gain in auditing, sometimes for the first time. LACK OF ENLIGHTENMENT Where Gradation Charts are not displayed and not in use and well known, the purpose of the various grades can become unknown. The Abilities Gained and the Inabilities Lost de-termine whether a person has attained a Grade or not. If the pc doesn’t know the Grade Chart he could be easily influenced into thinking that he had gotten all there was to get from a grade or level after one or a few processes – so great are the wins and cognitions obtained on each process. But it would be a disservice to let someone think he’d gotten it all, when he had barely scratched the surface. Gradation Charts should be well displayed, and the public enlightened on them by the registrars and other org personnel."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"HOW NOT TO MISS OUT ON GAINS 8 HCOB 29.8.80 FROM YOUR AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 106 16.12.09 IF YOU FEEL THIS APPLIES TO YOU If you feel that any of the above points apply to you or your auditing, realize that it can be handled. The first thing to do is to make it known to the Registrar in your nearest org, who will inform the Technical Division and advise you on how to get it handled. There isn’t any condition encountered in auditing that cannot be handled with 100% Standard Tech. Countless case histories and success stories demonstrate this. BLACK PR (See the definition of „Black PR“ listed under „Black Propaganda“ in the Management Dictionary.) There are the 2½% of suppressive persons who would do anything to keep Scientol-ogy from working. The only way this could be done is by preventing it from being applied, altering its processes and/or quickying them. By quickying processes, grades or levels, the pc is prevented from making the gains of that process, grade or level, and the Black PR artist can then say or imply that Scientology doesn’t work. By omitting processes, grades or levels entirely, or claiming these to be „unneces-sary“, there is an apparency that Scientology didn’t work – but it wasn’t applied at all! By falsely declaring or falsely attesting to grades or states not attained, or pretending to these, a Black PR artist belittles or degrades the actual grade or state. And by inventing strange and unusual states to declare or attest to, some have tried to make a mockery of or ridicule actual grades and states. These persons are described in HCOB 27 SEP 66 THE ANTI-SOCIAL PERSONALITY, THE ANTI-SCIENTOLOGIST and in HCO PL 7 AUG 65 SUPPRESSIVE PERSONS, MAIN CHARACTERIS-TICS OF. One of the tricks of SPs has been to talk about past lives with unreality and in such a manner as to ridicule the subject. A more recent version of this is that of pretending to have „run it all last life“ – often including of levels that weren’t even issued during the time span of the person’s last lifetime, or to pretend to states such as natural Clear or invented „states“. These are easily detected as the person while claiming to be in fantastic case shape, is by ob-servation incapable and low-toned in life. (This doesn’t mean everyone who says they were audited last lifetime as there are many who actually were.) Not everyone who has said or done these things is suppressive of course, but those persons who deliberately make a mockery of Scientology states or attainments, or who claim to have „done it all all, and it didn’t work“, will be found to be in an ethics category and should be so handled. Invariably it will turn out that not only have they not „done it all“, but usually have done very little if any of what they are claiming „didn’t work“! THE MOST OPTIMUM ROUTE The most optimum route is the Grade Chart."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"HOW NOT TO MISS OUT ON GAINS 9 HCOB 29.8.80 FROM YOUR AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 107 16.12.09 The Grade Chart today is a better bridge due to technical developments over the past year. Today’s Grade Chart consists of: • THE PURIFICATION RUNDOWN, • THE SURVIVAL RUNDOWN, • THE NED DRUG RUNDOWN (for preclears), • or, THE SCN DRUG RUNDOWN (for Clears), • FULL NED PROGRAM (for preclears), • FULL EXPANDED GRADES ARC S/W, 0-4 • POWER & POWER PLUS (for preclears), • then to an Advanced Org for Solo training and Solo levels. The new additions of the Purification Rundown and the Survival Rundown at the be-ginning of the Bridge vastly increase the amount of gains that one will get out of subsequent auditing, and on some cases, make the case auditable for the first time. Thus one not only gets gains from these and the Drug Rundown, but these actions result in greatly increased gain from auditing thereafter. While some have wondered if Expanded Grades were necessary for those who have gone Clear prior to Grades, I can assure you that they definitely are. Without full Expanded Grades it is not possible to successfully do the Solo Levels, and some might not succeed at all. Therefore Expanded Grades are a very vital part of the Bridge for both preclears and Clears alike. And when I speak of Grades, I mean fully and thoroughly audited Grades, each proc-ess fully run to its full EP, and each Grade run to the full Ability of that Grade. Only someone with other than the pc’s best interests at heart would advise skipping or skimping any of the Rundowns or Grades listed above. To do so would be to minimize the amount of gain and result from auditing. Your abilities and your freedom as a being are dependent upon getting the full results from each process, action and Grade, with no quickying and no false attests. Otherwise, in the long run it is you who would lose. I do have your best interests at heart, and I recommend that you fully do each of these Rundowns and the Expanded Grades, so that you will gain all of the priceless abilities and results being attained routinely today. As I read the glowing Success Stories and accounts of wins that Scientologists are getting today from each Grade and Level of the Bridge, I would want nothing less for you. Why settle for less? Insist on getting the most from your auditing. I have been working on and have made great strides in improving the quality of auditor TRs and metering and auditor training in gen-eral to upgrade the quality of auditing.

Pcs get bigger and more frequent wins in auditing. And now the subject of how to correctly handle auditing wins has come to the fore. Today, we are so used to pcs and pre-OTs having wins and gains in auditing as a very frequent occurrence, that it could easily be overlooked that there is an actual tech to handling them. Correct handling enhances case progress, but if one doesn’t know how to handle these correctly, it can take the edge off of results. Therefore, the correct way to handle wins and gains in auditing is well worth knowing. The most common and frequent method of handling wins is by acknowledgement. And of course the failure to acknowledge a win or gain can hang a case up. Failure to ac-knowledge is a lesser version of invalidation. A suppressive will actually invalidate case gains, but someone whose TR 2 is poor could err in failing to appropriately acknowledge. It is important that pc wins are acknowledged. An acknowledgement conveys recognition that something is what it is, and makes neither more nor less of it."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"WINS, „STATES“, AND GRADE 2 HCOB 30.8.80 CHART AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 110 16.12.09 There are varying degrees of wins. Some are bigger than others. A series of smaller wins, usually adds up to a larger win or even a major case change. All wins are valuable to pcs, but how valuable a particular win is varies from one pc to another. Major case gains are the subject of declares or attestations. When a pc completes a Grade or Level through full application of the processes, he or she is sent to declare and writes a Success Story. Declares signify completion of a Grade, Level or major Rundown. Sending a pc to „declare“ a minor win is an error as it seeks to make more out of it than there was. Failing to declare a major case change is incorrect as it makes less out of the win. The gradient of handlings of wins in auditing from small to large is: (a) acknowledging the win (TR 2), (b) having the pc write the win in a Success Story, (c) declaring the completion with an attestation and Success Story, (d) and in the case of a Persistent F/N, letting the pc have the win and not at-tempting to audit over the win, for as long as the Persistent F/N lasts.

(DICTIONARY) STATE: A mode of existence, a phase or stage, condition. (DICTIONARY) END PHENOMENA: Those indicators in the pc and meter which show that a chain or process is ended. It shows in Dn that basic on that chain and flow has been erased, and in Scn that the pc has been released on that process being run.

Thirty or forty cognitions on one lower Level might add up to (and probably would) the realization that one is free of the whole subject of the Level. It is safe to run more processes. It is unsafe to run too few.

If you audit past that you are wasting your time and processes. You have hit an „unkillable F/N“, properly called a Persistent F/N. It’s persistent at least for that day. (HCOB 8 OCT 70, C/S SERIES 20, PERSISTENT F/N) RELEASE REHABILITATION ERROR: The most laughable error commonly being made in Release Rehabilitation is one in which the auditor discounts the value of his own au-diting, keys out a lock in a pre-Scientology period and tells the pc he was a Release sometime before he was audited. Of course if you key out a major lock you may today get a Release State. The pc today, with better understanding through auditing, can at-tain Release by keying out an incident which made him worse than normal. I’ve never seen a „natural floating needle“ in the absence of auditing. I never expect to. (HCOB 7 NOV 65 RELEASE REHABILITATION ERROR) DECLARES There are two types of results from auditing that are declared. The first of these is the achievement of an ability. The second type is a new condition or state of being. The achievement of an ability is the result of a Program, Rundown, Grade or Level (of the Grade Chart). These result in a new or regained ability as a being, and/or loss of an inabil-ity. The important point regarding such declares, is that the action, such as a Rundown or Grade, must be fully completed to the full ability stated for that Rundown or Grade. Whether the pc or pre-OT has completed the Grade is very easy to ascertain. If he has the full ability of the Grade or end phenomena of the Level, without any coaching or suggestion, then he may declare. But until the pc or pre-OT has achieved the full ability, one must not order, nor may one permit, any declare. Instead the pc or pre-OT must be continued in auditing until the full results and abilities are achieved. Sometimes a pc or pre-OT achieves a new condition or state of being through auditing. An example of this is „Thetan Exterior“. The person exteriorizes from his body, and may re-main that way for a short or long period of time. The state of „Thetan Exterior“ is the subject of a declare and acknowledges or validates that achievement. It may or may not be accompa-nied by an increase of ability, but it is accompanied by an increased awareness. A „state of being“ is more a matter of subjective reality, rather than an ability that can be observed in action. And as a pc’s reality changes, so do his considerations about his state of being. Thus „states of being“ tend to be conditional, and change in processing for the better continuously and are not normally the subject of declares. They are also not as easily deter-mined as abilities are. For example the ability to communicate freely can be readily observed, as it is evident in life and livingness and not just a matter of the pc’s reality. There are certain states of being which are definite states. For example: „Thetan Exte-rior“ and „The State of Clear“. These are accurately determined states, and must be declared when and if they have been attained, (and never declared when they have not been!). These states can easily be determined as to whether they have been achieved by a qualified Case Supervisor as there are specific evidences or phenomena that accompany these states. It is not"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"WINS, „STATES“, AND GRADE 4 HCOB 30.8.80 CHART AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 112 16.12.09 just a matter of what the pc says or thinks, they are actual real states. And these states, when achieved, are beyond anything Man has experienced. They have been sought after and strug-gled for for eons and are not to be wasted or treated with disrespect. The gains from Dianetic and Scientology processing are available to be achieved and enjoyed and this is what we have been doing and what we must continue to do. FALSE DECLARES Sometimes people encounter lower harmonics of these states and sometimes a preclear can run into a dramatization of a false high from an engram. Unhandled drugs and toxins in the body can go into restimulation and cause the person to experience hallucinations, includ-ing the false highs and euphoria contained in drug trips. The person will sometimes state or even assert that he or she has attained some new high and wonderful state and may even want to declare it. But the Case Supervisor must never acquiesce nor propitiate to such demands by permitting a declare. It is always obvious as to whether the pc has genuinely attained a state through auditing, or whether the pc is asserting something not attained but possibly hallucina-tory, or is even just hopeful or in wishful thinking. Worst of all, is the matter of a pc having been fed a cognition or EP and then falsely asserting he or she has attained a state for dishonest reasons. Instances of such false declares have occurred, and must be cleaned up and handled, and such cases must be continued in au-diting until they have genuinely attained such states. Then there are instances of persons who have not gone Clear at all, who have asserted that they have and that they attained the state in an earlier practice, or outside of auditing, or that they are a natural Clear. If these persons were in fact Clear the actual evidence and phe-nomena of the state would be present and obvious to a qualified C/S as verified in a DCSI. In many instances these declares were done simply on the person’s assertion that he was Clear, without any evidence of Clear being present, because someone „didn’t want to invalidate the person’s reality“, or felt they „had to validate“ the person. This is a mis-application of the Auditor’s Code, in that you can’t validate something that isn’t true to start with. Besides it does a great disservice to the person, both by permitting the person to think there is nothing more to achieve, and by risking exposure to upper level materials before the person is ready for them. A common reason for such false declares is that the person, never having gone Clear, does not have the evidence or phenomena of the state of Clear, and some have mistakenly thought that this could mean that the person was a natural Clear. That isn’t so, of course, and is pretty obvious if you look at it. If he were a natural Clear, he would exhibit the phenomena of Clear. Sometimes having been unable to find the point when the person went Clear (either due to poor auditor skill, or due to there not being any such point as the person isn’t yet Clear), the auditor has then assumed that the pc might be a natural Clear. But states such as the state of Clear have very definite and precise phenomena, and if these do not exist then the person simply is not Clear. The only correct handling is to continue handling the case per the Grade Chart until he or she actually does make the state."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"WINS, „STATES“, AND GRADE 5 HCOB 30.8.80 CHART AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 113 16.12.09 Similar to the above is the example of the person who sought to assert the state of „natural Superliterate“, rather than confront the study course which would have resulted in Superliteracy’. This is silly of course as the person wasn’t able to study, and by trying to blow from study by asserting „natural Superliterate“, the person was denying himself all the advan-tages of becoming able to study and being Superliterate! So if anyone feels that they simply „have to validate“ someone’s assertion, they should realize that by not doing so, and by insist-ing that the person continue and get the full gains and results available, they are doing that person a favor! Some Technical personnel have felt that they might cause an ARC break if they didn’t go along with a false assertion by permitting a declare. Most often it doesn’t cause an ARC break at all. But even if there is a slight upset, it can easily be handled in session, and let me assure you – it would cause a far far greater ARC break to let someone falsely attest. The be-ing always knows when he hasn’t made it, and if you make him think that you are a fraud by permitting a false declare, you could make an enemy. It is only honest to tell a pc that there are more gains to be had from a process, Grade or Level, that it is not yet complete and so cannot be declared, and to continue the action to its full EP and result. The pc will always appreciate this in the end. Likewise, with students, the course supervisor would never permit the student to attest complete until the student really did know and could apply the data successfully. While there may be work to do to complete the course, that supervisor’s graduates will respect him and Scientology highly. REMEDY FOR FALSE ASSERTIONS Whenever you encounter a false assertion from a preclear that he „has made it“, you will find that the preclear is overwhelmed, is either being audited too steeply, or sometimes has not been audited at all. The false assertion is invariably an effort to solve a difficulty or difficulties the person is encountering, but doesn’t think he can confront and handle. The false assertion is a false solution, and is an effort to blow. Similarly with students seeking to false attest, they are overwhelmed, and don’t think they can make it honestly. But with study Tech and a correct gradient they could. The solution, in either case, is to repair the by-passed charge or errors, and then re-sume the auditing or study at a lower gradient that the person can do. Never resort to false declares as a solution to HE&R and by-passed charge, even if it is being demanded. Always handle the by-passed charge and get the case winning again an continued in processing until the full result is achieved. If you do the above, and apply Dianetics and Scientology fully, your preclears and stu-dents will respect and appreciate you, and you will respect yourself. Ignore the dishonest who tell you that all their pcs are natural Clears, or how these processes are unnecessary, or how"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"WINS, „STATES“, AND GRADE 6 HCOB 30.8.80 CHART AUDITING CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 114 16.12.09 fast they managed to get through a process or Rundown.

Some of these mishandled cases can be quite a challenge (to both auditor and C/S) to straighten out and get back on the rails. Of course, it is far better to handle a case standardly in the first place but it is neces-sary to know how to handle any cases which are the result of such out tech. The higher trained the auditor and Case Supervisor, the more efficiently they will be able to handle these case conditions. In the hope of making easy the task of undoing such a case tangle, the key references which tell how to do so are set out in this issue. THE CONDITION OF A CASE THAT HAS BEEN QUICKIED OR WHO HAS FALSELY ATTESTED The first thing to know when trying to remedy such a case, is the condition that the case is in so that one doesn’t err by misestimating the case. Regardless of what case level is stated on the folder, if the person hasn’t made the grade one cannot expect the case to respond to processes and techniques of the stated case level. A common error is failing to correctly estimate the case state of the pc and approach-ing the case on too steep a gradient. It is always safest to undercut. Very often, the first thing that has to be done on a quickied or falsely declared case, is to get off any withhold or pretence of having falsely attested. It is not just a matter of past auditors or C/Ses having erred, as the pc always knows when he hasn’t made it. (REFERENCES: C/S SERIES 46 DECLARES; HCO PL 26 OCT 71 TECH DOWNGRADES) The case, having gotten up to higher Grades or Levels than he or she has honestly made, is also in a state of overwhelm due to having been run on processes or techniques above and beyond the ability of the case to as-is. Hence the case will usually be over-restimulated and require repair of by-passed charge. (REFERENCES: HCOB 1 OCT 63 HOW TO GET TONE ARM ACTION; HCOB 19 AUG AD13 HOW TO DO AN ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT; BOOK: THE BOOK OF CASE REMEDIES) One should also realize how this condition comes about in the first place. For a pc to get into the frame of mind where he would false attest or assert states of case not attained, he would have to already have given up hope of accomplishing real gains in auditing (due to losses or lack of wins) and would have been out of session. (See THE BOOK OF CASE REMEDIES and HCOB 12 NOV 71RB FALSE TA ADDITION, SUB-SECTION: „PCS WHO FALSIFY”.) In order to be able to correctly estimate cases, an auditor and especially a Case Super-visor must know and be able to apply the basic data on cases and case states as given in: BOOK: DIANETICS: THE MODERN SCIENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"PROGRAMMING AND HANDLING CASES 3 HCOB 31.08.80 WHO HAVE BEEN QUICKIED OR FALSELY DECLARED CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 117 16.12.09 BOOK: SCIENCE OF SURVIVAL THE CHART OF HUMAN EVALUATION IMPORTANT SCALES SUCH AS THE EFFECT SCALE AND THE TONE SCALE, WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN THE BOOK: SCIENTOLOGY 0-8 THE STATE OF CASE SCALE (IN HCOB 8 JUN ADL3R) THE CASE SUPERVISOR SERIES HCOBS (TECH VOLUME X). CASE REPAIR The first action is to repair the case’s by-passed charge and get the case to a point of in-session-ness so that you can now do something for the case. (Definition of In-session: in-terested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor. Technical Dictionary) The most comprehensive and versatile repair lists that there are, are the C/S 53 (which contains everything that could be wrong with the mind) and the Green Form 40 Expanded (which contains the reasons for case resistiveness and the handling of such). Programming for a „C/S 53 to F/Ning List“ followed by a „GF 40 Expanded to F/Ning List“, would handle most cases with these provisos: (1) that the auditor’s TRs and metering are up to being able to make a prepared list read; (2) that the case is not in need of a more specific repair action to handle immediate by-passed charge before a more general action is done; (3) that the case is up to being audited on subjective or thinkingness processes. Full data on these points is con-tained in the following references: HCOB 22 APR 80 ASSESSMENT DRILLS C/S SERIES 90 THE PRIMARY FAILURE C/S SERIES 95 „FAILED“ CASES C/S SERIES 34 NON F/N CASES HCOB 15 MAR AD12 SUPPRESSORS PAB #120 CONTROL TRIO (VOL III, P. 119) HCOB 29 MAR 62 CCHS AGAIN – WHEN TO USE THE CCHS HCOB 5 APR 62 CCHS – AUDITING ATTITUDE HCOB 11 APR 62 DETERMINING WHAT TO RUN HCOB 12 MAY 80 DRUGS AND OBJECTIVE PROCESSES. On lower level cases the only action one may be able to take is to get the case’s Rudi-ments in (including getting off any withhold about having falsely attested) and then get the person through the Purification Rundown, the Survival Rundown and the Drug Rundown so that the case can be audited successfully. (And remember that these rundowns do not just ap-ply to badly of f cases and also that any case who has been quickied or who has falsely at-tested will need these rundowns. The rougher the case is though, the more imperative these three RDs are and these may have to be done before anything else.) Cases in the Non-Interference Zone (see C/S Series 73), are an exception in that they can only have their Rudiments gotten in and the correction lists appropriate to the Solo Levels they have done or are on."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"PROGRAMMING AND HANDLING CASES 4 HCOB 31.08.80 WHO HAVE BEEN QUICKIED OR FALSELY DECLARED CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 118 16.12.09 Apart from cases in the Non-Interference Zone and those unable to run thinkingness processes, other cases will most readily be handled with the appropriate correction list for the actions which they have been run on. There is also the rule that one can resort to if necessary, of simply getting TA action. This principle is covered in HCOB 4 AUG 63 E-METER ERRORS – COMMUNICATION CYCLE ERROR and in HCOB 1 OCT 63 HOW TO GET TONE ARM ACTION. While this is not the fastest or most accurate way to resolve a case situation, it is of value and may have to be resorted to and it will work. Any auditor or C/S handling cases who have been quickied or falsely declared, is well advised to re-study the materials given above even though he or she has studied these before. They do contain all the answers. Full data and examples of such repairs and Repair Programs are given in the C/S Se-ries, especially: C/S Series 1-14, 17, 19, 29, 34, 42, 43, 44R, 44R Addition, 62, 77, 90 and 95 (Tech Volume X). REPAIR CAUTION The worse off the case condition of the pc is, the lighter the approach must be. (See C/S SERIES 6, THE EFFECT SCALE, and THE CHART OF HUMAN EVALUATION „WHAT TO AUDIT“ COLUMN.) Also, the worse off the case is the more desperate the pc usually is for an immediate total solution and the more demanding and assertive the case is likely to be. This often in-cludes false assertions of what fantastic shape the person thinks he is in accompanied by pc demands to be run on „powerful“ techniques or procedures. The greatest error the C/S or auditor could make is to go into propitiation to these demands and accept the pc’s orders re-garding what to run or what to let the pc „attest“ to. Don’t use this to never advance a case that is running well, to higher level actions. Go by the basic rules of auditing and program-ming. Determine how you address a case by correctly estimating the case state of the pc and by the indicators of whether the pc gets TA action, the expected results and EPs of processes and actions, cognitions (or their absence) and whether the case condition of the pc is changing for the better. In short, determine your actions by how the case responds, not by what the case demands or asserts. Hold to the that if the pc knew what was wrong with him, it would no longer be wrong. (See C/S SERIES 3, 6, 7.) There is a handling for an overly assertive, protesty or demanding pc. The pc is not in session, the pc almost invariably is being audited above his or her ability to as-is (too steep, despite PC assertions or demands to the contrary) and the pc’s session rudiments are not in (including buttons: Assert, Protest, and pc considerations about his case and how it is being handled and about the processes or techniques being used). The tools to use are: L1C; Rudiments (including Ruds „in auditing“ or „audited over“), getting in the buttons of Asserted, Protested and sometimes all the Repetitive Rudi-ments, Middle Rudiments and End Rudiments; 2WCs, including getting off the pc’s consid-"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"PROGRAMMING AND HANDLING CASES 5 HCOB 31.08.80 WHO HAVE BEEN QUICKIED OR FALSELY DECLARED CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 119 16.12.09 erations about his or her case or auditing; C/S prepared assessments and Prepchecks such as the „Class VIII, C/S #6“ (Tech Vol XI, pg. 169). The rougher the current or chronic case condition of the Pc, the more essential it is to handle the pc’s or case’s reactions and considerations to the auditing. One not only has to handle what is wrong with the case but also the case reaction to-wards being handled or even helped. As cases in good shape usually require minimum han-dling (if any) on their reaction to the auditing, it is easy (but disastrous) for a Case Supervisor or auditor to overlook these actions on a case in rough condition. Most cases do not need such delicate handling so it is possible for a C/S to overlook or forget the necessity of handling the case’s reaction(s) to auditing, getting the case into session (or back into session) and then un-dercutting the previous approach (which would have to have been too steep, for these reac-tions to have occurred). (The references listed in Volume X index under the headings: “Session”, ”Session-able”, “Set-up(s)”, ”Rudiment(s)“ and the book: DIANETICS: THE ORIGINAL THESIS are vital materials to know and could make all the difference between failure and success in handling the above case conditions and in auditing in general.) CASE RETURN The general rule of case return programming is that having repaired the pc of by-passed charge and gotten the Repair EP (per C/S Series 3), one must then find the lowest level of the Grade Chart that the pc honestly and completely attained and move the case on up from there. If the Repair Program has been competently and thoroughly done, the case will now be in-session and will be able to run processes well. It is simply a matter of flattening processes left unflat earlier, running processes that were omitted previously and ensuring that the PC does make the full Ability Gained and Inability Lost of each Grade. The only exceptions to the above are pre-OTs in the Non-Interference Zone and those on NED for OTs. These can only be repaired with the appropriate correction list(s) for the Level, with Rudiments gotten in, and then the action the pre-OT is on continued and com-pleted until the pre-OT is out of the Non-Interference Zone.) On many cases the very first action will have to be a properly and thoroughly done Dianetic and Scientology CS-1. This has become necessary to call to attention as one of the most common omissions during the recent Quickie craze has been the omission of Dianetic and Scientology CS-1 actions! The necessity of these actions and of proper pc education (but not feeding the pc EPs or cognitions) has been covered in materials too numerous to mention. A PC cannot even understand or answer an auditing command containing words that he or she doesn’t fully comprehend, much less make any gain in such auditing. Checking „Audited over misunderstood words?“ or „Audited over words you didn’t fully understand?“ and then clearing each word so found, will be very beneficial to such a case in addition to a thoroughly done Dianetic and Scientology CS-1."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"PROGRAMMING AND HANDLING CASES 6 HCOB 31.08.80 WHO HAVE BEEN QUICKIED OR FALSELY DECLARED CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 120 16.12.09 From cases recently studied who had been quickied and falsely declared, misunder-stoods were a very common factor. One relatively unaudited case (about 25 hours total) who had attested to: Cleared Theta Clear, Static, Clear-OT, Natural Clear and a host of other „states“, was very wisely put onto a CS-1, despite the fact that the PC had previously „had a CS-1“ (in 30 mins). The very words of the rudiments were found to have been misunderstood and had to be cleared and the word „Scientology“ took 45 mins to clear. Not only didn’t the case understand what had been attested to, but the case couldn’t have made much progress in auditing over these and other misunderstoods. The rule is: Do a full and thorough Dianetic and Scientology CS-1, clear all misunderstoods the PC has been audited over and clear all new words or terms encountered in auditing thereafter. Also encourage preclears to become educated in Dianetics and Scientology via the books and introductory services. It will pay off in greater PC participation and greater gains. Even with a well done Repair Program it is quite possible that you may encounter some residual by-passed charge during the Return Program. This is usually simply repaired with the appropriate correction list and the process or action completed to its full EP. An in-complete cycle (and an unflat process is an incomplete cycle) can be the source of by-passed charge until that cycle is completed. Therefore one must not too hastily depart from a Return Program and go back to a Repair Program (see C/S Series 17). Handle the immediate by-passed charge) flatten the earlier incomplete process or action and continue the Return Pro-gram, wherever possible. While doing a Return Program, do not again make the error of quickying or falsely de-claring. Be sure to run each process, action and Grade to its full EP and result this time. The main references for the Return Program are: C/S Series 1-10, 11, 12R, 13, 17, 19, 20, 30, 31, 38, 41, 42, 43, 46, 47, 51, 58, 73, 77, 88R, 89, and 93 – Volume X; HCOB 15 JAN 70, HANDLING WITH AUDITING; THE CLASSIFICATION AND GRADATION CHART. CAUTION REGARDING EPs & COGNITIONS Unfortunately, there have been numerous examples of pcs having been „fed the cogni-tion“ or „fed the EP“. Sometimes this has been done under the guise of „word clearing“ by carefully selecting out words (which usually do not have anything to do with the words of the auditing command or question) and by „clearing“ these words, suggesting the cognition or EP to the PC. This is actually quite suppressive and can cause quite a case snarl up. Persons who would stoop low enough to do this are also invariably quite dishonest and seldom if ever re-port that they have done so in the worksheets. Thus neither a C/S nor an FESer can always rely on what is in the worksheets or FES. Where the case reaction of the PC differs from what one would expect from processes actually run and EPs reported in the folder, it must be sus-pected that the worksheets are false. For example, the case is said to be a Grade III Release but frequently has problems in life and PTPs in session, showing that at least Grade I Release is out and probably other Grades lower than Grade III are out too. (See C/S Series 97 and 98"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"PROGRAMMING AND HANDLING CASES 7 HCOB 31.08.80 WHO HAVE BEEN QUICKIED OR FALSELY DECLARED CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 121 16.12.09 for full data on how to detect and handle omissions and falsification in worksheets and fold-ers.) Pcs who assert „cognitions“ or „EPs“ have often been fed these by „friends“ (who cer-tainly do not have the pc’s best interests in mind). Any instance of the above must be reported to the Ethics section of the org or nearest org and acted on with alacrity. When a case has been „fed a cognition or EP“, it puts the case in the position of hav-ing a more difficult time being in session and running the process. As the Pc has been told what to expect, his attention is not on his case and running the process but is to some degree tied up in figure-figure-ing about the EP. This can result in the Pc, when he does have the cognition or EP, wondering whether he has really cognited or whether it is just because he already knows the cognition. If so, the Evaluation and any Invalidation and considerations should be cleaned up. Otherwise, even though the process is run to EP, it would be somewhat spoiled for the pc. Of course if the Pc simply repeated the cognition or EP as if he had had it and did not get off the withhold of having been „fed the EP“ (sometimes it will be a withhold of the pc having asked for it or searched it out) and if the process was not run or it was ended on such an „EP“, the poor Pc would have just denied himself all the gains available from that process. And, as processes and Grades each depend to a large degree on earlier actions and Grades being in, he will probably not progress further case-wise until this is made known and han-dled. There is another way „feeding cognitions“ can adversely affect the case. Although the PC had not had the cognition or EP at the time and the process was ended or the Grade or action was declared falsely, the person might have subsequently in auditing actually had the cognition or EP. Yet because of the earlier false declare, the action could be considered out or unflat. The tangle the auditor or C/S could run into here is that of trying to now flatten a proc-ess, action or Grade, that was out (unflat) earlier but is now in, and thus won’t run and results in overrun. Should you encounter this phenomenon, suspect the above and handle accord-ingly. One instance is known of where the person was falsely declared Clear, but in subse-quent auditing actually went Clear. It was not at once suspected that the Pc could have actu-ally gone Clear subsequent to the original false declare. Thus looking for the person went Clear earlier than the original declare, the actual Clear point was overlooked and it was falsely assumed that the person was a natural Clear! Due to the tremendous Dev-T, upset, denial of gains to pcs, and the work that has to go into untangling such a case snarl, certain cognitions and EPs are kept confidential. Anyone found to have violated this has done a great disservice to all and must be handled in Ethics so as to prevent any recurrence. It can be undone, but why cause that much trouble or permit others to do so, in the first place?"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"PROGRAMMING AND HANDLING CASES 8 HCOB 31.08.80 WHO HAVE BEEN QUICKIED OR FALSELY DECLARED CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 122 16.12.09 The usual handling for a case that has been “fed the cognition or EP” is to clean up the Evaluation and any Invalidation, get off the pc’s considerations about it and any withhold of the pc’s regarding it and then run and flatten the process, action or Grade, keeping the session rudiments in while doing so. This way it will come out fine. DRUGS AND MISUNDERSTOODS Drugs and the effects of drugs, are the main reason why a person flinches from or is unable to confront his bank. Misunderstoods and failure to educate the preclear on the basic terms of auditing, Dianetics and Scientology, and on the Grade Chart gives you a PC who can’t even understand or answer auditing commands. These are the two most common case reasons leading to quickying and false declares. It is therefore very important that the handling of these two factors be stressed. The Purification Rundown, the Survival Rundown, the NED or Scn Drug Rundown, and the OT or NOTs Drug Rundowns, are the way to fully handle drugs and their effects on the body, mind and being. Dianetic and Scientology CS-1s, Introductory courses, books on Dianetics and Scien-tology, and the Grade Chart are the way to bring about understanding and reality on the part of the preclear and thus his participation and maximum gain. TRs AND METERING TRs and metering are the two main factors in an auditor that make all the difference between failure and success. Thus the training of auditors on Professional TRs, Upper Indocs, the E-meter course and on Assessment Drills must be stressed and kept in, in order to ensure that pcs do get the full and complete results that Dianetics and Scientology are capable of. SUMMARY Although it is more difficult to repair and return a case that has been quickied than it is to correctly audit and C/S a case in the first place, it can be done and all the references needed are contained herein. There is no condition of the spirit that cannot successfully be addressed and handled with auditing today. Cases that have been quickied can be handled. But that’s no reason not to do it right the first time. The gains and wins and speed of progress of cases audited to full result in the first place exceeds those who have been quickied or tried to get through in the “fastest cheapest way”."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"PROGRAMMING AND HANDLING CASES 9 HCOB 31.08.80 WHO HAVE BEEN QUICKIED OR FALSELY DECLARED CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 123 16.12.09 Gains beyond the pc’s expectations lie at every Grade and Level of the Bridge.

(Paragraph three under the ASSESSMENT section on page 4 of this HCOB has been revised to update and expand upon the use of Prepared Lists in handling cases.) Keeping Scientology Working Series 26 OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN The term „Out Tech” means that Scientology is not being applied or is not being cor-rectly applied. When Tech is in we mean that Scientology is being applied and is being cor-rectly applied. By Tech is meant technology, referring of course to the application of the pre-cise scientific drills and processes of Scientology. Technology means the methods of applica-tion of an art or science as opposed to mere knowledge of the science or art itself. One could know all about the theory of motor cars and the science of building them and the art of de-signing them and still not be able to build, plan or drive one. The practices of building, plan-ning or driving a motor car are quite distinct from the theory, science and art of motor cars. An auditor is not just a Scientologist. He or she is one who can apply it. Thus the tech-nology of Scientology is its actual application to oneself, a preclear or the situations one en-counters in life. Tech implies use. There is a wide gap between mere knowledge and the application of that knowledge. When we say tech is out, we might also say, „While that unit or person may know all about Scientology, that person does not actually apply it.” A skilled auditor knows not only Scientology but how to apply the technology to self, pcs and life. Many persons auditing have not yet crossed over from „knowing about” to „applying”. Thus you see them fooling about with pcs. When a skilled auditor sees a critical pc he knows bang – pc has a withhold and pulls it. That’s because this auditor’s tech is in. Meaning he knows what to do with his data."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 2 HCOB 13.9.65R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 126 16.12.09 Some other person who knows a lot of Scientology, has had courses and all that, yet sees a critical pc and then tries to add up everything he knows about pcs and stumbles about and then decides on a Zero pc it’s a new thing that’s wrong that’s never been seen before. What’s the difference here? It’s the difference between a person who knows but can-not apply and a skilled technician who can apply the knowledge. Most golfers know that you have to keep your eye on the ball just before, during and after you hit it. That’s the basic datum of powerful, long drives down the fairway. So if this is so well known then why do so few golfers do it? They have arrived at a point of knowing they must. They have not yet arrived at a point of being able to. Then their heads get so scrambled, seeing all their bad drives which didn’t go down the fairway, that they buy rabbits feet or new clubs or study ballistics. In short, not being able to do it, they disperse and do something else. All auditors go through this. All of them, once trained, know the right processes. Then they have to graduate up to doing the right processes. Observation plays an enormous role in this. The auditor is so all thumbs with his meter and unfamiliar tools he has no time or attention to see what goes on with the pc. So for 15 years lots of auditors made releases without ever noticing it. They were so involved in know-ing and so unskilled in applying, they never saw the ball go down the fairway for a 200 yard drive! So they began to do something else and squirrel. There was the pc going release, but the auditor, unskilled as a technician for all his knowledge of the science, never saw the audit-ing work even though even the auditing done that badly did work. Do you get the point? You have to know your tools very very well to see past them! An auditor who squir-rels, who fools about with a pc, who fumbles around and seldom gets results just isn’t suffi-ciently familiar with a session, its patter, his meter and the mind to see past them to the pc. Drill overcomes this. The keynote of the skilled technician is that he is a product of practice. He has to know what he is trying to do and what elements he is handling. Then he can produce a result. I’ll give you an example: I told an auditor to look over a past session of known date on a pc and find what was missed in that session. Something must have been missed as the pc’s tone arm action collapsed in that session and ever afterwards was nil. So this auditor looked for a „missed withhold from the auditor in that session”. The ordered repair was a complete dud. Why? This auditor did not know that anything could be missed except a withhold of the hidden overt type. He didn’t know there could be an inadvertent withhold wherein the pc thinks he is withholding because the auditor didn’t hear or acknowledge. This auditor didn’t know that an item on a list could be missed and tie up TA. But if he did know these things he didn’t know them well enough to do them. A second more skilled auditor took over and bang! the missed item on the list was quickly found. The more skilled auditor simply asked, „In that session what was missed?” and promptly got it. The former auditor had taken a simple order, „Find what was missed in that session,” and turned it into something else: „What withhold was missed in that session?”"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 3 HCOB 13.9.65R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 127 16.12.09 His skill did not include applying a simple direct order as auditing looked very com-plex to him as he had so much trouble with doing it. You can train somebody in all the data and not have an auditor. A real auditor has to be able to apply the data to the pc. Importances play a huge part in this. I had a newly graduated darkroom photographic technician at work. It was pathetic to see the inability to apply important data. The virtues of ancient equipment and strange tricks to get seldom required effects were all at his fingertips. But he did not know that you wiped developer off your hands before loading fresh film. Con-sequently he ruined every picture taken with any film he loaded. He did not know you washed chemicals out of bottles before you put different chemicals in them. Yet he could quote by the yard formulas not in use for 50 years! He knew photography. He could not apply what he knew. Soon he was straying all over the place trying to find new developers and papers and new methods. Whereas all he had to do was learn how to wash his hands and dry them before handling new film. I also recall a 90-day wonder in World War II who came aboard in fresh new gold braid and with popped eyes stared at the wheel and compass. He said he’d studied all about them but had never seen any before and had often wondered if they really were used. How he imagined ships were steered and guided beyond the sight of land is a mystery. Maybe he thought it was all done by telepathy or an order from the Bureau of Navigation! Alter-is and poor results do not really come from not-know. They come from can’t-apply. Drills, drills, drills and the continual repetition of the important data handle this condi-tion of can’t-apply. If you drill auditors hard and repeat often enough basic auditing facts, they eventually disentangle themselves and begin to do a job of application. IMPORTANT DATA The truly important data in an auditing session are so few that one could easily memo-rize them in a few minutes. From case supervisor or auditor viewpoint: 1. If an auditor isn’t getting results either he or the pc is doing something else. 2. There is no substitute for knowing how to run and read a meter perfectly. 3. An auditor must be able to read, comprehend and apply HCO Bs and instructions. 4. An auditor must be familiar enough with what he’s doing and the mechanics of the mind to be able to observe what is happening with the pc. 5. There is no substitute for perfect TRs. 6. An auditor must be able to duplicate the auditing command and observe what is hap-pening and continue or end processes according to their results on the pc."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 4 HCOB 13.9.65R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 128 16.12.09 7. An auditor must be able to see when he’s released the pc and end off quickly and eas-ily with no shock or overrun. 8. An auditor must have observed results of his standard auditing and have confidence in it. CASE REACTION The auditor and the Case Supervisor must know the only six reasons a case does not advance. They are: 1. Pc is Suppressive. 2. Pc is always a Potential Trouble Source if he Roller Coasters and only finding the right suppressive will clean it up. No other action will. There are no other reasons for a Roller Coaster (loss of gain obtained in auditing). 3. One must never audit an ARC Broken pc for a minute even but must locate and indi-cate the by-passed charge at once. To do otherwise will injure the pc’s case. 4. A present time problem of long duration prevents good gain and sends the pc into the back track. 5. The only reasons a pc is critical are a withhold or a misunderstood word and there is NO reason other than those. And in trying to locate a withhold it is not a motivator done to the pc but something the pc has done. 6. Continuing overts hidden from view are the cause of no case gain (see number 1, Sup-pressive). The only other possible reason a pc does not gain on standard processing is the pc or the auditor failed to appear for the session. Now honestly, aren’t those easy? But a trainee fumbling about with meter and what he learned in a bog of unfamiliarity will always tell you it is something else than the above. Such pull motivators, audit ARC Bro-ken pcs who won’t even look at them, think Roller Coaster is caused by eating the wrong ce-real and remedy it all with some new wonderful action that collapses the lot. ASSESSMENT You could meter assess the first group 1 to 8 on an auditor and the right one would fall and you could fix it up. You could meter assess the second group 1 to 6 on a pc and get the right answer every time that would remedy the case. You have a C/S Series 53 which lists any general thing that can be aberrated in a thetan and you have a Green Form which covers the things bugging a case. Plus there are"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"OUT TECH AND HOW TO GET IT IN 5 HCOB 13.9.65R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 129 16.12.09 dozens of other Prepared Lists which are designed to handle various things that can be wrong in a case, an auditing action or a session. HCOB 29 April 80 PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND PURPOSE, summarizes the various types of Prepared Lists and their use. When I tell you these are the answers, I mean it. I don’t use anything else. And I catch my sinning auditor or bogged down pc every time. To give you an idea of the simplicity of it, a pc says she is „tired” and therefore has a somatic. Well, that can’t be it because it’s still there. So I ask for a problem and after a few given the pc hasn’t changed so it’s not a problem. I ask for an ARC Break and bang! I find one. Knowing the principles of the mind, and as I observe pcs, I see it’s better but not gone and ask for a previous one like it. Bang! That’s the one and it blows completely. I know that if the pc says it’s A and it doesn’t blow, it must be something else. I know that it’s one of six things. I assess by starting down the list. I know when I’ve got it by looking at the pc’s reac-tions (or the meter’s). And I handle it accordingly. Also, quite vitally, I know it’s a limited number of things. And even more vitally I know by long experience as a technician that I can handle it fully and proceed to do so. There is no „magic” touch in auditing like the psychiatrist believes. There is only skilled touch, using known data and applying it. Until you have an auditor familiar with his tools, cases and results you don’t have an auditor. You have a collected confusion of hope and despair rampant amongst non-stable data. Study, drill and familiarity overcome these things. A skilled technician knows what gets results and gets them. So drill them. Drill into them the above data until they chant them in their sleep. And finally comes the dawn. They observe the pc before them, they apply standard tech. And won-derful to behold there are the results of Scientology, complete. Tech is in. L.

In Scientology a course consists of a checksheet with all the actions and material listed on it and all the materials on the checksheet available in the same order. “Checksheet Material” means the policy letters, bulletins, tapes, mimeo issues, any reference book or any books mentioned. “Materials” also include clay, furniture, tape players, bulletin boards, routing forms, supplies of pink sheets, roll book, student files, file cabinets and any other items that will be needed. If you look this over carefully, it does not say “materials on order” or “except for those we haven’t got” or “in different order”. It means what it says exactly. If a student is to have auditing or word clearing rundowns or must do auditing those are under ACTIONS and appear on the checksheet. A course must have a Supervisor. He may or may not be a graduate and experienced practitioner of the course he is supervising but he must be a trained Course Supervisor. He is not expected to teach. He is expected to get the students there, rolls called, checkouts properly done, misunderstoods handled by finding what the student doesn’t dig and getting the student to dig it. The Supervisor who tells students answers is a waste of time and a course destroyer as he enters out-data into the scene even if trained and actually especially if trained in the subject. The Supervisor is NOT an “instructor”, that’s why he’s called a “Su-pervisor”. A Supervisor’s skill is in spotting dope-off, glee and other manifestations of misun-derstoods, and getting it cleaned up, not in knowing the data so he can tell the student. A Supervisor should have an idea of what questions he will be asked and know where to direct the student for the answer. Student blows follow misunderstoods. A Supervisor who is on the ball never has blows as he caught them before they happened by observing the student’s misunderstanding before the student does and getting it tracked down by the student."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A COURSE? 2 HCO PL 16.3.71R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 132 16.12.09 It is the Supervisor’s job to get the student through the checksheet fully and swiftly with minimum lost time. The successful Supervisor is tough. He is not a kindly old fumbler. He sets high checksheet targets for each student for the day and forces them to be met or else. The Supervisor is spending Supervisor Minutes. He has just so many to spend. He IS spending Student Hours. He has just so many of these to spend so he gets them spent wisely and saves any waste of them. A Supervisor in a course of any size has a Course Administrator who has very exact duties in keeping up Course Admin and handing out and getting back materials and not losing any to damage or carelessness. If Paragraphs One to Three above are violated it is the Course Administrator who is at fault. He must have checksheets and the matching material in adequate quantity to serve the course. If he doesn’t he has telexes flying and mimeo sweating. The Course Admin is in charge of routing lines and proper send-off and return of students to Cramming or Auditing or Ethics. The final and essential part of a course is students. If a course conforms with this P/L exactly with no quibbles, is tough, precisely time scheduled and run hard, it will be a full expanding course and very successful. If it varies from this P/L it will stack up bodies in the shop, get blows and incompetent graduates. The final valuable product of any course is graduates who can apply successfully the material they studied and be successful in the subject. This answers the question What is a Course? If any of these points are out it is NOT a Scientology Course and it will not be successful. Thus, the order “Put a Course there!” means this P/L in full force. So here’s the order, when offering training put a course there. L.

An Interneship then is serving a period as an Interne, or an activity offered by an org by which Experience can be gained. Interneships have been arranged this long while for every auditing class. The apprenticeship of an auditor is done as an org Interne. C/Ses very often have Internes on their lines and sometimes have trouble with getting them to audit. The why of this is that the Interne seldom knows the definition of the word “Interne” (which is as above). They sometimes think they are still students. They do not know this fact: A course graduate becomes an auditor by auditing. That means lots of auditing. The failure of “auditors” is that they go from one level to the next, HDC to IV to VIII, without ever becoming an auditor for that Class. Thus you can get a silly situation where a Class IX can’t audit or C/S well. Thus you get tech going out. An HDC graduate who doesn’t then audit under an experienced Case Supervisor who knows and demands the standard actions rarely gets to be an HDC Auditor. It takes tons of hours to make a real Dianetic auditor who can toss off standard sessions and get his routine miracles. So if an HDC doesn’t Interne, but simply goes on to the Academy Courses or SHSBC he has skipped his apprenticeship as a Dianetic Auditor. If he gets his Class VI and never Internes but goes on to VIII – well, we now have somebody who has long since lost touch with the reality of why he is studying."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"INTERNES   2   HCOB   19.7.71   CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 134 16.12.09 Therefore you can’t take a Class VI graduate who was never a Dianetic Auditor and Interne him as a VI. He’ll goof-goof-goof. So you have to Interne him as an HDC. When he can turn out flawless Dianetic sessions on all kinds of pcs you can Interne him as a IV etc. In other words you have to catch up all neglected Apprenticeships. I don’t care if the guy is an VIII, if he wasn’t ever a Dianetic Auditor and a Class VI Auditor and isn’t Interning as an VIII then he is only a provisional. Flubby auditors are the biggest time wasters a C/S has. If auditors on his lines aren’t good, he’ll take forever to get his C/S work done. And he won’t get results. The answer is, regardless of Class as a course graduate, a C/S must interne his audi-tors for each interneship missed on the way up. The “ok to audit” system is used. One takes any graduate and Internes him on the lowest Interneship he has missed. He reviews his material, gets his drills checked, gets his misunderstood words cleared and gets an “ok to audit” for that level. If he goofs he is crammed. And sometimes wholly retreaded. The “ok to audit Dianetics” would be his first okay. This suspends if he has to retread. When he then has turned out pcs, pcs, pcs, pcs, 5, 6, 8, 10 hours a day for weeks and weeks and is a total success as a Dianetic Auditor, he can go on up. At first as a Dianetic Interne he is part time studying Dianetics. Then as he gets flaw-less and while he is getting experience and practice on Dianetics, he can gradually phase over into re-studying his next Interneship, usually IV or VI. Then one day he is word cleared, checked out on his drills, and he qualifies for “ok to audit” for IV or VI. Now it begins all over again. Flubs – Cramming, midnight oil, audit audit cramming audit audit new word clear new drill work audit audit audit audit 5, 6, 8, 10 hours a day. Now he is a IV or VI auditor. His next real step is a VI or VII Interne at an SH. If he has been a good IV Interne Auditor his VI Interneship after his SHSBC will be a VII Interneship. VII is an Interne activ-ity. When he’s an Auditor that can do VI and Power, he is ready for VIII and IX. If he is going to be a good VIII-IX auditor he will Interne in an AO or SH under an experienced C/S. Now when he goes to his own org, you have a real honest to goodness C/S.

The world renowned Superiority of Flag Auditors is built just like I am telling you here. There is no reason just that same quality can’t be built in any org. One does it by the Interne method. By using this method you get IN tech and high volume. Any auditor in any org that is limping and fumbling simply has never been properly Interned. The way to remedy it is to set up a good Cramming that uses only HCO Bs and has them available (and no verbal tradition), a Good Word Clearer and a Qual “okay to audit” Interne system. The Internes are a Section in Qual. They have a Course Supervisor. They study and audit cram audit cram study audit, audit audit audit. And one day you have in tech and high volume high Class auditing all over the place. Otherwise you just have a bunch of students, in doubt, chewing on their misunder-stood words and failed tech. There is a right way to go about it. It is by Interneship. L.

Now, the first you hear of this – the first anybody heard of this, really, was Flag Bu-reaux Data Letter 101 of 5 August 71. And this came along at a time when Word Clearing was restored. Now, I have a hat that nobody quite notices, and it’s the Finder of Lost Tech. Now, some people go all of their lives looking for the mystery of the pattern of the pyramids and others go looking for the Mayan civilization and how it built things, and I go looking for the tech people have lost in Dianetics and Scientology as a primary expeditionary action. This begins some time ago when, with horror, I found out they had lost all of Ex-panded Lower Grades. Quickie grades had come in, and you’re just now recovering techni-cally from the loss of the full text of early Dianetics. And that was dropped out and wasn’t gotten back in for literally years. It dropped out for years and then we’ve been working, really, very hard since ‘69 to get it in. Right now, amazingly enough, you find me restoring Class VIII technology. I have a mission right now restoring Class VIII technology. ASHO, for instance – we’re going into a campaign in ASHO trying to restore Power technology. There was a mission and then they got a hidden data line going and a verbal communication line going and Power went out again. And „the finding of lost tech“ is a very, very interesting hat, because people manage to lose it at the drop of a bulletin. And that is very important because that is the primary function and action of Qual. It is not “patching up some case that has been messed up by the HGC”! I’m passing you this hat: the Finder of Lost Tech. Now, there are several ways that tech gets lost, and first and foremost amongst them is the misunderstood word. And the student comes to you and he says, „HCOB something or other, written by so-and-so, actually is in conflict with HCOB boff-boff and so on, and we don’t know whether to turn on the E-Meter with the right hand or left hand. We are all con-fused and I can’t make it out.“ And you say, „Look, it’s a misunderstood word, son, let’s find it.“"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 2 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 138 16.12.09 „Oh no, no, no, no, no! It’s not a misunderstood word. It’s actually all these things are in conflict with everything else, and everything is in conflict with me and so on. I’m going mad! Oh-h!“ You say, „Now look, take it easy, be quiet, be calm, and sit down; pick up the cans and let’s find out where on that earlier bulletin there is a word you don’t understand.“ And so he reads it – Method 2 – to you, and he has never understood HCOB, he has not understood Remimeo, and he doesn’t know the word at, he doesn’t know the word such, and he has never figured out what is the word this. [amusement in audience] And after you have cleaned all this up and got it all nicely looked up, now you say, „Read the bulletins.“ „Oh, yeah. There’s nothing – no conflict here. What was I talking about?“ All of these wild technical confusions begin with a misunderstood word and in actual fact don’t exist at all. Now, enough people at Saint Hill, sometime after I left there – ‘66, ‘67, ‘68 – enough people misunderstood enough words so the students were then told, „The early material of the course and all of the material on the course and anything you’re studying on this course is historical, and it is only background information and we don’t use it anymore.“ And that was the system by which it vanished. And what do you know? People were starting to get mad at them in the community. They were not delivering tech. The results were no longer there. And you would just be amazed at the number of cases that we crack right down the center and push right up from the bottom of one of these personality graphs on 1956 tech. There isn’t a case in the world that wouldn’t crack up on GF 40 Expanded, which has in it the running of engrams, narrative; and, of course, when it goes into drugs that’s also with somat-ics – the full drug rundown can be done from it; and listing, which is Grade III, Class III, Level III material. GF 40 Expanded. There isn’t an Interiorization Rundown that has gone wrong – that hasn’t gone wrong because of 1962 technology. In other words, when they lose the tech they don’t do the tech, they don’t get the results – they go „Thoo-thahhh” – and they lose the tech through the misun-derstood word. Now, that ‘64 technology managed to stay on the Study Tapes utterly unused until we suddenly started to dust it off and put it in picture-book form and began to issue it in the re-cent series. Now, if you recognize this as the operating background of technology, you will see then that somebody has to be a custodian of not just the books but the meaning of the books. And if that is kept in, the technology will continue to win. So, the probable earliest applicable policy letter is „KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING“ with which you are all familiar. Now, who does that? Qual does that."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 3 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 139 16.12.09 Now, if you look at Qual from that point of view, suddenly it makes a great deal of sense. And if at any time you become confused as to what you’re supposed to be doing, or anytime any one of your staff in Qual becomes confused as to what they’re supposed to be doing, point out that the essential commodity of the organization is knowledge. And before it is a deliverer of Tech, it is a custodian and disseminator of knowledge. And the only thing that makes that organization any different than anything they’ve been doing for the last umpty-ump trillion, billion, skillion years is the fact that it has knowledge that unravels the knots and problems that man has been cracking his brains with ever since he wondered, after he had made the stone ax, why he was so unhandy with it. [laughs, amusement in audience] Knowledge. That is the one thing which has appeared along this line. And this is true, true, true, because the most successful franchises have been those which featured knowledge, and people came in. And one franchise that was running at a very, very high level – and I think they stopped the – the successful pattern in it – had a group, and people met and people from the public came in, and so on, once a week. And they took up HCO Policy Letters. Now, it’s very interesting. You say, „Well, the public wouldn’t be interested in that.“ No, that’s not right. The whole public is all worried about organization. They’re caught in the middle of a hurricane of organization, or of disorganization. They are interested in it and there are many policy letters which are very good. The franchise also would take up HCOBs and so on, but the policy letters were quite a hit. And so all they’d do would be to read this policy letter and – to them and discuss this policy letter and talk about this policy letter. Now, that is pure export of knowledge. There have been comparable actions on the past track, one of them when the emperor of China sent one of his people over to India to import all of the textbooks of Buddhism. And they did, and translations occurred, and Buddhism eventually, up through the years – since it wasn’t pushed very hard and so forth – eventually permeated and got all through – got all through China. Japan was just hanging by its tail from the trees until Buddhist monks came in. And Buddhist monks brought them religion and also brought them culture; and they brought them writing, painting, pottery making and that sort of thing, but those were – were incidental. They brought them knowledge. Knowledge itself is something. And what org anywhere at the present moment pre-serves it except, perhaps, for the staff for application? And yet it is an important commodity. So if you find out „Why does knowledge get lost?“ it gets lost because of the misun-derstood word. And that in itself is a magnificent piece of knowledge because nobody ever knew that before. How do things squirrel? How do they get altered? They get altered because of a mis-understood word. It is so good, and this is so positive as technology, that the other day I cleared up the whole capability of a person on post here on this ship by just listening to the trouble he was having – but mainly to how he was solving it. He was given a certain type of material to write, and when he read that – he read it, and it was telling him what to write for"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 4 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 140 16.12.09 mission orders and so on. As he told me, he said he went then and found a couple of old mis-sion orders of that particular type he was confused about and looked them up to see how that was done. Sounds perfectly okay, doesn’t it? Except this is a brand-new type of mission order that’s never been written before. And I said to my messenger, I said, „Would you please go down and find what misun-derstood word occurs immediately before that mission order type is discussed.“ Now, actually, I may be telling tales out of school, but it all has a very happy ending. The messenger spent two hours with him and finally found right alongside of it the word such, and he had never known what that meant. And that cleared up and his GIs came in and now he grasped the whole thing completely and he’s a howling success. The odd part of it is, he’s been worried for some months about the quality of what he was writing. And it all hung up on a little, tiny word in English. So this is the – is the first thing, then, that you would have to do to keep Scientology working and keep technology present. The reason why you have somebody in an org running Power on the pc before Dianet-ics because after he has expanded the Lower Grades his shoe straps need adjusting is because, usually, he doesn’t know the English word a, an and the. And wherever you find altered tech in an org you will find it preceded by a misunderstood simple word. And there is the source and point of alter-is exactly. If you were to go into ASHO at this moment and comb over all of those auditors who are having trouble with Power, you would find the verbal-data line was more acceptable be-cause they had already collided with a misunderstood simple English word. The big oddity being – and the huge – it – this is really a huge oddity – is that the complex terms of Dianetics and Scientology they take in their stride. People speak on this ship better Scientology than they do English. It’s an – it’s a fact. It’s a subject of survey. The reads occur on English. A person starts in, starts to read a bulletin, starts to read something, and what do you find? You would be sure that ARC break would read. It doesn’t, even when he’s got one. [laughter] But the word then reads. You actually have to see it to believe it. And your hands should get very dirty with this material, and you should get to a point where you know this so well that you never falter. Here is an HAS who was going back to his org. And we found that Word Clearing had dropped out recently on the FEBC, and so I said, „We’ve got to brief these fellows within two hours and get them on the plane. And there’s all these people. For heaven’s sakes, get yourself a bunch of auditors, do Method 2 on their mission orders.“ I will tell you the misunderstood words which read here on an FEBC graduate where Method 2 had not been in use for a while. Believe me, it’s in use now. Wow! There’s – handy automatic thumbscrews leap over and jump onto the supervisors the moment they – if every half hour they haven’t mentioned the word word, or meter, or Method 2. It’s set up as an"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 5 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 141 16.12.09 automatic computer and these thumbscrews jump out from the walls. [lauhgs, amusement in the audience] Listen to these words: organization, Flag, standard, know (k-n-o-w), HCO Area Sec, [laughter] briefed, fired, action, Flag Org Management, situation, HASes, demands, neglected, hatting, post, establishment, continued, maintain, why, policy, PLs, deviation, producing. Well, I will save you the rest of it; it goes on this way for four pages. There it is, the words are circled, and that’s the exact material this man had been studying for several months. So, what can you adjudicate from that? That there should be somebody in an organiza-tion that keeps this straight. In fact there should be an organization in the organization that keeps this straight. And as long as you do that, the organization will win, it will become pros-perous, the people will be happy and cheerful, and you get one of these scenes where the pub-lic walking along is slapping the staff on the back and congratulating them and telling them they are great fellows, and one of these places where tech is in and the public and the custom-ers are getting big wins and so on. You’ve seen an org when it’s in that state. And when its tech has gone, why, it’s not in that state. The public walks through sort of „Thuh-duh-yuhh” and they don’t really look at anybody very much, or they come in snarling, „You owe me an intensive. When are you going to do it?“ You know? And that is the difference. And when an org is jumping and enthusiastic and so on, there is a minimum of misun-derstood words in it. And when an org is „Oh, thud; ohh, don’t know,“ you think it comes from the significance of a GI, or from a – the fact that somebody isn’t buff-wuff, or the fact that somebody is raising hell with the staff, or something or something or something. No, no, no. The only difference between a very happy org and a very glum, let’s-all-commit-suicide-tomorrow sort of an org is simply the misunderstood word. Now, A good Qual, then, is perfectly capable of straightening out all the alter-is in an org and sending its stats up through the roof with no ethics at all. The degree of ethics that has to be applied in an org is directly proportional to the number of misunderstood words. So, if you do your jobs well, you won’t see an org get into one of these heavy-ethics scenes. Now, you say, well, what’s the difference between this Qual and any other Qual? Well, this is actually a different Qual – this is a different Qual. We take everything that we have known as a Qual, and if you are going to bring back in Review, and if you are going to do this or that or the other thing that a full Qual would do, it goes over into Department 15. Now, Division 5, Department 15 that – is now called the Department of Validity, and has a Director of Validity, and it has Qual Interview and Invoice, and it has the Examiner, and it has Certs and Awards. Now, of course, there is the Student Examiner, and there is the PC Examiner and there is – anything we once knew as Qual fits there. But there would also be here any Review; you know, public review of pcs – that would be there. A Review Auditor would be there. A cramming of students – that would be there. Any Qual that you’ve known has gone over to 15. And that leaves two other departments open."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 6 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 142 16.12.09 So, this is published in HCO Policy Letter 14 August 1971, Issue II. Now, that tells us where old Qual is. Now, all you really have to preserve of old Qual, however, today is the I & I (the Interview and Invoice), the Examiner (Student Examiner, Pc Examiner) and Certs and Awards. That’s all that has to be preserved. And they, of course, have to be there, and you’ll find out in one form or another those exist in most orgs. So the action is, is just to take anything they’ve got in Qual and say, „You’re now all Department 15,“ and then you put in the rest of it. They may have a Staff Training Officer. If they do have, that’s rare; but if they do have, he goes back over into 13. So, if they have a Staff Training Officer, he can be placed over into 13. But the main thing for you to know is that this is really a Mini Qual. And the new idea here – which was what was really meant in FBDL 101 when this first emerges – is that we are discussing a Mini Qual. We really aren’t discussing a full, big, dress-parade Qual. It will grow. Just make sure that it does. But it doesn’t take much to get in a small Qual. Now, they’ve got somebody over there who examines and makes up the certs. Well, good, put him over in 15. Now, what about I & I? Now, in view of the fact that Department 13 with Word Clear-ing has something to sell, you don’t want that invoiced on credit, particularly, so it can be sold from the Registrar. If it is delivered in 13, it can be sold from the Registrar, but in that case your Interview and Invoice would simply have to be shown the fact that it was invoiced. I wouldn’t try to start up a separate organization that was serving the public. There is no reason under the sun why the HGC cannot deliver Word Clearing, provid-ing they are grooved in. That doesn’t move all Word Clearing into the HGC. But you will sometimes find you have far too much Word Clearing to do, because I can assure you this will sooner or later get popular with the public. So I wouldn’t try to run a whole new org. I would keep it to the basic job of keeping Scientology working. So with this policy letter let us see what the basic structure is – the basic structure, not of the Qual Division, but of its communication lines. Now, a Mini Qual would be in the org and there would be a Qual Bureau, or it’s called a Correction Bureau in a CLO, and it’s Bu-reau 5a, because Training and Services is Bureau 5, and it is released with its Org Board of HCO Policy Letter 14 August 71. Well, you say, „But look, wait. That – if you look at this you find out that’s just the Enhancement Chief and Enhancement Establishment Section and the Org Qual Inspectors and so on. It doesn’t seem to give any service at all.“ So, therefore, one of these requires, either in Training and Services or the service org (nearly every one of these CLOs, and so forth, is ac-quiring some form of service org) – it’s got a little Mini Qual in it. So what you do is you run this little Mini Qual in the service org. you just make sure they have a Mini Qual. Then you make sure that Quals exist. And then you push into that Mini Qual this area here which says"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 7 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 143 16.12.09 Qual Personnel Training Section of the Bureau – you push that over into the service org and you make them run it along with their interne course. But as it exists right now, the idea is that in the org itself would be a Mini Qual and then there is a Bureau that takes care of it, and then we’re putting together a structure here on Flag. I am it just now, as far as the Flag Bureaux hat of running it is concerned, but it will tend to – it – move out and become established just as soon as we can establish these lines. They’re in the process of establishment, in other words. Now, I just wanted to show you – there – the basic line design is the Qual in the org, the Qual Bureau, Correction Bureau in the CLO, and then there is somebody in the Flag Bu-reaux who is looking after that line. So here is the way that you operate at org level. You have Division 5, Qual Org Board, and it has a Qual Sec and a Deputy Qual Sec for Org Admin. Now, you say, „Well, wait a minute. The Qual Sec’s the senior, so he attends the Ad Council.“ Well, that’s what’s wrong. We’ve already piloted that out years ago, and we found out that if we didn’t have an officer in Qual who went over and attended the Ad Council meetings and took care of all of the internal org – divisional administration duties, that the Qual Sec never had a prayer. He couldn’t do his job. So it’s really – that’s really the beginning – and this is where it began – of the product officer-org officer system – began in Qual on Flag. And that Deputy Qual Sec, he takes care of all the organization or Org Officer actions. He makes sure that you get personnel, he attends Ad Council meetings, he runs around and argues with people about this or that, and defends them off. And the Qual Sec keeps Qual running. Now, Department 13 is basically a department for the org itself, and therefore if De-partment 13 is in and functioning, the org will come straight. And if Department 13 isn’t functioning, the org won’t come straight. So, you’re fond of believing that the org would be established and formed and would run all right from HCO. No, it won’t; because after HCO establishes it, then Department 13 must be there to make it functional. After they have hatted some bloke in HCO, why, they find out that he didn’t want – he actually wasn’t qualified to run lawn mowers. So there’s a close cooperation between Department 13, Department of Personnel En-hancement, and HCO, particularly with the Hatting Section. And Department 13 will be found to be failing to the degree that Department 3, Ethics, is functioning. After you get one of these things operating from the Bureau 5, CLO level, you could just go in – to inspect 13 – go into Department 3 and see how busy, how empty or how upset that area was with regard to ethics actions and it would give you the instant index of whether or not they had a functioning Department 13. Because this is basically Personnel Enhancement. You notice that isn’t Personal Enhancement, but it actually could be. But if you called it Personal Enhancement then it would seem like a public area which it really isn’t. The expansion of the org – so great is the technical burden that this unit carries – the expansion of the org is totally dependent, really, upon the functioning of that one department. So, you got a new staff member of some kind or another – he’s just been hired or something –"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 8 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 144 16.12.09 he must be brought in there and programed. I don’t care what personnel interviews he’s had; he’s got to be brought in and programed one way or the other. Now, having been programed, why, then he can be put on to his training cycles and so on. Well, you’re not necessarily going to train this fellow, because there usually is some kind of a staff study course, and that is best run in the academy. And we find all formal train-ing that goes down the line on a checksheet does not prosper in Qual, but prospers in the Academy or the Department of Training, just like any other area, even when its irregularly timed. That is to say, if the fellow – it’s a part-time; that also applies to part-time. You have three training periods in the day or something of that sort, and it’s just another part of the Academy. You don’t want anything to do with it. But the Staff Training Officer that sees that people get to it and so forth, as a post, would be here and would probably be combined with programing. So, what is this fellow being trained on? Well, he’s being trained on this, that and the other thing and so on. So the first action that you get in 13 is programing. And if you program everybody in the place, why, you’ve got it made. And the one thing which a Department 13 – when it’s first put in – always has done without any exception whatsoever is program everybody off his post, and it unstabilizes the whole org and that’s the end of it. That is inevitably the first thing that occurs to anybody. And I suppose they get it off the staff. Well, a fellow comes in, he’s just been hired to fix up the garden or something of the sort: „I want to be an FEBC, and so forth, and I want to become the Executive Director.“ And the green programer sits there and he works it all out, and he says, „You take this and you take that and then you go to Flag and so forth.“ And a while later you say, „What’s the matter with the lawn?“ „Well, as a matter of fact, he’s studying.“ He isn’t studying anything to do with his post. And what is violated is this HCOB on the supreme test of the thetan: They haven’t gotten to A so can never go to B. The supreme test of a thetan is, can he start at A and go to B? And you will be mystified many times as why people never get to B. Well, they never get to B because they’ve never arrived at A. And the A in this case is he must be programed on to the post which he has been assigned. And if he fully makes that post he will now be at A. And having accumulated some good stats and some good service on that post, he will have enough of a win, he will be sufficiently confident, that he can then be programed to a new post, B. And he may occupy the post at A for some little time while studying for B, but that will be in the latter part of his career on A. Do you follow? That is inevitably... we have found that to be inevitable. This is the one point which we’ve got to watch like a hawk, is in programing. Are they programing them on to their post or off of their post?"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 9 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 145 16.12.09 It’s very simple to program somebody on to his post, unless he doesn’t want to be it or something. But you’ll find usually that if he doesn’t want his post he doesn’t know what it is, and that is usually what happens, so you get into a Word Clearing action. And you’ll find that’s very interesting – confusions which you have to deal with in programing. And therefore, you have to have a fairly good line whereby the programmer isn’t totally tied up with Word Clearing. He must be able to move the fellow aside to get some words cleared, otherwise he’ll never get any programing done. Because when you’re Word Clearing Method 2, it can take a long while and the programmer won’t get any programing done. And if you find that programing is backlogging, it will merely be because it is doing too much Word Clearing to program. And so you must have a line that moves the person who is being programed, who is all bleah on the subject and so on, and he has to have words cleared on the post which he has and so on – then he’s got to be moved over to Word Clearing to do Method 2. Now, you’ve been grooved in here recently that Word Clearing only does Method 1, but there is – nobody said that is the case. Actually, it’s got such a backlog of Method 1 Word Clearing that it’s flat out to get it done. So therefore programing can get very badly jammed up on Word Clearing. So there is no absolute rule that the programmer cannot word clear on 2 – he would have to be able to – but that if he’s getting too tied up on the subject and if his job is backlogging, why, then it had better become a matter for the Word Clearing Unit, and you make it. And you’ll find out that Word Clearing is the basic difficulty with programing. You sit there and listen to all these considerations of one kind or another and if you buy them, you’re dead. It’s all a misunderstood word. And you say, „Well, of course, nobody“ – you see, you can be so reasonable about it – „of course, nobody under God’s green earth would want to work in – some department or another. We know the boss of it is mean or something. No-body’d want to work there.“ And of course, you know, you get terribly reasonable. „And who would want such a low-level post?“ You see? And you can think of a lot of things like this, and after you’ve „thunk“ them all up, [laughs] then you find out that he doesn’t know what the word “hat” means, or something, you see? It becomes ridiculous. And almost anybody is better for being able to actually get to a... point A and get some successes on it – and get some successes on it and move on up the line. It is those who haven’t done that from whom we have had the most trouble. Let me show you another mechanism here, and this is another point in programing which is terribly important to you. Is, there is a system followed out (it was invented by psy-chologists, believe it or not) that if an individual does not fit in one part of an org, then he possibly has aptitude which will fit him in another part of the org! And this is one of the rea-sons that lies back of musical chairs. And you say, „Well, this fellow isn’t doing all right as a mail clerk; let’s see whether or not we can’t put him on as Reception in Division 6, and maybe he can function there.“ And remember that that is a psychologist’s idea. And the second you start that, you’re dead. And here’s why you are dead. Because there will probably be so few people in Divi-sion 6 that the next thing you know, you’ve got him as a department head or the Distribution"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 10 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 146 16.12.09 Secretary. And then, because he is so easily spareable, he’s sent off for some high-level train-ing or something and you’ve really begun it. When you program staff to trans... when you permit staff by programing and so on to be transferred over – not having made it on this post, to be transferred over to another post – it is normally into a part of an org which is empty of personnel. And that means that it has a scarcity of seniors, and that means the next thing you know, he will be the director of some-thing. And because the personnel is still scarce, he will wind up as a secretary of the division, and then you’ll wonder why that division doesn’t work. Well, the division doesn’t work, not because he’s a bad hat, but because he has never made A. And so he will just carom around as a random particle in the org from there on out. And you start unstabilizing people without programing them very thoroughly and it really unstabilizes the whole org. Do you see how the thing is? So this guy comes in and he smokes dope and he – it’s horrible and it’s terrible, and he’s got a father that is PTS to his grandmother, and – and the – oh, it’s awful. And you say, „Well, nothing could be done with this.“ Well, American efficiency – it’s actually a French system, I think, originally and had a name; it had a name. You just kept firing people – you kept hiring and firing people till you wound up with some people who could function. And that actually is a system that is followed by American business, the army – it’s not followed by the government. The government exclusively deals with people who can’t function; they get rid of all the guys who can. The system... [laughter] So, you have to watch this. So you have to have some knowledge of the Personnel Se-ries and transfers and HAS policies. But you have to watch this with great care that you don’t just suddenly get somebody in there and start programing people off their post. The first ques-tion of programing is „Has he made the post he is on?“ And that is the duty of Personnel Pro-graming, is to get him to make the post he is on. And when he is may... sure, maybe he got misposted; yeah, maybe. Maybe he’s supposed to be a Dir Comm runner and he’s only got one leg. If that’s so, that’s tough. It’s at that point you become completely unreasonable. He’s got to make the post he’s on, and you can do it; you can do it with Word Clearing and so forth. And he will eventually sit down and he’ll do this post, and he’ll have a win and he will be able to function with the post. And after a while, why, he was – his stats will be in such a shape that he can be programed for a promotion or to somewhere else. I mean, just do it with a one, a two, a three. In other words, get him to A and then get him to B, and it’s very sensible. But then they come in and say, „This person hasn’t any real aptitude in the subject of arithmetic, and we don’t want him anymore in Income. Our stats have been wrong every day for the last...“ You know? HCO old-think is, „Oh, well, we’ll have to get somebody who knows arithmetic, and so we’ll transfer that fellow off. We’ll send him to Distribution Division. There is no Distri-bution Sec right now... And ah...“ [amusement in the audience] So the net result of the thing is, is the org is just in continuous upheaval because – not because they are all bad hats, be-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 11 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 147 16.12.09 cause nobody has ever made anything, and they are all unstable on their posts because there’s no – nobody in the org has ever made the post that he was put on to begin with! You can normally trace the breakdown of a personnel in an org from the first post he was removed from, and that is interesting in the field of programing. Somebody was put on one time as an Aide and was taken off as an Aide – and this is the sad part of it – really not taken off for incompetence. The person didn’t understand that they were being posted temporarily. When the person was taken off as an Aide, went promptly into a decline and went round and round and round. It was just a temporary posting; they were sent to a divisional secretary afterwards. And that haunted that person for the better part of a year. And if you want to know what the basic on the chain was, this person carried around the idea that on posts she failed, and that was – her relationship to a post was something on which one failed. Became very frightened of losing every post that she was on, and so on. Just trace back – a minor auditing job actually. But it won’t clear up until you trace it back to the first post they lost, because there was probably an earlier post, and they didn’t make that post because they weren’t programed on to it, so programing is very important. They didn’t study the things necessary to make the post. And that’s why you get reversion, or demotion or reversion, as a possible answer to this situation. Now, programing could be so extreme that this person is absolutely not making it at all in some point of the org. And you try in vain to find out – well, you find out they never got programed on to it; they haven’t held a post in the org yet. You, actually, in extremis, in con-sultation with HCO, could recommend that the person occupy the first post – not the first post they were successful on, but just go back and occupy the first post they ever occupied, and so on, and get programed on to this post and actually make it, and get programed on up the line. In other words, let’s get this thing straight. Now, let me show you that there’s a comparison to this in auditing. The way to straighten out somebody who has had fifteen different programs run on him is to go to the first one that was not completed and finish it, and go to the next one that was not completed and finish it and so on. He’ll come out right as rain. You got it? So anything that you do in auditing has a comparable level in the field of programing. If you can wrap your wits around that, why, you got it made. It’s just like auditing, program-ing. I’ve got somebody right now who won’t study his SO Member Hat. It was the first thing on his checksheet and he missed it; because he’s too busy, he has got to do something else. Now, my think in that is, „Let’s see, what post was this guy put on that he missed? What wasn’t he ever on?“ Now, one of the ways you could handle the whole thing is find out what post he was never programed properly on to and then program him properly on to that post, and he will..."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 12 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 148 16.12.09 Because from here on he will just start caroming around the org. He’s already bleh-uh-uh. So I’m just giving you the example of think. „Oh, well, this fellow – he’s having awful trouble and he doesn’t want this program, he wants some other program.“ See, alter-is, alter-is. All right. Well, he’s got misunderstood words galore on some earlier post that he was on. He’s in a – he’s in a mess somehow or other, but basically the program is out. He must have tried to take off from – tried to take off B without ever having gotten there, and he’ll – he’s just going to go on from there; he’s going to be in a mad state. Oh, you could get him to study, you could audit him, you could do this, you could do that, you could do the other thing with him, and you might or might not be able to bring him straight. But programing has it in its power to get it straight and just make a recommendation and say, „All right, now this fellow is having an awful time with the fellow, and he’s just goofing up like mad, and so forth. Let’s look – go back through the personnel records, or let’s interview him and let’s find out what post he failed on.“ Now, of course, there’s posts earlier than the organization that he may have failed on. So how do you handle that? You can’t go back and make him be a bank clerk and so on. Well, there’s where auditing comes in, and it would have to be auditing directly on former posts. You’d have to straighten it out by auditing. But in the continuous restimulation in an envi-ronment of lost posts in the organization, he’s not going to make it unless you really do get him programed on to everything he’s missed. You’ll find people who have started eight courses and have not finished any of them. If you expect them to finish any courses now without going back and finish course number one, forget it; because on course number one they’ve got enough misunderstood words and things to make them blow off of it and all the remaining lot. It’s important. So, therefore, programing has its own special skill, but it’s most horse sense, and if you just treat it as though you’re laying out auditing programs for the fellow, well, you’re all right. You know the fatality of putting a fellow on an auditing program af... „Let’s audit him – let’s audit him from Power up, without touching Dianetics or Grades.“ You’re not going to do it. „Let’s – let’s not finish anything on the case and then wonder what’s wrong with him.“ So, that’s what it takes and that’s the basic think of programing. Now, I don’t have to go into Word Clearing very strenuously for the excellent reason that it is the Word Clearing Series, and it’s the most self-explanatory series that anybody has ever laid out. I’ve been working on this. Actually, the brother, or the cousin, the – well, let me say it this way, the grandfather of the word clearing series is the Sea Watch Picture Book. And Mary Sue did that, and we found out that it was difficult to teach people the complexities of bridge duties and ship handling. And she worked for a long, long, long, long time and I said, „Look, the people with whom you are dealing are TV oriented, they are visual oriented, so let’s – let’s – let’s get out a picture book.” And she worked and worked and worked on this and she got out a Sea Watch Picture Book."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 13 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 149 16.12.09 Now, it’s interesting on lost tech – I found out the other day that one of the reasons we are having a little trouble on the bridge is they sort of lost their copies of the Sea Watch Pic-ture Book, and people were getting specialist training without having the general training first of the Sea Watch Picture Book. You could get a similar thing: without anybody doing the basic bulletins of the Word Clearing Series, why, he all of a sudden is specialized as a Word Clearer. You get the idea? He’s specialized in picking up single words, and he doesn’t know anything about Method 1 or the rest of those. You get a kind of a messy thing because he doesn’t know the scene. So the Sea Watch Picture Book gave them the scene. And after they’ve done the Sea Watch Picture Book, why, then you can specialist train them on these things and it’s immedi-ate, very quick; they’re right on the ball. But that is the great-grand daddy of this and that’s why you see some pictures involved in this thing, and it communicates with great speed; peo-ple are not having any trouble with it at all. And the reason why it has to be communicated that way is it’s wrong with everybody who reads it. And boy, does it have to have a velocity of communication, because it itself is communicating about what is wrong with the person to whom it is communicating on the ex-act subject. [amusement in the audience] And that is something for you to realize when you are getting it across. So, therefore, you will see that it has pictures. And pictures are a very, very good mechanism for the communication of it. Don’t think you can get away bypassing misunderstood words by getting somebody to simply punch a button, or do an automatic type of procedure, that if you just do this and that, why, then that will come out true – an automatic type of procedure. The whole civilization at this time is trying to bypass lack of comprehension by mak-ing men into machines. And you’ll find in the Basic Staff Hat, Volume 0, OEC Course, it says this is a bit bad to do because you spoil the individual’s initiative. What does man have that is valuable? Man has initiative. He can be causative. And when you try to make him over into a machine it’s just an effect. It doesn’t get very effective. That’s why you find me every once in a while beginning to get very, very cross if I find people are demanding too many orders. It’s not that I mind giving them orders. I have done my TR 0 on regiments as far as that’s concerned. I can give orders. I can give them in the streams. But when they are demanding too many orders, something is wrecking their initiative. The basic thing that wrecks their initiative is the misunderstood word. So if you find an org has too many misunderstood words in it, it will demand orders. It will demand that people say, „Pick up your right foot and put it in front of your left foot, and then pick up your left foot and put that in front of your right foot. That’s a good boy. Now, pick up the right foot – .“ So therefore – I say I don’t have to go into the technology of Word Clearing, but how Department 13 uses it is quite important – therefore, you automatically and immediately as-"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 14 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 150 16.12.09 sume that every time anybody is hatted that he must be word cleared on his hat Method 2 – instant, instant assumption. HCO gives itself huge points, vaulting graphs, everybody is hatted and raaaaw! It’s terrific and so forth. And your automatic assumption is that they’ve been hatted but they don’t know what the hat means because they got misunderstood words in it, and that they won’t be able to operate in that sphere until you clean them up and loosen them up on that subject. And that is the assumption of Department 13. „Yeah, he’s been hatted” (quote, unquote). Well, it’s up to you to take the quotes off and put an exclamation point after hatted. Some people favor hatting by taking a German helmet, putting it on the fellow’s head and hitting him with a sledgehammer. Now, that – they get very, very upset on this subject because people who (quote) „have been hatted“ don’t seem to be able to perform the functions of the post for which they have been hatted. The mystery of all that is simply the misunderstood word, and the cure for it is that one gets the person to read the most fundamental and basic materials. It doesn’t even matter if the hat is terribly extensive; you merely want the earliest materials or descriptions of this hat. And you want him to read that Method 2 while you comb it out of the E-Meter. And all of a sudden you will find the most miraculous things start occurring with regard to this hat. So, you have a direct, definite relationship to hatting, and nobody is really hatted until he has gone through 13 fully. Now, you’ve probably wondered why it’s called Method l, Method 2 and Method 3. Let me give you a sequence here that is very applicable to this department: Method l, Method 2 and Method 3 – because they normally start in doing Method 3, and then they do Word Clearing on materials, Method 2, and then they get picked up and Method 1 is done on them. So obviously they’re numbered backwards, aren’t they? No. They belong just the way they are, because the first thing you do on somebody is general Word Clearing, Method 1, and then you do Method 2 on the materials which he has, and after that he will get smart enough him-self to do Method 3. [laughter, laughs] Do you notice in Academies and so forth they’re doing it in reverse? They have them combing all the time with Method 3, Method 3, Method 3. No, no, no. No, no. Here’s some oddities which can occur. I saw somebody the other day, wouldn’t attest their Method 1 Word Clearing because they had spent all morning studying, doing Method 2, and found out there were a lot of words they didn’t understand. The moral of that is, get them to attest at once! [laughter, laughs] It’s a misnomer to some degree; when we say „clearing“ we think in terms of an abso-lute. Well, all you’ve done with Method 1 Word Clearing is get the fundamental basics out that have been hanging them up for the last few billion, and you get those out of the road so that it’s easy to do 2, so it doesn’t take you seven hours to clear the word „the“ because it is hung up on the word „gahg“ [laughs] way, way, way, way back. Do you follow? So that is"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 15 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 151 16.12.09 actually – you’re just doing a whole-track clearing on this subject so that he can think on this subject. Now, when you do a Method 2 before you’ve done a Method 1 it’s going to take a very long time, I can assure you, because you are sort of like – you are running a late engram on the chain, and it will grind. Do you see? „ABCD, ABCD.“ Clean up the word „the.“ „ABCD, ABCD, ABCD.“ Oh, God! „Use it in a sentence again.“ [laughs] Well, it’s just too late on the chain. Now that you’ve pulled the basics with Method 1, why, now it’s very easy to do 2. And you always save time by doing it Method 1, Method 2, Method 3. And you’ll save a great deal of time. And so, the proper sequence to handle anybody on this line is Method 1, Method 2 (blow Method 3 – leave that to him, leave it to the Academy, leave it to somebody else, see? You won’t do very much Method 3), and then Purpose Clearing. Now, in relationship to hatting – since this is a Personnel Department, in relationship to hatting, you want to do your Method 2 on anything associated with his post. Now, if you had somebody who was in the Estates Section who ran the car, you would want to Method 2 word clear the instruction manual put out by the manufacturer about that car. If he was an auditor, you would want to take the first bulletins of his level and Method 2 word clear them, and then take his auditor hat and Method 2 word clear it. Now, he is an auditor, he is going to be – have a post as an auditor. After you’ve done all that, Post Purpose Clear him. Don’t try Post Purpose Clearing before you have done Word Clearing because you’ll be doing them both at once, because the funny part of it is that Post Purpose Clearing is very dependent upon Word Clearing. So if you even start talking about the purpose of the post, or wanting the post or something like that, without doing some Word Clearing in con-nection with the thing, why, you start getting in trouble. So your programing actually will collide with this rather continuously, and it’s a con-tinuing phenomena. You’ll continuously be getting somebody that you’re trying to post clear while you are trying to program. So programing will run into both of these things simultane-ously. And if it gets too rough do Method 1 Word Clearing, then Method 2 Word Clearing on anything you want to, then do the programing, and finally do your Post Purpose Clearing. Do you follow? And then you could go even further and do an even more thorough hat clean. Do you see why these things are arranged that way? Now, you say, „Well, that isn’t standard.“ Well, no, not all people you meet will have the same degree or volume of misunderstoods. Some people want their posts but don’t know much about the words, and some people think they know a great deal about the words and are sure they don’t want their post, and there’s combinations of this sort of thing. So in programing, in general programing, you will probably be able to get through, and you say, „Well, now, you’ve got to do this. You’ve got to do your Staff Status I and your Staff Status II.“ And the fellow will sit there, you know, bawh. Now, all that is great, all that"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 16 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 152 16.12.09 is great right up to this point. The fellow didn’t bother to tell you that he doesn’t understand and doesn’t want the post. But that will be expressed in other ways, so that you’ll know that you’ve goofed. Because there’s another thing now I must tell you about programing. We find out that after a person has signed – has been programed (let’s go back to programing, because this has a definite interrelationship) – after the person has been programed, he has to be taken to the registrar and put on a course. And that is a duty of Department 13. We find that about 60 per-cent get lost between programing and the course. And if you don’t program them, take them there, enroll them for that, get them down and get them on the roll book of the course so they can be mustered, you’ll miss. You’ll miss all over the place. And that’s one of the things that we have learned here recently. We have quite a bit of practical experience on this, by the way. It’s not all airy-fairy by a long way. So that if you want to get the staff really wheeling on their part-time study and that sort of thing, the second the programer does so, he either himself, or if you are lucky enough to have a page and so on, the guy is taken immediately and enrolled for the first course, and is taken down and put on the roll book of that course that he is to report there at 7 o’clock. That’s it. Yeah, good. Thank you. You’re all fine now. Now you’ve got some – now you’ve got a Staff Training Officer or you have a Course Supervisor, or whoever is running this – it doesn’t much matter – but you do have a course, and the fellow is on the course, and he can be mustered, and he can be treated as a blown stu-dent. Up to that time he can’t be treated as anything, can he? So he can be lost between that and programing. So if you want to do a good job, just remember that. Soon as he’s – soon as he’s programed, fine, there is his program. He’s supposed to do Staff Status I, Staff Status II, so on and so on. It wouldn’t matter. You have an auditor, he wants to move up the line; he is a Class VI; you are going to make him into a Class VII in ASHO, something like that. Good, you pro-gram him up. He’s supposed to come over there for programing him. You program him up. He’s supposed to do Class VII; he’s supposed to do so-and-so and so-and-so. And he’s got certain administrative hats or something like this that you find out that he’d better do – what-ever it is. And he says, „That’s fine,“ and he walks out and thinks that that’s it. No. No. No. No! he is taken immediately to the registrar – even though it’s a no-charge invoice for some-thing like that – he is taken immediately to the Registrar, he is signed up, he is taken into the vicinity of where that course is actually taught and he is put on the roll book of that course, and there you are. Now, if you’ve done that far, he will probably keep going with the rest of the program. But you can – in periodic roundups you can always catch those that have fallen off the course they were enrolled on, or who need to be re-enrolled for the next one. Of course, the answer of that is, get ahold of him, say, „You’ve finished that. That’s fine. Good.” And take him back and get him enrolled for the next unit of it."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 17 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 153 16.12.09 So, it’s the job of this department to be causative on get them through. Now, do you see how to play that little piano? Programing, word clearing, hatting and so forth. They are played – these elements. And they might line up in different ways or some-thing, but you play these elements one against the other and it all comes out straight. And you’ve got the guy, he’ll be happy in life, he’ll be a staff member, he’ll be winning, everything is going along fine, he can do his job and move on up the line. Now, you notice there’s something missing and it’s missing in most orgs. It’s also missing on this policy letter because one didn’t want to throw too much into this Mini Qual. But the next thing you’re going to have to get in is staff auditing, which is really staff staff auditing. Staff auditors. If you don’t have a staff auditor or two starting to add over there, and with a large staff, has a staff C/S, why, you are going to be in bad shape. There is one other successful way of getting a staff audited without having a large staff auditing section, and that is by scheduling auditors whose hours are down through the D of P so that staff is fed in to make up lost auditing hours. And it’s an efficient method of spending the coins of the org. We used to do this in a very complicated fashion, but very successful, when we were giving week’s intensives – a week-long intensive. And the staff member who wanted a week-long intensive paid the pay and – forwent his own pay and paid the pay of the auditor who was auditing him. That’s – the most staff auditing I ever saw is when we did that. Gave up his pay for the week and the auditor was actually paid by the pay that was given up by the staff member. Every time they had an idle auditor, they would feed in a staff member. And then people were made very sure that they had plenty of auditors and so on. That was a workable system – Washington. Nowadays, they believe that everybody should get all of his processing free and so forth on staff, and that may be a good thing and it may not be a good thing. I’ll tell you why it may not be a good thing – because it doesn’t happen. That may be what’s wrong with it. So there are no distinct policy letters which tell you what system you must use to do this. There are some that say staff’s entitled to this, that or the other thing, or something like that. But all of that is subject to amendment. The earliest policy letters relating to this are the system which I just told you. The staff member gave up his pay for the week and paid the auditor for that week because the auditor was idle that week. They carried on an extensive auditing staff, and as soon as they didn’t have a pc for that week, why, the staff member gave up his pay. Now, you say this was terrible because you would have staff members missing all over the org. But actually it would only be two or three guys off staff, and then we’d make some sort of a proviso that they had to keep up their current work after hours so that it didn’t jam and various other little things would occur. Maybe that wasn’t so good and it didn’t – wasn’t prevalent. Usually it was held from above or some senior would hold it. But it didn’t ever show up in the stats of the org."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 18 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 154 16.12.09 So a guy got twenty-five hours all in one whack, and that was it. And that was the most successful staff auditing program that we have ever had, which is interesting, just to give you some sideline on it. Now, the one which is current and so on would add, in addition to your Word Clearing auditors and your Purpose Clearing auditors and so on, would add a C/S and staff auditors hired especially to do nothing but audit staff. And you’ve got a choice. And you say, „Well, that’s bad,“ and so on. Well, I haven’t seen it successful which is why I am giving you a choice. I would say it would be much better just to tell the D of P, „Why don’t you hire some auditors? You know, let’s knock off this two-man-HGC stuff here. Let’s get some auditors. Let’s get some auditors in here.“ You say, „well, that would be the HAS.“ No, it isn’t. It’s the D of P and it has been for ages. „Let’s get some auditors,“ and so on. And they say, „Well, our hours are up. Our hours are up. I don’t see why you’re hot. We got up to seven hours and twenty minutes last week,“ you know? [amusement in the audience] No, hire some auditors, hire some C/Ses, and get some enthusiasm going. Because there’s a certain amount of PR and campaigning that you always have to do from Personnel Enhancement or from Qual. And don’t think that you don’t have a PR function. And I don’t see that PR function being used, so I’m stressing it. Get a campaign going. „You know that if we could hire about seven more auditors, all of you guys could get audited – wouldn’t that be terrific? – because we would feed you in two and three a week on intensives.“ „I don’t see why the D...“ – it’s also black propaganda, you see: „I don’t see why the D of P doesn’t hire some auditors, you know?” [amusement in the audience] “What’s the mat-ter with those people over there in the Auditors’ Association and so on? Why don’t they have some interesting programs and attract some auditors in there, and so on and so on, and hire some people and...“ Propaganda, black propaganda. „I don’t see why not.” You see, makes it black propaganda and mention verbally around the place, you know, „I don’t know, I don’t think Joe is so good. You know, he hasn’t” [laughs] “hired any auditors lately. You know? And so and so and so.“ That’s black propaganda. But the OODs of an org are very, very, very polite. „A meeting was held in Personnel Enhancement yesterday“ – a notice in the OOD, you see – „and it was mentioned that if the D of P and the HAS would cooperate and hire twelve more auditors that we would be able to get the staff audited.“ You know? It doesn’t say you are doing anything about it at all, don’t you see? Propaganda. Propaganda. You have to keep it going. You have to keep it going on a lot of points: one, that the staff should study, that they should be hatted, that they should get au-dited and so on. Now, people agree with this, people agree with this, but very often in the pressure of GI and production and completions and so on, it can drop out as a factor. So that it would be up to Qual to keep this mentioned – these points mentioned. It’s actually the points of hatting, and the points of auditing staff. And if you’re not on the ball with keeping this going, why, it"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 19 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 155 16.12.09 drops out, and you become inactive and so can’t do your job because you’re not supported by public opinion. Your public, you see, are the individual staff members. And if you keep that going and keep that public pressing in this direction and so on, they’ll say, „Oh, yeah, that’s a good thing. Yes, yes, we ought to have a second HGC. And, yes, and so on. We should have four C/Ses. And yeah, we should have four HGCs as a matter of fact. And there ought to be a spe-cial Course Supervisor for crew study time, and you know? And, well...“ Propaganda, propa-ganda, propaganda. You keep pushing it out and people become aware these things exist and that they – it’s a should-be. So what you want to happen is you make a should-be out of it. Very simple. GI was down this week and they’re all saying why: It’s because everybody went to the football game, and the public is mah-smah-smah-smah. You make sure that your Qual Sec is smart enough to answer up, „The Why is the staff isn’t hatted! Can’t be hatted because there’s no staff course. Needs a Supervisor. ‘What Is a Course?’ PL needs to be in.“ You know? „That’s why your GI is down.“ See, it’s all these points. You have to keep looking for the points where you can enter the propaganda. People say, „That isn’t the Why,“ but they remember it. [laughter, laughs] So, there’s a certain amount of, as I say, propaganda goes forward. And I would personally believe – the only time I see, actually, lots of staff auditing oc-curring is when it is done during slack times and so forth in the HGC. And just adopt the prin-ciple that there should be lots of HGC or even HGC II or III or special cases, or anything else. Lots of that. The public always will buy auditing. And just keep overhiring, overtraining num-bers, you see. And then with this idea of feed your staff in there every time there is a blank auditor. And not on a bit-and-piece basis. Let me give you a warning on that. It won’t do you a bit of good to take Nancy Glutz and audit her for two hours in February, one hour in July and five hours in September. To hell with it. Put a pc tag on her, get the program there and crash her through. In the first place no C/S – there’s another point to this – no C/S could write a program that would cover that. Nobody could write the auditing program, because it stale dates in-stantly. And one of the greatest points of outness you will find in tech is stale dating C/Ses and stale dating programs. A C/S stale dated one week is dangerous. A program stale dated a month is sudden death. You pick up this folder – what’s happened for the last month? It’s the old principle that you have to audit them fast enough to get them competent in the environ-ment they’re in before the environment can knock their heads off again. And this stale date means the fellow was audited and then somebody did the next C/S and he was fine, you see? But two weeks later he’s being audited, but it doesn’t go right at all. Now, what is going hay-wire with it? Well actually in the meantime he’s been arrested, he’s lost his dog, and his wife is suing him for divorce. [laughter] And you know, standard, normal operating Earth proce-dure has been occurring."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 20 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 156 16.12.09 Now, the bad part of this is, I have actually kept track of this recently, and I have found out something that will be of considerable value to you. I do, not a lot, but I do some – enough skull watching – that is to say, I see somebody is down or is having a hard time and I will call for their folder. This is obviously a Qual Sec’s duty. And it certainly is something that Personnel Enhancement and so on, as far as staff is concerned, would have as a duty whether it’s mentioned or not. Call for the fellow’s folder and look through it and see what’s cooking and do some sort of a program for it, or get some sort of a program on it. And get the guy some auditing, see? Now, in five instances, I have done that of recent times and my C/S line fell out. It’s almost an unthinkable thing. Nobody had – it’s just never happened before, but my C/S line fell out. That is to say, when I sent down a folder with an LRH C/S in it, it’s – for the last twenty years it is done in the morning before they audit any public pcs, practically, see? But all of a sudden, these things were being neglected for a period of time, and they stale dated. And nobody told me that they hadn’t been done and that they had stale dated. But people then trying to audit or follow through this program, of course, were auditing a different situation, a different pc. Do you see? The pc’s case had changed and so on. One of them was permitted to stale date since February. They just didn’t pick up the program and carry the thing through due to pressures – terrific backlogs and pressures the thing was going into. But it was something that hadn’t happened to me ever before, so it was a brand-new experience. Five of these cases that I had already done this with, and they either lost their posts or became seriously ill by the neglect of that. I followed them through, I checked it up during this last year. And because the C/Ses weren’t done, and the programs weren’t done – they would have handled them, don’t you see – and nothing was done with them and they had a bad time. They had a bad time. If somebody had sat down and done those C/Ses, they wouldn’t have. I followed the thing through. We were doing an investigation on this, basically trying to find out why there wasn’t an – a rapid pickup of these things and straightening it out. And that was when it came up that a stale dated – I’d never had a stale dated C/S or program before. And when you stale date programs and C/Ses you get into trouble. So, there is a certain amount of authority involved here. Now, you understand that when we talk about a Mini Qual we’re talking about a Qual in formation. That would – it would have to have a Personnel Enhancement, see? It would have to be able to do these programing, Word Clearing functions. We’re even getting fancy from a Mini Qual when we say it has to have a page. We’re getting very fancy when it has a medical officer. But all those functions are absolutely essential to the conduct of Department 13. The functions which are mentioned here you can’t live without – if those functions are out."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 21 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 157 16.12.09 Now, when we start to build this up further and we start to go into staff auditing, we could put a c/s in there who fed the cases through to an HGC, or we could put staff auditors in there. Now we are getting up someplace. Now, at that time, we would start putting in a Chap-lain. So I’m just showing you, you must regard this as a Mini Qual org board. It wouldn’t matter if you had one man in Department 13, he would be the Programmer, the Word Clearing auditor, the Purpose Clearing auditor; he’d be the Page, and he’d be the Medical Officer. One man. Those functions are vital. Now, as you begin to build the thing up, you will find out that you’re starting to graduate up from a Mini Qual, you would start putting in somebody like a C/S and you would put a Chaplain – and the Chaplain obviously belongs there. The Chaplain was originally in Qual and gave the Ethics Officer so much trouble and gave the Qual people so much trouble that we eventually put him into 6, but he does belong in 5. He belongs in Division 5. Because when all else fails, why, they can still go to see the chaplain. And we find out that it’s neces-sary to have somebody standing there to catch it and to reroute them sort of into the lines, because sometimes people neglect a person utterly. And if he’s got some terminal he can go to, why, maybe he can straighten it out and get unbugged. So that’s public. Now, the second you put the Chaplain in there you are starting to get into the public sphere. Now, you’re already going to be in the public sphere if you start Word Clearing in such a way. If you start Word Clearing in such a way that you’re selling Word Clearing, let me tell you a trick: be perfectly willing to C/S it and everything else, but make sure they beef up the HGC and do the Word Clearing there. You got it? Why? Because your staff will cease to have Word Clearing. So regardless of where the word clearing is done, Department 13 is the czar of Word Clearing. Even though HGC auditors were being grooved in, even though HGC auditors were being grooved in to word clear and that sort of thing, you would groove them in to word clear in Department 13. Wouldn’t matter who did it, you are still responsible for it. The C/Sing of it is still done from here. But if you let go of that, to the degree that you suddenly... You see, this department can make an awful lot of money. This department can make money left and right because Word Clearing is valuable. It gets word of mouth, strangely enough, like mad and is very salable. And you find at this point when public sale is denying the hatting and Word Clearing functions necessary to keep up your tech, you make sure that that moves straight over to the HGC. While retaining control of the quality of it, it’s done by HGC auditors. You don’t want anything more to do with it – as far as auditing it’s concerned – because you are essentially there as an exporter of knowledge. Do you follow? So, you’ve got to keep Word Clearing in regardless of who does it, and you’ve got to – make it sure that you are – just don’t get swamped. Now, you could actually start accounting for a third of the org’s GI with enthusiasm. The second you find yourself doing that, you know very well nobody is going to get hatted. What’s this org going to do? This org is going to go into a depression right away. New staff is"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 22 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 158 16.12.09 going to come on because it is expanding. Nobody is going to program them; nobody is going to make sure they get down training; nobody is going to propagandize the place: „Hey, how about hatting these people? How about training them on their hats? How about this? How about that?“ The second that goes out, your org is going to head right straight for a non deliv-ery or for such a bad quality delivery that that boom is going to crash. And I must tell you something about booms and depressions, and it has a great deal to do with Qual. When Qual does not keep up quality, it goes into – and delivery, it goes into a depression. We have finally traced down exactly how this happens. They get GI, GI, GI; they get more and more GI, and then the GI starts to go down, and then the GI starts to go down further. So they scream harder and harder and get new tricks for GI, and they try harder and harder to get more GI, and the GI goes down. And then they try and work and work and work and work to get in GI, and try and try and try and try and try to get in GI, and the stat goes down. And we found out that that was the fault of the EC WW network and why it ran into booms and depressions. And it’s even worse than that; it is why the society at large runs into booms and depressions. Booms and depressions were the bane of civilization up to about 1932. Now they’ve got just one long depression. [laughter] It has to do with delivery – it has to do with delivery. You’ll find out that England’s collapse as an empire might be assigned to many political mo-tives, but it ceased to deliver. You can’t get parts for English cars overseas; you can’t get this, you can’t get that. In England – in England you try to get a part for a motor: „Yeah, we’ll make it. It’ll be six months.“ They don’t deliver anymore. And that’s what’s happening to their pound and their currency. Let me tell you, there’s a success story going on right this minute. Somebody left Flag here – you’ll see it; it’s in, I think, LRH ED 151 – left Flag here, went back to Toronto. Org area was all upset and the things were all going geahh, and this, that and so on, and they are getting – trying – everybody has been fighting for GI, and ECUS was coming in there every twenty-four hours with a new mission (they weren’t missions, that was the trouble with them), and – and so on. And they were going wa-arr-arr-arr-rrr! The whole org was coming apart. Guy went back here. He actually went up to Okay to Audit VI. He had the idea of flubless auditing. We checked him through like mad on the thing. He went back. He was al-ready an HSST. He just started as part of his hat grabbing some folders – he was the Assistant Guardian – started grabbing some folders, saw bleh! „To hell with this. Tech is out in this joint.“ He opened up a Cramming. And boom! It’s the only org right now with it’s stats going right on up, because it’s delivering like mad. Nobody else delivering. There is a new stat been assigned to orgs; there’s a new harass system been assigned to orgs and so forth to get them to deliver. But that was what picked up the thing off the launching pad. There’s been reports in here about it and so on."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 23 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 159 16.12.09 This thing has been subjected, by the way, to an analysis that you wouldn’t believe. If you went down into CIC you would see these huge tapes all spread around walls, and infor-mation put up all over there. That is all it is, and that is booms and depressions. So when they try to get GI without delivering, they spoil the public, if the delivery quality is poor. And it wouldn’t matter how they screamed, if they’re not delivering good training, if they’re not delivering good auditing, if the stuff isn’t straight – that is the other thing. All they got to do is tell them that something is verbal or something isn’t done now, and the public leaves them alone in droves, because basically it’s knowledge, you see? And that is the one org right this minute that has its – it’s got its delivery stats are going right on up, and it’s got its GI going right on up, and the area is all cooling off and everything is getting into a fine, smooth flow. Their main trouble right now is just volume. But they got it. That’s the answer. It’s the answer to booms and depressions. So a guy would say, „GI! GI! GI! GI!“ Well, then Qual must say, „Quality! Quality! Quality! Quality! Quality! Deliver! Deliver! Deliver! Deliver! What do you mean having a ten thousand dollar week last week without also having a ten thousand dollar delivery? Yes, yes. Well, I know you can’t deliver it in the same week and nobody is telling you to, but you better deliver that backlog. How much undelivered services there is in this place? Well, you’ll have to hire 142 auditors, and that’s 30 auditors per HGC, and you will at once have to have...“ This is the way to think, see? „That tells you you will instantly have to have at least 5 C/Ses and 144 auditors. That’s good. Let’s get busy.“ Boom! „And it’s all got to be flubless and they all got to be on the ball and it’s all got to be done yesterday.“ Anybody can get in GI. Oh, it takes a trick, but it doesn’t take very many people to get in a GI; it takes quite an organization to deliver. And then it takes a very hot organization with a very, very, very hot Qual to deliver flublessly. So that brings us to 14. And 14 has something that they have never had before. Pubs Org is doing a great job of assembling policy. It’s got it assembled, is publishing it. There will be auxiliary books and so forth to supplement – to supplement the OEC volumes. There will be more to catch up with policy been issued since. But they’ve done a great job, and it has taken years. So that makes your job on that much easier. And they also are now beginning – because many of them are already in print – they are now beginning on equivalent volumes of OEC volumes, with all bulletins published consecutively. Following that will be a transcription of all tapes. But that’s quite a ways up the line. But, an Org Library. Now, there are certain packs... Let us take an ASHO. An ASHO that does not have available Power packs – I mean an SH that doesn’t have available Power packs – baahh! It’s a bad show. You’ll find most Power auditors, and C/Ses particularly, and so on, assemble their own packs and their own library and so on. Well, so, great, that’s fine; you are not a substitute for that. It’s an Org Library. And you just get your hands on at least two of every pack on tech or policy or anything else that has ever been issued. And you put a great big red stripe with a great big stamp on the master copy, which mustn’t be removed from the area, and you carefully sign out any spares that you have and you get them recov-ered. In other words, you have an actual library, not just some books lying around."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 24 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 160 16.12.09 And if you are really building the thing up, you should have a copy of every tape ever made. Now, that’s quite a library! But we actually would be in a position somewhere up the line to furnish that. But you certainly should have a basic copy of every tape being used in HCI, not just all the tapes in HCI. And that’s a full library. Now, you are in the business of knowledge. Well, that’s where it’s concentrated in the org. Now, the duties of the Librarian have not been written up, but they are simple enough. They do the standard duties of a librarian. They never let the master copy out. They could have some area there where somebody can sit and read and look up something. They always have a master copy of everything they own, and they answer questions. Now, that takes an interesting librarian because he’s the technical information center. Tech Information Center; so if there is any other technology that you are using, such as the lawn mower and so forth, he’s got it, too. So all booklets about all equipment in the org also belong in that library. Now, that Librarian has got to be enough on the ball to be able to look up this volume or be able to tell the guy, „Look in that volume, and here it is.“ Now, there’s actually – technical indexes have been made and we have been trying to get them issued, but they’re being issued along with this HCOB series. You’ll find that the OEC volumes are extremely good in their indexing. Information! Where can the guy go to see it? Not to be told verbally it. Where can the guy go to see it, and so on? Well, that is Department 14’s Library. That’s the knowledge cen-ter. And so, you don’t get verbal data lines or anything of the sort. And you also can get this kind of a situation. Some senior in Division 2 tells this fel-low immediately to move out all of those CF folders and so forth because they’re not using those now and something, and he says it’s in policy they should. And this fellow says, „That doesn’t sound very sensible to me. What ruh-rah-rah.“ He’s got to have some place to go where somebody will tell him what policy to look up. He may be quite green, he may not be that well trained. Do you follow? What is policy on this subject? Well, your librarian should be able to inform him. It’s not that he can backflash, particularly, but he would be guilty of following an illegal order. And following the illegal orders is what tears these orgs to pieces. Guys do illegal duties. They do projects which have never been okayed. They can be told anything. I saw a whole org ruined one time when somebody just sat there and told every staff member, whatever they wanted to do, „It’s against policy. Yeah, well, that’s against policy. Well, that’s fine, that’s a good idea to actually write invoices on people when they come in and pay money, but it’s against policy.“ It was almost that corny. Tore the org to pieces. Actually the org has just recently begun to lift its head. It was Washington, DC. There was no place anybody could go to find out what policy was. It was very scarce in the org. Now, that is also there because you’ve got your Cramming Section there. So, what happens with Cramming? A guy goes in, he’s told that he must not list more items past the BD FN item, and he is told by the C/S that he mustn’t list any additional items past this, and that he must immediately go to Cramming and is something or other, something or other, and"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 25 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 161 16.12.09 he’s flunked and so on. Now, if there isn’t an existing body of HCOBs and packs on the sub-ject of Listing and Nulling and so forth, he could be left in the complete fog. He could think this was true. Happens that it isn’t. It isn’t true. Sometimes in cases that are really jammed up and whose ruds are kind of rahhh while you are nulling, you have to list further to get the charge off the thing. The listing is still giv-ing you TA action but he has already passed the item. Actually he will put it back on the list if you’ll keep going further. Sometimes he won’t, and that is about the only time you get hung up. But if the guy keeps giving you items and you didn’t write them down, you chopped him off, why, you would have a session ARC break. So it doesn’t appear anyplace in Listing and Nulling policy. Well, where could he – where could such an auditor go to check it up? Now, he’s sent to Cramming. So he goes in Cramming and looks this up and he doesn’t find it. In other words, his tech cannot be invalidated and thrown out, and that is the principal method by which auditors are ruined. They’re told that tech exists and they’re invalidated for using proper tech. They are told that tech exists which doesn’t exist. If Cramming doesn’t immedi-ately have fully available a full library of tech, then you’ve got a mystery. There’s a mystery someplace, right? It’s a hole. Do you follow me? So if you are going to cram, force-feed, knowledge into a guy, for God sakes have the proper materials to force-feed him with. You got it? So a cramming which exists without a library would be a curse. It isn’t what your Cramming Officer knows. A Cramming Officer will get fairly smart. And your Cramming Officer actually has to be right on the ball so that he doesn’t feed a bunch of stuff in, because very often he has to be enough on the ball to be able to look at this guy and say, „What’s he doing?“ And a clever Cramming Officer would just solve them left and right because of visual observation. „Here, sit down. Do TRs with this guy... Oh.“ It’s quite obvious the fellow’s TRs are out. Another fellow could never get any reads on a list, and all his lists were all null – pc with his Interiorization Rundown out, and he’s got overts, and he’s got everything and so forth, and yet the whole list that should have picked this up is null. Well, that’s an awful mys-tery. Well, we found out the guy had his meter clear over here on the left-hand side of him, and he couldn’t possibly see the list and the meter at the same time, so I don’t know what he thought he was doing. And the Cramming Officer simply picks this up, adjusts it, shows him where to put his meter, shows him line of sight and practices around, and then found out that he wore glasses with such a thick rim that when he looked here, he couldn’t see there. So he had to solve his glasses, and he finally salvaged and made an auditor who had lists that could read. But a Cramming Officer also has his visual observation, but he mustn’t be throwing a whole bunch of hidden data into the auditors or you won’t wind up with flubless tech. Now, your whole key here to flubless auditing in an org is contained right here in De-partment 14. And if you’re going to ever have upstats and an expanding org, that tech has got"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 26 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 162 16.12.09 to be flubless. And if you are ever going to have flubless tech, you’ve got to have a function-ing 14. It’s got to have an Intern Supervisor and it’s got to have a library. It’s got to have a Cramming Officer. And now, believe it or not, we are talking about a Mini Qual. God knows what you could make out of this! You could have seven different Cramming Supervisors, and Cramming could be sold and Intern Supervisors, and you could have five intern courses run-ning simultaneously. This thing could really be up to a big dress-parade proposition, see? Got so many personnel now that it has to have a special Personnel Officer, you know? [laughs] So, the key to flubless auditing is right here. Now, with the development and re-release of Word Clearing, and with the tremendous bearing that has upon the efficiency and happiness and orderliness of an org, administratively, as well as technically – with that re-codification and simplification (because you’ll find that’s very easy to do, very easy to train people to do that) – you’ve got the entrance point of Qual. And now your Department 14 is easily afforded because the org is much more afflu-ent – not because you are making money in 13. Thirteen makes money all over the org. Now you can really afford to go for broke on 14. You never let anybody – I don’t care if he’s an HSST that has audited for seventeen years in Seattle, if he has never had any Okays to Audit, and has never been checked out in any way, shape or form and so forth, you’re going to intern him till you find out what it is all about and you get that auditing flubless. Now, auditing is [not] flubless either because they don’t know, or they haven’t drilled, or because of misunderstood words, and that’s the only three reasons. They don’t know, they haven’t drilled, or they have a misunderstood word. You say, „Well, the guy could be blind and he couldn’t audit.” Ha-ha-ha. There is a sonic E-Meter. [laughs] Yes, it is true that a person who rock slams, that has evil intention toward the organization, will try to pull the rug out from underneath it. The funny part of it is, if you just word clear him it’ll desensitize. If you follow down the subject of the rock slam, you can also find the evil purpose that motivates him and pull it. It’s very easy to make somebody sane. People are aberrated because of misunderstood words. People are insane because of evil purposes. So you got the whole package right here, because on Purpose Clearing you inevitably will turn on the rock slam. If the guy is crazy, he will turn on the rock slam when you purpose clear him. Now with that proviso, that until that’s handled you are not likely to make much of an auditor, but you can still desensitize it, oddly enough, with Word Clearing to a point where he hasn’t got to wreck pcs. So you really have got it in the bag. And that’s what flubless auditing consists of, see? Knowledge, drill, misunderstood word. Now, you say, „Drills?“ Well, yes. Actually, we are just packaging up a drills course which has a drill for every auditing action – the wildest thing you ever saw in your life. It hasn’t been piloted out to amount to anything yet, but it’s been done by experts. And that"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 27 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 163 16.12.09 goes right in the direction of your Cramming Section, regardless of whether you taught a drills course. This fellow can’t seem to do Listing and Nulling. Well, there are Listing and Nulling drills. So it’s in – written down and these are the steps. So the Cramming Officer simply would have to take this, hand it to him – Listing and Nulling – he just does the steps, with the meter sitting there, and he goes through it on a sort of a doll proposition until he – when he gets the steps down he’ll say, „Oh, I see. I’m – yeah, I got it.“ You know? He goes through the motions, because it’s the confusion of sequence of motions is what he is up against. He is unsure of them. So the second the Cramming Officer can pick out from a whole pack of great big, long, thick pack of drills – he can pick the drills that the fellow has been flunking in his auditing and make him drill those things – and the second that you can get him – set him up with another guy and have him read the bulletins he is supposed to be doing on Method 2 and pick up the misunderstood words; and if you’ve got a library there that has the information in it; oh, you got it made – flubless auditing. Piece of cake! For instance, I found two cases the other day that had been bunged up – they brought them out straight but I found two cases that had been bunged up the other day, and they were bunged up because the interiorization pack and the – interior... – exteriorization pack wasn’t understood. They corrected it last, and it wasn’t understood. Now, that – somewhere in that mess there is a misunderstood word. So your Cramming Officer has to choose amongst these things: the guy hasn’t got the knowledge, the drill is out or he’s got a misunderstood word. And Cramming gets to be a piece of cake because to that you only have to add observation. And he can look at this fellow and this fellow actually is auditing with a right-hand meter but he is a left-hand auditor. No-body ever... He doesn’t know that a left-handed meter is available. There is. And so your Cramming becomes much more – much simpler, but that is the direction to which you’re go-ing in Cramming. Right now, dub it along. Get the Cramming Officer, get him to check out on the bulle-tins, get him to do this, and get him to do that. But you’re in a position right now, the second you get this Qual functioning, to say the most likely reason he missed it – there are two most likely reasons he missed it: He never read it in the first place [whispering:] (which is, by the way, the commonest reason) – [amusement in the audience] You know that a whole group of auditors will go in and run some new rundown with-out ever reading the bulletin? They ought to be shot. But they do it every time. You have to actually groove in... You see a new piece of tech come into the org – anything like this, they are supposed to be doing that they haven’t been doing – the first think in Qual, „Let’s round them up, get them to read it and check it out.“ First thought. First guy comes up with a ques-tion, „I don’t understand how this cancels out and so on, and isn’t there some confusion...“ Word Clearing. See? That’s the patterned think. Material they haven’t been doing – check it out. Have funny considerations on it – Word Clearing Method 2. Bang! Bang! Do you get it? So that makes you a very simple Cramming area."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 28 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 164 16.12.09 Now, we’ve just got through putting together the whole intern setup from A to izzard1. And I got that investigated like mad and we put that together and I grooved it in and so forth, and it’s pretty good. On every one of those sheets, however, there isn’t a word clearer of the material of the subject. And it’s now being put on the – on the intern checksheets. So that before – after the guy comes out of the Academy, and you’d word clear him and everybody would word clear him, he’s all set, he’s fine, he’s in beautiful condition, a good auditor already to start; then, the first thought as he goes in as an intern is „What are we going to do with this fellow in off the street?“ Entirely different think. And that’s been pre-sent for years. Most Ds of P who were very smart in the old days would not let an auditor audit unless he had been trained in the HGC. Well, you’re the substitute for that. That was the think, because they – it was just too hard to work with them. They weren’t practiced enough. So, they have to be checked over. And there are certain things you have to know to be an HGC auditor that’s different than just knowing how to audit. So, we’ve got a nice intern course. It has nice packs and so on. And the lower parts of that course apply to every org. So you got it made in the shade. Here’s an intern course. You can intern. You got your drills packs coming right up. They’re down being mimeographed at this moment. So, now we’ve – they’ve put the Chaplain over here in the wrong area on my card, so make your correction. Your Chaplain goes back to Enhancement, 13, as a correction of this Policy Letter 14 August. Your Staff Training Officer and Staff Processing Officer also move over into that other area. It doesn’t much matter where they are there, or doesn’t much matter if they are there. But remember that that is the individual. Now, basically, you’re dealing with the public in Department 14 and you are dealing with the whole org. As you expand you will find there’s an Org Correction Section. Depart-ment 13 you’re dealing with the individual staff member. Here you’re dealing with the broad subject of technology and getting it grooved in. The happiness and performance of duty and other things of the individual staff member is the business of 13. You see how the division is here? All right. You say, well, it’s mean of me to throw you a curve here at the last minute, but I’m just looking at what has been written up and laid down. And your Mini Qual actually requires that you take care of the individual staff member in 13, and that you take care of the org and its production in 14, and those are your divi... the division between the two things. Now, I am telling you some things here that are based on very long-line experience with having worked with a Qual, and I’ve worked with a Qual very hard here in the last cou-   1 izzard, from A to: from beginning to end. Izzard is an archaic word meaning the letter z."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 29 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 165 16.12.09 ple of years. All the materials that we have – not only worked with a – everything that was – at this moment, everything that is the HGC or the tech division at this particular time was once Qual here. So we’ve seen practically everything that can go wrong in a Qual and right in a Qual and see how the lines go and how they don’t go. And we’re in a position of having piloted the living daylights out of Quals. Also the first Qual that went in at Saint Hill was a fairly successful Qual, so that everything that went in at Saint Hill is over here in Department 15 – the original Qual, I – whatever it was. The Chaplain was in Qual then, but he’s moved back over. So, what do we look at here? What do we look at here? We’re looking at Qual I and I in Department 15, we’re looking at the Student Examiner, the PC Examiner, we’re looking at Certs and Awards, and that is all beautifully covered in policy and was one of the things that was a Qual and everybody has that. So there isn’t anything new or strange being introduced into that area at all. You’ll find out most orgs have something vaguely resembling an Examiner, and they have something vaguely resembling a Certs and Awards. So you don’t disturb them. Give them some help if you can, and then you put together a Mini Qual. Mostly will be the construction of two more departments. Now, there undoubtedly will be things constructed on this line; there will undoubtedly be evolutions and so forth. But this is very easily the best Qual that I have ever seen. It’s a doll baby. And when I first took a look at this I said, „Look, that’s very easy to get in. It is very easy to train auditors for it. Ah-so! Now, the technology which it uses is not very extensive. Now, let’s see if we can’t build up this technology so that it is well packaged.“ Drills course, you see? This Qual will be so popular nobody will think of reducing it or scanting it, because it’s hung on the solid anchor point there of Department 13 Word Clearing. Yeah, well, let’s take a look here if we’ve got something new. We’ve got, really, what is basically – we could call it, to begin with – a Mini Qual because we just slide Word Clear-ing in. And then we say, „We really have got to have more extensive Cramming facilities. That requires more of a library. So, now that requires... The Librarian is really the Org Infor-mation Officer. Therefore, we have to have a bigger room here and it should have a counter.“ Do you see? „And we need a whole classroom for our intern course and so on.“ So it’s strictly a camel-in-the-tent caper. He puts his nose in and then he gets his eyes in, then he gets his ears in, because this is going to build up. Because it will build up viably, as the more effective this Qual is, the better that org is going to function. What’s wrong with those stats right out there, in the length and breadth of anywhere, is lack of flubless auditing, lack of flubless training, course supervision not on at all. „What Is a Course?“ PL – that sort of thing. Guy has read it, but he doesn’t know the word course. [laughs] So, they only got in trouble when they didn’t deliver. So obviously they aren’t delivering because somebody doesn’t understand something."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"A TALK ON A BASIC QUAL 30 5.9.71 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 166 16.12.09 Well, somebody must not have understood something about the original thing: the rea-son you sell auditing and training is to deliver it. Well, if they can’t deliver auditing and train-ing, well, they’re going to collect a lot of money they’re going to have to refund, going to collect a lot of money, use it all up and not going to deliver anything in the area, people are going to be very upset, and that stat is going to go d-o-o-w-n, d-o-o-w-n. And it wouldn’t matter how many people with how many circuses moved into the area to get the GI up, that GI is going to go down. Do you see? Because it isn’t money that exports, it is knowledge. Money just continues too far, will contract the area. Now, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t make money. But make sure that that money is counted in terms of paid deliveries. And Qual is right there to make sure that the quality of those paid deliveries and their volume is great. And the morale factor enters in. Without a qual... You say Department 13 is dedicated mostly to the morale of the individual staff member – can he do his job, his individual re-quirements and so forth. Fine, that’s fine. But the basis of morale is production. If a guy doesn’t produce, no matter how many ice-cream sodas he is served with staff serving girls in bikinis per hour, his morale is going to go splat. It’s his own production that brings up his morale because that also brings up his pride. Now, as far as morale is concerned, the guy starts producing and he’s producing and he produces this and that, and he can end cycle on this, that and the other thing, because in production the cycle starts, changes and stops. And at those stops, why, you’ll get a morale surge. And then all of a sudden, if your auditing is flubless, you’re going to have people walking around and congratulating the staff and it’s all getting very cheerful and happy and uptone and whee! And people start running instead of crawling along and things start happening around the place. And it generated enough speed of particle flow to generate power and the organization becomes very powerful. The germ which starts all that is Qual. And it’s the Mini Org Board that you’ve got right here. Get it in, bit by bit by bit, and build the thing up. The next thing you know, the org will rise in direct proportion to the success of Qual.

Many new trainee Auditors have come to Flag. A certain percentage of these were very happy to be there because now their ”technical queries” could be ”answered”. And so my lines would carry their queries and of course an investigation would ensue to find why an org Class IV or VII would have technical queries. It was found in all cases that the person with the technical query had misunder-stood words or had never read the materials or listened to the required tapes. The misunderstood words were things like ”Scientology”, ”Auditor”, ”HCO”, ”tone arm” – things the person was encountering continually in his work. Every one of these ”technical queries” was already fully covered in the materials but the person had never bothered to clean up his Mis-Us or, occasionally, read the basic materi-als available to him. It was further found that it was absolutely fatal to try to answer these queries or explain them. The explanation given would just dive in under the misunderstood words or absence of study and the person would just have more bewildered queries. So it became the very firm rule on my lines that when technical queries were received the person was at once metered properly to locate the Mis-U words and get them defined or the false report that he or she had studied the materials at all. When ”technical queries” were handled this way and only when they are handled this way, the result was F/N VVVVVGIs. Any explanation brought only BIs. So the rule is very, very firm. Always answer a technical query by referral to materials and a cramming order to find the mis-u words. The Auditor who is not handled this way will go on failing. Further, verbal tech explanations or letters which explain things enter a false data line into the scene and drives tech further out. Such actions create a squirrel scene. So:"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"TECHNICAL QUERIES 2 HCOB 23.10.75 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 168 16.12.09 Never explain verbally or on paper in answering a technical query. Only refer to materials and issue cramming orders to find the Mis-Us or the unstudied materials. Probably the reason why Flag trained Auditors and Auditors who have been working on my C/S lines produce such phenomenal results is that the above two rules are fully en-forced wherever I am working. And it is true – the best Auditors in the world have been made by applying these rules. And now that you have the Tech Dictionary it is especially easy. So don’t do an Auditor or Student in by explaining the answers to technical queries. Apply these rules and make them come through on the original materials. To do anything else is a severe disservice. These are the basic rules of keeping tech in. L.

This started me looking. For there is no such line. I wondered if it was a „missed withhold of nothing“. There can be one of these, you know. There is nothing there, yet the auditor tries to get it and the pc ARC breaks. This is „cleaning a clean“ with an E-Meter. One pc I cleaned up very nicely had been harassed for years about „an incident that happened when she was five“. A lot of people had tried to „get it“. The pc was in a pitiful condition. I found there was nothing there. No incident at all! The meter read came from the charge on previous auditing. I think probably she must have sneezed or her finger slipped on the cans when first asked about „an incident when you were five“. An auditor who „sees a read“ when there is no charge makes a „missed withhold of nothing“. This is the other side of the ARC break – the gone something, the non-existence of something. No food. No money. These things ARC break people. So it is with a „missed withhold of nothing“. Take Johannesburg. Some years ago the field there was upset by three rabble rousers who alleged all manner of wild things about the Scientology org there. They held wild field meetings and all that. Truth was these three people had done a vicious thing and screamed to high heaven when I sought to query them. They made a „missed withhold of nothing“ in the field in that area! There was exactly nothing wrong with Scientology there or us. There was something wrong with those three people. They had been stealing from the org. The field kept looking for what was wrong with the org or us. Nothing was. So it couldn’t be cleaned up because there was nothing to clean. There were three thieves who had run off with org property and defied orders to give it back. How this made something wrong with us is quite a puzzle. They are still „cleaning up this ARC Break“ in Johannesburg! For it is not cleanable, not being there to be cleaned! Unless you realize there was nothing there at all! It’s a missed withhold of nothing. The basic org and staff and we at Saint Hill were just doing our jobs in ordinary routine!"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"THE „HIDDEN DATA LINE“ 2 HCO PL 16.4.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 170 16.12.09 Governments looking for evil in Scientology orgs will go mad (I trust) as they are seeking a non-existent thing. They are easily defeated because their statements are so crazy even their own legal systems can’t help but see it. So it’s easily won. The only person who goes mad on a missed withhold of nothing is the person who thinks there is something there that isn’t. So it is with the „hidden data line“ students sometimes feel must exist on courses. There is no line. But in this case there is an apparency of a line. When instructors or seniors give out alter-ised technology or unusual solutions, the student feels they must have some inside track, some data line the student doesn’t have. The student looks for it and starts alter-ising in his turn pretending to have it when they become instructors. It’s a missed withhold of nothing. The whole of technology is released in HCO Bulletins and HCO Policy Letters and tapes I do and release. I don’t tell people anything in some private way, not even instructors. For instance, all the instructors I taught to handle R6 we taught by my lecturing or writing bulletins for them. Every one of these tapes is used to teach GPM data and handling to students on the Saint Hill Course. Any new data I have given on it has been given to all these people. The instructor then knows only to the degree he has studied and used the very same HCOBs and HCO Pol Ltrs and tapes the student is now using. There is no „hidden data line“. To believe there is makes an ARC Break. The apparency is somebody’s pretence to know from me more than is on the tapes and in books and mimeos, or, brutally, somebody’s alter-is of materials. This looks like a „hidden data line“. It surely isn’t. All the lower level materials are in the HCOBs, Pol Ltrs or on tapes. All the GPM materials released are here waiting for the student when he reaches that level. One could say there was one if one was way off the main data line. But it sure isn’t hidden. It’s on courses and in orgs. I laughed one time at the top flight US Government White House entrusted psycholo-gist. He looked over some startling IQ changes, said such a thing would revolutionize psy-chology overnight if known and added „no wonder you keep your technology secret!“ That is very funny when you look at how hard you and I work to make it known to all! The data line isn’t hidden. It’s there for anyone to have. There’s lots of it is possibly a source of trouble in releasing it. But it’s all on courses in Academies or Saint Hill. You could"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"THE „HIDDEN DATA LINE“ 3 HCO PL 16.4.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 171 16.12.09 have a copy of everything in the tape library if you wanted. It might cost a lot, but you could have it. There is no hidden data line. There’s a lot of data I haven’t had time to write down and put on a line for sheer press of time. But I work hard to do it. But even my closest staff and communicators when it hears of a new process or plan from me verbally, sees it in an HCOB or HCO Pol Ltr a few days later. Don‘t for heaven’s sake mistake alter-is by somebody as evidence of a hidden line. In Scientology we say „If it isn’t written it isn’t true“. That applies to orders. Some-body says „Ron said to . . .“ and on a veteran staff you hear the rejoinder „Let’s see it“. I’ve had raw meat walk into an org and say „Ron said I was to have 25 hours of auditing“. And in the raw meat days of orgs, they sometimes were given it. So we have learned the hard way – “If it isn’t written it wasn’t said“. And that applies to anybody’s orders, not just mine. And on tech and policy, it’s equally true. If it isn’t in an HCOB or an HCO Pol Ltr or recorded on a tape in my voice, it isn’t tech or policy. Next time you hear a pretended order or a squirrel process attributed to me, say „If it isn’t written or recorded it isn’t true“. And watch how tech results soar then in that area. LRH:ml.rd L.

When it is neglected the org will soon experience a technical dropped statistic and lose income and personnel. The most attacked area of an org is its Tech and Qual personnel as these produce the effective results which make Scientology seem deadly to suppressives. The suppressive is terrified of anyone getting better or more powerful as he is drama-tizing some long gone (but to him it is right now) combat or vengeance. He or she confuses the old enemies with anyone about and looks on anyone who tries to help as an insidious vil-lain who will strengthen these „enemies“. Thus Tech and Qual personnel are peculiarly liable to covert, off line, off policy an-noyances which in time turn them into PTSs. Their cases will Roller Coaster and they begin to go off line, off policy and off origin (see Dev-T Pol Ltrs) themselves. This results in a technical breakdown and an apparency of busyness in these divisions which does not in fact produce anything, being Dev-T. The policy then is: No Tech or Qual personnel may omit giving ethics chits to eth-ics on any incident or action covered in the Dev-t policy letters or which indicates SP or PTS activity. This means they may not „be decent about it“ or „reasonable“ and so refrain. This means they must know their ethics and Dev-T Pol Ltrs. This means they may not themselves act like ethics officers or steal the ethics hat. It means that they must chit students who bring a body and ask for unusual solutions; they must chit all discourteous conduct; they must chit all Roller Coaster cases; they must chit all suppressive actions observed; they must chit snide comments; they must chit alter-is and entheta; they must chit derogatory remarks; they must chit all Dev-T.

This fact routinely stuns Tech and Qual personnel when it is called to their attention – that only two or three are making their lives miserable. Ethics, seeing tech statistics drop, must investigate all this and when Ethics finds the Qual and Tech personnel have not been handing in ethics chits, the ethics officer must report them to the HCO Exec Sec for disciplinary action. NON ENTURBULATION ORDER What to do with the 2 or 3 students or pcs causing trouble? Ethics issues a Non Enturbulation Order. This states that those named in it (the SPs and PTSs who are students or preclears) are forbidden to enturbulate others and if one more report is received of their enturbulating anyone, an SP order will be issued forthwith. This will hold them in line until tech can be gotten in on them and takes them off the back of Tech and Qual personnel. NOT THEORETICAL This is not a theoretical situation or policy. It is issued directly after seeing tech results go down, Tech and Qual cases Roller Coaster and results drop. Ethics found that the entire situation came about through no chits from Tech and Qual personnel about troublesome people which resulted in no restraint and a collapse of Divisions 4 and 5 comm lines and results.

It is called a Mini Qual because it is essentially simplified in con-struction and can be manned and operated by a comparatively small dedicated group of staff, as an initial establishing action. The primary function and purpose of the Qual Correction Division is the Finding Of Lost Technology. Qual is also the custodian of Knowledge-the books, materials and tapes, plus the meaning contained in these materials. The most essential commodity of an org is Knowledge. Knowledge gets lost through misunderstood words. Qual finds and restores lost technology to full use through its word clearing, cramming and personnel programming actions, plus the full utilization of the Qual Org Library. This is Keeping Scientology Working. The Qual Sec must see that knowledge is not lost and is salvaged where it was lost (al-ter-ised or misused) and thus ensure that the quality and delivery of org products keeps rising and boom the org. The Qual Sec must have a Deputy Qual Sec who takes care of all admin functions in the division and for the org regarding Qual – i.e. FP, Ad Council. This leaves the Qual Sec free, free and able to put his full attention on running the division and ensuring that its prod-ucts are being well produced. DEPT 13: DEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL ENHANCEMENT AWARENESS LEVEL: ENHANCEMENT The Dept of Personnel Enhancement is run by the Director of Personnel Enhancement. Dept 13 is basically for the org itself. HCO establishes the org but it is primarily Dept 13 which makes it functional – which makes it run. The Valuable Final Product of Dept 13 and the Org is: Effective And Well Trained Org Staff Members."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"DIVISIONAL SUMMARY FOR DIVISION V 2 FDD 18 – 2.10.71 CORRECTION DIVISION CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 176 16.12.09 A Stuff Case Supervisor is posted in Dept 13. He may or may not have Auditors in Dept 13. This depends on what is the most workable system in the org. It is, however, the responsibility of the Qual Sec, Dir Personnel Enhancement and the Staff Case Supervisor to see that staff do get audited and that they are properly C/Sed and programmed. It is forbidden for staff to have \"bit and piece\" auditing. Staff auditing must also be scheduled in intensives. Put a pc label on them and crash them through to a completion every time. The Staff Training Officer has the responsibility for seeing that staff personnel pro-gramme training actions are done. It is found by test that staff study runs best in the Academy, even part time. Standard tech courses have their own Supervisor and STO should see that an Admin Supervisor is appointed to run staff admin training periods. Staff study can be stag-gered to say, three study periods per day, if needed. The important thing is that staff do get and complete study cycles. The Personnel Programmer, through his programming actions, can markedly raise the production and morale of the entire staff and org. The expansion of the org is dependent upon intelligent, well executed personnel programming. He interviews each staff member personally and programmes him to a point of real win on his current post. He never programmes a person off his post. The Personnel Programmer should have a working knowledge of tech and program-ming of pcs – anything in auditing has a comparable action in the field of programming. He compiles a programme which will really put each staff member there on his post. He works towards creating a whole org of post specialists and uses word clearing liberally. He may have to repair past losses on earlier posts and does what is necessary to ensure that staff members do win on their posts, thus increasing the product quality and delivery of the org. The Personnel Programmer does word clearing method 2 and also utilizes the Qual Word Clearing Word Clearers in all his programmes. Dianetics and Scientology books are included in all programmes – these being essen-tial Knowledge necessary to causative living and working, and which contain the basic data and truths of this universe. The Personnel Programmer should set a personal goal to have all staff read all Dianetics and Scientology books by L. Ron Hubbard. After each staff member is programmed, they are sent to the Registrar to sign up for the first course. It is essential to get this done because it is found that 60% of programmed staff can get lost if not so handled. They are signed up for each action on a no charge invoice. When the Personnel Programmer does his job well, the staff and org will be expanding and product quality rising sharply. The org repute in the area will rise. Word of mouth will increase. The org's publics will be happier and taking more services. The integrity of the org will be raised. Staff morale and production will be shooting up and up. The Personnel Programmer liaises with the org Personnel Control Officer to ensure that all new staff joining the org are sent to him for programming immediately on joining staff. The Qual Clearing Section, under the Qual Clearing Officer is primarily for staff use."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"DIVISIONAL SUMMARY FOR DIVISION V 3 FDD 18 – 2.10.71 CORRECTION DIVISION CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 177 16.12.09 This section, with its Word Clearers and Post Purpose Clearers, has the vital new tech-nology of word clearing, which enables Study Data to be fully applied. Word Clearing is the main tool in the org to keep Scientology working and prevent technology or policy from getting lost or misused or altered. The public is going to want Word Clearing and the Qual Sec is warned that when the public traffic gets to the stage that staff Word Clearing is severely reduced or stalled, that public word clearing should be moved to the Hubbard Guidance Centre in Dept 12. However, Qual remains the czar of word clearing and retains all case supervision and training of Word Clearing. Note: There is no credit allowed on public Word Clearing. The Qual Sec must ensure that word clearing always remains in Qual. All staff must be word cleared on all misunderstoods in past subjects (Method 1), then word cleared on their prime post duties and technology (Method 2) and finally Post Purpose Cleared. Word Clearing plays a vital role in the safeguarding of technology and Knowledge and this function must never be allowed to pass out of Qual's hands. The post of Chaplain is needed in an org because there must be someone who can handle neglected public or staff. There must be someone they can turn to. The Chaplain han-dles persons who are in trouble or who have been neglected and fallen off the right lines. He must handle and get them back on the right lines. The Medical Officer is responsible for the health, proper diagnosis, treatment and fast recovery of any sick staff member, student or preclear, ensuring that Dianetic auditing and Assists are fully utilized to speed recovery. He learns and applies basic first aid and provides the necessary liaison between the Case Supervisor and the Medical Doctor. All in all, Dept 13 is a versatile Department, with very powerful tools to use to bring the org and its staff to a higher and higher operating level and become more and more effec-tive and well trained org staff members.

Under the Staff Librarian, the Org Library ideally contains 2 copies of everything that has ever been issued – books, tapes, policies, technology, packs, manuals on all org machines, various dictionaries of all sizes, in English and other languages, plus speciality books on vari-ous subjects which may need to be used in Word Clearing.

The Librarian may refuse to sign out books to any staff member who does not promptly return materials or who loses them. There should also be a quiet area in Qual where staff can come and read. We're in the business of Knowledge and Qual is where it's concentrated in the org. The Library is a Technical Information Centre. There is also a Staff Information Offi-cer, who is an expert on where to find what in the Library. Staff may come to the Staff Infor-mation Officer for assistance. The Staff Librarian does standard Librarian logging duties and sees that the Org Li-brary is kept in good condition, safeguarded and used. The Org Library must be situated very close to Cramming and the Word Clearers. The Interne Section has an Interneship Supervisor and org Internes get their Okays to Audit in this Section regardless of earlier training, prior to auditing in the Hubbard Guidance Centre. The final OK to Audit is given after an apprenticeship in the HGC by the Case Super-visor, when the Auditor has proven his competence and standard application in a particular level. The Interneship system is the only known way to make course graduates into flubless Auditors. Volume auditing is the keynote of an Interneship. The Interne Supervisor can arrange to have all Field Auditors and Franchise Auditors invited in to get their Okays to Audit in the org. It is a commendable for a field auditor to get an OK to Audit in his nearest org. This will also open the door to getting tech in more in the field, bringing Auditors in for Cramming, etc. The responsibility for the safeguarding of Knowledge and ensuring its full correct use extends beyond the borders of the org and ex-tends throughout the entire org field. Cramming is an essential part of the Interne programme and plays a major role in its ultimate success. It takes many hundreds of hours of actual auditing application, assisted by expert case supervision and instant cramming for the slightest Hub or non-standard application to make a real flubless professional Auditor at any level. He also pulls in and crams Course Supervisors and Case Supervisors. The Cramming Officer uses the Library to augment the complete HCO Bulletin packs already in use in Cramming to ensure that Knowledge is known, duplicated and applied. The Cramming Officer uses full study technology, word clearing, the learning drill, training drills and auditing procedure drills to locate \"whys\" and handle misunderstoods and any inability to apply standard technology. He knows that auditing is not flubless if the stu-dent or auditor: (a) Doesn't know the technology – this could be so simple as the person never read the HCO Bulletin. So the Cramming Officer ensures that all new Bulletins are word cleared, star rated, clay demoed by all Supervisors, Auditors and Case Supervisors prior to application."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"DIVISIONAL SUMMARY FOR DIVISION V 5 FDD 18 – 2.10.71 CORRECTION DIVISION CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 179 16.12.09 (b) Hasn't drilled on it – this is totally handled by the new drills for each auditing action and handles additionally the problem of \"confusion in handling a sequence of mo-tions\".

Qual I and I collects and invoices money for Word Clearing and Cramming. No credit is extended for public Word Clearing. The Student Examiner examines each student on the materials of the course just com-pleted and must ensure that Knowledge and the ability to apply the data is attained. The Preclear Examiner silently examines each preclear and the folder, and verifies that all processes or steps of a rundown have been done, and that the person has attained the full end phenomena before sending to Certs and Awards for Declare? The Preclear Exam-iner's observations are valuable to the Case Supervisor and he usually becomes one of the most trusted and valued persons in an org. The integrity of Scientology and the hope for beings in this Universe is entrusted to the Examinations Section. The Certifications and Awards Officer provides the final step towards achievement and validation of a Certificate well earned. Certs and Awards logs all achievement carefully and issues Certs and Awards which Scientologists and Dianeticists alike will be proud to dis-play. He must never issue a certificate or award to anyone who has not earned it and must refer all sour or bad indicators on completing persons to the Director of Validity and the Qual Sec for investigation and handling."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"DIVISIONAL SUMMARY FOR DIVISION V 6 FDD 18 – 2.10.71 CORRECTION DIVISION CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 180 16.12.09 A good product will always have very good indicators.

No-one may chit or attack any Qual Staff member who is acting to safeguard technol-ogy and knowledge, and preserve the quality of the products and integrity of the organization. The final function in Qual is the ARC Break Auditor. This is an old Qual function and cannot be dropped or shifted. As per the original ARC Break Program, the ARC Break Audi-tor delivers a free ARC Break session (usually handling ARC Breaks and cleaning up overts) on persons who are ARC Broken with some real or imagined person, in, or formerly in, the org. These persons are then routed to the Registrar for sign-up for their next paid service. The ARC Break Auditor can also be utilized to get in ARC Broken students and preclears and liaises with the ARC Break Registrar in Div 2 to get this done. Valuable final product of the dept and the org: Earned Certs and Awards. There is one other new function which is recognized and that is: Qual has PR value. Qual staff are opinion leaders in the org. What they say has weight. The Qual Sec and Qual staff can use propaganda to push standard org actions. For example: \"I don't see why the D of P doesn't hire more Auditors\" or an OOD item, \"A meeting was held in Dept 13 and it was agreed that the D of P and HAS should hire more Auditors and then we can see the staff gets more auditing,\" or \"Staff should be hatted, or do more study, or get more auditing,\" or \"There ought to be a special staff Admin Supervisor in Dept 1 I.\" The stats go up and the Qual Sec says, \"Well, that's pretty good, but what about all the paid up undelivered service?\" \"Deliver, deliver, deliver.\" \"Quality, quality, quality.\" It is up to Qual to keep these points mentioned. It may not be the right Why but staff remember it. Remember, what Qual personnel say counts-push LRH Knowledge, Policies and or-ders and the org will catch on. Qual pushes basic actions which should be done. Ron states, \"This is the best Qual I've ever seen. This Qual will be so popular, no-one would think of reducing or scanting it. It's hung on the solid anchor of Dept 13 – Word Clear-ing. It will build up org viability.\" Qual sees that the quality of delivery is great and gets up morale through increasing production, by using Word Clearing, programming and cramming, and thus increasing Knowledge, and keeping Scientology Working. This generates a new higher speed of particle flow-and the germ which starts it all is Qual-the Correction Division. Judy Ziff Qual Aide for L.

Here is one which if left out would cause mystery. This is the principle of traffic flows we now use. It is called the Fast Flow System of Management. A being controlling a traffic or activity flow should let the flow run until it is to be re-inforced or indicates a turbulence will occur and only then inspects the part of the flow that is to be reinforced or is becoming enturbulated and inspects and acts on only that one flow. This principle would operate on a committee of 3 in this fashion: the committee does not act as a body. Each member acts individually in three spheres of influence (three types of flow). There is no committee (collective) action until one of the three members wants concur-rence from the other two on greatly reinforcing a flow or until the other two, by observation, see the third is going adrift. Only in these cases does the committee act as a Committee. In other words all 3 members go about their work independently until there is a change in one of their three spheres and then they act. Otherwise the flows of orders and actions are independ-ent. Not doing it like this is why Committees have gotten the reputation of being unable and a waste of time. To do this one, of course, needs another principle: that of Indicators. An Indicator is something that signals an approaching change rather than finding the change is already present and confirmed. We get this from auditing. An auditor audits so long as things go evenly. He knows when they will begin to deteriorate or change by an Indicator. He acts on seeing the indicator. He doesn't wait until the collapse or total change of the pc occurs and then look it over and act. The pc could be run into the ground or a good process that was bettering the case could be neglected if an auditor could not predict from indicators how it was going before it was gone. In supervising a number of sections or departments, it would work this way: The person in charge does not examine every action or decision on the lines. If all des-patches of all the activities went through his or her one pair of hands the volume would be too great and would jam. The executive's \"plate\" would be too full and this would halt any expan-"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"ADMINISTRATION FLOWS AND EXPANSION 2 HCO PL 29.03.65 THE FAST FLOW SYSTEM CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 200 16.12.09 sion of the activities as the executive would feel overworked, yet in actual fact would be get-ting nothing much done. The flows which needed watching would be buried in a huge volume of flows that did not need watching. Instead, the principle of flows tells us that the executive should have statistical indica-tors such as OIC charts on every part of the activity each week and should act only on the basis of the charts' behaviors. If a chart went down the Executive would not wait for that area to collapse before in-specting it. At a dip point the executive should go over all the plans and traffic and despatches of the area dipping down and unearth the real reason why it did dip. If the matter needs minor remedy, it should be corrected. If then the graph still dipped down, the executive would not only be advised of it by the OIC Indicators but would know, having inspected earlier, what had to be done on a more drastic scale to get the graph going up again. The OIC system must be used and all data plotted and circulated to the Executives in an org before this system will work. If the OIC system is put into effect fully the executive can then (and only then) let go the comm lines and let the traffic flow. He then only needs to: 1. Keep alert for and correct Dev-T (off-line, off-policy, off-origin and non-compliance); 2. Keep an eye on the weekly OIC charts; 3. Find from OIC the upward trends and inspect and find out what's working so well it can be reported; 4. Be alert to any down dip and inspect the activity itself and correct the matter; and 5. Spend most of his time getting his own job done (since executives do have jobs be-sides supervision). The one thing he mustn't do is \"get reasonable\" about dips or zooms and not act to really check the decline or to reinforce the rise: (a) Thinking one does know when he has not gotten it inspected closely; (b) Not believing the graph and Indicators; and (c) Not acting, are the fatal errors. Doing 1 to 5 tells us who's an executive and doing (a), (b) and (c) tells us who should-n't be an executive. If this system is in effect the org can't help but boom. We will call this the Fast Flow System of Management. It is a very precise art. It's like auditing. One predicts the slumps and reinforces the tendency to boom. It can't miss. If it's done completely. "},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"ADMINISTRATION FLOWS AND EXPANSION 3 HCO PL 29.03.65 THE FAST FLOW SYSTEM CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 201 16.12.09 L.

It does have a flaw. The basic flaw in organization is Inspection Before The Fact. That means inspection before anything bad has happened.

The prosperity of any organization is directly proportional to the speed of its parti-cles – goods, people, papers. World trade, world shipping, world prosperity is dying only because of the cumulative effect of inspection before the fact.

FURTHER MATERIAL ON STUDY - EXAMINATIONS Progress in study can be inhibited through the usage of a poor system of examination. By asking of questions irrelevant to the material covered and by failing to ensure that the stu-dent is fully aware of exactly what question is flunked, the student can be given sufficient losses to slow down his rate of learning and to cause ARC breaks. A misunderstanding comes about in the first instance purely on the basis that the stu-dent understood that he was studying a given subject. An irrelevant question asked by an ex-aminer indicates to the student that such an understanding was false or that no basic agree-ment existed on the subject in the first place. An example of this would be to ask a student of a French language course to give the main historic dates and their significance to Eighteenth Century France. The original understanding was that the student was learning to speak and read French, not to learn the history of France. In Scientology an example of an irrelevant question would be to ask the student to give the distribution of a bulletin. The understanding of the student is that he is there to learn Scientology, its theory and application, not to learn the internal administration of organiza-tional communication lines. A further example would be to ask a Level II student a question concerning data and material covered in Level IV. Frequently enough a Supervisor has to cope with a student who has come into Scien-tology to study the law of Karma or to study sociology or some other previous misconception without adding to the difficulties by asking irrelevant questions. Knowing what we now know about study we can handle earlier misconceptions, but a Supervisor must never ask a question of a student which is irrelevant to the subject or level. We must ourselves be careful not to"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":" CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 206 16.12.09 add to student confusion. Therefore, any Supervisor tendency to ask irrelevant questions must be firmly restrained. In the second instance of the unknown question, a student can be given a verbal ques-tion on which he is flunked. In most cases the student will not be able to remember the ques-tion asked as he would not have flunked it in the first case if he had not already failed to un-derstand the material covered by the question. Failure to remember the question asked or a Supervisor's refusal to give him the question asked reacts upon the student as an unanswered question, and therefore an uncompleted communication cycle, but also as an unknown ques-tion. The student will ARC break. You can easily demonstrate this by mumbling a question which is not clear enough to be understood and then insist upon an answer. You will soon enough have a very upset person on your hands. This is what happens when a student is asked a question, flunked, and then not given to clearly understand the question asked. Therefore Ron now requires that any examiner must always write down verbal questions asked before asking them, and when a student flunks, hand him the written question which he flunked. The student will then be able to know what he didn't know and be able to look up the material and clear up what it was that he had not understood. Further, this will enable him to complete the communication cycle. If tape examinations are addressed to a class as a whole, these questions must be posted and the examination papers returned to the student. The student can then see what it was that he missed and what question was missed. Many people have had experience of such poor systems of examination which failed to follow the above. It is common practice in universities not only not to give students the questions asked, but also never to return examination papers. Most frequently all the univer-sity student is given is a grade. If that grade is not 100%, then the student never knows what it was he didn't know and so can not look it up to know it. This leaves him in the uncertain con-dition of insecurity about his data on a particular subject. And if the student flunks the subject and has to re-take it, he cannot comfortably study the subject because the whole of the subject has now become a complete mystery to him. Thus, the subject is set up as an ARC Break. Universities probably do this to be sure that their examinations do not get out to stu-dents, but then one can only state that this is laziness or lack of ability on the part of profes-sors to think of different questions, or perhaps even a professor's own lack of understanding of his subject sufficient to enable him to be able to think of enough questions to ask. It also could be that there is a complete lack of worthwhile material in more primitive subjects than Scientology on which to ask questions, in which case it should never have been part of the curriculum. (Freudians mainly examine on the dates of Freud's papers for their qualification of psychiatrists!) The administration of a proper system of examination is quite simple: 1 . Tape examinations or examination questions given verbally to the class as a whole must be written down before being asked and must be posted on a bulletin board af-terwards and all examination papers must be returned to the students."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 207 16.12.09 2. Verbal questions asked of individual students must be noted down in a book like an invoice book with tear-out sheets and a piece of carbon paper. Such books are easily procured from stationers as they are used in most stores. The student is given the yel-low copy of the questions with the flunked question plainly marked. The white copy is placed in the examiner's folder for the bulletin, tape or material. In this fashion we will be able to collect good questions to be asked; to notice funda-mental areas of mis-understanding individual students have; and to note any areas of mis-understanding which are broadly mis-understood. We can, therefore, see where the indi-vidual student needs help and see where it is necessary to elaborate more fully, on certain technical data in order to make it more broadly comprehensible. Supervisors and examiners doing this will then be contributing to the more rapid pro-gress of individual students and to students in general.

Qual only really comes into action when other divisions and staff of other divisions have failed. So if they knew what to do the person would not be turning up in Qual for tech remedies. So if Qual takes their orders of what to do it will also fail. This datum originated at SH when Qual, in a collapse, was found to be obediently do-ing what Div 4 and Dept 3 ordered on students and pcs. It was getting no results. I analyzed the situation and over a period of a couple of weeks worked on it. The result was the above datum and the Green Form. Qual always does its own analysis and its own internal routings independent of other directions. It can use any process ever released and a Review auditor must be able to do them. The Green Form must be added to from time to time as new difficulties are found due to advancing technology or new errors developed by poor training. A student sent by Tech Sec for Cramming may be routed instead by Qual to case re-pair if that is what is needed. The keynote of Qual is correction. This is of course applicable to diagnosis as well. No other division may chit Qual for refusing to obey their directions regarding what to do with students or pcs. Other divisions are assembly lines. Qual is an individual approach. Qual’s Review only gets flat ball bearings – which could not or would not roll on the assembly line of Div 4. People can’t be sent to Qual for ”disagreements checks” ”sec checks” or other stated actions as these are an attempted diagnosis and will normally be found to be the wrong proc-ess. Qual is the students’ and pcs’ friend. A last refuge when other doors close."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"QUAL SENIOR DATUM 2 HCO PL 28.12.67 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 212 16.12.09 And cases must leave Qual and students must leave Qual with the whole thing han-dled in a way that will stay handled. Qual has no Qual Div for the Qual Div. When it goes irresponsible and lets an unhandled case or student out, then that person has no place to turn. I know how bad a failed Qual case can be because when I’m in an org, having no part of the org to go to (unless the Chaplain) they come to me. I usually find (a) that some imagi-nary rule has stopped the person’s progress or policy has been used to stop or (b) that Qual was obedient to some other division and (c) always that Qual has either not been approached or has failed when it was. So the senior datum of Qual is important. ____________________ There is another datum in Qual that is very important. And that is: No auditor may be employed in Qual who cannot successfully list and assess flaw-lessly without any errors. All you have to do to wreck Qual is put an auditor in it who is not letter perfect in all the tech of listing and assessing. (Some isolated summary is not enough – all the original tapes and all the original HCOBs must be studied to make an auditor able in listing and as-sessing. It is the weakest applied point in our tech – too many can’t or don’t learn how to do it. But a Qual auditor must be a shark on it.) One can say that the health of an org depends on Qual finally handling. The key proc-esses which keep an org healthy are new (67) style Remedy A, Remedy B and S & Ds and the Green Form. These are listing and assessing or assessing processes. Thus the vital tech is listing and assessing. So Qual auditors have to be carefully trained to do these perfectly. At this writing Qual is being streamlined into a new fast flow pattern. This policy still applies and in 2068 will still apply and in 200068 as well. L.

It is in addition to the required courses and any class, org or field experience. Tech quality in orgs and auditor morale (which depends on wins) depend upon flubless auditing. A Cramming must exist in any org which sells auditing. The Qual Auditor Cramming Section issues the okay to audit after rigorously follow-ing this essentially interne program. Franchises may adopt this system. An “okay to audit” must be signed by the Cramming Officer and attested to in C & A by the auditor. No former experience counts. Courses, while required, do not give an HGC okay to audit. Auditors hired after a course must go through this entire procedure. Okays to audit, issued in a qualified org, are valid on going to a different org if duly certified and presented but may be lost by a poor demonstration on pcs, at which time the okay to audit steps must be undertaken again. An HGC okay to audit is a high recommendation for a field auditor. There is no compromise with auditing quality.

Scientology is itself the microcosm of a civilization. It contains two moral codes: one is the moral code of practice which is the Auditor’s Code of 1954, the other is the Code of a Scientologist, which will be given at greater length in the next PAB. It also contains an ethical code, and that is its Code of Honour. The difference between ethics and morals is very clearly known in Scientology, if not in a modern dictionary. This mergence of morals and ethics has occurred in recent times, and is symptomatic of a general decline. An ethic is practiced on an entirely self-determined basis. An ethical code is not enforceable, is not to be enforced, but is a luxury of conduct. A person conducts himself according to an ethical code because he wants to or because he feels he is proud enough or decent enough, or civilized enough to so conduct himself. An ethical code, of course, is a code of certain restrictions indulged in to better the manner of conduct of life."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"THE CODE OF HONOUR 2 PAB 40, 26.11.54 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 226 16.12.09 If one Scientologist started to punish or berate some other Scientologist and called for an en-forcement on the grounds that the Code of Honour had been disregarded, the punitive act it-self would involve and violate the Code of Honour. The Code of Honour is a Code of Honour as long as it is not enforced. If a person is big enough, or strong enough or sane enough, then he can indulge himself in the luxury of holding upon himself freely and of his own decision the Code of Honour. When such an ethical code begins to be enforced it becomes then a moral code. A moral code is enforceable. Mores are those things which make a society possible. They are the heavily agreed-upon, policed codes of conduct of the society. If an auditor were to flagrantly and continually violate the Auditor’s Code or the Code of a Scientologist, then other auditors would have a perfect right to demand, and through the HASI effect, the suspen-sion or revocation of certificates or memberships, or both. However, no such action is possi-ble with the Code of Honour. A person could continually and flagrantly flaunt the Code of Honour and experience no more than perhaps the slight contempt or pity of his fellows. The Code of Honour clearly states conditions of acceptable comradeship amongst those fighting on one side against something which they conceive should be remedied. While anyone practicing „the only one“ believes that it is possible to have a fight or contest only so long as one remains „the only one“ and confronts as that single identity all of existence, it is not very workable to live without friends or comrades in arms. Amongst those friends and comrades in arms one’s acceptability and measure is established fairly well by his adherence to such a thing as the Code of Honour. Anyone practicing the Code of Honour would main-tain a good opinion of his fellows, a much more important thing than having one’s fellows maintain a good opinion of one. If you believed Man was worthy enough to be granted by you sufficient stature so as to permit you to exercise gladly the Code of Honour, I can guarantee that you would be a happy person. And if you found an occasional miscreant falling away from the best standards you have developed, you yet did not turn away from the rest of Man, and if you discovered yourself betrayed by those you were seeking to defend and yet did not then experience a complete reversal of opinion about all your fellow men, there would be no dwindling spiral for you. Indicative of this is a process which is rather easy to work and which has some worka-bility. Sit down in a public place where many people are passing by and simply postulate into them, above them, around them, Perfection – no matter what you see. Do this person after person as they walk by you or around you, doing it quietly and to yourself. It may or may not occur that you would bring changes in their lives, but it would certainly occur that you would bring about a change in yourself. This is not an advised process – it is simply a demonstration of a fact that he who lives believing wrong of all his fellow men lives, himself, in Hell. The only difference between Paradise on earth and Hell on earth is whether or not you believe your fellow man worthy of receiving from you the friendship and devotion called for in this Code of Honour) L.

It is reissued now as a Flag Order as \"toughness\" is a distinctive SO attribute.) Toughness is high on scale. At upper levels in Scientology we find ourselves unable to handle one area and so in-stead of doing natural thing and reducing the area we are trying to handle, we just double the size of the area. That's the way theta works. How many times in your life have you decided: \"Well let's see, I couldn't handle so and so. I guess I'd better handle just a little bit less.\" And then the first thing you knew you couldn't even handle that. What if you have said: \"All right. Now let's see. I don't seem to be able to do this. Well, where's two of them?\" I recommend it to you very thoroughly. You can't handle something, you say. Find a couple of tougher ones. The point is that you go in reverse. You've decided already long time since it was rough handling a mest body. A pre-OT who's fairly convinced that it's tough, gets kind of anxious about handling his body. He knows he can do only one thing at once. He knows this. He knows it completely. Let him go down the street and work two bodies at once. \"Oh no,\" you could say, \"no, this isn't the right road out. This couldn't be. That's just more quantity. That's . . .\" I'm afraid that this is the road out. The job gets tougher as you move up the line to higher levels. Fortunately I've de-signed it so that each new level is attainable for most.

If the pc is being audited in an auditing environment that is unsafe or prone to inter-ruption his or her confront is greatly lowered and the result is a reduced ability to run locks, secondaries and engrams and to erase them. If the auditor’s TRs are rough and his manner uncertain or challenging, evaluative or invalidative, the pc’s confront is reduced to zero or worse. This comes from a very early set of laws (Original Thesis): • Auditor plus pc is greater than the bank, • Auditor plus bank is greater than the pc, • Pc minus auditor is less than the bank. (By “bank” is meant the mental image picture collection of the pc. It comes from com-puter technology where all data is in a “bank”.) The difference between auditors is not that one has more data than another or more tricks. The difference is that one auditor will get better results than another due to his stricter adherence to procedure, better TRs, more confident manner, and closer observance of the Auditor’s Code. No “bedside manner” is required or sympathetic expression. It’s just that an auditor who knows his procedures and has good TRs inspires more confidence. The pc doesn’t have to put his attention on or cope with the auditor and feels safer and so can confront his bank better. L.

Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough.

I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to “eat crow”. On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology”. By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as “unpopular”, “egotistical” and “undemocratic”. It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don’t see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable – only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact – the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called “new ideas” would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved worka-ble mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve – psychia-try, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infinitum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 234 16.12.09 So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’s not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell – and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by “public opin-ion” media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It’s the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the Bank that says we must fail. So just don’t play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of “new technology” and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor’s report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 235 16.12.09 still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B’s own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be “too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases”. All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That Process X didn’t work.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s your audi-tor’s report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?” Then the Pc wouldn’t have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. “Of course his model session is poor but it’s just a knack he has” is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he “overcompensated” nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at “set”. So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student “got such remarkable TA”. They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 236 16.12.09 Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don’t wait until next week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him. If you can’t graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they’ll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse – never permit an “open-minded” approach. If they’re going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they’re aboard, and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the same terms as the rest of us – win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It’s a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive – and even they have a hard time. We’ll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don’t make students into good Scientologists and that lets eve-rybody down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist. Now we’re going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you dead than incapable.” Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 237 16.12.09 But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of “unworkability”. They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance. Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past. Don’t muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Do them and we’ll win. L.

HIGH CRIME It is a High Crime for a Case Supervisor not to write in a preclear’s folder what the case supervised instructions are and a High Crime for an auditor to accept verbal C/S instruc-tions. To commit this crime causes: 1. Extreme difficulty when doing a folder error summary as there is no background of what was ordered and why. 2. Gives the auditor leave to do anything he likes as not in writing. 3. Is open to misduplication and can cause squirrel processes to be run and so mess up a preclear with Non-standard Tech."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"C/S SERIES 11 2 HCOB 25.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 242 16.12.09 Any C/Supervisor found guilty of this from this date is to be removed as this could only be considered a deliberate attempt to mess up preclears. POINTS ON CASE SUPERVISION 1. Check your orders to find out if auditor did them. 2. Check to see if commands correct and if pc’s reaction was expected reaction for those commands. 3. Check any list and find out if there was mislisting. 4. Advise against a background of Standard Tech. 5. Order any errors corrected or get the case on further up the grades. 6. Beware of over-correction. 7. Beware of false, pessimistic or over-enthusiastic auditor reports. They are detected by whether the case responded to usual actions as they all do. 8. Beware of talking to the auditor or the pc. 9. Have implicit confidence in Standard Tech. If it is reported not working the auditor’s report is false or the application terrible but not reported. 10. Above all else hold a standard and never listen to or use unusual solutions. DOUBLE FOLDER DANGER When a preOT has a Solo and an Auditing folder, both, there is a great danger if the Case Supervisor does not look at both before C/Sing. There has been an instance of a preOT running strange C/Ses on himself. Another ran C/Ses out of other folders on himself. In both cases the consequences were hard to repair when finally found. In another case in the Solo folder the preOT had gone exterior with full perception. But the Non-Solo Auditing folder was being C/Sed. The TA shot up for 2 months without any C/S except myself calling for all folders. PreOTs unfortunately run on a Solo folder and an audited folder. Unless both are to hand when C/Sing wild errors can be made by the C/S. There is also the case of a person having two audited folders, being C/Sed at the same time. This is an Admin error. The firm rule is C/S only with all folders to hand. The embarrassing situation where one can’t get a folder from another org or field audi-tor or where the old folder is lost has to be made up for somehow. It mustn’t halt auditing totally."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"C/S SERIES 11 3 HCOB 25.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 243 16.12.09 CASE SUPERVISOR – FOLDER HANDLING Analyzing Folders Go back in the folder to the session where the preclear was running well and come forward from it doing a folder error summary. Reviewing Folders In reviewing a folder, the first thing to do is to look at the C/S to see if it was done. Use the Summary Sheet to get the Auditor’s attitude and pc mannerism changes. Use the Auditor’s Report Form to get the time of processes. Read and take all your data from Worksheets and compare it to and see that C/S was complied with and ensure Standard Tech was applied. If you can’t read the reports, send it back to have the Auditor over-print illegible words. Never try to case supervise (C/S) an illegible worksheet as you’ll only run into head-aches. The After Session Examiner’s Report gives you the first clue of how suspicious you should be in examining the folder and whether or not auditing reports contain falsities. Standard Tech You’re never led by anything into departing from Standard Tech. The only reason it doesn’t work is that it hasn’t been applied. The main question of a Case Supervisor is: Was it applied? If you follow this exactly, you’ll never miss. CASE SUPERVISOR DATA A Case Supervisor should watch for Ethics record of pcs who have been C/Sed. If they fall on their head, get into low conditions, the folder should be reviewed. Most probably the auditor did not do what was ordered and, if folder looks okay, chances are the auditing report is false as something is wrong or pc would not be in trouble. AUDITING AND ETHICS Cases undergoing Ethics actions, Comm Evs, amends projects or low conditions should not be audited until the Ethics matter is cleared up and complete. It only louses up their cases to audit them when under such stress."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"C/S SERIES 11 4 HCOB 25.6.70 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 244 16.12.09 ADMIN Auditors must always put the pc’s grade or OT level very prominently on the Auditing Report. A Case Supervisor cannot properly C/S a case without having this data. To not do this is out admin. OUT ADMIN – LIABILITY Much has been said about the importance of admin in auditing but auditors just aren’t getting it – so...... it now becomes a liability to have out admin in pcs’ folders. Folders are to be submitted with the latest session on top. Auditor’s report form is sta-pled to Worksheets which are dated, numbered and in order, latest on top. Summary Report is then attached to the auditing report and W/Ss with a paper clip. This of course is as well as the usual admin such as legible writing, re-writing illegible words, marking reads and F/Ns, and all End Phenomena, etc. The C/S instructions for that session go under that session, so you get C/S 4/6/68, Au-diting Session 4/6/68, C/S 5/6/68, Auditing Session 5/6/68, C/S 7/6/68, etc, etc. As the whole purpose of Class VIII is to minimize the time in auditing, by doing per-fect Standard Tech, this cannot be done if it takes 15 minutes to put the folder in order, so it can then be case supervised, so it can then be audited. GROSS CASE SUPERVISION ERRORS 1. Failing to use progress and advance programs when needed. 2. Ordering unnecessary repairs. 3. Trying to use repair processes to get case gain instead of getting the pc onto the next grade. 4. Not writing down C/S instructions, but giving them to an auditor verbally. 5. Talking to the auditor re the case. 6. Talking to pc re his case. 7. Failing to send pc to examiner if you’re unsure why his folder has been sent up for C/S. 8. Being reasonable. 9. Not having enough Ethics presence to get his orders followed. 10. Issuing involved repair orders. 11. Biggest Gross Case Supervision Error for C/S is not to read through the pc folder.

Dianetic and Scientology C/Sing Technologies are different in many respects and must not be mixed. These technologies are complementary to each other in the long overall view of case handling. The rule is simply that whenever a preclear is being run on Dianetics, at any case or Grade level, the rules of Dianetic Case Supervision apply. Dianetics can be run on any Grade of preclear or Pre-OT if necessary. It can even be run on a preclear who has had only a C/S No. 1 and no other auditing. The need for Dianetic Auditing can and does occur at any case level. The advent of “Expanded Grades” and the C/S Series of HCO Bulletins and Triple Flow Dianetics does not cancel the basics of Dianetics Case Supervision; these developments clarify and complement Dianetic Case Supervision.

11 MAY 1965 Remimeo Ethics Officer Hat HCO Exec Sec Hat HCO Sec Hat Dir Insp. & Rpts Hat Ethics Section Per-sonnel Hat HCO DIVISION Star Check out by Director of Exams on hats listed (Effective at once) ETHICS OFFICER HAT This is a quick outline of the activities of the Ethics Officer. The purpose of the Ethics Officer is \"To help Ron clear orgs and the public if need be of entheta and enturbulation so that Scientology can be done.\" The activities of the Ethics Officer consist of isolating individuals who are stopping proper flows by pulling withholds with Ethics technology and by removing as necessary po-tential trouble sources and suppressive individuals off org comm lines and by generally en-forcing Ethics Codes. The technology of how this is done is quite precise. In a nutshell, (a) one finds an imperfect functioning of some portion of the org and then (b) finds something that one doesn’t understand about it and then (c) interrogates by des-patch the individuals in that portion connected with the imperfect functioning. Just those three steps done over and over are usually quite enough to keep an org run-ning quite smoothly. On first taking over post in an enturbulated org, or in viewing a portion of the org in an enturbulated condition the actions of the Ethics Officer consist of: (1) Run back entheta by asking for names of who said it to the person who is now saying it, (2) locate those persons and find out who told them and then (3) look amongst those names for no-case-change or for potential trouble sources. Bill voices a rumour (usually with a \"they\" say ...). The Ethics Officer asks Bill what"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"ETHICS OFFICER HAT 2 HCO PL 11.5.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 260 16.12.09 \"they’s\" name is, Bill thinks and finally says it was Pete. The Ethics Officer locates Pete and asks Pete who told him, and when Pete says \"they\" the Ethics Officer finds out what \"they’s\" name is. Pete says it was Agnes. Ethics Officer locates Agnes. Agnes maintains it is true and can’t say who said it. Ethics Officer looks up Agnes’ case folder or puts Agnes on a meter and sees by high or very low TA that he has a Suppressive. Or he finds Agnes has a suppressive husband and that she is a Potential Trouble Source. The Ethics Officer then handles it as per Ethics Policy Ltrs. In short, rumour comes from somewhere. The somewhere is a Potential Trouble Source or a Suppressive. One runs it down and applies the remedies contained in Ethics HCO Policy Letters to that person. An Ethics Officer’s first job is usually cleaning up the org of its potential trouble sources and requesting a Comm Ev for the Suppressives. That gets things in focus quickly and smooths an org down so it will function. Then one looks for down statistics in the OIC Charts. These aren’t understandable, of course, so one interrogates by sending Interrogatives to the people concerned. In their an-swers there will be something that doesn’t make sense at all to the Ethics Officer – Example \"We can’t pay the bills because Josie has been on course.\" The Ethics Officer is only looking for something he himself can’t reconcile. So he sends Interrogatives to the person who wrote it and to Josie. Sooner or later some wild withhold or even a crime shows up when one does this. The trick of this \"Org Auditing\" is to find a piece of string sticking out – something one can’t understand, and, by Interrogatives, pull on it. A small cat shows up. Pull with some more Interrogatives. A baby gorilla shows up. Pull some more. A tiger appears. Pull again and Wow! You’ve got a General Sherman tank! It isn’t reasonable for people to be lazy or stupid. At the bottom you find the real cause of no action in a portion of an org or continuous upset. When you have your General Sherman, call a Court of Ethics on it. Or take action. But in actual fact you have probably already fixed it up. There’s always a reason behind a bad statistic. Send out Interrogatives until you have the real reason in view. It will never be \"Agnes isn’t bright.\" It is more likely, Agnes is on a typing post but never knew how to type. Or worse – the D of P audits org pcs for his own profit. Or the D of T simply never comes to work. The real explanation of a down statistic is always a very easily understood thing. If you Interrogate enough you’ll get the real explanation and then you can act. Never use conduct for anything but an indicator of what you should interrogate. Never buy rumours as generalities. Somebody said them and that somebody has a name. Get the name."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"ETHICS OFFICER HAT 3 HCO PL 11.5.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 261 16.12.09 FILING Filing is the real trick of Ethics work. The files do all the work, really. Executive Ethics reports patiently fled in folders, one for each staff member, eventu-ally makes one file fat. There’s your boy. Call up a Court of Ethics on him and his area gets smooth. Whatever report you get, file it with a name. Don’t file by departments or Divisions. File by names. The files do 90% of the work. When one file gets fat, call the person up for Ethics ac-tion. TIME MACHINE Run a Time Machine and let it accumulate data for you. The orders that fall off of it that weren’t complied with should be reported to the sen-ior issuing them. But file those non-compliances. Soon, a file gets fat and we know why the org isn’t running in one of its portions. POLICY All Ethics policy applies to the actions of an Ethics Officer. But the above is his workaday world, auditor to the org, filing his replies, watching for the fat file and then calling a Court on it. That way an org soon begins to run like a well greased river, doing its job in a happy atmosphere. Be as sudden and swift and unreasonable as you like. You aren’t there to win a popu-larity contest. Make Executives report all those Ethics items they should. Make them write their or-ders and send you a copy. Make your Comm Centre give you the responses for pairing with the copies. File carefully and call the lightning down on the person who gets a fat Ethics file. It’s an easy job. Mostly admin. But so is all Intelligence work. The files do the job if you make people report and if you file well yourself. And when you feel exasperated and balked and feel like taking it out on somebody, do so by all means. Whoever heard of a tame Ethics Officer? The sanity of the planet is all that is at stake."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"ETHICS OFFICER HAT 4 HCO PL 11.5.65 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 262 16.12.09 L.

Audience: 19th May. Nineteen May AD 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. The reason why – why everybody showed up here so fast actually has to do only with one fact – is, I haven’t lectured here for a couple of weeks, you see? [laughs] Now, you’re – I don’t know why we called this lecture today, actually. I should be up there working on the verification of your materials and so forth which are all pretty well in hand. I think if you were going into the materials which I’m working on at the present mo-ment, why, it would probably be a different story. But the object is not to get you wrapped up, but to wrap up the materials, so I’m doing it. The – I haven’t really anything to talk to you about today at all. But I think – I think that you probably know all there is to know about auditing. You probably have no difficulties with auditing. You probably have no difficulties with the material at all and everything is smoothed out. And you got all that taped. Now, I think we probably ought to take up the preclear and getting a win on the pre-clear, applying the information to a preclear. I think that might – might be germane to the situation. The situation is pinpointed by the fact that – I’ve forgotten the exact number – I think I had twenty-five provisional Class VIs issued here – what was the – twenty-four? – last week and I think that you all ought to be applauded for getting through to where you did. [applause] The only comment I’d like to make on that is, I never saw such vicious grading in my life! I just never saw such vicious grading in my life. You had some of your papers on your fellow students down to around sixty when the grade was eighty plus, and on one noteworthy example it was down around sixty when the actual grade was ninety. It’s fantastic! Fantastic. But on a classification examination I’m not about to stand there idly twiddling my thumbs and of course I graded all the papers afterwards personally. Took me about six hours, by the way,"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 2 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 264 16.12.09 going through every question and so forth, because all I wanted to know was just – is this auditor competent and does he know his material, you see? And even so, I didn’t have to stretch any points to amount to anything. But those grades were just cut to ribbons. I never saw the like of it and so forth. And I said to myself – I said to myself, \"Well, I hope this isn’t a symptom of what will happen to the preclear!\" Pretty ghastly. Anyhow, you all did quite amazingly well. Your grades were right up there with the Saint Hill Co-audit Course grades on the final exam and your examination was tougher, if anything, than that. So I’m quite happy with that now. Now, how auditing can occur is probably the greatest mystery to the person who makes it work the least. You’ve got a mysterious mysteriousness on any auditor who is hav-ing an awful hard time making anybody recover from something. See? He’s got a mystery. And he may not know he has this mystery. He may not know he has this mystery. But he really doesn’t know why auditing works, or if it does work. And he has assigned some value to the subject of auditing which is different and extraneous to the actual value of auditing, so therefore he makes enough goofs in trying to handle auditing, that auditing doesn’t work. It’s as simple as this, you see? And he always looks for something more mysterious than is. He looks for something more complicated than is. And you, whenever you have a student that just can’t seem to get any kind of result whatsoever, one third of the time his trouble will resolve if you simply ask him why auditing doesn’t work and why it does work and get him into a big discussion about this thing. Now you will have relieved, then, the impediment which is preventing him from per-ceiving. He will have been impeded from perceiving why auditing works. So a person who can’t understand why auditing works has got a barricade across the line of his understanding which is a presumption that it doesn’t work. Do you see? He is not about to understand why it works, because he already understands that it doesn’t work. On some reactive basis, you see, he knows it doesn’t work. So now you’re going to ask him to try to understand why it does work and of course he’ll hit this other one and he never will grasp it. Do you see? He’s blocked himself out from a comprehension of it. So therefore, a dis-cussion of this simple basic, to you as an Instructor of auditors, is like diamonds – like dia-monds. It’ll cut through most of your more difficult students and so on. The way to use this little gimmick is – you see somebody is having a terrible time with his comm cycle. Now any-body has a little bit of trouble with a comm cycle. You take a pc, he’s all rattled and he’s up-set, and he’s this and he’s that and the other thing, and he’s in the middle of the – of the bank, and so on, and his comm cycle response you see is so rough quite ordinarily, that it takes a good expert to even find out, you know, which way it’s going or what it’s doing. You have to be an expert just to get by, see, as an auditor. All right. So the pc, you see, he’s already all rattlepated out on the subject of his comm cycle, you see. You ask him one question, he gets an answer to something else, you see? And your effort to steer him through this without ARC breaking him and so forth, as I said, that is an expert action – an expert action. Because that is rugged. It’s never quite by"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 3 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 265 16.12.09 pattern from the pc’s viewpoint. And of course, that’s as it should be. So the auditor who un-derstands this aspect of it, he doesn’t have very much trouble with anything but the pc. Now, supposing he has trouble with understanding what the comm cycle is, under-standing why auditing works, and this is added to the difficulty the pc is going to introduce into it. Of course, at this moment we get an unmanageable session. We get no improvement, we get no case gain, we get nothing, you see. Why? The auditor is already incapable because of his own barricade across the line of understanding why auditing works because something is telling him that it doesn’t work or there is some reason why it shouldn’t work, you see, something like this. So that’s already got him stopped. So therefore, he doesn’t understand that it should work. Now let’s put that mess on the line. Then let’s get the routine difficulty that a pc introduces into the line, you see: pc gets all waddle-gabopped, you see, he sounds like ions going around inside of his skull, you know; he’s banging from hither to hence and you ask him, \"Do fish swim?\" and he gets \"Do they fly?\", and – you know, he’s – that’s why he’s being audited, you see. Because he’s got stuff to walk through, see. Well, that introduces the problem into the thing and by the time you get the combina-tion of all these factors, why, you get – you get no gain, see. So, I repeat, you have to be an expert to handle the pc’s comm cycle anyway. And therefore, you have to take out of line as an auditing Instructor, an auditors’ Instructor, you have to take out of line those things which make it too difficult to do. And chief amongst those is: does auditing work or why doesn’t auditing work and a discussion of this particular character is very, very, very heavy in its pay-ment. You’ll be quite surprised. I’m not giving you a bum tip here. This is a hot one, see, as far as study is concerned. All right, now you take this fellow – I'll show you how you spot him, see. He’s sitting there and he says, \"Do – now, have you ever been up?\" or whatever repetitive process he’s running, you know, and the pc says, \"Mm-hmm, hmm...\" \"Thank you! Good. Thank you. Have you ever been up?\" And the pc says \"...\" \"Thank you. Good.\" It’s – it’s – you go, \"What the hell’s going on here?\" See? This, this – there’s no comm cycle here. What’s going on, see? Or you’ll get... There’s so many variations of this it would be almost impossible to mimic them all. You get the auditor who says, \"How many is up,\" or something of the sort, and the pc says, \"Well, actually – actually, it’s a matter of downness. I’ve always thought it was really a matter of downness and so forth, but when you really come down to think about it and so forth, when you really take how many is up, you count them off, and – and so forth and so forth and... But I don’t really understand that. It’s how many is down that is really got – got the thing impor-tant to me, you see, that – that’s what really I keep dwelling on.\" And the auditor says, \"Thank you,\" just as though something has happened, you see. And he asks the same question again and he gets another evasion, see. And he never really notices that the pc never has understood or agreed with the auditing question. Now the pc hasn’t got a clue as to what’s going to happen here. Well, pc isn’t answering the auditing question. In other words, you can just keep adding these various flubs. You see any of them and they all come under the category: the auditor isn’t answ... asking the question, getting it an-"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 4 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 266 16.12.09 swered and acknowledging when the pc has completed his answer, see? And you get any variation of that – get any variation of that, then you’ve got an auditor who has got one over here... Of course, you show him how to do it and he says, \"Oh, that’s the way to do it!\" and he does it perfectly. You see, you don’t need any – any more action than that. This guy can’t seem to learn it. You straighten him all up on cutting the pc’s re-sponses. Now he asks one question in a 2½ hour session and lets the pc chatter the rest of the time, see. You’ve got him broken of one thing; he goes into another thing, you see. Now, my recommendation is not – as the auditor’s Instructor – not to go into despair, but to examine – to examine this one burning question. Why doesn’t auditing work? Let’s get it out into the clear, see? And you all of a sudden will find some very interesting answers. You’ve got to be auditing on your toes to get these things and catch them as they go by, you know. You’ve got to watch that tone arm. He says, well, something or other, something or other, and you get a wild blowdown on the tone arm. Well, make a note over here to take that one up, too, see. And he all of a sudden will come out with some very, very interesting data. And it will be very revelatory to him, too. And after that he says, \"Well, of course auditing works.\" You know? Now, you say, \"Go back in there again with a comm cycle,\" and it’s rat-atat-tat-a-ta-bang and you won’t have any trouble teaching the comm cycle, see. Got this as a side panel to auditing. Says nothing to do with taking care of the pc; this is the auditor taking care of the pc. Why do you have trouble with this, see? All right, that’s under one heading, then – this one heading. And that’s \"Why doesn’t auditing work?\" That – just put that in one big, wide, broad heading. You see somebody who’s having too much trouble, can’t ever get tone arm action, this way and that way as an auditor, that’s – that’s one thing you do with this fellow. And there happen to be two more things and that’s the subject of this lecture here. Now, in this type of interrogation, this looks very much like an auditing session, but it’s not quite an auditing session. It’s not quite an auditing session because you are looking for something that answers your question that only the auditing will tell you, not really the pc. Do you see, that’s a little bit different. You’re accumulating information so that you’re steer-ing the pc toward a cognition. And he eventually will round up the cognition. You don’t pre-conceive the cognition, you understand, but you take tone arm blowdowns on everything he has told you, see. Every time he says – he’s saying – I’ll just give you a ridiculous example – every time he says it’s \"adult,\" you see, and it’s \"immaturity.\" And he keeps – every time he says, \"it’s – it’s adult,\" or something, you get a blowdown. You make a note of that, \"adult,\" over here, you see. And then he mentions this word \"immaturity,\" and he’s still discussing why auditing doesn’t work, you see, and you write down \"immaturity.\" And you finally – what’s this got to do with it? See. Well, he’s finished telling you everything – he’s finished. Now, let’s find out what does \"adult\" have to do with auditing not working, you see, and what does \"immaturity,\" of it, so on. And he’s got some kind of an idea that everybody is stuck at the age of four, that he got taught in a sociology class, or something of this sort, so therefore they’re not sufficiently mature to face up to the realities of existence, you see. He’s got this all packed in sideways. All of a sudden he’ll get the rest of the puzzle and drag it off."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 5 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 267 16.12.09 What these blowdowns are, are little flags that tells you there’s dynamite buried here. And you take that up and you can completely change the auditing address and aspect of an audi-tor’s auditing with such a discussion, as an auditing Instructor. So that’s well worth knowing. But there’re two other categories, so I won’t say that will work with every one of these cases. And there may be two or three more categories. But I will give you as many as I know and I’m certain of. Now, let’s give you the next one, not because it’s the next most important, but because it is the – it’s an old one and it comes under the heading of \"help.\" Now, unfortunately, you must not use \"failed help.\" You mustn’t use \"failed\" anything. That’s because of the line plot of actual goals. So let’s just skip this idea of \"failed,\" don’t you see? We’ll just have to take up the subject of help. This is another ramification of what I’ve just been telling you, but it hits sometimes very close to home, indeed. There is no GPM about help, so let’s – you can hit it as heavy as you want to, see. That’s something above. I can give you data of this particular character now, because knowing what is the total-ity content of the reactive bank, you see, I know some things are slightly senior to the content or don’t impinge on the content and therefore can be cared for independently, you see, with-out undue restimulation. And this too – this just barely comes under the heading – \"Help,\" just barely comes under the heading. Therefore, it’s rather successful. It’s rather successful. You may find help in an implant someplace, or something, but it isn’t going to wrap anybody around a telegraph pole. You can take up the subject of help, you see? You can take up the subject of who he’s tried to help and who’s tried to help him and who he’s tried to help and any confounded thing you want to take up under this subject, and you’re liable to get some-place with this auditor who really can’t make auditing work. \"Well, there’s no use trying...\" You get cognitions like this: \"There’s no use trying to help them because man only succeeds when he helps himself.\" See, \"So where the hell did I get that?\" you know. He’s standing back and he looks at this thing and he suddenly conceives of dragging somebody out of a stone quarry, you see. And he conceives of standing up on the bank of the stone quarry looking diffidently down into the stone quarry, with the guy drown-ing down there, you see, and sheer walls, and thinking to himself, \"Well, there’s no reason to give him a hand or throw him a rope, because he really doesn’t deserve help unless he can help himself,\" you see. The poor sod down there hasn’t got anything to hold onto, nothing to stand up in. Of course, this becomes ridiculous, even to him, see. But you’ll find – you’ll find that these – these odd-bit presumptions of some kind or another get wedged sideways in some-body’s skull and you couldn’t begin to make a dictionary of the number of them you will find. They’re just innumerable. So you don’t know quite what you’re digging for, except you’re digging for an impediment on the subject of help. Something is impeding his ability to help or be helped and that’s all you’re digging for. So anything that you talk about help, that he hits on, that is a sidelight to help, that gives you a tone arm motion, you then make a note of to take up independently. And you will chase this whole thing all the way down to a proper cog-nition and you will therefore take care of his attitude toward pcs and auditing, you see, and all of a sudden he will start using the comm cycle. You understand that?"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 6 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 268 16.12.09 The whole basis of it is, is the comm cycle is too easy to use as long as the person’s intention toward the pc is good and he’s trying to assist the pc and so forth. So the things which make a person unable to use such a comm cycle are those things, of course, which make a person believe that he cannot assist or cannot or should not, or that it’s impossible to, see? You get the – you get where you enter this? See? There’s where you enter it, see? Of course, all this works with pcs, too, this really works with pcs. This also applies to the pcs who get no tone arm action. Pcs who get no tone arm action and so forth have got one of these buttons. Well, there’s a dangling spring that goes out here about a yard, see, and the button is out here, you see, and all the machinery down underneath where the spring should contact on this button, and so on, is all miswired and filled full of concrete. And you’re not about to get there without a special address to the situation, see. In other words, this person is sitting there saying, \"Well, I can’t be helped, anyway. Actually nobody could help anybody. If anybody did help anybody, then he would become responsible for the other person’s life. And I don’t want this other person to be responsible for my life because that would be a bad thing to do to them. So, therefore, if I sit here just sort of blank, why, therefore I won’t incur any liability.\" This is some reactive thlthlthlthl that’s going on, see. And that’s why the person isn’t getting tone arm action – given good auditing. But we’re taking it up, of course, here at Saint Hill from the auditor’s viewpoint. That’s all good preclear material. Now, the other one which I save until last is a bit more esoteric. Now, there may be some more of these things. I wouldn’t say there aren’t. But I notice from a long log of experi-ence along the line, most of the pcs I’ve had much to do with have come under one or another of these three categories. Now this other one – this other one is a real dog. This other one is a sneaky sneak that probably could furnish the material for a half a dozen lectures. I’ll give it to you very rapidly. This is of great social importance what I’m giving you. This is something to chitter-chatter about. Now, because it’s so interesting, don’t forget the other two. This is very interesting. And if I were giving this – if I were giving this – [sound of rain pouring down becomes audi-ble] (there’s a nice spring rain) – if I were giving this in a broad sort of a way at a congress or something like this, I could really embroider this thing up. I would call the beginning lecture \"Life amongst the lowly.\" People, especially Southerners, don’t recognize that’s the second title to Uncle Toms Cabin. It’s very amusing. You can ask a Southerner, \"Have you ever read a book called Life Amongst the Lowly? Have you ever heard of this book?\" And they will swear no; you can bet them a couple of pounds and they’ll lose every time. Life amongst the lowly. Why is life amongst the lowly so lowly? I’ll give it to you right where I caught it – on the entrance point. This was the entrance point to this examina-tion. It’s all right for some professor to sit in his ivory tower and \"ivory-towerify,\" and fill books with – full of what other professors in their ivory towers have \"ivory-towerified.\" But there’s no substitute for getting down and getting your paws dirty with life to know what it’s all about. There is just no substitute for that. And I’ve rubbed elbows with an awful lot of people at various stratas and classes, sizes, shapes and descriptions. And in rubbing elbows,"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 7 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 269 16.12.09 one fact used to strike me as a wild bit that I never could quite reconcile. There was this weird attitude which didn’t fit with what they did to people. I’m not now saying there is such a thing as a lower classes. I’m talking about people who under tremendous duress, people who are being hammered and pounded by the economic mills and ground very fine indeed. People who are being hunted. Criminals on the run, don’t you see. This type of person. People that – they’ve more or less had it, you know, from life. And those people in a group do one thing that is a common denominator to the group. It’s always \"Poor Dillinger, they shot him.\" It’s always \"Poor Bill, poor Joe.\" There’s always grief and supersaccharine sympathy of some kind or another. It really isn’t sentimentality – it’s too gruesome. And I’ve listened to this – oh, a group of guys sitting on a fo’c’sle head, you know, and they’re talking about \"Poor old Bill,\" you know, \"the sharks got him,\" you know. And I’ve listened to this and in life they just knock each others’ heads off, see. They’re unthinkably mean to one another. But they’re so supersaccharine – weird aspect, this – and it always just kind of went clink–creak! It didn’t make any sense, you see. They’d just as soon step on Dillinger’s teeth and sell them at the local pawnshop, see. See, but it’s \"Poor Dillinger,\" you know? And it’s \"poor you.\" And this \"poor you\" gave me a clue to something that is confoundedly well worth knowing and it very well could open up a whole field and make a real subject of sociology. Because it gives us the mechanism by which the lowly hold the lowly down. And which they do to one another constantly and continuously and instinctively. And it’s just about as vicious as keeping a cobra in the cash drawer and then inviting somebody to rob it. It’s a wild mecha-nism. Why is it a wild mechanism? I dare say you will occasionally hear this or you have occasionally heard this. But really, you’d have to be on the seamier side of life than most of you are accustomed to, to run into it as a habit and a way of life. The slums – the places where people have zero opportunity, that sort of thing. There is where it is most prevalent. It’s the poor you. \"You poor fellow.\" And now let’s move it up into a little bit more workable technical platform. How you have been wronged. How he was wronged. How they were wronged. Now, let’s just move it into that technical platform. And we all of a sudden see that life amongst the lowly depends exclusively on their continued operation of just this one little gimmick, not on any other gim-mick. Were looking now at the common denominator of sociology. What makes a slum a slum? Why can a fellow never get out of the slum? How come? What is this trap? Well, it’s: how you have been wronged, how they have been wronged, and so forth. And not to any great degree except as an example, how I have been wronged. That is not its dominant cord. You will hear that in there as an example, but that, is – isn’t – that’s just a response to the mechanism. That isn’t the important point of the mechanism. In the early days of Dianetics, we ourselves had this, you see, \"How you have been wronged,\" see? And it is the most acceptable thing that you ever had anything to do with. People just licked this up left, right and center. Well, what happened to it? Well, I worked it out along another line – an entirely different line. If you can’t take responsibility for your own actions, and if you can’t recognize the cause of your difficulties, then you’re in a trap and"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 8 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 270 16.12.09 you’ll continue in that trap forevermore; and I became completely unwilling to hold people forever in a trap, by any reason, even that of popularity, which, of course, everybody knows is the greatest god to worship there is. I’m thinking of Johnson’s poverty programs now and the fact that he had five families sitting down on one of his – one of his farms in the most abject poverty that anybody had ever lived in. The Republicans went down and dug it up. It may have – it probably would contrib-ute to finishing him – Johnson off as a presidential candidate. The point is here, this war against poverty would have to include an understanding of why people in groups remain poor. This is the missing link, this piece of data I’m giving you right now – quite valuable to the auditor and very valuable sociologically. As I said, I could lecture on it a very long time and it’s very interesting, but let’s get down to what the truth of the matter is. An individual must accept his own responsibility and his own ability as cause before he can run off his overts. Simple. You can’t have an overt if you can’t recognize yourself as cause. You can’t get out of a rat race unless you can recognize your overts. That’s all there is to it, see. So how do you keep somebody in a rat race? Just never let him recognize his overts. And you say, \"Poor you. Look at everything that has been done to you. And you, you have never done anything, you poor fellow. Look how you have been wronged. There you were, sitting there innocently, doing nothing, and up jumped the regiment and wiped you out. You poor fellow.\" And all you have to do is keep up a running fire of this stuff and you effectively suppress and mask the fact that the individual himself is capable of causation. Let’s just not worry about the overt act, you’re telling this individual that he was inca-pable of cause, and you are pointing out moments, particularly, when he was not at cause. And you are pointing out the fact that he just – things just happen to him and that he doesn’t cause any of them. Which brings him into a causeless thing, which throws him into the dwin-dling spiral and will hold him on the floor and on the bottom of the heap, forever. And all you have to do is keep convincing him that he has been wronged and that he himself never wrongs anybody. That’s all you have to do, you just keep that mechanism going and they’ll stay on the bottom of the pile forever. So life amongst the lowly is a long song of how you have been wronged. \"You never had a chance.\" And when you get this tune played out to its bitterest end, you get a person who is bitterly finished. Because he can never get off an overt act. Now, we have to go back into what is really – completely aside from the fact that this does occur in actual GPMs and so forth – what really is obsessedness. How does a person become obsessed with a problem? This is – this is gold, man, this is solid gold to an auditor. How does a person become ob-sessed with a problem? How is he always dwelling on it, dwelling on it, dwelling on it, think-ing on it, thinking on it, thinking on it. Why, why, why, why, why is he stuck in – how does he get stuck in this, see? Why is this – this is – this describes ninety percent of your pcs, see. They walk in and all he can think about is Madge left me, Madge left me, Madge left me, Madge left me, Madge left me, you see – he’ll bring it up, and so forth, and they say so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so and you think you’ve gotten them out of it now and"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 9 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 271 16.12.09 you’ve processed them down the line very beautifully and all of a sudden, \"Madge left me.\" See? You never can seem to get them off of that – you never can get the needle out of that groove, much less off the platter. They just go on. Days and days they spend – worrying, wor-rying, thinking, thinking, going on and on about, about this thing, see. They can’t get the nee-dle changed, you see. They can’t get the platter flipped. And you, the auditor, know instinc-tively that you’ve got to change that tune before you can have anybody in front of you who’s paying any attention to auditing. He’s obsessed with the subject of, \"Well, that all went back – I guess that was in the days before Madge left me.\" He had it all taped. You never get tired of personnel like you get tired of one of these personnel in a pc’s bank, you know? \"That was before the bank failure. Before the bank failure. No, that was after the bank failure. You know, the bank failed.\" [laughter] Now, what pins them into it and what can unpin them? And this becomes very vital in-formation. What can unpin them off of this thing. There’s several systems that can be used to unpin them. We won’t go into all of the systems that can be used, but chief amongst them is the O/W sequence. That is a prime mechanism that pins a person into obsessiveness. They never recognize their own overt in that sphere of existence. And not recognizing their own overt in that sphere of existence they can never unpin themselves from it. Now let me put it very crudely. Before you get your hand cut off in a buzz saw, you’ve got to get yourself somehow in the vicinity of a buzz saw and you in some fashion or another have got to reach for that buzz saw. It’s actually impossible for you to get your hand cut off in a band saw unless somehow or another you have, by whatever concatenation, ar-ranged that proximity. Now somewhere, back along the line, before the buzz saw, the individual did some-thing or committed something that walked him on that channel up to getting his hand cut off in a buzz saw. He did something to arrive him there. That is very important. Because he will never get out of there till you’ve tricked the something that actually did arrive him there. It’s not good enough to have him inventing reasons. It’s not... guilt, you see, is just – is a – is the inversion of this. You keep inventing ideas, inventing overts. There’s guys around who’ve – who eventually have realized that they have to get off their overts, but they don’t know what they are, they haven’t got an auditor, so they’ll invent overts to get off. You’ve got to beware of this bird, too, see. That’s known as a \"guilt complex.\" \"Ten thousand Japanese killed in landslide.\" This fellow was sitting in Birmingham at the time. He says, \"How did I do it?\" That’s a guilt complex in operation. So it goes into an inversion and the individual will actually start dreaming up things he didn’t do in order to get out of the obsession of thought, see. He’ll eventually go that far. Well, he’s spun by the time he goes there on that subject. But look-a-here: What is this – what is this constant dwelling of the mind on this ac-tion that the auditor runs into continuously in processing pcs? It’s very hard not to run into this. It’s the overt act that he committed, that kept him pinned into that line. And if you want to really find the overt act and monkey around with this, nicely and gently by any overt act system that we have ever had, you all of a sudden will find what he really did do – and you’ve"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 10 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 272 16.12.09 got to beware of the guilt complex of inventing things that he did do that he didn’t do because this is just another alter-is, you see. You see, he can alter-is this, as well as get off his actual overt. So therefore, you always have to verify one of these things when you’re handling one of these things, on making sure that he didn’t give you any untruths. You’ve got to get your truth answer in there on the E-Meter. In other words, you’ve got to ask him, \"Is there anything you’ve told me that doesn’t apply to this?\" you see – or you’re trying in some diplomatic way \"You told me any lies, bud?\" You want to get that off. Because they will. But any one of these dwellings upon it is preceded by a basic overt act which is fol-lowed by a withhold and followed by other overt acts. And the individual is keeping himself pinned into this thing by his series of overt acts. He cannot get out of that channel of thought. He’ll tell you, \"I could just give anything, anything, anything – I could just – I’d – I’d just give anything not to be thinking about the service station. If – if – if I could just for five min-utes not think about the service station and worry about it, you see, anything!\" You’ll actually run into somebody like this sometime or another, you know. \"If – if I could just stop thinking about it, you know? If – if – if I could just go down to the beach or something like that...\" or so forth, and vava-vaa! That’s a more notable example where the pc is articulating it. Sometimes you merely observe it in the pc or something. Well, what’s the action? Let’s get off his actual overts against the service station. His overts and withholds from the service station and bing! Just like magic. He stops thinking about it. In other words, all dwellingness on a subject is associated with overts against that subject. You follow that? That’s a rule that you can carry around in your hip pocket and feel like you’ve got it full of diamonds. You won’t recognize that you’ve got diamonds there until you run into this pc who is da-da-da-da-da – he’s got present time problem, present time problem, present time problem; he comes to every session he’s got a present time problem, he’s got present time problem. And it’s a present time problem about his domestic affairs, a present time problem about his domestic affairs, present time problem about his domestic affairs. So you spend two hours of the two and a half hours cleaning up the present time prob-lem about domestic affairs. It should occur to you now to ask, \"Do you spend a lot of time thinking about this, outside of auditing?\" \"Oh, oh, ha-ha-ha, yes, I don’t think about anything else.\" In other words, he’s really not in session. He’s just continued his life over into the auditing session, see. Anybody comes up there with present time problems all the time in an auditing session, he’s not free of those things outside the auditing session. And the way for you to cure this is O/W. You run any version of O/W. And we’ve got lots of systems of running O/W. There’s some very slippy ones. There’s various types and kinds of running O/W. This is quite a subject. And it well merits being a subject since it is very, very upscale and is of a greater order of magnitude than the reactive bank itself. It is something that is part and parcel of life which is senior to other types of aberration. Told you something then, didn’t I? It’s pretty horrible to think of."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 11 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 273 16.12.09 It is senior in its power even to GPMs. In other words you could be totally free of GPMs and still be colliding with the O/W sequence. You’d still get the consequences of your overts. Now, you can carry it perhaps upstairs in auditing to a point where you no longer have the consequences of your overts and that undoubtedly is true, but I’m just telling you that there it stands and that’s a pretty magnitudinous statement, just between ourselves, that it’s senior to GPMs. So it’s always safe to audit O/W. And it’s always indicated to audit O/W. And that’s one of the things, unfortunately, which auditors do very industriously, but here or there do very badly. They can make a stinking job out of O/W. Just, not to be critical, but just to be factual. It can be the most stinking, driveling job I ever heard of. They chop up comm cycles and they do this and misread meters – and somehow or another – and then you find out, \"Oh, I finally did, I got the overt.\" \"What was the overt?\" \"Well, the auditor [pc] was thinking hostile thoughts about me while I was auditing him.\" Oh, no! Oh, no! This merely showed bypassed charge in the session. He didn’t get an overt off. What auditors will sometimes buy as an overt is a matter of grief to me. It really is. I look over auditors’ reports and they’ve gotten this overt off of this pc. And the pc had been going around all the time, all the time all the time, not sending his mother candy. This is an overt act? You know, it’s unbelievable. It’s unbelievable. But I don’t mean to downgrade you or berate you, but very often some God-awful tacit consent will come into one of these ses-sions where \"I don’t get my overts off, therefore I won’t get them off you and you don’t get them off me and we’ll all sit here and be happy.\" And you know why they do that? And why they’ve done that? Because there’s some thread of this sociological datum I’ve just given you, running through that session. Ah, yes! So we carried the typhoid fever with us into Scientology. So it’s a good thing to know that there’s a – there’s an illness known as \"you’ve been wronged.\" Because it has been the source of great despair to me amongst auditors, wondering why in the name of heaven they just couldn’t sit down and say, \"Whatcha done, sister? Whatcha done?\" And she says, \"Well, I didn’t do very much.\" \"All right. But how much was it?\" [laughter, laughs] You know and just carry it on through in a workmanlike fashion. And that’s because \"wrong-itis\" has entered the session, see. How you’ve been wronged. This is so much a part of the social world around us that it very easily slips into a session, if the auditor is not aware of this fact. So he’s inclined to sympathize with the pc and he thinks it’s a very openhearted, beautiful sentiment on his own part. It’s just about as beautiful as a striking rattlesnake. We always knew there was something wrong with this. You’ll find it mentioned in the first book. You can only give him sympathy as the lowest level of healing. Well, more – I revise that, man, that’s no level of healing, that’s a method of strangulation. You get my point, now? You get what I’m talking about, here? If the auditor sets there – sits there, see, and the – he says to the pc, \"All right, what have you – what have you done now? You have – you’re thinking all the time about cat fur, now what have you ever done to cats?\" you see."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 12 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 274 16.12.09 \"Well,\" the pc says, \"well, cats caterwaul outside my window all night long and keep me awake.\" \"Good. We’ve gotten that overt act off.\" [laughter] What’s going on here, see? See? The auditor very, very slippily will pick up a motiva-tor for an overt and so forth. You ask somebody... Somebody is unhappy with their auditor or something of the sort. And somebody’ll pick him up and you’ll say, \"Look, get his overts off against the auditor.\" And he sits there and listens to an hour’s worth of motivators and says, \"Well, I fixed him up,\" and now the guy does cave in, see? They think one is being tough or they can be interpreted wrongly in several different ways. The only thing I’m trying to tell you is just this – this very, very close point, is if you carry this \"you poor devil, you have been wronged,\" into a session, you no longer audit the pc at cause. You’re auditing the pc at effect and so the pc will not get better. You buy motivators and sympathize with these motivators of all the horrible things that have happened to the pc in his lifetime – perfectly all right, you understand, for a pc to tell you how horrible life has been to him. As long as, with not too tactless a change of pace, you get in and find out all the horrible things he’s done to life. You’ve got to recognize that the \"you are wronged\" is a disease. \"You poor fellow, you have been wronged. You poor fellow, you have been wronged.\" And any time you give somebody this kind of a response, of any kind whatsoever, you’re contributing to his upset, contributing to his illness, because the only way he’ll ever get out of it is return his own cau-sation. Not how he’s been wronged, how has he done some wrong to somebody. And as soon as you get the other side of that picture cleaned up, all of a sudden, bing! It’s just like magic. You see, nothing can hold onto a thetan. There is no butterfly net, there is no elec-tronic switchboard, there is nothing can hold onto a thetan. Nothing. That is – that’s the truth of the situation. There is no hobbles. There is no ropes. Nothing can really hold on to a thetan. It sounds absolutely incredible, but it’s true. Well how come he gets caught? He must have grabbed hold and then forgotten he’d grabbed hold, for him to be trapped thereafter. See, there he is, holding onto the stanchion in the bus, with a third hand he didn’t know he had, and with the other two hands trying to push himself off the bus and wondered how he can’t get off the bus. So now he has to conclude that he is trapped on the bus. Nothing can trap him on the bus, except his own holding onto the bus. He’s got to – he’s got to have hold of it. Now, what is this third hand? The third hand is his overts against the bus. That’s how he can’t get out of it. That’s how he cannot get out of a – of an engram. That’s how he can’t get – really can’t get out of the bank. This is – so on. He himself has overts. It might add up to something that the one that we are – you’ll find out to really get somebody out of, are the banks he makes himself and has made himself Oh, man! Getting him out of those is rough. Getting him out of an implant, oh, sneeze. See, it’s nothing to get him out of an implant. But how about his own actual GPMs? Oh, wow, see. It’s rough, rough. See? It’s easily done today, but it’s his own actual GPMs that are holding him. Not the ones that were given to him gratuitously. That’s something for you to recognize. So you sit down and you tell this pc, \"You poor fellow, how have you been wronged in life? Good. How else"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 13 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 275 16.12.09 have you been wronged? All right. Now we both recognize you have been wronged.\" Where do you think he’s going to drift? Up or down? He’s going to go down in session, man. He can’t do anything else, because you’re auditing him – one, you’re auditing him at effect. Two, you are pulling on him the gadget that it’s all done to him and he’s never done anything. You are confirming this third mysterious hand that is busy holding onto this thing he’s so – he’s so busy, worried about and so forth. You’re just burying that hand a little bit further. Because that hand is an overt, see? That’s the overt act. And you’re carrying with you the whole sociological impact of life amongst the lowly. How is it a man can never get out of a slum? Well, you’ll see this dramatized right straight on up into life in its solid aspects of today. You go down to Chicago, you find out there – there are various types of slums. Nothing to do with color, you can find white slums that are twice as slummy as any other kind of slums, you see, there’s nothing to do with color. See, we’re talking about slums. Well, the dominant aspect which you will find in that slum is \"How you have been wronged,\" and that nobody can be at cause. The thing is, you can’t do anything about it. You look in their windows and you’ll find out that lucky charms and things like this, probably occupy the greatest commerce of the whole place, see? It’s all based on some kind of a wild luck, like a numbers racket, or it’s based on: \"Buy your lucky pixie fish,\" see, \"today\" and so forth, you know? You can’t do anything about it, but maybe some goddess called lady luck, or something like that, nobody has run into lately. Actually she retired. I forgot to tell them that down in Reno. When they opened up Las Vegas she retired because she didn’t like everything fixed. Anyway, the whole score in that place is \"You can’t do anything about it. Nothing can be done about it,\" played hand in glove, counterpoint with, how you have been wronged. And we notice that federal governments which are – national governments and so forth, which are notorious for their affinity for the indigent – they just love the indigent. They won’t take care of any industrious bloke that’s doing a job in the society, but boy, they just love the indigent, to a point where they’d love to make them more indigent. And that is the mechanism they use in their social work. \"How you have been wronged.\" This is the – this is the yap used by the labor agitator, and so forth, to the workmen. \"How you have been wronged.\" Everybody always feels worse after he’s talked to one of them but never can quite figure out why. In other words, it’s a black operation. Just pure and simple, a black operation. \"How you have been wronged.\" So when you sit there, and this fellow has actually kicked his sister downstairs and busted her skull in and you let him get off a fact that his father whipped him, \"Yes, father whipped me.\" You don’t even say, \"Why did your father whip you?\" no, but, \"Well, father whipped me and he was always a brute.\" \"Oh, you poor fellow, well thank you, I guess we’ve got that straightened out in your life. Now what else can we find?\" \"A teacher was mean to me.\" He doesn’t say anything about those frogs in the inkwell, see. \"A teacher was mean to me and everybody’s mean to me.\""},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 14 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 276 16.12.09 The auditor who sits there and says, \"Yes, we agree, everybody was mean. Yes, we agree, everything is fine. Oh, yes.\" He’s saying at t same time, \"You weren’t at cause, you didn’t do anything, it was all purposeless, there is no way you can regulate your fate, life is this way.\" See? Pah! What a corny tune. And that’s life amongst the lowly. That’s how they keep themselves lowly. That’s how they get themselves stuck in. It’s a series, it’s not hard to understand, it’s just a series of overt acts. Naturally, an individual who’s guilty of overt acts does not like to be cause in that particular direction because he’s held back from reaching in that direction by the fear they will perform further overt acts. A thetan is basically afraid of committing overt acts. He doesn’t really want to commit overt acts. I don’t care what else is arranged anyplace. And as a result, when he does so, he tends to pull them back. He eaves himself in and there he goes. So let’s get now – I told you this was a long – a long dissertation to give you this third point, and you can very easily see how this thing could occupy not just a couple, three hours of lecture, but four or five sciences all in one fell swoop, such as labor relations and sociology and war against my not getting any votes, poverty, all of these... You could open up this sub-ject, see. This subject becomes a big subject. But let’s look at it in just the framework that we’re addressing it in – is why can’t some students audit and why can some students audit and why, more germane – since this is not always at the root of auditing but more germane to the pc – why do some pc’s just never, never, never, never, never, never, never get any tone arm action? See? Well, I’ve given you two sources and this was the third one. Now you think I’m going to tell you that they believe they have been wronged and you’ve got to get their overts off. No, if it were just that simple, I would have found it out a long time ago. But it isn’t that sim-ple. Remember, I told you a problem – solutions are as complex as the problem and this is pretty complex. This person has been so wronged – how a thetan can be wronged is pretty hard to do – but this person’s been so wronged, that they have no longer any concept of an overt. This person cannot really handle the idea of an overt act. And that’s what’s wrong with that person. Now the Christian already ran into this in the year yup-gup. He already ran into this and he tried to do something about it. He didn’t run into this, he had another pitch in mind. But he came down the line saying, \"Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and you’d better repent.\" He was pulling an inversion. He wanted people to invert. He wanted people to admit their guilt. And it’s interesting that amongst Middle Western Chris-tians particularly, when you listen to their confessions and so forth, at Holy Roller meetings and so forth, all you hear is a long potpourri of things that they never were courageous enough to do in their whole lives. You could ask any one of them this burning question, \"Are you bragging or confessing?\" [laughter] Now, there is the crux of the situation because they’re getting off false overts in an ef-fort to get off some overts. They feel that they just could say they were guilty enough of something, then somehow or another things would be better. And you’ve got to safeguard yourself as an auditor against a pc walking into this particular instance because they will in-vert and they go kind of mad on this subject.

You’re looking for the honest, actual overt. The actual one. And that’s what unpins him, because only the truth sets you free, see? It’s the actual overts you’re looking for. And recognizing that if you don’t find it, why you’ve committed him to a further pro-gress of being stuck into it, see? Now you – what you want to do with this character when you run into him – and he’s very frequent, he is not very unnumerous at all – I don’t know what he runs but he certainly must run something like ten, twelve percent – is, you get him to de-fine an overt act. Here’s one of the gags – I’ll give you a gag. You define an overt act. And then after he’s got it all defined, is ask him why it isn’t an overt and he’ll tell you right away with the greatest automaticity you have ever heard in your life. He’ll go brrrrrr! Call out an overt act and he’ll give you some sort of an answer and so forth, \"Well, if I walked out and pushed a little child in the road and pushed him underneath an automobile, and so forth, that would be an overt act. That’s an overt act, it’s a – it’s an act of harmfulness against some other person.\" And if you weren’t alert you could be pretty, pretty knuckleheaded about this and let it go at that and say, \"We’ve got that licked.\" Because you haven’t asked the little gee-whizzer that comes around the back door. And you’re just going to, going to have your eyeballs snapped out about an inch and back into your skull a few times when you work this on your pc sometime in the future. You’re going to really be upset. Even though the pc knew the – knew the gimmick, I mean he can’t get around it. \"All right, you pushed this child out in the street, and so on, all right, very good. Now, why isn’t that an overt act?\" Brrrr! He’ll have immediate instant explanation of why it isn’t an overt act. And they don’t think they can commit an overt act. Well, how are you going to get an overt act off if the person can’t commit an overt act? They’ve committed overt acts, but they haven’t com-mitted any overt acts, so the net – net result of all this is they stay pinned into it tight, because there’s no reality on this as an overt act at all. Then you’ve got to find something, searchingly, that they do really consider an overt, that would really be an overt act. It may be something very mild. The old effect scale tells you that it’d be something very mild on such a person. They’ve done something or failed to do something, and that was an overt act. And now you’ve got a real honest to goodness overt act, and it might be so petty, and so nothing, that it – you’d hardly categorize it as an overt act. But it’s actually real to this person because they can’t answer this question, \"Why isn’t that an overt act?\" \"But it is an overt act.\" And sit there and look rather griefy about the situa-tion, see. Didn’t praise their mother’s cakes. Of course, we also know that they knocked their mother down the cellar steps and broke her leg. But that wasn’t an overt act, see, but didn’t praise mother’s cakes and that was the overt act, see. But that’s a real overt act to the person. Now you can go up on a gradient scale like that. And there are numerous ways of tackling this. I’m not even trying to give you the whole embrace of how you tackle this problem. It’s wide. Numerous ways you can handle this situation if you know the situation exists. How do you walk upstairs on this thing? The individual could get off some overt acts but he wouldn’t get any tone arm action and they’re not real to him. He didn’t do anything. You ask him how he – well, how it isn’t an overt act, on a discussion basis, but not a process-"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"THE PRECLEAR AND GETTING 16 SHSBC-383 – 19.5.64 AUDITING TO WORK CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 278 16.12.09 ing basis. That’s not a process. And he’ll give you some very good reasons why it isn’t an overt act. You know right away that you haven’t got how this is an overt act. That’s that – that’s that discussion level. And that’s a cross-check of one kind or another which is left to your cleverness to walk around and straighten up, see. Well, how do you finally do something about this? Well, there are probably numerous ways that something could be done about this. Fred here the other day was running – a person had found a real overt act, a real overt act, they really considered a real overt act and then Fred was auditing him – audited his justifications for having committed it. And as-ised all the person’s justifications for having committed it, like a – an R1 type of approach, don’t you see? Use justifications. Got the justifications off. Well, the thing would be getting realer and realer and realer. Unburden it, in other words. See, that was a very clever method of approach. Now here’s – here’s a wide avenue of what do you do in order to bring about the real-ity of this. Now, it’s no good to stand there and try to convince the fellow how serious it is because that’s why he isn’t saying it is an overt, because he’s so convinced that it’s so serious that he can’t confront it. You find, if you went to a prison for instance, to process some blokes in a prison, one of the wildest things you’d run into is the fact that nobody there has ever committed a crime. That would be the most astonishing thing to you. And also how sorry they are for each other, that would also be a little astonishing unless you remember what I’ve told you here. And also, how they’ve all been wronged and how society has wronged them. Let’s look at where they are. They’re in prison. Well, how come they’re staying there? You see, you can’t put a thetan in prison. Unless he’s committed an overt act. Only then, the overt act, actually, would have to be against the prison or the people who were holding him in prison or prisons in general or metal or – or bars or block buildings or something like that. Otherwise you couldn’t keep him in the place for a minute, you see? So, what is this? How would you sort this out? Therefore, the criminal must be a very serious problem to the society because they lock him up all the time. But maybe he’s a more serious problem to the criminal because he gets himself locked up all the time. How does he get locked up all the time? Well he commits overt acts all the time. I’m afraid this isn’t a planned idea at all. I’m afraid this is totally reactive as far as life is concerned. Person com-mits overt acts, why, he locks himself up. The criminals that go around and ask to be caught, alone accounts for the record of the FBI. Nothing else could account for it. So there’s the overt act-motivator sequence, see? There it starts operating. This doesn’t mean, now, that everybody is guilty and everybody is this and everybody is that and everybody should be shot down in flames because they are this way. They have forgotten how to let themselves out of the trap. They’ve forgotten how to let themselves out of the trap. They don’t know where the door is anymore. They’re walking around in circles here. And they would as happily get out of the trap as anybody else. But they’ve lost the key and they’ve lost the door and that’s it and that’s the state you find him in. No reason standing around and say-ing, \"Well, it’s your own fault.

What he is, what he does. The Cramming Officer should be the most skilled Supervisor in the place. He should handle only causes – as basic as he can get. Then he sets the fellow back on the road. Cramming requires individual, skilled attention by someone who is willing to 2-Way Comm and knows the subject under discussion well enough to be able to find where specific points are covered. Cramming’s purpose is to teach the student what he’s missed. To do that, it must handle both why he missed it and what was missed. Stable Data: 1. Things are caused, they do not “just happen”. 2. The cause lies earlier than the effect. 3. It is not “human to err” nor is it reasonable to forget things nor are there people who are “naturally slow”. 4. Though stupidity comes in general from charge on the case, thoroughly remarkable changes can be effected in rate and thoroughness of data assimilation, independent of general auditing, by use of study technology. 5.

(Some-times one has to carry the matter earlier, especially in the case of improving a study rate that is generally slow.) RESULTS Another Stable Datum is: If it didn’t resolve the situation, it wasn’t the right cause of it. You don’t know what was bogging the guy until you find it – it’s easy to evaluate what you think must be wrong with the guy or sell your wins or cogs... but it’s very hard on the guy you’re cramming. The route to 100% results on the students is persistence in finding the actual cause. Hammering the same point over and over just doesn’t find the cause of a repeating error (and there shouldn’t even be the first error, if he did the course properly). When he’s found (not you’ve found, when he’s found) what’s out, you’ll have as many VGIs as you could ask for and the error will not repeat. LOG BOOK Keep a log book giving the date and name of student, reason sent to Cramming. This gives a good idea of how the student is doing. PROGRAM The Cramming Officer gets into 2-Way Comm with the student to estimate what needs to be done, and lines up a short program of steps to be taken in Cramming. This is done in duplicate. The original is handed to the student. The Cramming Officer retains the duplicate for his record and so he can trace the student’s progress, and bring it to a rapid completion. The students should be kept busy. GRAPH TREND Go over the student’s daily graph of study stats and from the point of downward trend, check the checksheet for what was being studied at that time, or just before. CRAMMING TECH The standard of just taking the Bulletin he’s hung up on and asking for a missed word in the previous Bulletin (or previous Section of the Bulletin) works great and often simply this would handle the situation."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"CRAMMING 3 CRS 1R – BTB 22.04.71R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 283 16.12.09 Whatever it is, it is something, and there are a finite number of things it can be. Frequently the student will offer a word and then half withdraw it – yet usually it’s the very first one he offers when asked. So when you ask for a word, take what’s offered... all too often the word the guy hung up on is one he almost believes, or fully believes, he knows. BASIC TOOL Your most basic tool is the full “cycle of the misunderstood”. A very large part of the time you have to use the whole thing. Say you’re cramming an Auditor who’s just goofed. C/S has sent him to Cramming on R3R steps, as in the middle of session he started dropping commands. Your first task is to find what exactly occurred. There can be bad admin or other varie-ties of false reports. Then why that occurred, looking earlier. In many cases something else preceded gross obvious goofs. He did the course, he’s got no right ever to goof that data. Aha! He wasn’t sure if he should have been running that item on the pc... seemed like a narrative. Now with the initial goof to hand you find the principle that wasn’t understood. On check, yep, he doesn’t understand what it’s OK to run or not to run in Dianetics. Aha, Aha! And what word or term? Yes, he doesn’t know what “narrative” means. Clay Demo of “narrative” (full demo – not “can somebody guess”) after looking it up... a checkout on a couple of HCO Bs... and the guy’s in business. Then you can assess how much restudy of what is needed and groove him in to not omit commands even when flustered. Now he can learn, and will apply. OTHER TOOLS All standard study tech is at your disposal; HCOB Feb 21, 66, “Definition Processes”, HC Stress Analysis, etc., will get many a student out of the soup by themselves. Frequently a student proves to be pushed too far along the gradient and simply needs to be put back, to the proper slot. Often all mass and doingness get left aside and only theory gets done – the guy never got an E-Meter or looked at a pc. Sometimes the guy’s programmed onto the wrong course entirely – completely without a purpose on the one he’s on. WHEN SIMPLY ASKING FOR A MISSED WORD DRAWS A BLANK Sometimes he can’t spot one offhand."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"CRAMMING 4 CRS 1R – BTB 22.04.71R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 284 16.12.09 You can simply ask for the prior area the fellow feels “weak in” or “disagrees with” or “feels unsure of” and from that easily get the missed term. Clay of terms which the guy missed and hung up on helps a lot – whether in the present or a previous similar subject. This approach works very well when cramming in relation to a subject involving only activity, where there was no particular study of printed matter associated with it. WHEN THERE APPEARS TO BE NO EARLIER Counter-Policy and Counter-Tech come into this. Frequently the guy “knows” the data but also “knows” something else that is either directly misunderstood or the result of a misun-derstood. There’s no obvious earlier error, he just all the time erroneously omits the R3R step despite having been checked out... obviously if it’s simply a matter of “Gee! I never saw that before,” your job is easy and the Why is simply didn’t do the material in the first place. But say the Exec did the course, but still won’t ever train his staff. He’s full of appar-ent comprehension, but doesn’t apply. Well there’s the overt – won’t train – yet he feels he’s doing right or he wouldn’t be doing it. Fine, your approach is, “Why was what you did the right thing to do in those circum-stances?” (“What made it OK to commit the overt?”) “One’s got to cope and get the product out.” “Good, what’s the policy covering that that you’re using – get me a copy, please.” You take the policy he’s using as the reason (whether an actual Policy, Bulletin, or someone’s order, or even an “everybody knows” from Psychology) and find the principle not understood and the word missed that led to the misunderstanding and you’re back in business. Maybe, above, it turns out the guy didn’t know he should have set someone to organize be-hind him and finally didn’t know what “product” meant at all. Repaired, the guy will now at last both cope and train. SLOW STUDENTS Often subjects studied earlier (and usually blown from) have to be addressed. E.g. One student couldn’t seem to get or find his misunderstood on the Ethics Section of OEC. This was traced back to a term he’d never understood while studying law, and magically he sud-denly understood the Ethics Policies he was studying. Sometimes the student has gone past 20-30 misunderstoods, and each one has to be defined. E.g. One student had never completed his HSDC because he “couldn’t read DMSMH”. He’d gone ⅓ way through and utterly bogged. After defining word after word he hadn’t understood, with the student getting brighter and brighter, he suddenly stated – “Hey, it’s easy to read now.”"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"CRAMMING 5 CRS 1R – BTB 22.04.71R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 285 16.12.09 CRAMMING AUDITORS The first thing to do is to go over the C/S, the session, the C/S comments and Cram-ming actions to be done. Trace back misunderstoods to basic and from that indicate which HCO B(s) to restudy on. Often the Auditor will originate another area of uncertainty. Take these up too and handle each one. OTHER STANDARD TOOLS Student Rescue Intensives sometimes are a life-saver. The Learning Drill, even Op Pro by Dup (with C/S OK), TRs 0-9 and all sorts of drills as issued (e.g. 101-104) assist. TR errors are as fundamental errors as you can get on an Audi-tor – except perhaps, can he sit in the chair? THE COURSES A large part of the Cramming Officer’s responsibility lies in correcting the courses that trained the guy being crammed. If it had been run all that standardly you’d not have ex-pected the fellow to wind up in Cramming. Sometimes the student himself isn’t at fault at all – common course outnesses which the Cramming Officer may have to see corrected before students can get anywhere are: 1. No Supervisor. 2. No materials. 3. No checksheet. 4. Improper checksheet. 5. No checkouts available. 6. All theory, or perhaps theory with demos or clay substituted for an actual practical section. 7. No Supervisor 2-Way Comm in use. (Nothing mystic here just no one talks to any-one.) 8. Evaluated tech, e.g. by Supervisor or fellow student. 9. Uneducated Supervisors, in general – not using or applying the Study Tech them-selves. 10. Bad equipment, especially tape recorders. 11. Student has never done the Student Hat, not knowing Study Tech at all himself. Doesn’t know how to study and so never learns anything!"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"CRAMMING 6 CRS 1R – BTB 22.04.71R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 286 16.12.09 The Cramming Officer, in the face of Course and Supervisor outnesses, as above, must firstly unbug the student and get him winning again, then call in the Supervisor or Su-pervisors involved and get them corrected. In the case of a Course Admin who can’t maintain the tape recorders, he is pulled in and fully corrected in this area. SUPERVISION AND C/S Very often the student is having difficulty because of poor supervision. He would be learning well and progressing if the Supervisor were better trained or crammed. The same situation could exist with the C/S – he may need training and cramming. This should not be overlooked by a Cramming Officer who sees too many students or Auditors being sent for the same difficulties. It is the Cramming Officer’s responsibility to keep Supervisors and C/Ses trained as well. THE STUDENT HAT The Cramming Officer may find that the student has never learned how to be a stu-dent. He was never hatted – never got an R-Factor on what was expected of him as a student. It is simple to get him hatted with the Student Hat. This does not apply only to students in Tech Training and Technical Personnel but to Admin Students as well. Staff Personnel on Admin Courses, Staff Status, OEC, Hats, are also students and require Hatting and Cramming. They should not be neglected by the Cramming Officer. COACHING TO A NO WIN Occasionally you will find a coach who can’t give himself or another a win. He coaches toward a loss. This could go so far as to not let himself progress just to keep his fel-low student back. Or he may never let his fellow student pass – or pass him when he doesn’t deserve it. This could require auditing to resolve. But a good Cramming Officer can handle this by finding the Why and getting it handled. And find the area he has losses on and get the mis-understoods off. INVALIDATION AND CORRECTING THE WRONG WHY One barrier to study is the conviction that a right datum is wrong or not to be applied. The only resolution to this is finding and pulling off whatever or however it got invalidated and then rapid restudy of the area."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"CRAMMING 7 CRS 1R – BTB 22.04.71R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 287 16.12.09 A student ordered to “restudy his Finance Pack because ‘he doesn’t know his finance policy’”will profit from the study best after the Why is located specifically and straightened up. Once he’s found, say, his misunderstood in “how to do payroll” he can then study the rest of the pack in staff study with profit and certainty. A restudy without finding what’s out tends to leave him in doubt about all his comprehension of the materials and he ends up more un-certain of the materials than before, unless he happens to spot the exact error in the course of the general review. THERE IS A CAUSE Persistence is probably the keynote. Since, (a) he can do it, and (b) sometimes the first thing you find and well handle does not resolve the situation, then (c) there was some-thing else awry too. You follow each cycle to a VGI/Cog. A VGI/Cog doesn’t necessarily resolve the whole show, but it ends an action. Sometimes you get a good change as “My God, you know I’ve never really known what an F/N was” or “You know, I’ve always avoided Finance Pol-icy and don’t really understand it at all.” That does end that action. But then you still have to find the misunderstoods in the Policy, and drill, checkout, etc. BASICS The most common misunderstoods of Tech Students and Students on Admin Courses alike lie in the Basics – Metering, TRs, Understanding of the Auditor’s Code, the Basic Theory of the Human Mind, Strict Honesty and Honor as an Auditor. These are the things the student should learn early and what a good Cramming Officer always looks for, because if the student did not learn them early in his training – or if he had had an earlier than Scientology Misunderstood – his later training will hang up somewhere. The Cramming Officer should check for things like: • What is the Mind? • What is Charge? • What is the Time Track? • What happens when something keys in? • What happens when something keys out – or erases? • What is it that makes the meter read? • What is mass? Questions like this should be asked and good Demos done. Then the Cramming Offi-cer can go earlier and earlier. He may find the misunderstood in earlier subjects algebra, sci-ence, philosophy, simple multiplication, it could be anywhere; and the Cramming Officer tracks it down."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"CRAMMING 8 CRS 1R – BTB 22.04.71R CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 288 16.12.09 TRs, Metering, Auditor’s Code, the Auditor’s Integrity are drilled so that they apply to the Sessions the Auditor runs. The student or Auditor will cognite that these are for use and not just for drilling. The Cramming Officer is there to unbug the Auditor and student – wherever the bug or flaw may be. It must be tracked down to basic and cleared up. Every Org must have a good Cramming Officer. Without a Cramming Officer, audit-ing and training are not kept at the high quality our Tech requires.

In THE BOOK OF CASE REMEDIES we find on page 25 Remedy A and Remedy B. These two remedies are A and B because they handle a primary source of worry to supervisors and auditors. AUDITING STYLE Each level has its own basic auditing style. The Auditing Style of Level II is Guiding Style. The Secondary Style is Guiding Sec-ondary Style or Guiding S Style. ASSISTS An assist is different from auditing as such in that it lacks any model session. Assists are normally short periods of auditing but not always. I have seen a touch assist go on for months at the rate of 15 minutes a day, two or three days a week. And it may take hours to do a touch assist on an accident victim. What characterizes an assist is that it is done rapidly and informally and anywhere. “Coffee Shop Auditing” isn’t really an assist as it is usually done over coffee too casu-ally to be dignified by the name of auditing. The pc is never informed at all of the existence of a session. The pc, in an assist, is however informed of the fact and the assist is begun by “This is the Assist” and ended by a “That’s it”, so an assist, like a session, has a beginning and an end. The Auditor’s Code is observed in giving an Assist and the Auditing Comm Cycle is used."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"DEFINITION PROCESSES 2 HCOB 21.2.66 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 290 16.12.09 As an Auditor one sets out in an Assist to accomplish a specific thing for the pc like relieve the snivels or make the ache in the leg better. So an Assist also has a very finite pur-pose. SECONDARY STYLES Every level has a different primary Style of Auditing. But sometimes in actual ses-sions or particularly in Assists this Style is altered slightly for special purposes. The Style altered for assists is called a Secondary Style. It doesn’t mean that the primary style of the level is merely loosely done. It means that it is done a precise but different way to accomplish assists. This variation is called the Secondary Style of that level. REMEDIES A Remedy is not necessarily an Assist and is often done in regular session. It is the Remedy itself which determines what auditing style is used to administer it. Some Remedies, as well as being used in regular sessions, can also be used as Assists. In short, that a process exists as a Remedy has no bearing on whether it is used in an Assist or a Model Session. GUIDING STYLE The essence of Guiding Style is: 1. Locate what’s awry with the pc. 2. Run a Repetitive Process to handle what’s found in 1. In essence – steer the pc into disclosing something that needs auditing and then audit it. GUIDING SECONDARY STYLE Guiding Secondary Style differs from proper Guiding Style and is done by: 1. Steering-the pc toward revealing something or something revealed; 2. Handling it with Itsa. Guiding Secondary Style differs from Guiding Style only in that Guiding Secondary Style handles the matter by Steer + Itsa. Guiding Style Proper handles the matter with Steer + Repetitive Process."},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"DEFINITION PROCESSES 3 HCOB 21.2.66 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 291 16.12.09 DEFINITIONS PROCESSING Definitions Processes, when used as Remedies, are normally processed by Guiding Secondary Style. Both Remedies of The Book of Case Remedies A and B are Guiding Secondary Style in their normal application. One would expect them to be used by a Class II Auditor. One would expect the Assist to last 10 or 15 minutes, perhaps more, but less than a regular session would take. One would expect that any case in a PE class, any student that was getting nowhere, would be handled by the Instructor with Guiding Secondary Style using Remedies A and B as precision processes. REMEDY A PATTER One would not expect the person or student in trouble to be turned over to another stu-dent for handling. It’s too fast, sharp and easy to handle that trouble oneself if one is Class II or above and far more certain. You can do it while you’d be finding another student to do the auditing. It would be uneconomical in terms of time not to just do it right then – no meter – leaning up against a desk. The auditor’s patter would be something like what follows. The pc’s responses and Itsa are omitted in this example. “I am going to give you a short assist.” “All right, what word haven’t you understood in Scientology?” “Okay, it’s pre-clear. Explain what it means.” “Okay, I see you are having trouble, so what does pre mean?” “Fine. Now what does clear mean?” “Good. I’m glad you realize you had it mixed up with patient and see that they’re different.” “Thank you. That’s it.” In between the above total of auditing patter, the student may have hemmed and hawed and argued and cognited. But one just steered the pc straight along the subject selected and got it audited and cleaned up. If the student gave a glib text book definition after chal-lenging the word preclear, we wouldn’t buy it, but would give the student a piece of paper or a rubber band and say ”Demonstrate that.” And then carry on as it developed. And that would be Remedy A. You see it is precision auditing and is a process and does have an Auditing Style. And it works like a dream. You see this is Steer + Itsa as to its style. And that it addressed the immediate subject. What makes A Remedy A is not that it handles Scientology definitions, but that it han-dles the immediate subject under discussion or study."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"DEFINITION PROCESSES 4 HCOB 21.2.66 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 292 16.12.09 REMEDY B What makes Remedy B Remedy B is that it seeks out and handles a former subject, conceived to be similar to the immediate subject, in order to clear up misunderstandings in the immediate subject or condition. Remedy B, run on some person or student, would simply be a bit more complex than Remedy A as it looks into the past. A person has a continuous confusion with policy or auditors, etc. So one runs B like this (the following is auditor patter only): “I’m going to give you an Assist. Okay?” “All right. What subject were you mixed up with before Scientology?” “I’m sure there is one.” “Okay. Spiritualism. Fine. What word in Spiritualism didn’t you understand?” “You can think of it.” “Good. Ectoplasm. Fine. What was the definition of that?” “All right, there’s a dictionary over there, look it up.” “I’m sorry it doesn’t give the spiritualist definition. But you say it says Ecto means outside. What’s plasm?” “Well, look it up.” “All right. I see, Ecto means outside and plasm means mould or covering.” (Note: You don’t always break up words into parts for definition in A & B Reme-dies.) “Yes, I’ve got that. Now what do you think spiritualists meant by it?” “All right, I’m glad you realize that sheets over people make ghosts ghosts.” “Fine, glad you recalled being scared as a child.” “All right, what did the spiritualist mean then?” “Okay. Glad you see thetans don’t need to be cased in goo.” “All right. Fine. Good. You had Ectoplasm mixed up with engrams and you now realize thetans don’t have to have a bank and can be naked. Fine. That’s it.” (Note: You don’t always repeat after him what the pc said, but sometimes it helps.) Student departs still cogniting. Enters Scientology now having left Spiritualism on the back track. Doesn’t keep on trying to make every HCO Bulletin studied solve “Ectoplasm”, the buried misunderstood word that kept him stuck in Spiritualism. DEFINITIONS PURPOSE The purpose of definitions processing is fast clearing of “held down fives” (jammed thinking because of a misunderstood or misapplied datums) preventing someone getting on with auditing or Scientology. Remedies A and B are not always used as Assists. They are also used in regular ses-sions. But when so used they are always used with Guiding Secondary Style – Steer + Itsa. As a comment, people who seek to liken Scientology to something, “Oh, like Christian Science,” are stuck in Christian Science. Don’t say, “Oh no! It isn’t like Christian Science!” Just nod and mark them for a fast assist or a session the moment the chance offers if they seem very disinterested or aloof when asked to a PE Course. There’s weapons in that arsenal, auditor. Use them. As Remedies A and B stand as the first and second given in THE BOOK OF CASE REMEDIES, so before a large number of potential Scientologists stands the confusion of defini-tions."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"DEFINITION PROCESSES 5 HCOB 21.2.66 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 293 16.12.09 We have made Scientology definitions easy for them by compiling a dictionary, using words new to people only when useful. But those that don’t come along at all, are so wound up in some past subject they can’t hear or think when that earlier subject is restimulated. And that earlier subject is held down only by some word or phrase they didn’t grasp. Some poor pawn howling for the blood of Scientologists isn’t mad at Scientology at all. But at some earlier practice he got stuck in with mis-definition of its terms. You see, we inherit some of the effects of the whole dullness of Man when we seek to open the prison door and say, “Look. Sunshine in the fields. Walk out.” Some, who need Remedy B say: “Oh no! The last time somebody scratched the wall that way I got stupider.” Why say, “Hey. I’m not scratching the wall. I’m opening the gate”? Why bother. He can’t hear you. But he can hear Remedy B as an assist. That’s the channel to his comprehension. UNDERSTANDING When a person can’t understand something and yet goes on facing up to it, he gets into a “problems situation” with it. There it is over there, yet he can’t make it out. Infrequently (fortunately for us) the being halts time right there. Anything he con-ceives to be similar presented to his view is the puzzle itself (A=A=A). And he goes stupid. This happens rarely in the life of one being, but it happens to many people. Thus there aren’t many such messes in one person in one lifetime that have to be cleaned up. But there are a few in many people. The cycle of Mis-definition is: 1. didn’t grasp a word, then 2. didn’t understand a principle or theory, then 3. became different from it, commits and committed overts against it, then 4. restrained himself or was restrained from committing those overts, then 5. being on a withhold (inflow) pulled in a motivator. Not every word somebody didn’t grasp was followed by a principle or theory. An overt was not committed every time this happened. Not every overt committed was restrained. So no motivator was pulled in. But when it did happen, it raised havoc with the mentality of the being when trying to think about what seem to be similar subjects. You see, you are looking at the basic incident + its locks as in a chain of incidents. The charge that is apparently on the lock in present time is actually only in the basic incident. The locks borrow the charge of the basic incident and are not themselves causing anything. So you have a basic misunderstood word which then charges up the whole subject as a lock; then a subject charging up similar subjects as locks."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"DEFINITION PROCESSES 6 HCOB 21.2.66 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 294 16.12.09 Every nattery or non-progressing student or pc is hung up in the above 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 cy-cle. And every such student or pc has a misdefined word at the bottom of that pile. If the con-dition is new and temporary it’s a Scientology word that’s awry. If natter, no progress, etc, is continuous and doesn’t cease when all is explained in Scientology or when attempts to straighten up Scientology words fail, then it’s an earlier subject at fault. Hence, Remedies A and B. Hence Guiding Secondary Style. Hence, the fact that Definitions Processes are proc-esses. And vital processes they are if one wants a smooth organization, a smooth PE, a smooth record of wins on all pcs. And if one wants to bring people into Scientology who seem to want to stay out. Of course these Remedies A and B are early-on processes, to be audited by a Class II or above on a Level 0 or I pc or student. However, some in Scientology, as of this date, are studying slowly or progressing poorly because A and B haven’t been applied. One expects that very soon, now that auditors have this data, there will be nobody at upper levels with his definitions dangling. L.

THE CRAMMING OFFICER’S PROCEDURE The general procedure in use in handling Auditors sent to Cramming is as follows: A. Interview the Auditor with the folder and Cramming Order. B. Go over the folder locating all errors in sequence, earliest to latest. C. Find the Why for the goof on a meter. D. Ensure the Cramming Order handles the Why, is short and written in sequence of gra-dient handling, including basics. E. See that the misunderstoods are cleaned up back to the Basics (e.g. errors handling out Ruds traced back through Basic Auditing Series to the Auditor’s Code). Always use WC 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 in addition to starrates and clay."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"CRAMMING ACTIONS 2 CRS 2RB – BTB 8.03.75 I CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 296 16.12.09 F. Have the Auditor drill the procedure flubbed until flawless. G. Have the Auditor do TRs 0-4 (6-9 if necessary), debugging individual TRs on a gradi-ent of perfection. H. If a chronic error, metering error or low hours, check over his meter position, eyes and his handling of the meter, and OT TR 0 and TR 0 particularly. I. Now, with the error corrected and basics in, interview the Auditor and verify that the Why is handled and send to the Pc Examiner as a VGIs F/Ning student. J. If no F/N, check him over on the meter for by-passed why or misunderstoods, isolate the area and get it corrected and Word Cleared M2 & 9 and starrated and drilled. K. Write up the “Why” and key actions of the handling for the C/S, attach the F/N Exam form and route to the C/S logged as complete. Steps A & B have several parts: a. Show me. b. Tell me. c. Obnosis. d. What happened just before that? SHOW ME In many instances, if a person is asked what was done, he will not report exactly what was done, so a Cramming Off should get a person to show him what he did. A Cramming Off has to hand a Cramming Order. His first action is to get the person to demonstrate by going through the motions. In many cases, he won’t have to go any further because the demonstration will immediately show what was wrong and requiring correction. For example, an Interne is having trouble with assessment, but a simple demonstration shows that he does not know how to set up for a session. He has his Meter way over to the left, the worksheets in the center and the assessment sheet way over to his right, and thus can-not see the list, the Meter and the Pc all in one field of vision. Such a demo can take one min-ute and save a Cramming Off 20 minutes of digging. In Admin Cramming, Show Me can take the Cramming Off into the Staff Member’s area. TELL ME When Show Me is not possible, have the person tell what happened. “Exactly what did you do?” is a stable datum. Get the exact sequence of events not a lot of ramble. If very con-fused have the person use a Demo Kit. Don’t get caught up in reasons or explanations."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"CRAMMING ACTIONS 3 CRS 2RB – BTB 8.03.75 I CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 297 16.12.09 OBNOSIS The Cramming Officer must be able to pick out the outnesses in what is being said or shown. One doesn’t have to be an expert to recognize and follow down something that doesn’t make sense. WHAT HAPPENED JUST BEFORE THAT? In some cases, particularly in the Tech Cramming area, the Cramming Off will have to find out what happened just before the goof. When checking for what happened just before a goof, the Cramming Off will find A. something he didn’t understand, and/or B. something he couldn’t control. A new Interne flubs the commands of R3R. Now, if the Cramming Off doesn’t ask what happened just before that, he may miss out on his Why. He will probably find out that the Interne realized he was running out of paper, or some such common incidence, which caused him to become flustered, TRs to go out, and he flubbed the commands. In this case, through his own lack of planning and set-up actions, the Interne lost control of the session. So the Cramming Off will cram the Interne on session set-up actions and strengthen his TR 0 through the use of TRs booklets and tapes and see that he continues daily TRs Training on the Interneship. When a look into a situation does not readily show up a Why, go earlier and find out what happened. ETHICS The only hidden barrier to real success in Cramming is non-participation, the indicator of Out Ethics. A Cramming Off must recognize Out Ethics and get it handled. He may be able to get the Staff Member to handle it on the spot, or he may have to send the person to Ethics or even to Integrity Processing. The point is to recognize the barrier to progress and get it removed. SUPERVISOR CRAMMING Unless Qual is also correcting Training where needful, Cramming will be overloaded with flubbed products who didn’t get the data in the first place and are now goofing on their Tech or Admin post. The Qual Sec should inspect Course rooms daily. Does the Super have his E-Meter set up on his desk ready for an M2 or M4? Is the Super moving around the class constantly, han-dling students, keeping them moving and F/Ning? Actual Super two way comm with students should be listened to and TRs and Supervisor or study tech correction written up."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"CRAMMING ACTIONS 4 CRS 2RB – BTB 8.03.75 I CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 298 16.12.09 Does the Super have a Qual OK to do Word, Clearing M2 and 4 on his students? Are there student graphs up and posted in PT? Are the Roll Books properly filled in and in PT? Are all points of “What is a Course” in? Are there any students on strange or irregular schedules? Is the Supervisor at least a Mini Course Supervisor Course grad? Are there other Supervisors training on HPCSC and postgraduate Supervisor training (HSCSC) or schedules to go for such training? Are Supervisor TRs poor or choppy? Do they do daily TRs? Are blown students immediately contacted, brought in and handled? Can the Supervisor “see” what is happening in the Classroom? Can he handle what he sees? Any Supervisor with down stats, drop-outs, blows or slow students must become bait for a continuing correction program until the standard is way up and into an acceptable level. The value of a good Academy or HSDC Supervisor, who runs snap and pop courses, gets his students through rapidly and thoroughly is extremely high. In this case, he is person-ally worth about two times that of a top HGC Auditor in terms of beans into the Org. HAS and HQS Course Supers prove their worth in future beans and re-sign-ups in the Org. They help to create future business in the Academy and the HGC. Therefore, proven top Supervi-sors should not be ignored as areas of facility differential. A Supervisor is handled in Cramming like any other person in for correction. The Situation is located, the Why found and the handling for that Why executed. There are many such Situations and Whys to be found on most to get them to a point of being flubless Super-visors. It is a no more lengthy cycle than getting an Interne through his Interneship.

There are two areas of Cramming: 1. Tech Cramming. 2. Admin Cramming. There are two basic types of Cramming: A. To rapidly prepare a person for post or technical action, through intensive study, Word Clearing and drilling on key materials. B. To rapidly correct a person after the fact of an error or flub, by finding the Why, and handling that Why with study and Word Clearing of the particular data involved and drilling the actions to a point of confidence and competence. This covers Cramming Orders sent to Qual or originated by the Cramming Off or Qual Sec on Outpoints in the Org. The administrative and executive staff of an Org require Cramming as much as techni-cal personnel. The handlings are analogous. The cycle goes like this: 1. Hat checksheet completed in staff training. 2. Cramming ordered when a staff member flubs. 3. Cramming to find and handle the basic reason for the continued flubs, if present. 4. Ethics, if proven necessary, to no change or improvement or refusal to be corrected, overtly or covertly.

Where staff training is lacking, he must work with the Qual Sec and STO to get it into operation. The steps of handling an Admin Cramming cycle are: 1. Find out what happened or is happening. 2. Establish the situation (biggest departure from what should have happened or should be happening). 3. Find the why for that situation on a meter. 4. Write up the handling to eradicate the why and get a return towards the Ideal Scene by Cramming on the key issues for the area and removing any blocks to their implemen-tation. ORG OUTPOINTS In doing Org outpoint corrections per HCO PL 30 Aug 74, “Qual Stat Change”, look at the GDSes first. Take up any and all GDSes with down stats or trend, and cram all person-nel directly involved with making the GDS on visible outpoints until the stat starts going up. That means keep on correcting outpoints, by pushing in Policy and Tech until you get a stat recovery occurring. Then take up the Dept stats and get them going up. Then take up the Sec-tion stats and get them going up. Checking on stats before doing Org outpoint correct actions narrows the target to the areas needing correction. There are sometimes more areas which can cause trouble than a Cramming Officer may realize. These separate out into: 1. Staff member’s actions, flubs and misunderstoods. 2. Senior’s actions and reports. (Supplementary Situation per Data Series 27, HCO PL 25 May 73, “Supplementary Evaluations”.) 3. Other staff influences.

First amongst these is of course poor evaluation. Second would be a considerable dis-agreement in the evaluated scene with the WHY, especially if it is interpreted as condemna-tory. Third would be a failure to obtain actual compliance with the targets in the evaluation. Fourth would be interference points or areas which, although affecting the scene being evalu-ated, are not looked at in relationship to it. In any scene being evaluated, there are two areas which are not likely to get much at-tention from the evaluator as they may not be remarked on in any of the reports or data being used in his evaluation. These two types of area are (1) local environment and (2) relay points and lines between policy and order source and the scene itself. These two areas may be looked at as (1) the plane upon which the scene exists and (2) the upper stages of authority under which the scene reacts. THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT The surrounding area to the scene being evaluated in the matter or a person would be the general third dynamic or other dynamic in which he or she lives his day-to-day life and which influences the person and therefore influences his hat or post. The search for the WHY which exactly causes Joe or Joanna to fail to hold post or wear a hat and which when handled will greatly better Joe or Joanna may well be their reactions to environments at their level and which may be or may not be there with them. Family or distant friends, not visible to an evaluator, or the work environment or on-the-job friends of Joe or Joanna may greatly influ-ence Joe or Joanna. This might prove too inviting for the evaluator to blame environment for the state of the existing scene and a caution'would have to be introduced: that any WHY must lead to a bettered scene and must not just explain it."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUATIONS 2 HCO PL 25.5.73 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 306 16.12.09 EVAL BY RELAY PTS. Thus, in such a problem it should be understood that one has two existing scenes, one, the person and two, his environment; that they interrelate does not make them just one scene. Thus two evaluations about Joe or Joanna are possible, each with its program. To go about it otherwise is likely to prove as unsuccessful as the original evaluation of the person. Life and orders are reaching Joe or Joanna through relay points which are not ordinarily taken into consideration. Thus those areas should be separately evaluated. Usually, in the case of a per-son, something would have to be done to those areas, on the same plane as the person, by the person himself. So the program might include what the person himself could do about them. The local environment of a material object, such as a machine or an office or a vehi-cle, may also be evaluated as well as the machine or the office or vehicle itself. In short, there are relay points of difficulties that produce situations, on the same plane as the person or thing being evaluated. And these make additional evaluations possible and often profitable to the evaluator in terms of bettered ideal scenes. Yet at first glance, or using only the usual reports, it may seem that there is only one situation such as the person himself. Completely in the interests of justice, it is unfair to put down a target in some greater area situation like \"Remove Joe.\" It may well be that stats did go down when Joe was ap-pointed to a post. Well, that may be perfectly true. But by only then evaluating Joe and not the greater zone of Joe's personal scenes, one may very well come up with a very wrong and abrupt and unjust target. Who in other words, when found, may not solve the scene at all even when one only targets it as \"specially train\" or \"audit\" without removal. There may be another scene that is having an effect on Joe which, if not evaluated properly with a proper program of its own, will make nonsense out of any program about Joe himself related only to his post or position. Another scene may be relaying fatality to Joe which if unhandled will unsuit him to any other post of any other kind. Thus Joe and Joanna would have, each of them, two or more full evaluations possible. What the person is failing at or not doing on the job may have a plain enough Why that can be corrected by programming and moved to an ideal scene or at least toward it. What is hit-ting the person at an environmental or familial or social level might be an entirely different situation, requiring its own evaluation, with a proper Why and program for Joe or Joanna to carry out themselves or even with some help from others. In a broader case, we have, let us say, an organization or division that is in a situation. One, of course, can evaluate it as itself, finding a proper Why and a nice bright idea and a program'. And one can also do a second evaluation of the local environment. This might be the society or an adjacent division or even another organization. And this will require the lo-cation of a situation and finding its Why and working out a program to handle that can be done by the org or the division itself or with help from outside. The local environment outside the scene being evaluated is then a proper subject for another evaluation. It is a serious error to only evaluate the local environment as all too often the person or org or division will insist that that is the only situation and also that it is totally beyond any"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUATIONS 3 HCO PL 25.5.73 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 307 16.12.09 remedy by their own actions. Thus, if the evaluator is going to evaluate the local environment of a subject that is in a situation, he does it after he has evaluated the subject on its own ground totally. EVALUATION OF ECHELONS On any command or communication channel there are always a certain number of points extending from source through relay points down to the final receipt or action point. These may be very numerous. Some may be beyond the authority of any evaluator. But each is capable of having its own situation that will cause an evaluation of the receipt or action point to fail. These can be called \"echelons\" or step-like formations. The receipt or action point that is to comply finally with the program may be the subject of hidden sources of effect in the relay points of any program or order. Thus, as in the case of a dangerous decline of some activity somewhere, an evaluator has several evaluations possible and probably necessary. It would be, by experience, a severe error to try to evaluate all these different scenes (such as many echelons each in a different area) in one evaluation and find a Why for the lot as one is attempting to find a single Why for several different scenes in different places which violates the strict purity of evaluation procedure. One may find the exact and correct Why for the point of action and do a splendid pro-gram only to find that somehow it didn't come off or didn't last. Yet it was the right Why for that scene. Hidden from view is the influence on that scene from one or more upper echelons which have, themselves, an individual situation and need their own Why and their own pro-gram. Only then can the influence on the action point be beneficial in its entirety. There is a system by which this is done. 1. One recognizes that there is a situation in an area which has not responded well to previous evaluation or has not maintained any benefit received very long. 2. One realizes that there are several, echelons above the point being evaluated. 3. One draws these points without omission. This makes a sort of graph or com-mand chart. It includes every command or comm relay point above the level of the point being evaluated. 4. The points, if any, below the point under consideration as in I above are then added to the chart below it. 5. One now undertakes a brief study of each of these points above and below to see if any have a situation of its own that could influence the success or failure of the original point evaluated as in I above. 6. One does a full separate evaluation of each of these echelon points where any situation seems to exist. Each of the evaluations done must have its own local situation, Why and program. Care is taken not to evaluate \"n o- situations.\""},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUATIONS 4 HCO PL 25.5.73 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 308 16.12.09 Care is also taken to keep this Series of evaluations consistent with the main idea of remedying I above. 7. The evaluations are released as a series and executed as feasible. In doing such a series, brand new data may leap out as to the interrelationship of all these relay points and this may bring about a recommendation for a change of organization requiring new policy. But this would be another evaluation entirely as it is in effect an evalua-tion of basic organizational policy and may even require that tech be issued or withdrawn. Take a case where the area which has not bettered or sustained a betterment has in ac-tual fact two echelons below it and six above. The area, let us say, is a continental manage-ment office of an international hotel chain. Below it are its state offices and below that the hotels on that continent. Above it is the international comm relay center, the international headquarters executive at international headquarters for that continent, above that the interna-tional management organization, above that the chief executive of the international manage-ment organization, above that the advisors to the board and above that the board itself. By drawing these out as a series of echelons one sees that there is potentially a series of eight evaluations in addition to the main evaluation of that continental office which is where the situation originally was. By scanning over all these eight other influencing areas, one may find one or more of them which have situations of real influence on the original evaluation subject. One then evaluates separately and handles separately while still going on handling the original subject. One can then also do the local environment evaluation of the original subject if there seems to be a situation there. No evaluation is done where there is no situation. But one should assert in a covering note to the series that there are no known situations in the remaining points. Doing a series of evaluations and local environment evaluations can be extremely fruitful only so long as one realizes that they comprise separate situations which only by their influence are preventing an ideal scene from being achieved in the original area where bet-terment cannot be attained or maintained. Supplementary evaluations, when necessary and when done, can rescue a long series of apparently fruitless evaluations of a subject and move the evaluator himself toward a more ideal and happier scene of success.

Cramming Series 5RB TRs IN CRAMMING There is no restriction whatsoever on doing TRs in Cramming. It is not rote and is done on each Cramming cycle. All Technical Personnel are expected to continue to work on and improve their TRs throughout all Training and Interneships and service in an Org or Franchise. The LRH Model Auditing Tapes and materials are the only guide to perfect TRs. Any questions or queries or strange ideas about any TRs must be immediately handled with Word Clearing on the relevant material. Beware of quickie TRs or Auditors who do five minutes of TR 0 and then say that they have improved their TR 0 and confront. Watch out for Auditors who cannot or will not do two hours of confront or Auditors who cannot deliver 2½ hours of auditing and short ses-sion. Be on the lookout for Supervisors whose students blow or who have small classroom attendance. The Interne Supervisor is responsible for forcing in daily TRs on Auditors, Internes, C/Ses, Cramming Officer, Pc Examiner, Word Clearers, Basic Courses Supervisors, Success Officer, D of P and D of T. Auditors and Internes get their TRs training done outside of production hours and time must be provided daily for this to be done. Each personnel may not be prevented from doing daily TRs. Technical reports show that some Auditors do not get in their minimum 25 WD hours showing the vital need for lots of TRs to be done. Poor scheduling keeps Auditors wait-ing, and unnecessarily lengthens their auditing day, leaving no time for daily TRs. Daily TRs and Auditor and Interne training times actually reduce time in Cramming. Auditors and Su-pervisors do not have cases and are expected to work on their TRs daily. Special TRs booklets and tapes have been compiled for Cramming Officers to assist them to get real correction of TRs done in Cramming.

Cramming Series 6RA CRAMMING EXPERTISE All Cramming Officers are to put up a large well lettered, permanent sign in the Cramming area: Good cramming is the key to flubless auditors and auditing LRH A Cramming Officer must be an experienced Auditor up to the highest Class of audit-ing he/she is Supervising. A failed Auditor on post will only result in failed correction cycles. Another Cramming Officer is appointed to handle students and admin cramming cycles. This has been proven a successful action. The Cramming Officer keeps a log book of all Cramming actions done and weekly re-views the types of Cramming actions going on with the different Auditors. He could find at this point that a certain Auditor has been crammed on three slightly different but related areas. He can, at this point, call the Auditor in and handle the more basic outness isolated. Packs of materials to do with a subject or action should be compiled for Cramming – e.g. Rudiments, Listing and Nulling, TRs, etc. If an Auditor goofs on Rudiments, he reviews the little pack, word clears it, drills the actions, etc. Word Clearing is used very heavily in Cramming. Auditors are not “sent to Word Clearing” when it is required. They are just twinned up and word clear the materials ordered in Cramming. If a student is consistently goofing on data contained in a particular level or course, he can be ordered to word clear the entire materials on that checksheet in Cramming. When certain materials have already been word cleared and the student is still goofing on the procedure, it must be considered that he has a confusion re the sequences of actions and the student must be very heavily drilled on that action."},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"CRAMMING EXPERTISE 2 CRS 6RA – BTB 8.03.75 V CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 316 16.12.09 The Cramming Officer has the whole resources of the Org Library to call upon. Many books contain key data applicable to every level and these should be used liberally in Cram-ming. If an Auditor is showing ignorance of a datum or rule, it is quite possible that he never read it. The three main areas investigated in Cramming are: 1. The student or Auditor never read it. The exact data may not have been on an earlier checksheet done on a subject. So one always ensures that all the data is to hand and reviewed. 2. The student or Auditor has misunderstoods in the material. Handled fully with Word Clearing, always on the whole text of the materials goofed. 3. The student or Interne has confusions on the sequences of actions. Handled by drilling. Can also be handled by HC lists. One point that the Cramming Officer must watch out for is overlong Cramming Or-ders. An overlong Cramming Order would be one that contained more than four or five is-sues. Such a Cramming Order is actually a training cycle and should be done in staff training. Overlong Cramming cycles tend to bring about a backlog because they cannot be handled quickly and completed. Qual is a corrective Division and should not get into routine training actions. Routine training belongs in the Tech Division. The Cramming Officer does not ac-cept overlong Cramming Orders. NO F/N AT EXAMS Per C/S Series 86RB, BTB 20 Jan 73RB, “The Red Tag Line”, the Examiner sends a copy of the list of the day’s Red Tags to the Cramming Officer. A Red Tag Pc report must lead at once to Cramming of the Auditor, the D of P, the C/S and the Tech Sec. They are immediately crammed on the appropriate materials with all Mis-U words cleared up and any Why found on the meter as needful. Any discovered instance of a non-F/N VGIs folder not being relayed to the C/S, and thus discovered by the Cramming Officer, must result in an immediate Ethics Hearing for No Report.

It is part of the Cramming Offi-cer’s responsibility to prevent Wrong Target correction. According to Qual Senior Datum, the Cramming Officer must not take orders but must do his own investigation and handling. It will be found that there is usually a valid corrective action to be made.

Cramming is there to find the real cause of any error. So if the real Why is not made known to the C/S he has a “something is wrong with Joe’s TRs” which hangs up in time and never is resolved. A response from Cramming to an order from the C/S to “check his TRs – Pc’s TA went low in session – “ which states: “I checked his TRs and they are good. But he audited the Pc in a room that was overhot and the cans were too big. He has been drilled on Auditor’s Code and session environment handling and HCO Bs on TA Errors and now has this down pat. It won’t happen again,” leaves the C/S in no doubt as to what really happened. What’s more he can order this repaired on the Pc by a “2wc on times he felt worried about his TA or F/Ns” taken E/Sim to F/N (which will clear it up). Furthermore the Auditor now knows that the C/S knows what the real error was, doesn’t get hung with a withhold or a false idea about his TRs from the C/S. In essence one is putting the Exact Truth on the line. So the following rule is now mandatory in all HGCs and Quals: The Cramming Officer is always on any cramming order to report the exact out-nesses found or the exact session goofs, with any additional data, in detail, to the C/S.

The Qual Page can also get needed Pc folders or packs and materials from the Li-brary as a service to the Cramming Officer. The high degree of personal attention in Cramming brings about a situation whereby a Cramming Officer can handle about 20 students at one time before he will tend to become overloaded. In this case, a second Cramming Officer must be added to reinforce the area. The Qual Sec and Org Officer must be alert to this or the area will get jammed and production lines slowed.

In all cases, also, all tech personnel had their TRs corrected and improved while in Cramming. All the tools of Tech Cramming are applicable into Admin Cramming, as can be seen by the above examples. Admin Cramming is vital to pick up, revitalize and get a floundering Division, area or Org on its feet and operating. Word Clearing plays a key role in Cramming, so there must always be a minimum of two Word Clearers in any Org. If an enterprising Qual Sec wants to get some Word Clearers, his best action would be to word clear the HAS and all HCO staff on their posts and duties until they get the message on the value of Word Clearing. Any Qual Sec who has no Word Clearers or Word Clearing being done in his Div should be ordered to extensive Word Clear-ing by his CO or ED, and then crammed in his own Qual on his hat. Cramming is not an area for weaklings or persons with no confront. It is probably one of the single most versatile posts in an Org. He has all types of staff with all types of flubs and outnesses to handle. He must use every skill he has, every piece of knowledge about Scientol-ogy and Dianetics, every piece of Policy, to handle his everyday work cycles. Any piece of tech by LRH, if a relevant handling for the situation, is grist for the mill of a Cramming Offi-cer.

An old HPA/HCA could get this action done in Cramming, for a fee, of course, prior to doing an Academy Retrain. The Cramming Officer must be familiar with all the tools he has at his disposal for the handling: HC List, Slow Eval Assessment, C/S 78 Wrong Why Finding Correction, Word Clearing, TRs, Admin TRs, Reach and Withdraw, 3 May 72 PL, C/S 53RI, PTS Tech, con-front of MEST and work areas, various study and staff correction lists, Pre-PCRD assessment, disagreement checks, Integrity Processing, writing drill, plus the entirety of the Technology and Policy and Books of Dianetics and Scientology. In working with lists which contain training and auditing correction actions, the rele-vant training correction actions are done in Qual and the Assessment form is routed to the Pc folder for the auditing actions needed to be done and Staff C/S advised. Do not buy case reasons as Whys for staff member post flubs. There are always post or staff reasons for flubs. However, if the Cramming Officer finds that staff on his lines are mis-audited or not audited, he should chit the D of P and Staff Training Officer for failure to take responsibility for seeing that staff get regular Intensives on a rotational basis, and that staff members in trouble do have their folders checked for Out Tech and do get corrected. When it is found that the staff member never studied or checked out on key data or post hat material in the first place, the correct Cramming handling is to cram in the key mate-rial so the person can now function, and see that a post training program is written up by Pers Programmer and done in staff training. The one to five steps in the method above do not take more than a half to one hour at the most. Do not hesitate to use TRs and drills on staff members in Admin Cramming. They need TRs and drilling as much as Tech personnel. What to do with the staff member who has never been crammed in the first place? As Admin Cramming starts being used more regularly in Orgs, Cramming Officers will find themselves with bogged staff who have never had any Cramming. He will then be handling an actual backlog situation which is unexpressed. In this case, he should get a write-up from the Div Head involved of exactly how this person has been operating and the outnesses observed. The Cramming Officer should then get the person himself to write up what he considers that he has been or has not been doing, plus a write-up of exactly what post training the person has had. The Cramming Off goes over the data with the person and they sort out and group the outnesses as found, thus locating the key outness to be handled. For this person, the handling will be what will rapidly handle the Why found and enable the person to function on post.

Cramming done over an ARC Break, like Auditing, will result in the person getting worse, more out of comm or misemotional. Cramming a person over a problem or W/H will produce no change so no correction will occur. Out ruds are easy to spot. The person with an ARC Break, won’t talk or is misemo-tional or antagonistic. A problem produces fixated attention that prevents Cramming from finding the actual area of difficulty. Natter and 1.1 remarks means a withhold. Recently a musician being crammed kept bringing up a dispatch that he was in mys-tery about concerning the group. Every time it was mentioned it read or BDed yet the Cram-ming Officer continued “Cramming” him and never handled it. So no product. I sat the musician down, told him he was crammed over a problem, the mystery about the dispatch, cleaned it up by getting the dispatch and letting him go over it, made sure the problem was handled then found the area of misunderstood and traced it back to an early age and the Why fell right out. And I got the Cramming Officer crammed by the Senior C/S and found her Why too. So the moral of the story is don’t cram over out ruds. It is too costly in lost production and flaps. CRAMMING OFFICER FLUBS When the Cramming Officer flubs you must get him crammed fast because he will re-peat the error on others and there goes your results. In such cases, get him crammed immediately by the Qual Sec or Senior C/S. If it is the Qual Sec who has flubbed, then he is crammed either by the Senior C/S or the Keeper of Tech."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"CRAMMING OVER OUT RUDS 2 HCOB 15.10.74 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 340 16.12.09 INCOMPLETE HANDLING It is often not enough just to correct a Why and do no further handling in Cramming. Most Cramming Cycles reveal a broader area of situation which must also be handled. An example is the Auditor who flubs on an L4BR and during the Cramming reveals he never really listened to the key SHSBC L&N tapes. The Cramming Officer who does not also program the Auditor for a review of those tapes would not have fully corrected that Auditor. You could accurately predict future L&N flubs and pc upsets. A subsequent program such as the one above would count as an additional Cramming Cycle for the Cramming Officer, or a Retread if lengthy and would count as additional points. Therefore the maxim of Cramming is: Handle the hell out of it. Honest correction must be fully and completely done for the sake of the public and the org as well as the staff member. SUMMARY Cramming success depends on not Cramming over out ruds and on fully handling all areas of confusion or weakness. Follow these operating rules and you will enjoy rave results and real correction. And your org stats will soar. L.

This means metered Why Finding, checks for misunderstoods, scouting for areas of uncertainty, completion of clay demos and word clearing. Neglect of the full use of the meter has led to half done, ineffective and often repeat Cramming cycles as the person’s why or M/U was never found in the first place.

The tech of finding a Why on an individual person is extremely important and is the fundamental tool of the Est O, Cramming Officer, Dept of Personnel Enhancement and oth-ers. The resolution of a major broad Why can depend on the finding and handling of indi-vidual Whys. Example: In LRH ED 174R INT the Why of failures in Tech and Admin areas was found to be “Study Tech not in use for individual whys for each supervisor and stu-dent”. A similar example exists where tapes with Scientology materials were not in full or proper use, the Why being “Tapes with Scientology materials not in use for an individual Why for each org person concerned”. In each case, the tech of finding the individual Why is necessary to handling the broad Why. This tech is contained in the Data Series PLs and is restated here in brief form for finding the Why on a person. STEPS 1. Know the Data Series PLs. (Don’t have any misunderstood words on them.) 2. Work out exactly what the person should be producing. 3. Work out the ideal scene. 4. Investigate the existing scene. Observe the scene around the person for outpoints related to what the person should be doing in an Ideal Scene."},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND A WHY ON A PERSON 2 CRS 16 BTB 6.04.72R AND HANDLE CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 344 16.12.09 Verify that there is a situation with that individual and that you know what the situa-tion is. Don’t go trying to find the Why of a no situation. (A bad situation is measured by the difference between existing scene and an Ideal Scene and threat to Ideal Scene.) 5. Ask the person exact specific questions pertaining to the situation. 6. Do not at any time ask the person for the Why. If the person knew the Why, the situa-tion wouldn’t exist. 7. Use the comm formula and get your questions answered. Don’t be diverted by the per-son’s “reasons”. 8. Note all outpoints. 9. Be alert for the area(s) with the most outpoints which relate to the situation. 10. Verify the data by looking. This will often reveal the major outpoint which leads to the Why. It must be realized that you are often looking for an omitted something, hence a knowledge of the Ideal Scene and product is required. 11. When you find a major outpoint, trace down the chain of outpoints to the Why. Pull the string by asking more questions in the area of the Major Outpoint. 12. The big crashing outpoint that explains all the other outpoints will be the Why. 13. The Why must have something to do with the person. If not, you will have a “Why is God” and it won’t resolve. 14. Indicate the Why to the person. Correct Whys result in Cogs and VGIs. A wrong Why can make the person feel degraded, will not bring in VGIs and will not lead to a resolution of the situation. 15. Look over existing resources. 16. Get a Bright Idea of how to handle. 17. Handle or recommend handling so that it stays handled. The handling of the Why must directly relate to the Why that was found. EXAMPLES 1. Situation: Supervisor not using study tech. Investigation: Supervisor was observed, found to be very casual with students. No 8-C. Supervisor questioned. All outpoints in area of Supervisor not wanting to tell stu-dents what to do and himself not liking to be told what to do. Why: Big button on control and does not want to control others.

Whereas the majority of auditors do a good job, there are some who don’t, and it is these who have our reputation at stake. The general outness has been traced (as usual) to out TRs and metering. Lack of a Cramming in Qual Divs and even lack of Qual Divs is what has brought this about. TRs and metering are out of the view of a C/S. He only sees what is written on the Auditor Report. A Cramming should exist in every org and every bog should cause the auditor to be sent to Cramming on the material missed. As TRs and metering are not visible to the C/S, Cramming should always add “Two hours TRs and metering” as a matter of course. This was the way it was when tech was more consistent. A TR 1 that can’t be heard (or blows the pc’s head off), a TR 2 that consists of “That didn’t read. That read” and TR 4 that is pure Q and A, plus missed reads and bypassed F/Ns can wreck any program. A Cramming in every org and required verification of TRs and metering will go a long ways to improve tech quality. L.

To remedy this, I developed the following Cramming Repair List. In subsequent use of it, including people who had been mis-crammed elsewhere, the usage appeared quite miracu-lous. It has been found that faulty, quickie or mis-cramming can result in continual goofs or an apparency of out-ethics as the person isn’t correcting. This list covers the basic errors that can occur in cramming. It has also been found that a Cramming Officer who has consistent overt products will mess up an area. This list is used to correct such cramming. This list can be used by an auditor in session who finds the pc has bypassed charge on his past cramming. It is also used when a bog or impasse occurs during or following a cram-ming action. Its main use is to clear up an org or area where it is found that one or more Cramming Officers have been messing it up. In such an instance, it is applied to every past or present staff member. In such an instance particularly, its use can result in a miraculous resurge of the org or area. Needless to say it can produce a remarkable resurgence in a person who has a history of being mis-crammed. The list is done in a session by an auditor who has a Qual OK to assess a prepared list and Qual OK to operate an E-Meter. Auditor Instruction: In case of a wrong why, use L4BRA.

Despite this, there still have been instances of persons being “handled” in cramming without the ruds having been gotten in, so no handling got done at all. HOW TO FLY RUDS IN CRAMMING To begin any cramming of anyone, assess the ruds including overts, invalidation and evaluation and fly any that read. Then when you have cleared up the reads to F/Ns and have an F/N, begin the exact cramming orders indicated. You can mimeo a small form on which to assess these and mark reads which will save time.

PREVIOUSLY MISDONE CRAMMING Misdone crammings and failure to fly the ruds in cramming will mess up staff mem-bers, and undisclosed overts and withholds will prevent any gain, not just in auditing but in Word Clearing or cramming or other Qual corrective actions. Resistance to cramming, protest of cramming or natter about cramming, or other Qual corrective actions are indicative of out-ruds, especially overts and withholds against cram-ming or Qual or on the subject on which the cramming order was written. These symptoms of resistance or natter can also stem from having been crammed over out-ruds in the past, or having been mishandled in cramming. The way to handle someone who has been crammed over out-ruds in the past is to as-sess the following and fly each reading line to F/N: “Have you been crammed over.... an ARC break?” _____ a present time problem?” _____ a withhold?” _____ an overt?” _____ any invalidation?” _____ any evaluation?” _____ If someone is nattery about Cramming, Qual correction actions, or Qual, use the as-sessment above on the subject of their complaint. E.g. you could assess: “Have you been Word Cleared over?” If the above does not resolve the matter fully, use the Cramming Repair Assessment List (HCOB 2 Jun 78R), or other specific list such as the Word Clearing Correction List (WCCL). CRAMMING OFFICER QUALIFICATIONS Because the Cramming Officer is required to do these actions, he or she must get checked out on how to do them. Possibly a reason why some did not fly the ruds despite HCOB 15 Oct 74 CRAMMING OVER OUT-RUDS, is that the Cramming Officer did not know how to fly ruds and had not gotten himself trained to do so, then either didn’t fly ruds before he attempted to do the cramming order, or did not do the cramming order at all “because the ruds were out.” Both of these errors show an effect attitude that no real Cramming Officer (or Scientologist for that matter), would be guilty of. Cramming Officers get tech in and being applied, staff members successful and winning on their post and are therefore very causative."},{"pageNumber":371,"pageContent":"FLYING RUDS IN CRAMMING 3 HCOB 24.09.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 357 16.12.09 A Cramming Officer must get checked out on flying ruds and overts as these are vital tech of the cramming hat. If a classed auditor, he must get checked out on use of correction lists such as the Cramming Repair Assessment List, WCCL, etc. Failure to check out on and use the tech of the post is an ethics matter. WORKSHEETS The worksheets (W/Ses) of all such actions (i.e. ruds, Word Clearing, crammings, Cramming Repair Lists, Product Debug Assessments and any other Qual corrective action), are put in the pc folder and sent to the Case Supervisor (C/S). The C/S will correct any out-tech or failure to fully handle, and in the case of no F/N at Exams or other out-tech, red tags the folder, until the matter is fully repaired. These worksheets must be complete, accurate and legible. In the case of a non F/N exam or other bad indicator, these have rush priority and must be handled fast. All the rules regarding worksheets apply to cramming and any other Qual corrective actions. IS A C/S NEEDED BEFORE FLYING RUDS IN CRAMMING? Someone may wonder if he needs to get a C/S to fly the ruds before doing so in a cramming action. The answer is: no. You do not need to get the pc’s folder to the C/S before you fly the ruds in cramming. To do so would make an unnecessary delay, and you don’t need a C/S to fly somebody’s ruds. The C/S (Case Supervisor instruction) is contained in this issue, and that is what you do. FOLDER CHECK BEFORE CRAMMING Sometimes a staff member has been known to have been started on and left incomplete on several different actions. E.g. the staff member is started on a cramming order, but before this is complete, someone starts doing a Crashing Misunderstood handling on him, they end for lunch and after lunch someone tries to start yet another action on the staff member. This is a serious situation indeed and it could be enough to spin somebody. So it is mandatory that before starting an action, you must check the folder first. Cramming orders and flying ruds in cramming and other Qual corrective actions do not require C/S OK before doing them as this would put an unnecessary and arbitrary delay on the line, and could be used as an excuse not to do the action. (E.g. “I couldn’t fly his ruds because I didn’t have a C/S to ‘fly the ruds’, so I didn’t do anything.”) But since one would not start a new cycle in the middle of another in-complete cycle, and would not try to fly ruds or word clear over out-Int or out-lists (provided these really were out and not just a false or protest read), the folder must be checked by the person who is going to do the action (this only takes a minute to do)."},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"FLYING RUDS IN CRAMMING 4 HCOB 24.09.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 358 16.12.09 Before starting a Cramming or other Qual Corrective Action, look in the folder to ensure the person isn’t in the middle of another Qual Corrective Action, or C/Sed to get a flubbed action repaired. After the cramming or other Qual Corrective Action, send the folder to the Case Supervisor with legible worksheets on what you did and the exam form. FESing If a person has been “crammed” or has had other Qual corrective actions and has got-ten worse, or made no improvement, then get all Qual corrective actions done on the person FESed by the Case Supervisor, and a program and C/S to repair these, and get that program done. Comm Ev anyone who interrupts or cross-orders or prevents such a program from being done, as that would be suppressive. Such a program has the priority of repairing a flubbed session and the folder is red tagged, until handled. USE THE TECH There are several new Qual corrective actions as well as all the earlier tools of cram-ming. These produce spectacular results when done correctly. Use this tech to make greatly enhanced staff members. Your cramming will be many times more effective and popular if you do it with the correct tech. L.

Reasons for this are given in HCOB 23 Jul AD19, which also sets the policy: “Therefore it is policy not to assign an auditor whose grade and class is less than that of the pc.” This policy becomes even more important when handling assignments on pre-OTs, because if the auditor were of lower case grade it would prevent the pre-OT from communi-cating to the auditor and the auditor not being aware of or trained on the materials of the level of case of the pre-OT, would not be able to audit that pre-OT and would risk disaster for the pre-OT as well as himself. As Cramming Officers fly ruds in Cramming and as some of the Cramming and Qual corrective actions can get into a person’s case, this policy is extended to apply to Cramming Officers, as well as auditors. Therefore the following policies apply: 1. It is policy not to assign an auditor whose grade and class is less than that of the pc. (HCOB 23 Jul AD19) 2. It is policy to assign only good proven auditors to good auditors. (HCOB 23 Jul AD19) 3.

A person who has been audited on NED for OTs, may only be audited or crammed by a NED for OTs auditor. The terms “auditor” and “Cramming Officer” in these policies above are intended to include anyone acting in the capacity of an auditor or Cramming Officer and the fact that one is not a trained or posted auditor or Cramming Officer does not permit one to do auditing or Qual corrective actions in violation of the policies above. These policies apply to any auditing actions and to Qual corrective actions such as Why Finding, metered debug actions, False Data Stripping, Confessionals (whether done in Qual or HCO), Clay Table auditing and these policies are intended to apply to any new Qual corrective actions released in the future. Subjective questions and metered actions which lead into a person’s case are not OK on OTs. Such actions are not advised on lower level cases either, unless these have been C/Sed for and are part of standard tech. Otherwise this type of action is only a covert way of auditing the person while not calling it auditing and is forbidden in C/S Series 29 CASE AC-TIONS, OFFLINE. Nonstandard actions or interviews done by untrained persons whose TRs and metering are out are especially forbidden, as detrimental to cases. Definition of “subjective”: “Consultation with the preclear’s own universe, with his mock ups, and with his own thoughts and considerations.” (COHA, page 167) “Recall, think, remember or return on the time track processes are subjective.” (HCOB 2 Nov 57RA) There are actions which are OK to do in Cramming. These are not related to the per-son’s case. They relate to his post and performance. These are objective questions or actions. Definition of “objective”: “Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept, idea or belief.” (Dictionary) “Means here and now objects in PT as opposed to ‘subjective’.” (HCOB 2 Nov 57RA) Questions or actions by the Cramming Officer which are objective and pertain to the person’s post, the materials which cover his post or that he is studying, clearing words misunderstood, hatting actions and post or Product Debugs (pro-vided subjective questions are not asked on OTs) are all OK. The most usual and successful cramming action is simply to take the materials or text that covers the subject of the cram-ming order and word clear and cram those materials. This is always safe and OK to do. (The only other caution is not to give verbal data, nor to evaluate or invalidate or throw the per-son’s ruds out while doing the cram!) It is not that OTs are difficult to handle. To the contrary OTs are far easier and faster to handle than non-OTs. But OT cases must be handled as OT cases or the person doing the handling risks invalidation of case level of the OT and could get into aspects of the case that he/she knows nothing about and is thus incapable of handling or repairing. OTs when handled on the appropriate auditing and Qual corrective actions for their state of case by auditors, Cramming Officers and C/Ses who are qualified to do so, make very fast and spectacular gains.

The major cause of trouble in seeking to correct OTs has been violations of the auditor assignment policy, whereby a person of lower case level than the OT was trying to audit or cram the OT. Not only does this put the OT on a withhold of confidential data, but a person of lower case level has no reality on the materials of the case level of the OT and can easily stir up aspects of the case that should have been left alone, or, if taken up handled fully. Addi-tionally if the OT did get messed up, then he could only be repaired by using Repair actions appropriate to his case level. A non-OT III Cramming Officer or auditor could not possibly repair BPC on an OT III. Where Cramming Officers have limited their actions to simply word clearing the ma-terials that the person had gone past misunderstoods on, it has worked out OK. But if the ac-tion being done led into the person’s case then there is a liability of messed up case and inef-fective staff member. Some of the Qual corrective actions such as False Data Stripping and some of the questions in the Product Debug Checklist are not directed toward the person’s post alone but are directed towards the person’s case by asking about intentions or reactions or considera-tions or directing the person to recall past events. The statement: „I’m not auditing you.“, doesn’t prevent a case action from occurring if one then proceeds to ask auditing questions. The worst repercussions of all have stemmed from offline case actions done as some sort of squirrelly „2WC“ which wasn’t a valid part of the cramming action anyway. When subjective questions are asked one invariably is into a case action. Definition of „Subjective“: „Consultation with the preclear’s own universe, with his mock ups, and with his"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"QUAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ON OTS 2 HCOB 11.01.80 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 366 16.12.09 own thoughts and considerations.“ (BOOK THE CREATION OF HUMAN ABILITY, p. 167.) „Re-call, think, remember or return on the time track processes are subjective.“ (HCOB 2 Nov 57RA.) Subjective actions, especially when metered, lead into the person’s case. If mis-done, particularly if mis-metered, these can ball the case up. OTs when correctly handled with the correct tech appropriate to their case level, han-dle very quickly and easily. So it is important to know what to do and what not to do. The solution to this is in having specialized lists for OTs, and forbidding the use of non-OT actions on OTs, and forbidding non-OTs from seeking to audit or cram OTs. HOW TO DETECT FLUBBED CRAMMING There are ways to detect and isolate what happened in a mis-done cramming: – The person crammed has any BIs about the cramming action; – The person continues to goof in the same area or subject; – The person Red Tags on the cramming or within three days after the cramming action; – The person gets sick, misemotional on the subject of the cram, or turns on somat-ics, within three days of the cramming action; – The person is introverted on the subject of the cram; – The person comes to next session after the cram with TA or needle behaviour worsened from what it was prior to the cram, (such as TA used to be in normal range and now is high or low, or Sens setting for 1/3rd dial drop on can squeeze is now higher due to tighter needle, an unusual needle pattern has now appeared, etc.). A sharp C/S can usually spot a mis-done cram from the worksheets of the cramming action and must insist that these are legible and accurate (ref: HCOB C/S Series 98, AUDITING FOLDERS, OMISSIONS IN COMPLETENESS). These indicators above apply to flubbed cramming at any case level, (not just OTs), and must be repaired within 24 hours. Where the person is of an upper case level, the C/S and auditor must be of comparable case level (C/S Series 107). ACTIONS THAT CAN BE DONE There are actions that are OK to do in Cramming and will not get into the person’s case. These relate to his post or study and are objective. Definition of „Objective“: „Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept, idea or belief“ (Dictionary). „Means here and now objects in PT as opposed to ‘subjective’.“ (HCOB 2 Nov 57A.)"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"QUAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ON OTS 3 HCOB 11.01.80 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 367 16.12.09 Questions or actions by the Cramming Officer which are objective and pertain to the person’s post, the materials which cover his post, the materials he is studying, clearing words misunderstood, hatting actions and post or product debugs (provided subjective questions are not asked on OTs) are all OK. The most usual and successful cramming action is simply to take the materials or text that covers the subject of the cramming order and word clear and cram those materials. This is always safe and OK to do. (The only other caution is not to give verbal data, nor to evaluate or invalidate or throw the person’s ruds out while doing the cram!) Word Clearing Methods 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are OK to do on OTs (but not Method One, which asks for „earlier similar?“). Finding and clearing Crashing Misunderstood Words is OK. Demonstrating meanings or words and terms and principles either with a demo kit or on Clay Table are OK. Starrate checkouts on materials are OK. Product Debug Tech is OK to do on OTs (provided the subjective questions on the as-sessments are omitted). All of the actions given in this section can and should be used in Cramming, and these have no liability. OTs when handled correctly in Cramming (or in auditing) are very fast and easy to handle, and correct very readily. L.

I found many targets bugged. Project Operators did not seem to know what to do and were getting losses and becoming frustrated. Their targets were “bugged.” “Bugged” is slang for snarled up or halted. “Debug” means to get the snarls or stops out of something. I had always been given to believe somebody had developed and written up debug tech. People would often tell me they had debugged this or that, so of course I assumed that the tech existed and that issues and checksheets existed and were in use. Yet here were people operating projects who couldn’t get the targets done by themselves or others. I didn’t recall ever having written any policy letter containing the tech of debugging programs or targets. So I called for the various “Debug Checksheets” and “Debug Issues” they were using and found something very astonishing. None had any real tech on them to debug something. They just had various quotes that did not necessarily apply. I did a study of the subject based on what people trying to debug should be doing and what they were not doing and developed a fast, relatively simple system. Some Project Opera-tors were located in very bugged areas which had brought them to apathy and even tears of frustration. The new debug tech was put into their hands and they came streaming back in wild excitement. It worked! Their areas were rolling! I am releasing this tech to you as it is vital that programs are quickly executed and that production occurs. This debug tech is tested, fully valid and for immediate use. Debug tech is a vital executive tool. Anyone who is responsible for getting targets and programs executed, getting production out, turning insolvency into solvency and generally making a better world frankly can’t live without it. Debug tech is used to debug program targets, programs, a lack of completion of the cycles of action which lead to production and in short, whenever there is any insufficiency of viable products coming from an area, org or individual. THE TECH I. INSPECTION The first action in debugging an area is an inspection to see what is going on in terms of production. In inspecting the area you do the following: 1. You look for what products have been gotten out in the past. 2. You look for products that are there completed."},{"pageNumber":385,"pageContent":"DEBUG TECH 3 HCO PL 23.08.79 I CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 371 16.12.09 3. You look for what products can be attained in the immediate future. 4. You look for the value of the products produced as compared to the overall cost of the production organization. 5. You look for overt products or cycles where products continuously have to be redone, resulting in no or few products. The full volume of data on how to do an investigation is given in the Investigations Checksheet on page 175 of The Volunteer Minister’s Handbook. When you first inspect an area for products you just look. Policies on “Look Don’t Listen” apply (HCO PL 16 Mar 72, Esto Series 8, LOOK DON’T LISTEN). Don’t listen to how they are going to get 150 products, just look and walk around with a clipboard. If you don’t see 150 products waiting to be shipped or invoices showing they have been, they don’t exist. If you don’t see receipts for 150 shipped products, they don’t exist and never have. The product is either there or there is ample shipping or departure or finance evi-dence that they have just left or been shipped. Products that are only in people’s heads don’t exist. Dreams are nice – in fact they are essential in life but they have to be materialized into the physical universe before they exist as products. The most wide trap the debugger can fall into is, “But next week...,” since experience will tell you that next week’s production may never arrive. The definition of product is some-thing that can be exchanged for a valuable product or currency. They have subproducts. These are necessary. A subproduct can also be an overt product and block final products. When you have done your product inspection, you then look over the period of time from a viewpoint of time and motion. This is to answer the question, “Are things arranged so that there is no time wasted in useless motions which are unnecessary?” This includes poor placement of materiel on a flow line or tool sheds five miles from the site of work so that one has to go there every time one wants a hammer, out-of-sequence flows or waits. One counts up the amount of wasted time simply because of the disorganization of a place. It isn’t enough to say a place is disorganized. How is this disorganization consuming time and motion which is not resulting in a higher quantity of production? Examples of this are quite gross. When you have done this study, during which of course you have made notes, you will have the raw materials necessary to make an estimation of the area. If there is not an adequate and even spectacular record of products getting out and if products have to be redone or if no products are coming out, you proceed as follows: II. PERSONAL HANDLING Find a product that can be gotten out, any product, and insist that it and products like it or similar cycles be gotten out flat out by the existing personnel."},{"pageNumber":386,"pageContent":"DEBUG TECH 4 HCO PL 23.08.79 I CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 372 16.12.09 Do not let this debug act as an excuse for them not to produce. The first step of this handling is to demand production. When you have gotten them on that, you enter in upon a second stage of debug. This consists essentially of finding if the place is knowledgeable enough and able enough to pro-duce what is actually required and what is actually valuable or being needed from it. This is accomplished as follows: (Note: You should not attempt to find Crashing MUs, etc. until the above inspection and the Steps A to H below have been done.) A. Where are the orders relating to this target (or project or production area)? (Can in-clude policies, directives, orders, bulletins, issues, despatches, tapes, valid texts and previous debugs and any and all files.) Handling: Collect up all of the orders relating to this target (or project or production area). This includes the orders and policies the person is operating off of as well as all those he should be operating off of. At this point you may need to employ the “How to Defeat Verbal Tech Checklist”: 1. If it isn’t written it isn’t true. 2. If it’s written, read it. 3. Did the person who wrote it have the authority or know how to order it? 4. If you can’t understand it, clarify it. 5. If you can’t clarify it, clear the MUs. 6. If the MUs won’t clear, query it. 7. Has it been altered from the original? 8. Get it validated as a correct, on-channel, on-policy, in-tech order. 9. Only if it holds up this far, force others to read it and follow it. If it can’t be run through as above it’s false! Cancel it! And use HCOB 7 Aug 79 FALSE DATA STRIPPING as needed. B. Have you read the orders? Handling: If he has not read them then have him read, word clear and starrate them. Ca. Do you have MUs on these orders? Handling: Get the orders word cleared using M4, M9 or M2 Word Clearing – what-ever Word Clearing is needed to fully clear any MUs he has. Cb. Do you have false data on these orders? Handling: Strip off the false data per HCOB/PL 7 Aug 79 FALSE DATA STRIPPING.

It may be necessary to do this debug on the HAS or any person responsible for getting the products of staff members who produce. F. Are there hatting problems?

Hatting problems may include the total and utter lack of a hatting course for the staff or a hatting course where WHAT IS A COURSE? PL is flagrantly not in and if you find this you have gotten to the root of why you are working hard debugging all over the place and it had better be handled quick. It may also be that the area senior doesn’t make sure his staff puts in study time off production hours and in this you may find the senior is a failed student himself and this you would also have to handle. Note: A person who cannot be hatted at all has false data. The handling would be to strip off the false data. G.

When told that these exterior influences exist the wise debugger immediately verifies. The simplest way to verify is to ask the person who is supposed to be putting stops on the line if he has issued such orders. You commonly find out he hasn’t. But if he has, then you have started to locate your area to handle. You commonly run into verbal tech at which moment you use the “HOW TO DEFEAT VERBAL TECH CHECKLIST.” H.

Do they have any idea at all that they should be getting out any products? Or do they pretend to but don’t? Handling: Simply two-way comm of why the guy was there. It might come as a star-tling realization that he is supposed to get out products. This can be backed up with Exchange by Dynamics, HCO PL 4 Apr 72, Esto Series 14, ETHICS and Short Form Product Clearing, HCO PL 13 Mar 72, Esto Series 5, PRODUCTION AND ESTABLISH-MENT ORDERS AND PRODUCTS or HCO PL 23 Mar 72, Esto Series 11, FULL PRODUCT CLEARING LONG FORM. There is also such a thing as a person who will not complete a cycle of action. This is normally true of what we call a “suppressive person” or even an insane person. Handling: Get the person’s case looked into by a competent C/S and also by the Ethics Officer for background. But as PTS people are in suppressive persons’ valences he may only be PTS. Handling: See Section P below for de-PTSing. L. Wrong stat. The person has been given a stat that has nothing to do with what he is supposed to produce. Handling: get the right stat figured out so that it agrees with what he is supposed to produce and actually measures his actual production. M. Wrong VFP or wrong product? Do they have the idea of VFP right? (or does the org think it’s the award rather than the product, i.e. GI rather than an audited paying pc or a trained paying student?). It of course can occur, amazingly, that the person or department, etc. is trying to turn out a product that has no exchange value. This can occur because what they do pro-duce is so flubby as to be called “an overt product” which nobody can use further on up the line or even at the end of the line. You handle this by coming down on their sense of fitness of things. Overt products waste resources and time and personnel and are actually more destructive than on first glance. They cannot be exchanged but they"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"DEBUG TECH 7 HCO PL 23.08.79 I CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 375 16.12.09 also waste resources as well as lose any expected return. You can remedy this sort of thing by improving their tech so they do turn out something decent and useful. They can also be turning out a type of product nobody wants – such as 1819 buggy whips in a Space Age. They may be great buggy whips but they won’t exchange be-cause nobody wants them. They may also be getting out products of excellent quality but never tell anybody they have or do them. This can apply as narrowly as one worker who doesn’t tell anybody he is having or doing them or a whole organization which, with complete asininity, never markets or advertises their products. It is also possible that a combination of all three things above may be found. It also may be they have all sorts of products they could get out but they never dreamed of getting them out yet their life blood may depend upon it.

O. Out-ethics? Handling: Determine the situation and handle with O/W write-ups or auditing and eth-ics conditions or correction of past conditions and the ethics policies that apply. P. Is the area or individual creating problems and demanding solutions to them? Handling: Give the person PTS handling as per ethics policies. If and when available, get the personnel de-PTSed using Clay Table De-PTSing as per HCOB CLAY TABLE DE-PTSING – THEORY AND ADMINISTRATION. (Note: Clay Table De-PTSing can only be done on someone by a person who has had the step himself.) Q. Total organize? (Is the area organizing only?) Handling: This is an indicator of many misunderstoods in the area, especially on the part of its senior. The senior and the personnel in the area need full Word Clearing on the materials to do with the production area, including Crashing MU finding as in J (ref: HCO PL 26 Mar 79RA MISUNDERSTOOD WORDS AND CYCLES OF ACTION – MU WORDS AND NO PRODUCTS) off production hours and meanwhile make them produce what they can.

No organization: Handling: This is the situation where someone does not organize any corner of his area or work or organizations or lines. This manifests itself by irrational demands to only produce and to prevent any organization so that production can occur. The han-dling is to clear the misunderstoods (including Crashing MUs) in the area, particularly on the purpose of the production and why one is producing. Lacking a sense of organization? Handling: Lack of a sense of organization lies below the level of MUs, overts and withholds and PTSness – and you have to go north through PTSness and overts and withholds to even get to the MUs. The handling would be de-PTSing as in Step P. Then handle any overts and withholds and then clear the MUs in the area being addressed (including Crashing MUs.) Debug tech is laid out as a checklist in HCO PL 23 Aug 79, Issue II, DEBUG TECH CHECKLIST. It is a very useful checklist as the points of debug can be assessed on a meter by an auditor (or any person trained to use an E-Meter) or be administratively used by anyone wishing to debug an area. HCOB 23 Aug 79, Issue II, PRODUCT DEBUG REPAIR LIST is for use by an auditor to repair someone who has been messed up by somebody trying to debug his area. As faulty de-bugging can mess a person up, this repair list has been written to remedy that, should it occur. _____________________ Normally, in an area that is very bogged and not producing, the first question or two will deliver the reasons right into your hands. They are trying to produce blue ruddy rods but the order they finally dig up after a fifteen minute search says specifically and directly that green finglebums are what are wanted here and that blue ruddy rods are forbidden. It is usu-ally outrageous and large. As you go down the list you will find out that you are running into things which open the door to justification. So you take very good care to notice the justifica-tions which are being used. The handling of justifications is indicated in HCOB 23 Aug 79, Issue I, CRASHING MUS, BLOCKS TO FINDING THEM and the HCOB of JUSTIFICATIONS 21 Jan AD10."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"DEBUG TECH 9 HCO PL 23.08.79 I CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 377 16.12.09 WHAT TO HANDLE Handling of course is indicated by what you find and the above references. But han-dling must always be in the direction of at least 50% production. Even while debugging do not go for an all-organize handling. Also do not go for an all-production handling. A person, once trained on the data as contained in this PL, Crashing MU tech, False Data Stripping and Product Clearing, will be able to get almost any area debugged and pro-ducing. It is important to remember that debug tech applies from the very small expected ac-tion to the huge expected project. THE EP OF DEBUG The above debug actions are never carried on past the point where the target or area or individual or org has been debugged. Once production has been debugged and desirable products are now being gotten for real in adequate quantity, the debug has been accomplished. This could occur at any one of the above steps. And when it does you let the area get on with producing the products they are now able to produce. EVALUATION AND PROGRAMMING There is a whole different technology called Evaluation. The full tech on how to exe-cute and program is contained in the Data Series and the Data Series Evaluator’s Course and BPL 4 Jul 78 ELEMENTARY EVALUATOR’S COURSE and the Target Series HCO PLs: 14 Jan 69 OT ORGS, 16 Jan 69 TARGETS, TYPES OF, 18 Jan 69, Issue II, PLANNING AND TARGETS, 24 Jan 69, TARGET TYPES, 24 Jan 69, Issue II, PURPOSE AND TARGETS and HCO PL 4 Dec 73, Data Series 32, TARGET TROUBLE. One is expected to know how to evaluate. But even after you have evaluated, evaluations contain targets. And targets get bugged. So you will need debug tech even when you are an accomplished evaluator. With the debug tech and the added steps of Crashing MU finding, overts and with-holds, False’ Data Stripping, Product Clearing, etc. you will be able to crack the back of the most resistive non-producing areas and get them into roaring, high-morale production. Between February 79 and 23 August 79 I have spent a great deal of development time on the technology needed to completely debug people, projects, targets and production. A very large number of missions researches and pilots were undertaken to discover and polish up this tech. It can now be considered a completed development cycle. The above is the tech. Use it!

The person will remain unfamiliar with the fundamentals of his activity, at times appearing idiotic, because of these not-defined and falsely defined words. Verbal hatting is the main source of false definitions and false data. Someone who “knows” tells someone else a definition or a datum. The person now thinks he knows the definition (even though nothing in the field makes any sense to him). The word may not even read on the meter during misunderstood checks because the person “thinks he knows.” A politician is told by an advisor, “It doesn’t matter how much money the government spends. It is good for the society.” The politician uses this “rule” and the next thing you know, inflation is driving everybody to starvation and the government to bankruptcy. The politician, knowing he was told this on the very best authority, does not spot it as false data, but continues to use it right up to the point where the angry mobs stand him up in front of a firing squad and shoot him down. And the pity of it is that the politician never once suspected that there was anything false about the data, even though he couldn’t work with it."},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"FALSE DATA STRIPPING 2 HCOB 7.8.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 380 16.12.09 There is no field in all the society where false data is not rampant. “Experts,” “Advi-sors,” “Friends,” “Families” seldom go and look at the basic texts on subjects, even when these are known to exist, but indulge in all manner of interpretations and even outright lies to seem wise or expert. The cost, in terms of lost production and damaged equipment is enor-mous. You will see it in all sectors of society. People cannot think with the fundamentals of their work. They goof. They ruin things. They have to redo what they have already done. You’ll find people whose estimate of the environment is totally perverted to the point they’re walking around literally in a fog. The guy looks at a tree and the reality of the tree is blurred by the “fact” that “trees are made by God” so he won’t take care of the tree because he is convinced. What we’re trying to cure in people is the inability to think with data. This was traced by me to false data as a phenomenon additional to misunderstood words, although the misun-derstood word plays a role in it and will have to be allowed for. When a person is having difficulty in an area or on a post, when he can’t seem to ap-ply what he has “learned” or what he is studying or when he can’t get through a specific drill or exercise in his training materials, you would suspect he has false data in that area or on those materials. If he is to use it at all effectively he must first sort out the true facts regarding it from the conflicting bits and pieces of information or opinion he has acquired. This elimi-nates the false data and lets him get on with it. INABILITY TO HAT We are looking here at a brand new discovery I have made which is that it can be nearly impossible to hat anyone who is sitting on false data on the subject you are trying to hat him on. This is the primary reason people cannot be hatted and False Data Stripping there-fore enables a person to be hatted even though other approaches have failed. This is a very valuable discovery – it solves the problem of inability to hat or train. SOURCES False data on a subject can come from any number of sources. In the process of day-to-day living people encounter and often accept without inspection all sorts of ideas which may seem to make sense but don’t. Advertising, newspapers, TV and other media are packed with such material. The most profound false data can come out of texts such as Stanislavsky (a Russian actor and director); and even mothers have a hand in it, such as “children should be seen and not heard.” Where a subject, such as art, contains innumerable authorities and voluminous opin-ions you may find that any and all textbooks under that heading reek with false data. Those who have studied study tech will recall that the validity of texts is an important factor in study."},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"FALSE DATA STRIPPING 3 HCOB 7.8.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 381 16.12.09 Therefore it is important that any supervisor or teacher seeking to use False Data Stripping must utilize basic workable texts. These are most often found to have been written by the original discoverer of the subject and when in doubt avoid texts which are interpreta-tions of somebody else’s work. In short, choose only textual material which is closest to the basic facts of the subject and avoid those which embroider upon them. It can happen, if you do False Data Stripping well and expertly without enforcing your own data on the person, that he can find a whole textbook false – much to his amazement. In such a case, locate a more fundamental text on the subject. (Examples of false texts: Eastman Kodak; Lord Keynes treatises on economics; John Dewey’s texts on education; Sigmund Freud’s texts on the mind; the texts derived from the “work” of Wundt (Leipzig 1879 – Father of Modern Psychology); and (joke) a textbook on “Proper Conduct for Sheep” written by A. Wolf.) USE OF FALSE DATA STRIPPING False Data Stripping should be used extensively in all hatting and training activities. Current society is riddled with false data and these must be cleared away so that we can hat and train people. Then they will be able to learn useful data which will enable them to under-stand things and produce valuable products in life. False Data Stripping can be done on or off the meter. It can be done by an auditor in session, by a Supervisor, Cramming Officer or Word Clearer or by an exec, Esto or any ad-ministrator. Students and staff can be trained to do it on each other. Not a lot of training is required to deliver this procedure but anyone administering it must have checked out on this HCOB/PL and have demoed and drilled the procedure. If it is going to be done on the meter (which is preferable) the person doing it must have an OK to operate an E-Meter. GRADIENTS It will be found that false data actually comes off in gradients. For example, a student handled initially on false data on a particular drill will appear to be complete on it. He goes on with his studies and makes progress for a while and then sometimes he will hit a bog or slow in his progress. This is usually an indication that more false data has been flushed up (restimulated or remembered as a result of actually doing stud-ies or drills). At that point more basic false data will come off when asked for. The reason for this is: when you first give a student false data handling he doesn’t know enough about the subject to know false data from the true. When he has learned a bit more about the subject he then collides with more false data hitherto buried. This can happen several times, as he is get-ting more and more expert on the subject. Thus the action of stripping off false data can and must be checked for and used in any training and hatting."},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"FALSE DATA STRIPPING 4 HCOB 7.8.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 382 16.12.09 The rundown has to be given again and again at later and later periods, as a student or staff member may come up against additional faulty data that has been not-ised. It can be re-peated as often as necessary in any specific area of training until the person is finally duplicat-ing and is able to use the correct tech and only the correct tech exactly. THEORY There is a philosophic background as to why getting off false data on a subject works and why trying to teach a correct datum over a false datum on the subject does not work. It is based on the Socratic thesis-antithesis-synthesis philosophical equation. Socrates: 470 B.C. – 399 B.C. A great Greek philosopher. A thesis is a statement or assertion. Antithesis: opposing statement or assertion. The Socratic equation is mainly used in debate where one debater asserts one thing and the other debater asserts the opposite. It was the contention of Socrates and others that when two forces came into collision a new idea was born. This was the use of the equation in logic and debate. However, had they looked further they would have seen that other effects were brought into play. It has very disastrous effects when it appears in the field of training. Where the person has acquired a false thesis (or datum), the true datum you are trying to teach him becomes an antithesis. The true datum comes smack up against the false datum he is hanging on to, as it is counter to it. In other words, these two things collide, and neither one will then make sense to him. At this point he can try to make sense out of the collision and form what is called a synthesis, or his wits simply don’t function. (Synthesis: a unified whole in which opposites, thesis and antithesis, are reconciled.) So you wind up with the person either: (a) attempting to use a false, unworkable synthesis he has formed, or (b) his thinkingness locks up on the subject. In either case you get an impossible-to-train, impossible-to-hat scene. GLIBNESS Probably we have here the basic anatomy of the “glib student” who can parrot off whole chapters on an examination paper and yet in practice uses his tools as a door stop. This student has been a mystery to the world of education for eons. What he has probably done in order to get by, is set up a circuit which is purely memory. The truth of it is his understanding or participation is barred off by considerations such as “nothing works anyway but one has to please the professor somehow.”"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"FALSE DATA STRIPPING 5 HCOB 7.8.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 383 16.12.09 The less a person can confront, the more false data he has accumulated and will accu-mulate. These syntheses are simply additives and complexities and make the person compli-cate the subject beyond belief. Or the collision of false data and true data, without the person knowing which is which, makes him look like a meathead. Therefore, in order to cure him of his additives, complexities, apathy and apparent stu-pidity on a subject, in addition to cleaning up misunderstood words, it is necessary to strip the false data off the subject. Most of the time this is prior to the true data and so is basic on the chain. Where this is the case, when that basic false data is located and stripped the whole sub-ject clears up more easily. FALSE DATA PRONE Some people are prone to accepting false data. This stems from overts committed prior to the false data being accepted. The false data then acts as a justifier for the overt. An example of this would be a student studying past Mis-Us on a subject, cheating in the exam and eventually dropping the subject entirely. Then someone comes along and tells him that the subject is useless and destructive. Well, he will immediately grab hold of this datum and believe it as he needs something to justify his earlier overts. This actually gets into service facsimiles as the person will use the false data to make the subject or other people wrong. So if you see someone who is very prone to accepting false data on a particular subject or in general, the answer is to get the prior overts pulled. Then the person will not need to justify his overts by accepting any false data that comes his way. PROCEDURE You may not easily be able to detect a false datum because the person believes it to be true. When False Data Stripping is done on a meter the false datum won’t necessarily read for the same reason. You therefore ask the person if there is anything he has run across on the subject under discussion which he couldn’t think with, which didn’t seem to add up or seems to be in con-flict with the material one is trying to each him. The false datum buries itself and the procedure itself handles this phenomenon. When the false datum is located it is handled with elementary recall based on 1950 Straightwire. Straight memory technique or Straightwire (so called because one is stringing a line between present time and some incident in the past, and stringing that line directly and without any detours) was developed originally in 1950 as a lighter process than engram run-ning. Cleverly used, Straightwire removed locks and released illnesses without the pc ever having run an engram."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"FALSE DATA STRIPPING 6 HCOB 7.8.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 384 16.12.09 Once one had determined whatever it was that was going to be run with Straightwire, one would have the pc recall where and when it happened, who was involved, what were they doing, what was the pc doing, etc. until the lock blew or the illness keyed out. Straightwire works at a lock level. When overdone it can key in underlying engrams. When properly done it can be quite miraculous. STEPS A. Determine whether or not the person needs this procedure by checking the following: 1. The person cannot be hatted on a subject. 2. No Crashing Mis-Us can be found on a subject yet it is obvious they exist. 3. The person is not duplicating the material he has studied as he is incorrectly applying it or only applying part of it, despite Word Clearing. 4. He is rejecting the material he is reading or the definition of the word he is clea-ring. 5. You suspect or the person originates earlier data he has encountered on the mate-rials that could contain false data. 6. The person talks about or quotes other sources or obviously incorrect sources. 7. He is glib. 8. The person is backing off from actually applying the data he is studying despite standard Word Clearing. 9. He is bogged. 10. He cannot think with the data and it does not seem to apply. B. Establish the difficulty the person is having – i.e. what are the materials he can’t dupli-cate or apply? These materials must be to hand and the person must be familiar with the basic true data on the subject being addressed. C. If the action is being done metered, put the person on the meter and properly adjust the sensitivity with a proper can squeeze. D. Thoroughly clear the concept of false data with the person. Have him give you examples to show he gets it. (This would be done if the person was receiving False Data Stripping for the first time.) E. The following questions are used to detect and uncover the false data. These questions are cleared before they are used for the first time on anyone. They do not have to read on a meter and may not do so as the person will not necessarily read on something that he believes to be true. 1. “Is there anything you have run across in (subject under discussion) which you couldn’t think with?”"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"FALSE DATA STRIPPING 7 HCOB 7.8.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 385 16.12.09 2. “Is there anything you have encountered in (subject under discussion) which didn’t seem to add up?” 3. “Is there something you have come across in (subject under discussion) that seems to be in conflict with the material you are trying to learn?” 4. “Is there something in (subject under discussion) which never made any sense to you?” 5. “Did you come across any data in (subject under discussion) that you had no use for?” 6. “Was there any data you came across in (subject under discussion) that never seemed to fit in?” 7. “Do you know of any datum that makes it unnecessary for you to do a good job on this subject?” 8. “Do you know of any reason why an overt product is alright?” 9. “Would you be made wrong if you really learned this subject?” 10. “Did anyone ever explain this subject to you verbally?” 11. “Do you know of any datum that conflicts with standard texts on this subject?” 12. “Do you consider you really know best about this subject?” 13. “Would it make somebody else wrong not to learn this subject?” 14. “Is this subject not worth learning?” The questions are asked in the above sequence. When an area of false data is uncov-ered by one of these questions one goes straight on to Step F – handling. F. When the person comes up with an answer to one of the above questions locate the false datum as follows: 1. Ask: “Have you been given any false data regarding this?” and help him locate the false datum. If this is being done on the meter, one can use any meter reads one does get to steer the person. This may require a bit of work as the person may believe the false data he has to be true. Keep at it until you get the false da-tum. If the person has given you the false datum in Step E then this step will not be needed: just go straight on to Step G. G. When the false datum has been located, handle as follows: 1. Ask: “Where did this datum come from?” (This could be a person. a book. TV, etc.) 2. “When was this?” 3. “Where exactly were you at the time?” 4. “Where was (the person, book, etc.) at the time?”"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"FALSE DATA STRIPPING 8 HCOB 7.8.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 386 16.12.09 5. “What were you doing at the time?” 6. If the false datum came from a person ask: “what was (the person) doing at the time?” 7. “How did (the person, book, etc.) look at the time?” 8. If the datum has not blown with the above questions ask: “Is there an earlier si-milar false datum or incident on (the subject under discussion)?” and handle per Steps 1-7. Continue as above until the false datum has blown. On the meter you will have a float-ing needle and very good indicators. Do not continue past a point where the false datum has blown. If you suspect the datum may have blown but the person has not originated then ask: “How does that datum seem to you now?” and either continue if it hasn’t blown or end off on that datum if it has blown. H. When you have handled a particular false datum to a blow, going earlier similar as ne-cessary, you would then go back and repeat the question from E (the detection step) that uncovered the false datum. If there are any more answers to the question, they are handled exactly as in Step F (location) and Step G (handling). That particular question is left when the person has no more answers. Then, if the person is not totally handled on the subject under discussion, one would use the other questions from Step E and handle them in the same way. All the questions can be asked and handled as above but one would not continue past a point where the whole subject has been cleared up and the person can now duplicate and apply the data he has been having trouble with. I. CONDITIONAL: If False Data Stripping is being done in conjunction with Crashing Mis-U finding one would now proceed with the Crashing Mis-U finding. J. Send the person to the Examiner. K. Have the person study or restudy the true data on the subject you have been handling. END PHENOMENA When the above procedure is done correctly and fully on an area the person is actually having difficulty with he will end up able to duplicate, understand and apply and think with the data that he could not previously grasp. The false data that was standing in the road of duplication will have been cleared away and the person’s thinking will have been freed up. When this occurs, no matter where in the procedure, one ends off the False Data Stripping on that subject and sends the person to the Examiner. He will have cognitions and VGIs and on the meter you will have an F/N. This is not the end of all False Data Stripping for that person. It is the end of that False Data Stripping on the person at that particular time. As the person continues to work with and study the subject in question, he will learn more about it and may again collide with false data at which time one repeats the above process."},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"FALSE DATA STRIPPING 9 HCOB 7.8.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 387 16.12.09 NOTE False data buries itself as the person may firmly believe that it is true. Sometimes the person will have such faith in a particular person, book, etc. that he cannot conceive that any data from that particular source might be false. One artist being false data stripped had re-ceived some false data from a very famous painter. Even though the data didn’t really add up and actually caused the artist tremendous problems, he tended to believe it because of where it came from. It took persistence on the part of the person administering the False Data Strip-ping to eventually blow this false datum with a resulting freeing up of the artist’s ability to think and produce in the area. MISUNDERSTOODS Misunderstoods often come up during False Data Stripping and should be cleared when they do. One would then continue with the False Data Stripping. One person being false data stripped knew he had some false data from a particular source but the false data was a complete blank – he couldn’t remember it at all. It was discovered that he had a Mis-U just before he received the false data and as soon as this was cleared up he recalled the false data and it blew. This is just one example of how Word Clearing can tie in with False Data Stripping. REPEATED USE False Data Stripping can be done over and over as it will come off in layers as men-tioned before. If False Data Stripping has been done on a specific thing and at some later point the person is having difficulty with a drill or the materials, the stripping of false data should be done on him again. In such a case it will be seen that the person recognizes or remembers more false or contrary data he has accumulated on the subject that was not in view earlier. As he duplicates a drill or his materials more and more exactly, former “interpreta-tions” he had not-ised, incorrect past flunks that acted as invalidation or evaluation, etc., may crop up to be stripped off. CAUTIONS CODE. False Data Stripping is done under the discipline of the Auditor’s Code. Evaluation and invalidation can be particularly harmful and must be avoided. All points of the code ap-ply."},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"FALSE DATA STRIPPING 10 HCOB 7.8.79 CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 388 16.12.09 RUDIMENTS. One would not begin False Data Stripping on someone who already has out-ruds. If the person is upset or worried about something or is critical or nattery, then you should fly his ruds or get them flown before you start False Data Stripping. OVERRUN. One must be particularly careful not to overrun the person past a blow of the false datum. The stress in recall is that it is a light action which does not get the person into engrams or heavy charge. Keep it light. If you overrun someone past the point of a blow, he may drop into engrams or heavy charge. Just take the recall step to a blow and don’t push him beyond it. DATE/LOCATE. Date/Locate is another way of getting something to blow. If a false datum does not blow on the recall steps despite going earlier similar, then it could be handled with Date/Locate in session as ordered by the C/S. This would normally be done as part of a False Data Stripping Repair List. Date/Locating false data would never be done except in session as ordered by the C/S or as directed by the False Data Stripping Repair List. The auditor must be totally starrated on Date and Locating and practiced in it before he attempts it. FALSE DATA STRIPPING REPAIR LIST. The False Data Stripping Repair List is used in session by an auditor when False Data Stripping bogs inextricably or the person is not F/N GIs at exams or gets in trouble after False Data Stripping has been done. A bogged False Data Stripping session must be handled within 24 hours. NEW STUDENTS. Students who are new to Scientology should not use this procedure on each other as they may be insufficiently experienced to deliver it competently. In this case the Supervisor or someone qualified would administer False Data Stripping to those students who need it. SUMMARY The problem of the person who is unable to learn or who is unable to apply what he learns has never been fully resolved before. Misunderstoods were and are a major factor and Word Clearing must be used liberally. Now, however, I have made a major breakthrough which finally explains and handles the problem of inability to learn and apply. Man’s texts and education systems are strewn with false data. These false data effec-tively block someone’s understanding of the true data. The handling given in this HCOB/PL makes it possible to remove that block and enable people to learn data so they can apply it. With the ability to learn comes stability and the production of valuable products. With stability and the production of valuable products comes the achievement of one’s purposes and goals, high morale and happiness. So let’s get to work on stripping away the false data which plagues Man, clogs up his ability to think and learn and reduces his competence and effectiveness. Let’s increase the ability of individuals and the human race. L.

Other tech exists to handle these. However they also, sometimes in a shadowy way, make their appearance do-ing M9. People doing M9 are doing it to get something understood or get some order done or get some product actually made and out. In most cases M9 will produce a marked gain. How-ever, when it doesn’t work, one of the above is also present. Handling of these is covered in detail in other HCOBs. However, the item the M9er is most likely to collide with in situations where M9 is really not getting much done is the mysterious Crashing Mis-U. A Crashing Mis-U, while it is always sitting right there in PT, big as life, can some-times appear to be elusive. It eludes the most conscientious Word Clearer and the person him-self, despite honest efforts to find it. Let’s say you’ve made an exhaustive search for the CRMU, you’ve hunted and punched in the area of his products, you’ve word cleared him on the texts covering his prod-ucts and you’ve found and cleared some misunderstood words, none of which are IT. You’ve done the full CRMU and Product Debug procedure by the book and you still haven’t gotten the Crashing Mis-U – as evidenced by no products. At this point you could suspect one of the following:"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":" CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 392 16.12.09 1. The word that has caused him to crash may be right there in plain view, it does appear in the texts and orders covering the person’s post and products, but it has been missed. Why? Because the Crashing Mis-U (which is not your ordinary common garden vari-ety of misunderstood word) will not always show up for what it is in M9ing. The word may appear in the materials but the person reads it with no stumble or reaction what-soever, as he is so certain he knows it and his misunderstanding of it is so obscured by false data and false definitions. It doesn’t even read on the meter on Method 2 or 4 be-cause it’s way below his awareness. So you wouldn’t just assume there was nothing there because the word didn’t turn up on Method 9 or Methods 2 or 4. You’d need to move in with Method 5 or 6 and probably also False Data Stripping in a case like this to really pry it into view. Or: 2. The Crashing Mis-U may not be on the subject of the product itself but in an area re-lated to the subject. If this is suspected you look for the CRMU in the related areas and it’s very likely you’ll come up with the prize! The reason it wasn’t found in the first place is because the word didn’t appear in the materials he was word cleared on and it didn’t come up in a search in the area of his products. But it was sitting there, all the time, in an adjacent, a related area! In two cases recently where staff members were being crammed on rejects of their products this phenomena turned up and was used and it all straightened out nicely! The watchword is: you utilize all methods of Word Clearing and whatever else it takes to find the Crashing Mis-U. ALERT RE METHOD 9 The data above applies to routine Method 9 Word Clearing as well as to Crashing Mis-U finding. Thus, if you’ve M9ed the person on his post materials and he’s not getting it or making it, realize that he may be sliding over an MU or even a Crashing Mis-U where the word actually appears in the materials and is obscured for the above reasons. Or that the mis-understood may be in an area related to the subject and the word itself doesn’t appear in the text you’re handling. Method 9 is a superlative Word Clearing tool. Word Clearers must keep it effective, and not permit that effectiveness to be dimmed by a failure to know and use the data in this bulletin. So you check the related areas where it’s indicated, or you marry up routine Method 9 with Crashing Mis-U finding and all of its steps where the person isn’t making it otherwise. And you’ll find the elusive misunderstood or Crashing Mis-U is not so elusive after all. It will come plainly into view – ripe for the plucking! L.

It is revelatory to him when he finds it so it isn’t necessarily true that he will know. So he himself additionally has a number of wrong Whys and wrong reasons. There is usually one principal misunderstood that is preventing the cycle of action from completing. This is called the “Crashing Mis-U.” APPLICATION While finding Crashing Mis-Us is not a substitute for full Word Clearing and while it is also true that the person can be PTS and be engaged in creating problems, it is nevertheless uniformly true that a Crashing Misunderstood lies somewhere in the subject matter of the cy-cle of action which is not being completed. The tech given in this HCOB can be used by anyone who has checked out on it and drilled it. The steps given here cover metered and nonmetered Crashing Mis-U finding. Using a Word Clearing meter will make the action faster and more accurate but it is not vital. The whole action does not take long to do and will save hours of purple-faced desk pounding and frustrated attempts to get people to produce. It is to be USED by execs, Supervisors, Cramming Officers, Estos, missionaires, etc., etc. – anyone who is responsible for seeing that products are gotten out. Crashing Mis-U tech is used in debugging products. It comes as step I of HCO PL DEBUG TECH. If any of the earlier steps are out then you can find all the Crashing Mis-Us you like and still not get one single product. THEORY A cycle of action is a parallel to a cycle of understanding or a cycle of communication. The cycle of action is the physical universe expression of a cycle of communication. The cy-cle of communication occurs in the physical universe! A misunderstood interrupts not only the cycle of communication or understanding, but also interrupts the motion or action. That is the discovery. A person is trying to get the product of a finished house. He doesn’t understand the word “plumbing.” He may tell you that it is because of the price of materials, that nobody can dig in that kind of ground, that certain types of pipes aren’t available, that he is having trouble with his wife – and his supervisors and bosses will tell you that he is just plain lazy, that he has been bribed not to, that he is a secret drinker maybe, and even less printable Whys. But when you get right down to it and use the Tech you find that he has a Crashing Mis-U on the word “plumbing.” He thinks it is defined as “drilling holes.” Mentally this interrupts his ability to think any thoughts through on the subject. His cycle of understanding is being inter-rupted by the Crashing Mis-U. This then has a parallel cycle, the cycle of action of trying to get the finished house. Thus for want of understanding of a word we get the actual physical inability to finish a cycle of action on a connected subject. I can assure you that ethics condi-tions, threat of suit, physical violence, none of these things are going to get anybody a fin-"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 3 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 397 16.12.09 ished house. Only when his Crashing Mis-U “plumbing” is found and properly handled are you going to get a finished house. This tells you incidentally that the time track of shattered civilizations must have been strewn with these things. It doesn’t only apply to a house, it applies to almost anything man has ever set out to produce. It would even apply to some general who suddenly won’t finish a battle or a war. Amazingly you will discover that the Crashing Mis-U has probably been Man’s single greatest barrier to actually creating and maintaining a civilization. You have to work with the tech yourself to actually appreciate its depth and power. CRASHING MIS-U FINDING Where you have a person not getting products, not completing cycles of action despite attempts to debug per A-H of HCO PL DEBUG TECH, you have to get in there and find the Crashing Misunderstood. It will be directly on the subject. There are various approaches to doing this, starting very simply and getting more complex. You would start off using the sim-plest approach and then, if that didn’t handle, you would go into a more thorough handling, and so forth. PROCEDURE 1. It is apparent or it is reported that someone is failing to complete cycles and is not get-ting out his products. 2. Before even talking to him you inspect his area as regards products per HCO PL DE-BUG TECH: A. You look for what products have been gotten out in the past. B. You look for products that are there completed. C. You look for products that can be attained in the immediate future. D. You look for value of products as compared to overall cost of production. E. You look for overt products or cycles where products continuously have to be redone, resulting in no or few products. This requires a bit of homework. 3. Conditional: If your inspection finds he is getting out actual products and that he is not producing overt products, correct the reports and let him get on with it. Do not go on with the steps in this procedure. 4. Now if the earlier debug steps per HCO PL DEBUG TECH have been done and it is ob-vious from your inspection that this person is still not getting out the products he is expected to get out or should be getting out you know that he has a Crashing MisU. You just start hunting and punching around for the Crashing Mis-U on the subject of the products he should be but is not getting out. “What don’t you understand about"},{"pageNumber":412,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 4 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 398 16.12.09 that subject?” “What Mis-U word is there on this subject?” You keep at it this way un-til you get the Crashing Mis-U. On the meter you would use reads to steer him to the area and the Mis-U. Crashing Mis-U finding differs from regular Word Clearing in that it is an investiga-tory procedure which utilizes all methods of Word Clearing and whatever else it takes to find the Crashing Mis-U. You can use Method 2, Method 3, Method 4, Method 5, Method 6 or Method 9 to help you find the misunderstood. The person you are han-dling may be sure that the Mis-U is in a certain issue but doesn’t know what the word is. It may require Method 2 or Method 9 to actually dig it out. Often Method 5 is used whereby the Word Clearer asks for the definition of individual words, checking to make sure that he knows the definition as well. The point is that you are trying to narrow down the area further and further until you finally get the Crashing Mis-U and any method of Word Clearing or investigation that helps you do this is legitimate. 5. You clear this word fully to VGIs (on the meter it would F/N). Don’t assume the dic-tionary will necessarily give the right definition – a missing or false definition might be the root of his trouble. If no dictionary, textbook or encyclopedia can be found that gives a satisfactory definition for the word you are still not stopped. You can go over all of the related material to the word and work out with him what definition has been omitted or what is the proper definition for it. This is a last resort but it is necessary that anyone doing Crashing Mis-U knows this as Man has not necessarily properly de-fined everything in his technical sphere or culture. WARNING: The inability to find the definitions is a rare case. Only work out the definition when you have exhausted all possible texts and dictionaries and have cleared all of the words you have encoun-tered in them. Whether you looked it up and found it or couldn’t find it and had to evolve it make sure the definition is useful to him and that it blows his difficulty with it. 6. Assure yourself that this was his Crashing Mis-U and that it is real to him. When he finds it he will quite often be chagrined and then go into VGIs and cognite and may change considerably right in front of your eyes. 7. Send him to the Examiner. 8. Run some Reach and Withdraw in the area where he had difficulty to a good win and tell him to get on with it. 9. Check back later to see that he is now completing cycles of action and getting his products out. – If he is then you have got it. That is the EP. 10. If he still isn’t getting out the product then you haven’t yet found the Crashing Mis-U and you have some more work to do. Go over his area with him and look for things that he has difficulty with. Often it will leap right up at you. Get him to tell you what the difficulty is. 11. Now question him to find the Mis-U on that subject that is behind those difficulties. Often his statement of the difficulty will contain the Mis-U itself. On a meter you"},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 5 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 399 16.12.09 would get a read as he says it. Off the meter you would have to take the words that he said and ask him what they meant. For example he might say “The plumbing always seems to be the hardest part.” On a meter “plumbing” would read and you would take it up right away. If you weren’t using a meter you could say “Well what does the word ‘plumbing’ mean?” and he’ll say “Well, it means, uh... ‘drilling holes’“ and there you have it. Now clear the word as in step 4 above, run your Reach and Withdraw and send him back to work. END PHENOMENON The end phenomenon (EP) of this action is the person now producing the products he wasn’t able to produce before and completing the cycles of action related to his product. The end phenomenon is not: the fellow now all VGIs and saying he can get the prod-ucts, feeling great, etc. That is all very well but is he now getting out the products? And you keep handling him with Crashing Mis-Us and related handling until he is producing the prod-ucts and then you know you have completed the Crashing Mis-U handling. ADDITIONAL FACTORS There are various factors which must be known by anyone doing Crashing Mis-U finding and used if the above simple steps do not get the desired result of the person now tear-ing along getting his products. O/Ws Since overts and withholds stem from Mis-Us in the first place, you are liable to run into O/Ws when doing Crashing Mis-U finding. If the person has O/Ws in the area this will be manifested in the form of resistance to finding the misunderstood word either overtly or covertly. An example of this would be the person misdefining a word and then when you have him look it up in the dictionary he says that he knew it all along. Or it could be straight non-cooperation. If you are using the Word Clearing meter, the handling for the situation above would be to pull the O/Ws. To do this simply ask “Do you have any overts in the area of ________?” and pull them, each one earlier similar to F/N with all specifics until the question F/Ned on asking. Do the same with withholds and missed withholds. Since you run the risk of missing withholds if you try pulling withholds without a meter, in doing the nonmetered Crashing Mis-U finding the way you would handle the above situation is to ask the person if he has some withhold concerning the area you are trying to handle, and getting him to tell you about it. If you do this then you must get him meter checked to ensure nothing has been missed."},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 6 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 400 16.12.09 There is another manifestation which can be encountered. A Crashing Mis-U simply cannot be found at all yet it obviously must be there. The person seems to cooperate some-what but no Crashing Mis-U turns up. This is again an O/W phenomenon. The person is hold-ing on to his withhold so hard it is burying the Crashing Mis-U. Again you could run the risk of missing a withhold if you simply ask him for his with-hold on the subject but we cannot rule out the fact that doing so sometimes works. The Crash-ing Mis-U simply doesn’t seem to exist yet by all evidence of no products or overt products it must exist so simply asking him if he has a withhold on the subject gives us the gain of find-ing it straight off immediately and, if we meter check him afterwards to find out if he has any more withholds, it is very likely to pay off. Once he has gotten off the withholds the Crashing Mis-U can pop right up. When you miss a withhold, remember, a fantastic amount of upset can be caused for the Word Clearer or the person himself. So don’t indulge in missing with-holds. Once the O/Ws have been pulled or gotten off by whichever of the above methods, you will now be able to find the Crashing Mis-U and clear it up. Sometimes in clearing the Mis-U you will hit a chain of overts connected with the sub-ject, and these will have to be cleared up or you may not get your product. An example of this was a cleaner who could not clean. The Crashing Mis-U found was the word “clean” and this went straight into whole track overts which had to be fully handled. When the overts and the Mis-Us were cleared up the person went straight out and started getting real products. DEFENSE MECHANISM You may find the person has a defense mechanism which would make it impossible to find the person’s Crashing Mis-U as he believes it is OK to have Mis-Us in that area. The defense mechanism consists of false data which acts as a justifier for the Mis-U. An example of this would be “I don’t have to know that as I’m not a professional” or “Well I’m new to the post” and so on. The handling would be simply to ask the person if there was some reason why it would be OK to have Mis-Us in that subject and then strip off the false data and justi-fications. Then you can recheck for the Crashing Mis-U and you will find it is now available. (See HCOB FALSE DATA STRIPPING) THE WORD CLEARER’S MIS-US When he has found a Crashing Mis-U on the subject the Word Clearer’s first action is to himself look up the definition and the derivation of the word so he himself understands it. He then gets it fully cleared up with the person. This is all done right there in the Crashing Mis-U session. If he doesn’t do that he won’t be able to perceive how the person has misun-derstood it or misapplied it previously. Example: A person in charge of the lights in a theater could never get anything lit. A Crashing Mis-U was looked for and the word “scene” was found. However the person glibly"},{"pageNumber":415,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 7 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 401 16.12.09 read the dictionary definition and said he had it already. The Word Clearer made him look up the derivation wherein it was found that the glib person didn’t understand it at all, for the per-son, when asked for an example, described an actor and how he would put the light on the actor. The Word Clearer having looked it up first, before handing the dictionary over, knew that a scene was a stage. It was found that the person’s Crashing Mis-U had so introverted him that he had never perceived that a stage had backdrops, scenery and a floor. The Word Clearer practically had to pry him out of his head to get him to see that a stage had walls and backdrops and that these had to be lighted. If the Word Clearer had not known the correct definition of “scene” he would never have detected that the person thought it meant “actor” even though the dictionary said it had to do with scenery. Crashing Mis-U tech would have failed as the person was very convincing as to how he knew it all already yet in the example was giving a totally incorrect demonstration. Showers of light broke through when the person realized for the first time that he had to light the whole stage and had been in total mystery why people kept yelling at him. This had been going on for a long, long time in the person’s job and was making him a total failure at it. PRACTICAL USAGE Always ask for instances of practical usage from the person you have found a Crash-ing Mis-U on. From these you can detect if he’s got it and if he hasn’t got it he may have to work and work to clear it further. The end phenomenon of Crashing Mis-U tech is not finding the Crashing Mis-U but getting the person totally straight on it and actually getting out the product. DEBUG TECH Crashing Mis-U finding is an integral part of debug tech as covered fully in HCO PL Debug Tech. It comes as step I of the whole procedure. When products are not getting out, cycles are not being completed, there will invariably be Crashing Mis-Us but there may be other factors involved which also have to be resolved. The handling is just to go through the steps of the HCO PL, including Crashing Mis-U finding (step 1) and Product Clearing (step J). You may find more Crashing Mis-Us come up during or after the Product Clearing. The whole point is that you use the whole debug tech procedure without trying to short cut it. Otherwise you get the ridiculous situation of clearing up the fellow’s Crashing Mis-U on “plumbing” and then find he can’t get out the product of a finished house because there are no pipes and won’t be any for 3 months because the owner can’t afford them. This all has to be resolved."},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 8 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 402 16.12.09 IMPORTANT NOTE Since the sole purpose of this debug tech is to get the person or area producing what it should be producing you would not continue past a point where this had been achieved. So for example, if after step C of HCO PL DEBUG TECH had been done (any Mis-Us on issues related to the area of production had been cleared up) the person was turning out great prod-ucts in the expected quantity and time period, you would not then start looking for Crashing Mis-Us. This would act as harassment, not help. Similarly, don’t use any other step of A-M of the above PL where it does not apply. One should let people have their successes. Once you have achieved what is desired with this tech, don’t carry on. The rule is: Don’t continue debugging past the point where the person or area has been successfully debugged and products are now rolling. And you would know it was debugged because products of the expected quality would be coming out of the area in the expected quantity. GRADIENT APPROACH The whole idea is to try the simplest approach first and then if that doesn’t work go deeper. The end phenomena for all this is a person cheerfully and willingly getting his prod-ucts and these appearing visible in the physical universe. EXAMPLES This is how it might go: you might find yourself in the position of being responsible for seeing that the house, in the example given earlier on this bulletin, got finished. You no-tice that the deadline has been exceeded by weeks and still there is no house. The first thing to do would be the inspection as in step 2 of the procedure above. You would discover that the house has no plumbing; that is what is holding up its completion. Points A to H in HCO PL DEBUG TECH have been gone over but things still aren’t moving. So you approach the contractor personally and go over this with him. You start hunting and punching around for the Mis-U. Ask him “Is it possible that there is some word you don’t fully understand in the area of building this house?” And he’ll say: “Well, no – it’s just that I don’t have enough men to do the plumbing.” (Now you already know from step E of your prior inspection that he does have adequate personnel.) So you say “Well, what about plumb-ing? Is there some word connected with plumbing that you don’t get?” He’ll say “No, but I’ve always had trouble with it.” Now you ask him “What does ‘plumbing’ mean?” And when he says, “Everybody knows that plumbing means drilling holes,” you have his Crashing Mis-U. As you clear this up his initial embarrassment will turn into floods of relief and off he will go and get the house finished up in no time."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 9 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 403 16.12.09 Now if you were able to use a Word Clearing meter, so much the better. You would put him on the meter and ask him something like: “Now on the subject of building houses is it possible you could have a misunderstood?” The meter will read on this and you use the read to steer him to the area and find the misunderstood word. This is then cleared to a floating needle (F/N) and very good indicators (VGIs). It might not be as straightforward as above. The case could arise where there was plenty of evidence that the person has a Crashing Mis-U yet, despite arduous search, nothing comes up. You would then ask the person: “Is there something about all this you haven’t told me?” If your TRs are good and you don’t have a challenging or accusative attitude he will come up with it: “I can’t finish the house because the machine that cuts and bends pipes is broken.” With a bit of further questioning you find that he broke the machine and has been withholding this for weeks and didn’t even dare mention that it needed repair for fear of being punished. A simple meter check would ensure that nothing was missed. Then up would pop the misunderstood on “plumbing” which he thought meant drilling holes. No wonder he broke the machine: he was trying to drill holes with it! So now with his withhold off and his MisU cleared up he will feel immensely relieved and will most likely be able to go right off and finish up the house. At the most you might need to product clear him and run some Reach and Withdraw in the area per the issues on Product Clearing in this series. CASE HISTORIES Here are some actual case histories to show how Crashing Mis-U finding goes and the sort of things one might expect to come across and have to handle in order to debug a cycle or product with this tech. CASE A: This was a senior executive who was on the verge of being removed from post. The general manager was impatient with the lack of products from that area. A. The Word Clearer inspected the executive’s department and found that the main area of difficulty seemed to be handling personnel. B. The Word Clearer put the executive on the meter and asked him if there were any products he should be getting out but wasn’t. No Crashing Mis-U came up on this directly. C. By two-way communication the Word Clearer confirmed that the main area of difficulty was handling personnel. D. He took the words that were directly related to the area mentioned – ”person-nel,” “staff,” etc. – and asked the executive what each one meant. He checked the dictionary to ensure the person had a full understanding of the words. The exec seemed fine on these. E. There was one word the executive seemed to have some hesitation on so the definition of that word was word cleared Method 9. A few words were cleared up but none of them turned out to be the Crashing Misunderstood."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 10 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 404 16.12.09 F. The area of difficulty was further narrowed down by two way comm to “the obtaining and posting of personnel.” G. Words relating to this area were checked. Some of the definitions were M9ed to make sure the exec really did have them straight – still no Crashing Mis-U was found. H. The executive originated an area of difficulty to do with handling authority that he felt was interfering with his ability to obtain and post personnel. No MisUs were found in this area however. I. The Word Clearer asked for overts and withholds in the area (“Is there some-thing you’re not telling about this area?”, “Is there something you’ve done you don’t want known?” etc.) but none were found. J. He then checked for false data (something that would justify having misunder-stoods on that subject) and found that the exec was loaded with false data on the subject of authority. This was handled by two way comm – it did not take much to clean up as the exec was realizing by this time where his trouble was coming from and was only too willing to get it sorted out. K. The word “authority” was found as the Crashing Misunderstood. This became obvious as soon as the false data came off. This word was fully cleared to a floating needle and very good indicators and the executive volunteered that he felt ready to go back on post and produce. The Word Clearer ended off and returned the executive to work. He started producing actual products and doing well. CASE B.: This was a technician in a highly specialized and complex field who was having difficulty with his job and was unable to get approval on some tests that were urgently needed. A. An inspection of his area revealed the situation to be exactly as described. B. The Word Clearer put him on the meter, oriented him to the situation and asked him: “Is there any single misunderstood word in the area of these tests?” C. A long search ensued in which several words were cleared, none of which turned out to be the Crashing Mis-U. D. The Word Clearer then checked for a withhold and found out that the techni-cian had never understood an important dispatch relating to the cycle and had been withholding the fact. This withhold was cleared up to a floating needle. E. This was followed by further search for the misunderstood which uncovered an area of upset and losses to do with technical writing. F. The Word Clearer checked for the misunderstood that must have preceded the losses and the Crashing Mis-U was found – a very basic technical word in the subject."},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 11 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 405 16.12.09 G. He attempted to clear the word with a dictionary but found no adequate defini-tion. H. Encyclopedias and textbooks were consulted but none of them had a useful definition. I. Eventually, by combining textbooks and working out what it should be, a workable definition was arrived at and the subject became clear to the techni-cian who was greatly relieved. The technician returned to work and started producing. The very next set of tests sub-mitted were approved. CASE C: This case was an executive who was having trouble getting people in his area to produce. The actions below were done unmetered. A. The product inspection showed the executive to be unable to get his juniors to produce. B. He arrived for the Crashing Mis-U finding quite upset and this had to be han-dled before anything else. C. The Word Clearer went over his upset with him and sorted it out to a point where he was willing to go ahead with the action. D. Various words were checked (“What does ‘junior’ mean?” “What is the defini-tion of ‘executive’?”) and so forth. No Crashing Mis-U was found. E. The area of difficulty was narrowed down further to “getting compliance.” F. On checking, the Word Clearer found that the exec had a Crashing Mis-U on the word “compliance” which was cleared to very good indicators. The executive went back to work and found he could now handle his juniors. CASE D: This person was in charge of briefing missions. He had recently had trouble with this and some missions had fired without full briefing resulting in failures. A. The Word Clearer asked him, on the meter, if there was anything concerning his post he was having difficulty with. B. The difficulty was narrowed down by two-way comm until it was established that he felt he couldn’t brief them fully due to lack of time. C. The Word Clearer checked for a Crashing Mis-U concerning this difficulty. None was found. D. He then asked if there was something the person was withholding about the subject. Several chains of overts were taken up, each one to a floating needle, until the question itself produced a floating needle on asking. E. The Word Clearer again asked for a Crashing Mis-U in the area and one of the words in the person’s own post title was found and cleared. This was the Crashing Mis-U."},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 12 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 406 16.12.09 The person was then able to get out his products. CASE E: This was an auditor who was being product cleared on her post. A. The Product Clearer discovered that there was a certain part of her post that this auditor could not handle. It was a certain aspect of handling the preclear B. He asked her if there was one single Mis-U in the area, and helped her trace it, using the meter reads. C. The Crashing Mis-U was found and cleared in the dictionary to very good in-dicators. D. The auditor was then able to complete the Product Clearing and get back to work, her main difficulty no longer impeding her from getting products. The above case histories show the variety of situations that can come up and the han-dlings that would be done. They are by no means all the situations that can arise in doing Crashing Mis-U finding. CAUTIONS Make sure you guide him on the subject of products all the time. You could get right off the track and find yourself clearing up a whole subject that had nothing to do with getting out his product. An example would be trying to clear up the whole of chemistry on a photog-rapher. There is chemistry involved in photography: the film is developed and so forth with chemicals. But the person is a photographer, not a photo laboratory technician, so he does not need to know all of chemistry to get his product. Another point is that sometimes a person will have a Crashing Mis-U cleared up on himself and immediately suppose that this is the Crashing Mis-U everyone else has. This is not necessarily the case. When one has a Crashing Mis-U on “crackers” it is not necessarily true that everyone else has a Crashing Mis-U on “crackers.” Their Crashing Mis-Us will be different. It is their Mis-Us one is after. REPAIR If the action bogs down and can’t be sorted out, or the person becomes upset during or after Crashing Mis-U finding, then the difficulty should be sorted out right away with a Crashing Mis-U Repair List. This list is done on a meter by someone qualified to do so. A botched or bogged Crashing Mis-U finding must be repaired within 24 hours. EFFECTS OF CRASHING MIS-Us You can tell someone has a Crashing Mis-U because when you start to question them about the cycle of action or demand the products they will go robotic on you. They sometimes"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"CRASHING MIS-US: THE KEY TO COM- 13 HCOB 17.06.79 PLETED CYCLES OF ACTION AND PRODUCTS CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 407 16.12.09 just stand there gaping at you and won’t even answer your question. They won’t even be able to talk to you. There’s another manifestation you will come up against and that is the person becoming annoyed with you. This indicates either that he was getting out products in the first place, or that he had a withhold in addition to a Crashing Mis-U. The solution is not to immediately shoot them for not getting out the product. Find their Crashing Mis-U. If they get annoyed then find out which of the above it was and handle. And then the justice factor would consist of disciplining them for going past misunderstoods without clearing them. You have to teach someone to get in his own ethics in this respect so that others do not have to take justice actions on him. SUMMARY Well, here you have the tech that will enable you to debug failures to produce the products required of him. The person using this tech has to learn it well and become practiced in its application. Then he will get the full benefit of it and total reality on its power. Let’s get busy and, along with the remainder of debug tech, find the crashing Mis-U when products aren’t coming off the line. This is indeed miracle tech so let’s go get some miracles! L.

It is vital, in attempting to find someone’s Crashing MUs, that one does not abandon the search simply because, on enquiry, the person is unable to come up with anything. It may take skill and hard work to uncover the Crashing MU but it must be found, no matter how arduous the search. The completion of the cycle of action and the accomplishment of the product depend on locating and clearing up the Crashing MU that is getting in the way. Crashing MUs can be buried. They can be buried by A) Other MU words B) Overts or withholds C) False data D) Justifications"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":" CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 410 16.12.09 E) Service facsimiles.

After handling one of the above blocks, he would recheck for the Crashing MU and if still not available to be found and cleared, he would proceed to check the next block and so on until the Crashing MU was found and cleared.

OTHER MISUNDERSTOODS Ref: Word Clearing Series The person may have MUs and confusions which are obscuring the Crashing MU. In attempting to find the Crashing MU one might have to find and clear these other MUs before the person can locate the Crashing MU which has been buried by these other MUs and which is hanging up the cycle of action or the product. A Crashing MU is a MU that crashes a subject and crashes a person. It is straight on the subject-line that is giving trouble and is totally blocking the person’s comprehension of the subject. This is not to be confused with other MUs. These would include grammatical MUs, MUs on disrelated subjects or MUs on simple words. A Crashing MU is quite different."},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":" CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 411 16.12.09 It is directly on the subject and it totally blocks the person’s understanding of the subject and stops any cycles of action or products on that line. Handling: Other MUs obscuring the Crashing MU are located and cleared using any of Word Clearing Methods 2-9 or a combination of these. One might have to do Method 2 and Method 4 on certain materials, for example, before the Crashing MU can then be located. Method 9 is a very thorough and fruitful method of word clearing materials. By whatever method, the MUs are found and cleared. Any MUs that come up during Crashing MU Finding are imme-diately cleared. This does not mean, however, that one has found the Crashing MU. One has simply unburdened it. B. OVERTS AND WITHHOLDS Ref: Academy Class II Materials As covered in HCOB 8 Sep 64 OVERTS, WHAT LIES BEHIND THEM?, overts and with-holds can enter in after the person encounters a misunderstood word or symbol on the subject or in the area. Having committed the overt, the person may now be withholding so hard that it can become impossible to get his attention onto the MU word that comes earlier in time and is more basic than the withhold. An example of this would be someone who had broken a machine as a result of trying to operate it over his MU on how it worked. His attention would become so caught up with withholding this overt that he might not be able to confront the area at all, let alone find the underlying Crashing MU. The person’s withholds on the subject of the area not only prevent him from talking about it sensibly to the person trying to find his Crashing MUs, but also tend to withhold him from the subject itself. He won’t be able to think well on that subject because he is withhold-ing data concerning it. The person might also be frightened of punishment or discipline if he did reveal his overt. Therefore, communication with the Crashing MU finder or the subject, also may block up his memory or his ability to think on the subject and so a Crashing MU can be buried totally out of sight. Handling: The handling of O/Ws would depend on whether or not one was using a meter for the Crashing MU finding. In metered Crashing MU finding one would ask: “Concerning (subject under discussion) is there anything you are withholding?” and if it was reading one would handle per HCOB 11 Aug 78, I, RUDIMENTS, DEFINITIONS AND PAT-TER. Suppress and False could be used as needed. One could also check and handle: “Concerning (subject under discussion) have you committed any overt?” “Concerning (subject under discussion) has a withhold been missed?”"},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":" CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 412 16.12.09 In non-metered Crashing MU finding one could ask the person if he had any overt or withhold concerning the subject under discussion. Very often, if one is in good communica-tion with the person and there is no accusativeness or duress, he will say, “Well, actually, I didn’t want to tell anyone but I lost all the ruddy rods,” or whatever the withhold was. In non-metered asking for overts or withholds one must get the person meter checked immediately afterwards to ensure nothing gets missed. It goes without saying that a person can get very misemotional or blow or get very angry with the Crashing MU finder if you miss a withhold on him. So don’t be surprised if you get a sudden blow-up when you use un-metered overt or withhold questions. C. FALSE DATA Ref: HCOB/PL 7 Aug 79 FALSE DATA STRIPPING A person who has been given and has accepted false data or false definitions on a sub-ject may become convinced that he “knows” the words when in fact the data and definitions may be entirely false. This may even prevent the misunderstoods from reading on the meter. It can certainly bury a Crashing MU because the person’s certainty that he “knows” the data will prevent him from looking for the Crashing MU which is blocking him from getting prod-ucts. Handling: One handles false data by stripping it off exactly per HCOB/PL 7 Aug 79 FALSE DATA STRIPPING. This is a procedure which locates the false data and then blows it by recall. It is an extremely effective way of getting off the false data which is blocking the person’s understanding of a subject by giving him a false understanding. D. JUSTIFICATIONS REF: HCOB 21 JAN 60 JUSTIFICATION HCOB 7 JUL 64 JUSTIFICATIONS A person can have a defense mechanism whereby he justifies having a Crashing MU by giving reasons why it is OK not to understand the subject or area. He explains why he doesn’t have to understand and makes others wrong for trying to set him straight on it. Exam-ples of this would be: “I’m new and haven’t been at it too long.” “I have to spend so much time on my post, I don’t have time to learn about it.” “Only a professional could really understand this.” “No one really knows anything about that subject anyway.” “They keep changing the terminology so how could I learn it.” Handling: The handling of justifications is covered in HCOB 7 Aug 79 FALSE DATA STRIP-PING which has several questions in the section on locating the false data which are designed"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":" CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 413 16.12.09 to pull off the person’s justifications for failure to understand a subject or inability to turn out professional products in an area. Basically the questions ask for anything that makes it OK not to know a particular subject or not to get results with that subject. When the justifications are located they are blown with recall, just as with false data in general. If there are no justifications present or if the trouble does not resolve with pulling off justifications, then it will be handled with the next section – service facsimilies – since justifi-cations as used here are really a specialized kind of self-serving service facsimile. Justifica-tions and service facsimiles are actually cousins. E. SERVICE FACSIMILIES Ref: Academy Class IV Materials HCOB 5 SEP 78 ANATOMY OF A SERVICE FACSIMILE HCOB 6 SEP 78 II SERVICE FACSIMILES AND ROCK SLAMS HCOB 6 SEP 78 III ROUTINE THREE SC-A FULL SERVICE FACSIMILE HANDLING UPDATED WITH NEW ERA DIANETICS A service facsimile is an idea someone uses to make himself right and others wrong. These ideas are held in by engrams. For the purposes of Crashing MU finding, they can be handled by recall. If you are trying to find someone’s Crashing MU and he has a service facsimile get-ting in the way, then his efforts will be taken up entirely with trying to make himself right and you and others wrong and you will not be able to get to the Crashing MU. He would even feel made wrong if a Crashing MU was found. One person who was being checked for a Crashing MU in an area in which she was goofing could not even see her goofs, let alone a Crashing MU. Eventually she admitted that she had the idea that she could not be wrong regarding this particular subject. When this was spotted and cleared up the Crashing MU could be located and the whole area straightened out. Handling: If the person is manifesting the symptoms of a service facsimile or if the failure to find a Crashing MU where one obviously must exist is not resolved with A-D above, then the Word Clearer would ask, “Is there some idea you are using which makes you right and others wrong?” and two-way comm with him about it without getting into listing for an item. Usu-ally the person will give up the service facsimile and realize that he has been making himself right and others wrong. He will feel very relieved to have spotted it and will be able to look for and find his Crashing MU. If, however, the service facsimile does not come up on request and two-way comm, then the person should be sent for handling by an auditor on service fac-similes."},{"pageNumber":428,"pageContent":" CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 414 16.12.09 CAUTIONS The remedies given in this HCOB must be understood to be remedies for inability to locate the Crashing MU – they are not substitutes for standard application of the tech of find-ing and clearing Crashing MUs. One would always begin with the standard approach to finding the Crashing MU and, if none was found, only then would one check for and handle each of the blocks given above in the sequence given. If one found something on any of A-E above, one would handle it and then check again for the Crashing MU. One does not automatically check all of A-E. The sole idea is to handle whatever is burying the Crashing MU and as soon as that has been achieved one re-turns to Crashing MU finding. If half way through the False Data Stripping, for example, the person realizes he has had a Crashing MU on, then that’s it. You wouldn’t now continue the False Data Stripping. You would complete the step you were on and then end off. The same goes for any of the remedies. As soon as the Crashing MU is found or find-able, the purpose of the remedy has been achieved and that would be it. As it is fatal to miss a withhold on someone, it is very important that any withhold pulling done is thorough and goes to real VGIs whether it is metered or un-metered. Withhold pulling off the meter must be followed by a meter check, whether anything is found or not. Similarly in asking for a service facsimile it is possible to start the person listing and if he gets sick or caves in later one must assume that this has occurred and get the action re-paired in session rapidly. Note: Of course if the person is PTS and dramatizing creating problems, you may not be able to get anywhere at all until he has been run on Clay Table de-PTSing to full EP. These cautions are not given here to make it look difficult or dangerous to do Crashing MU finding. It is usually very straightforward. However, if one is going to get results every time, he must be aware of the possible errors or barriers that he may run into and should know how to handle them. SUMMARY Sometimes Crashing MU finding draws a blank even though there is plenty of evi-dence that a Crashing MU exists. Other misunderstoods, overts or withholds, false data, justifications and service fac-similes can bury the Crashing MU. If one runs into this situation, one must not abandon the Crashing MU finding as the person will continue to have difficulty and will not get out his products."},{"pageNumber":429,"pageContent":" CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 415 16.12.09 The answer is to handle the blocks that are preventing the Crashing MU from being found and then find and clear the Crashing MU.

It can be done on the spot by the person doing the Crashing Mis-U finding or in session by an auditor. The Crashing Mis-U Repair List is used in the event of a bog or trouble during Crash-ing Mis-U finding or a red tagged exam after a Crashing MisU finding session. It can also be done if, after the fact of a Crashing Mis-U being found, the person is still not getting out his products or is not completing cycles of action in his area. (Note: The person could be up against a new Crashing Mis-U on a whole different cycle of action in the same area.) If after the Crashing Mis-U Repair List has been done and fully handled, there seems to be some other bypassed charge or BIs connected with the Crashing Mis-U finding, a C/S 53 or WCCL should be done. This would be determined by the C/S. Any person using this list must have excellent TRs and be able to make a list read and correctly interpret E-Meter reads. They must also be drilled on this correction list and have their High Crime checkouts done on this list as well as HCOB 17 Jun 79 CRASHING MIS-Us: The key to completed cycles of action and products.

Production is the basis of morale. People who don’t get products have low morale. Executives and responsible people have the task of getting out products. When they don’t get them out, the unit or organization fails. It is extremely upsetting and puzzling to a staff member and to his seniors when he can’t get out the products expected of him. I have seen an executive going around in circles for weeks trying to guess why such and such a staff member couldn’t get out the products of his post area. I have seen staff members actually in tears because they were unable to achieve the products of their post. I have also seen people busy, busy, busy and totally unaware of the fact that they were producing absolutely nothing. LRH ED 302 was a breakthrough. It has now been written into HCO PL 10 June 79, DEBUG TECH and contains a considerably expanded tech on how to debug products. People have had very great success in applying it."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"DEBUG TECH CHECKLIST 2 HCO PL 23.08.79 II CRAMMING OFFICER HAT 424 16.12.09 To give them even greater successes, I have rewritten LRH ED 302-1 into this PL. The whole object of this checklist is to debug a lack of products and accomplishments of an org or post. This Debug Checklist is used in conjunction with HCO PL DEBUG TECH. It gives the person doing the debug a list of things that could be standing in the way of production. The sequence of handling is as laid out in the debug tech PL. The first action is an inspection of the area. Then come the personal handling steps. This sequence must be followed in any debug action. For instance, if you haven’t done the inspection then how would you know what it is you are trying to debug? This checklist can be assessed on a meter or be administratively used (off the meter) by Mission Operators, Program Operators, Project Operators, evaluators, executives and any-one else needing to debug a cycle of action or lack of products, including any staff member or student himself. When assessed on a meter, each reading line would be taken to F/N by doing the han-dling given for that line. When doing this checklist the individual should have the issues and references he may need to carry out the handlings along with him. THE EP OF DEBUG Debug actions are never carried on past the point where the target or area or individual or org has been debugged. Once production has been debugged and desirable products are now being gotten for real in adequate quantity, the debug has been accomplished. This could occur at any one of the steps. And when it does you let the area get on with producing the products they are now able to produce. PRODUCT DEBUG REPAIR LIST In case of a bog or trouble on the following checklist use HCOB 23 Aug 79, Issue II, Product Debug Series 10, PRODUCT DEBUG REPAIR LIST to repair the person so he can con-tinue with the debug actions. INSPECTION 00. The first action in debugging an area is an inspection to see what is going on in terms of production.
