(Originally issued as an article in Ability 50 on 5 July 1957. Issued as an HCO PL on 5 Oct. 87.) Lonesome? Have people who don't know Scientology stopped making \"sense\" to you? Start a group. When the groups in Chicago, LA and Houston have pushed out to the city limits, we hope they will continue to expand until they find themselves merged with New York, Seattle and Miami. If Scientology is ever to travel, it will be accomplished by groups. I hope to see the AMA defined as \"that building in Chicago which is totally sur-rounded by Scientology groups.\" And the government in Washington defined as \"that group which has not yet been validated.\" And Earth defined as \"that planet where people settle things peacefully via Scientology groups.\" Scientology is basically communication. If you knew all the wisdom in the universe and had none to whom you could communicate, you would still be unhappy. People don't bite. Ask them over to a sociable evening to discuss forming a mental health group. When they get there, don't ask them to join. Just elect them as officers. Get them to agree on future meetings and the programs. Assume they want to know more about Scientology. Explain Scientology offhandedly as though it's sort of strange they don't know and get on with group organization and business. Don't run Decisional Processing on them. Assume they've decided and lo! you've got a group. Groups fail to form in absence of purpose. People fail to join in absence of pur-pose they can understand. Mock up the purpose. Invite in the people. Form up a program around the purpose and away you go. If you don't have one, it's because you've been trying to explain Scientology to people and so get them to join.

Get good results on every pc processed individually. 2. Operate a group and do PE and Group Processing. 3. Keep the group recruited. It is not necessary that a field auditor has great sums of money to finance his activity. All successful Scientology activities have financed themselves. In extreme, an auditor with no pcs to keep him going can get a job and run a group evenings until the income of the group activity makes the job unnecessary. The keynote of handling any area is to bring order. Every time you put some order into a pc or a group, or society, a little confusion blows off. Ignore the confusion. It is transi-tory. Order is not. It stays. Therefore the more order (not necessarily the more activity) you put into things the more continuance you have. This is new data, extremely important and should be carefully gone over again and again and applied. It is data that brings big wins in a society, a group or a pc. Bring a little order. Get the pc to see that he can bring order into his affairs. Ask him bluntly, \"What order could you bring into your life?\" And his case will start resolving. The highest ability of a thetan is to Bring Order. Therefore, orderly processing brings results, disorderly processing does not. All an ARC break is is a disorder. What order, then, can a trained auditor bring into his area? Into his own life? Into his pc's? Into his group? That is the question worth answering. The confusion that flies off when the order is entered in seems so important to many auditors that they Q and A with it. They stop pursuing order and start pursuing confusion. Never change from order to disorder just because confusion blows off. Let the confusion go. If you want it all gone, just put more order into it. That's why CCH works when properly used. An auditor who just starts a group blows some disorder out of a society. The disorder flies into view. Ignore it. Just put some more well-run, exactly scheduled group there. More disorder discharges. Order put in too suddenly always discharges disorder too fast. That's an explosion. You don't want that. Leave explosions to the government (its highest level of en-tering order is to blow everything up)."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"FIELD ACTIVITIES 2   HCOB   6.01.59   STARTING A GROUP 6 21.12.12 Here's a program. Get hold of all the people you have processed in the area you are in. Give them an interview. In it, ask each one, \"What order are you trying to bring into your life?\" \"What part of your life?\" Tell them that's what Scientology is trying to help them do. You'll have more pcs. Weld them into a group. Give them some group processing Tone 40. Bring order into their lives. Take responsibility for every pc's whole life. Take responsibility for all the reactive banks in your area. Clear them up by bringing more order. Money cannot flow back to you on disorderly lines. AUDITOR CONFIDENCE Every field auditor has had some loses. These cut down his confidence. He should re-build his confidence. He should rebuild his confidence as his first step. He failed where he failed to bring order into lives. Therefore, he had better now discipline himself to use one simple process and use it right and without change until he has won with it. Don't change the process because it blows off disorder. To the devil with the disorder–put the order in regard-less of how much disorder it blows off. KEY REHABILITATION PROCESS 1. Start session. 2. Find out if the pc has an auditor. 3. Find out if the pc has an auditing room. 4. Ask pc (goals), \"What part of your life would you like to bring some order into?\" Two-way comm on it for no more than five minutes. Get into session then. 5. For one hour at the beginning of each session every session run \"Look around here and find something you have.\" Only that command. If pc originates, understand and ac-knowledge. Don't do anything else about it. 6. For remainder of session run \"Recall something you have done.\" When he says he has, acknowledge only. Session after session run nothing else but this. And you'll bring order to a pc, believe me. And he'll have great case changes and he'll be moving forward toward clear. This process will give you wins unless you do something else to vary it. The only people it doesn't work well on are nearly unconscious. On these only CCH 1, 2, 3 and 4 work. If the process doesn't bite at all, use CCH 1, 2, 3 and 4. But don't worry, it will bite–if you keep your mouth shut and don't flub."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"FIELD ACTIVITIES 3   HCOB   6.01.59   STARTING A GROUP 7 21.12.12 Now you want some wins. Don't talk to the pc much during a session. Use TR 4 whenever he talks. Keep him reassured, happy, comfortable and don't let him out of session until you end it. And you'll win. If you lose, it's because you got fancy or chopped the pc up. Factual Havingness will ease off PT problems and ARC breaks. That's why you use it for an hour always. If a process regimen comes along that's simpler or better than the above I'll let you know right away. Until then, this is the very best you can do. GROUP RECRUITING Groups fall apart on sloppy scheduling. They need one night a week at the minimum. Always the same night, same hours. That's order. Always a one hour lecture and one hour group processing Tone 40. We have new phonograph records of lectures for you. They're cheap. Buy them. When you have a group processed a while get people into an HAS Course. Teach them TRs 0 to 9 and then let them co-audit on exactly the above regimen. By permitting co-auditing, the trained auditor actually gets more pcs. Charge for co-auditing consultations. Keep them at it. We're taking the lid off. The country is full of people. They should be in groups and co-auditing. In that way we'll bring enough order to the country to make even it survive. By the way, HCO Washington, D.C., will issue a Hubbard Apprentice Scientologist certificate to anybody you guarantee has passed TRs 0 to 9 without charge to you. We trust you to make sure they're good. In recruiting a group, keep explaining Scientology as something that helps people bring order into their lives. You'd be amazed how little order they believe they can inject. Call on new people. Run an ad for your group: \"Tired of Being Human? __________ Scientology Group Clears People,\" or \"Does Life Seem Disorderly?

In this case the datum con-cerns dissemination. I, of all people, had to find out that books sold Scientology. How does one actually get the subject around in his area? He sells books and more books. How? In small magazines and shopping weeklies. What books? Books on Dianetics and Scientology. Why? People have agreed that books can be believed. If it is printed it is true. People don't believe people. They believe books. How did we learn this? In the winter of 55-56 London had a slump. For eight months we tried to send out enough circulars and place \"goodwill ads\" about Scientology training and processing, but the level of activity of London did not change despite these campaigns. Then I found that coincident with the slump all Dianetics and Scientology books had disappeared out of the bookstores and hadn't been put back. The moment books went back into bookstores and into public circulation (with the publication of Scientology: The Fundamentals of Thought) the London \"slump\" vanished. The identical thing happened in the US with the same results. In other words, no amount of talking or Personnel Efficiency or goodwill ads made these two large Central Organizations function. But a few books did! Well, even after the wonderful example of 1950, I hadn't learned that books sold the subject–that auditors and clinics were as successful as books we sold. But we know it now. Sell books. That's the answer to a good practice or group. How? The most successful method seems to be placing ads for books in small maga-zines so that people can send their money in and get one. Now here's what you can do. Place ads in small magazines to sell books. Buy your books from the Distribution Center or the HASI and remarket. Stamp your name and address in each book you sell.

RON HUBBARD EXECUTIVE DIRECTIVE LRH ED 343 INT 4 May 1982 To: COs, EDs, FBOs, D/FBOs,  Bookstore Officers,  All Org Staffs, FSMs From: Ron Subject: BOOKS STRAIGHT TALK Books are the first line of dissemination. If you're not marketing and selling books to raw public in volume, you will have no eventual customers. Book One seminars are booming orgs where used. If you want Book One seminars to work you've got to be sure Book One is in every possible public outlet. You can't fill up Book One seminars with no people. You can't get word of mouth in the public without books marketed and sold. People who have not read Dianetics and Scientology books are harder to sell. People who have read them become eager for service. If books are not marketed and sold to the Scientology field, they cannot go up the Grade Chart. Your booksales predict your future GI. If you are worried about your GI today, you'll be frantic tomorrow unless you've marketed and sold books to raw public. So part of your promo monies must always go, not to just BMO but to promoting raw public booksales. If you have only one book or one meter in a bookstore people aren't likely to buy it. If you have far more sitting on the shelf or available they will. Scarcity of book stocks make no sales, abundant books do. Every book should have in it a return address card to the org. Books are your best ambassador and spokesman. Get them out into public hands. And don't be running out of book stocks, or let your inventories be ripped off. Books are assets. Safeguard the stock and the money you get for them and order new books with it."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"BOOKS STRAIGHT TALK 2 LRH ED 343 INT – 4.05.82 STARTING A GROUP 14 21.12.12 While you can make a profit on books, the service GI they bring in is far greater. Your org can run and pay its bills without also absorbing the money you get for books. So pay your Pubs bills and order more books with booksales funds. The cycle is (a) lots of books in public hands, (b) lots of good service delivered in org, (c) more books in public hands, (d) more service demand on org. When you don't use the money gotten for books to buy more books from Pubs you won't have any books and very soon will have no GI or staff pay either! Don't fool with this or fool yourself or short-circuit the org's first dissem line. They say Book One has started every boom since 1950. But Book One since 1950 (al-though it sold millions) has never been really marketed. I'll bet you can't even buy one in the corner drugstore! It's your responsibility to get them into every outlet in your area! You need the rest of the books also sold to back Book One up. Don't look on books as a sideline. They're your front line troops. Books, cassettes, films, meters are a planet-wide assault on the reactive mind. No one wants a reactive mind but a psychologist. So everyone else will be your friend. I'm not saying this just because I want books sold. No. I'm saying this because I want to clear a planet. Do you? Good! Then market and sell books and use the money to buy more books. And market and sell those. And you'll be making a real approach to getting people in for service and clear the planet. Money I get from booksale royalties helps to pay for research. Any money over is des-tined for a non-profit foundation to keep Scientology working. Any money you get from booksales should go to buy more books. And marketing and selling them will get people in for service and put your org in clover. There's no real profit anyone is making from books. It's no sin to make a profit from them. But it is a sin and a big one not to push them. And it's a real suppressive crime to cut the line or rip them off. Books are the spearhead of a planetwide offensive against the reactive mind, the unconscious part of the mind that enslaves the souls of Man. So only a very reactive person would stop this vital flow of Dianetics and Scientology books. You want public in? You want GI? It will happen only if you're clever in marketing and selling books. And at about 100X the volume of past years. Books are your shells and ammo in a planetary assault. They're also your infantry and ambassadors. Put attention on them! It is far from an unrealistic goal, short term, to get Book One into the hands of 1% of all the people in your area. That's a start. A longer term goal is to capture 5% of the world book market. We can do that too. And if we did it, sheer momentum would clear the planet. Are you with me on this?

It takes about 2 Admin personnel to keep a tech personnel going. Even a group of auditors, trying to make lots of money, usually try to do nothing but audit. It is not that they have case failures. It is that they fail to wear the essential hats. The best auditing results are obtained from teamwork. A Review Auditor has to be a trained Scientologist. Lack of one means a roughed-up pc has to be sent to the nearest org. But there is no reason one cannot work as part of a group, even if the others are only part-timers."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"DIANETICS AND RESULTS DIANETIC 2 HCOB 28.05.69 II COUNSELING GROUPS STARTING A GROUP 18 21.12.12 The best solution to all this is to form a Dianetic Counseling Group and get the es-sential posts on the org board held. Then the advances and gains the group makes will be ad-vances that are stable. This group would of course have to have liaison with a competent Medical Doctor or Clinic. In the United States especially, the Counselors would have to be ministers. A Dianetic auditor would be able to audit all day even if the whole group only worked evenings. Let's face it. The auditor auditing alone will have case failures. He won't have time to pick them up. He won't be able to get them to Qual. After a while he will have losses and some failed cases that muddy up his neighborhood just as other professions get. Psychiatry and psychology failed as single practitioners not only because they had no real tech but because they tried to work alone. This turned them toward governments which then used them only to control populations and there went whatever tech they might have developed. The single practitioner theory in Dianetics failed badly as an early Dianetics practice. Auditors that made it only attached themselves to the rich. Others became drifters. The answer, we have found out long since, is the group. The full hats, organization and activities and how they interrelate are available to Dianetic Counseling Groups. It is a wide area of interesting development all by itself. We had to know org basics to make orgs. A Dianetic Counseling Group can be enfranchised and made regular and helped. It will tend to stabilize any practice area. And it will minimize case failures. The official position of orgs is that they cannot take responsibility for the results ob-tained by single practitioners. Auditing is a team activity. Even if one were a medical doctor or a psychiatrist or psychologist, it would be best to have on hand or on call the rest of the team or at least a Dianetic Counseling Group even if one were not an integral part of it. The purpose of auditing is healthy sane people. The largest percentage are very grateful and very happy. And then there are the few who, through misconducted lives, are quite a handful to say the least. Realism requires that auditing be a group action. As such a group can also teach a course, it is not difficult to recruit able people to help."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"DIANETICS AND RESULTS DIANETIC 3 HCOB 28.05.69 II COUNSELING GROUPS STARTING A GROUP 19 21.12.12 I recall in particular two pathetic cases of singlism.

The other was an auditor who found himself with the whole of a war vessel's crew as pcs and no help in sight. In either case forming a Dianetic Counseling Group, getting them checked out on their \"hats\" and doing their duties even part-time would have solved all. One stick won't burn.

The FSMs working in or with the group allocate automatically as soon as the commission is received by him or her from the org, say 3% of the 10% (meaning 30% of what he receives). This would be paid to the Treasurer of the group. Or: b. The group itself is the FSM, receives all commissions and pays the person who signs up selectees in the group name 50%, the group retaining the remainder. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"GUNG-HO GROUPS 3 HCO PL 2.12.68 STARTING A GROUP 23 21.12.12 Or: c. The group as the official FSM of the area receives all the fee and has its group staff members do the selection. Of these (b) is probably the most workable. As the operating group if functioning well would triple or quadruple the potential sign-ups for FSMs, the halving of the commission would benefit one and all. Plan (c) is the one used by Scientology orgs in selecting people to higher orgs but is not actually all that workable. There are undoubtedly other plans and arrangements that could be made. The whole point here is that an independent FSM depending on the group for spade-work has to contribute to the group's survival or the cycle will break down. And roving FSMs entering the area should work through the group as this in past years was a very sore point and hurt groups who had then to clean up the pcs left unfinished and all that. MEMBERSHIP FEES Group members should pay a fee yearly to the group. It is about $2.50 to $5.00 but is up to the local group as it is their money. Membership fees cover postage and mailing costs to members but not very much more. It is a minor but necessary source of income. The group member of course gets a membership card and pin for his membership fee. CONTRIBUTIONS The most heavily worked-over income point of most civic-minded groups is the ob-taining of contributions. These can be quite sizable. They do not however come easily unless the group has a nonprofit status and the pa-tron can thereby deduct it from his income tax. A group, however, that registers as a charity and is a member of existing nonprofit or-ganizations can obtain contributions. Governments have been known to contribute large sums to groups. Contributions should be worked at but should be regarded as an irregular source of in-come and not counted on for the general running expenses of a group. Rather, they are like an affluence, and major projects are the best use for contributions and the best reason to get them–such as a new building for the group or a new hall, things like that."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"GUNG-HO GROUPS 4 HCO PL 2.12.68 STARTING A GROUP 24 21.12.12 COURSE FEES The group can teach four types of courses: a. Group organizations, b. Basic management, c. Personal and family management, d. Basic Scientology book study. These are not expensive courses. Their fees are comparable to those charged by mis-sions for HAS Courses, etc. The group's courses are packaged, easily supervised checksheet courses, run on a regular evening schedule. All the fees go to the group. MISSIONS ARE DIFFERENT A mission is different entirely from a Gung-ho Group. One can easily benefit from the other. But the Gung-ho Group is there to speed up and smooth out the society and civic or-ganizations and make a better community atmosphere directly. The group is a society entrance point. The mission is basically a Scientology training and processing activity for individuals. The group works on other dynamics–notably the third and fourth. GROUP ORG BOARD For a Forming Elementary Group The group president is in general charge of the group. The group communications executive handles communications and dissemination and is very like the HCO Exec Secretary. The group organization executive handles finance and training and is comparable to the Organization Executive Secretary.

However, when the group gets above 50, the org board is expanded to 27 departments from the 18 now indicated. People as they join the elementary group fit in where the load is heaviest. The recruiting officer recruits group members and acts as reception. The communicator handles all communications of whatever kind, in and out. The master-at-arms keeps order at meetings and ejects people trying to break the group up. He also inspects things and reports on them to the communications executive who in turn informs the president or other group members. The project planning officer finds, figures out and draws and writes up all the steps of a project or program after it is agreed upon by the executive council.

The income officer cashiers and receives and bills for any income owed. The disbursement officer pays all bills from treasury. The materiel officer keeps up the property and quarters of the group, anything it owns, repairs it, sets up meeting chairs and cleans them away. And inventories things. The tech services officer sees students are routed and cared for, sees other groups when meeting together are routed and handled. His business is bodies, to what are they as-signed, where do they go. The training officer handles all training of whatever kind, including the training of the group. And any school. The operations officer actually handles and directs all operations programs and pro-jects in progress. The examinations officer examines anyone trained or being trained and any project or program. In the event of any breakdown in anything, such as a project or program, the review officer grabs it and corrects it or gets it redone. The certs and awards officer gets made up and issued all certificates, membership or otherwise, pins, etc., as well as conditions. The individual contact officer is in charge of polls for purposes from individuals in the public. These form up in project planning into specific, long-range targets for the area of the group. The target apportionment officer apportions short-range targets to other groups which when all done make up the completion of long-range targets for the whole area. The group liaison officer is in contact with other groups to be sure things are going right and patches them up and keeps them going.

It will function. When more than fifty are serving in the group and it is active, then the basic pattern is expanded properly. Each executive gets one more department so that there are nine. And each department gets three sections. But the functions remain more or less the basic group pattern. It is best to start with a simple pattern. This pattern also adapts to any business or any civic group. POST THE BOARD The org board of the group is posted conspicuously. It is best done on a varnished board or a Formica board varnished over. Names are printed or typed or Dymo stickered. If the board isn't varnished, tape and Dymo strips can't be pulled off easily and stuck back on. Christmas red, green, yellow tape is used to separate the different departments and parts of the group organization. FUNCTION It is forbidden to obtain long-range targets from civic groups or businesses. One only obtains long-range targets by ringing doorbells and going into shops and asking individuals what they think should be done on community projects. When enough of this is done, then the project planning officer sums the results of the poll up into long-range objectives. The publishing officer publishes these as a pamphlet for the Gung-ho Group that also explains the group's purpose. The project planning officer now breaks these long-range ones down, each one down into possible short-range ones, gives them to the group apportionment officer to see if he can get them lined up to various civic groups or businesses as their portion of the long-range tar-get. By keeping one or two long-range targets going (by getting other groups to do the short-range parts), the long-range targets can be met for the community.

They are working groups. Most such groups are mainly concerned with keeping the members interested, having \"group programs,\" etc. These groups are hard to form, hard to keep going. The usual old-time type group was a sort of audience for somebody that met once a week, evenings or lunch or dinner that then got spoken to by somebody about something. If the group had anything to get done, it formed a committee. Then only one or two in the committee did anything about it. The result was that the dynamic quality of the group was missing. Such groups tended to \"squirrel\" (which means go off-line). Some wild new idea would come along and the group members, being bored, would chase off. The essences of a true group are participation and contribution. Group members must be able to participate in action to become a true team. And each must be permitted to contribute to the action for a group to generate a life of its own. Giving money or things to a group are both a form of participation and contribution. But while this is an important matter, it does not involve actual action. Thus, a contributor of money or objects to a group is yet withholding himself and his time. One should seek contri-bution of money and things. But the status granted for this is that of patron or associate, not of a true member of the group. Thus, one must sharply differentiate in giving out \"membership\" cards between the contributor of money or things and the active member by always calling the money contribu-tor an \"associate\" or a \"patron\" and the time and effort contributor a \"full member\" or a \"true group member'\" or an \"active member\" on the card. An active member should have a full"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"GUNG-HO GROUPS POLICY LETTER #2 2 HCO PL 3.12.68 STARTING A GROUP 30 21.12.12 credentials card with picture, thumb print and description. An associate just a name typed on a card. Groups that become members of the Gung-ho Group are in fact \"Associate Group Members.\" They receive a large certificate as Associate Group Members of the local Gung-ho Group, as issued by the local Gung-ho Group. TRUE GROUP MEMBER The True Group Member is part of the org board, has a post on it and has duties relat-ing to his department. Where there is more than one person in a department (of which there are eighteen on the basic board) his title is the department name plus a function such as \"Recruiting Letter Writer\" or \"Communications Telephonist\" or \"Master-at-Arms Inspector.\" MEETINGS The group should \"meet\" two or three times a week on exactly scheduled evenings or weekends, Saturday and Sunday afternoons. These evenings or afternoons should be those which normally are not connected with events. For one thing the group members will be free and for another, people will be home. The group transacts the bulk of its work according to the posts of members during its meetings. It doesn't have meetings and then at some unnamed time in the week get its group work done. It gets its group work done and works as an organization during meetings, each to his own post. As the group gets affluent, it should hire a permanent communicator who keeps the telephone manned and handles things during the week days. Failure to keep a telephone manned and failure to answer mail can nullify all the work of the group. So, to begin, the group should have at least an answering service or somebody's phone. The group also has to have a mail address and a letterhead. OFFICE SPACE A typewriter, some chairs and office space of some sort are important to a group. No big outlay is needed at first. But the sooner a group gets something like permanent quarters the better off it will be."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"GUNG-HO GROUPS POLICY LETTER #2 3 HCO PL 3.12.68 STARTING A GROUP 31 21.12.12 COMM SYSTEM The group should have a \"Comm Center\" in some safe place where it meets. A comm center is made up of baskets–the \"beanstalk\" type are best and each group member has his own basket with his name on it. The comm center is best laid out directly below an org board and exactly follows the org board in that several baskets are under part of the board and relate to that part of the board, with the most senior baskets highest. In this way one can locate the person on the org board and locate his basket at a glance. People sort into others baskets and empty their own basket. Notices can be distributed, etc. The Communicator takes care of the baskets and posting all boards. TARGET BOARDS There are two different target boards. One board is for the Gung-ho Group. This gives the targets per department for current, long-range actions of the group itself. It is called the \"Gung-ho Group Target Board.\" The other board is the Community Target Board. On this is posted the long-range tar-gets of the community and the short-range targets of the various civic groups. Targets are typed on a slip of paper and put under the department's name. Various systems of posting can be used. The main thing is to post the targets. When short-range targets are done, they are marked off as done. When all short-range targets are done, the long-range target they made up is done. GROUP ORGANIZATION The principle and success of a true group organization is each member does his own specialized part. When you have a \"group\" where everyone in it, each one does all the jobs, you don't have a group, you have chaos. The group won't expand. Thus each group member is responsible for his own job as assigned."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"GUNG-HO GROUPS POLICY LETTER #2 4 HCO PL 3.12.68 STARTING A GROUP 32 21.12.12 HATS On a train, a locomotive engineer and a conductor each wear a different kind of hat. You will notice that various jobs in the society are designated by different hats. From this we get the word hat as a slang term meaning one's specialized duties. This is one's hat. Usually, when a person has been on a job awhile, he knows what it consists of. He then should write up his hat, meaning in this case a folder which contains past orders and directions which outline his job plus his own summary of his job. When one is transferred or leaves a post, he is supposed to \"write up his hat\" which is to say, modernize this summary of the post. Hats are kept and assembled and reissued by the Recruiting Officer who is in fact the Personnel Officer of the group and assigns personnel to posts. It is pretty grim for someone to take over a post newly which has no hat. Thus, these hats are carefully preserved, turned in and reissued. _________________ These items, the org board, comm center, Gung-ho Group target board, community target board, and hats are the basic items of a group. People and these can be organized into a highly dynamic effective group. ALL HANDS An action requiring a huge burst of activity is called an all hands action. Thus a mailing to be stuffed in envelopes and mailed, a huge, doorbell-ringing cam-paign to get individual purposes, a big drive to persuade civic groups by individual calls–all these are all hands actions. Thus, a group member has two functions: 1. His post in the group for which he is directly responsible and 2. All hands actions where the whole group pitches in on one fast project. Wise group leaders do not keep a group continually in an all hands condition. One of these is good for a sprint. The bulk of a group member's time should be on his own post, do-ing his specialized job. FLOW LINES It will be noted on the org board that it flows from left to right. A person or particle enters on the left side and flows down to the right side."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"GUNG-HO GROUPS POLICY LETTER #2 5 HCO PL 3.12.68 STARTING A GROUP 33 21.12.12 This tendency of the board to flow particles from left to right is fine and it's designed to do that. But also this pull along the board gets into the true group members. They get pulled down the board on their posts. The Recruiting Officer has to watch it to keep from sliding on down into the duties of the last department. The President also has to watch it as he can get pulled into some lower part of the board and cease to be an overall supervisor of the group and just answer the telephone. The rule is, where you have a group member who is not doing his job, he pulls others into it. So when a group member finds himself doing another's job, you know the other isn't doing his job. This is the prime reason for a disorganized organization. COMMITTEES The true group does not appoint committees ever. That is a way to get no action. The way to get action is to get it done by the proper place on the board. TRAINING OFFICER Whatever else he does, the first duty of the Training Officer is to teach group members and new group members the Gung-ho Group policy letters and the functions of the org board, comm center, target boards, and hats. A primary reason for confusion in any organization is that people don't know the pat-tern. The one who has to know these things best is the President. Otherwise, he cross-assigns duties to the wrong parts of the board. ACTION The way to get action is to let people finish the actions they begin. The way to get no real action is to assign actions to the wrong parts of the board and then prevent people from completing what they start. A few simple targets actually executed are worth a thousand thoughts about and not done. All actions should be assigned to the right people and pushed to full completion. In this lies the strength of the group.

It is easy to handle an upstat. In a world which is taught by the old school that it is a dog-eat-dog, jungle world, one has incompetent governments, wars, pressure groups, conflicts, economic pushes and gener-ally a hard environment in which to operate. The humanitarian objective of Scientology is–to make a safe environment in which the fourth dynamic engram can be audited. A suppressed and insecure society is a hard one in which to operate. The answer then is to generally increase the security of races, groups, individuals. A true democracy is possible only when the group is made up of sane, thinking indi-viduals. We can produce these and out from them goes a zone of greater security. However, it is perilous to neglect the further out surroundings and it is necessary that one give some thought to other dynamics beyond the first dynamic (self). We are not engaged in a conquest or to achieve some planned utopia. All we are trying to do is lessen the turbulence and insecurity in the society, which is the basic role of a church. By organization and an orderly approach to the problem, we can achieve this in sev-eral ways, a main one being Gung-ho Group activities. [Image below contains the following text:] [1. Gung-ho Group ... asks individuals in the society what should be done.] [2. Gung-ho Group publishes the results] [3.

Vitality returns to a society when common purposes are restimulated. At present so many special group interests are so in conflict with other special groups that social progress is impeded. If you can get one commonly expressed purpose then actually done by liaison with in-terested social or humanitarian groups, the knot starts to untangle. The combined strength of many social groups using all their connections to achieve one gain cannot help but produce it. Instead of all the force vectors lying about in a random confusion, opposing each other, you add up some of the vectors all in one direction and achieve thereby a concentration which brings a result. Even a small, local campaign so coordinated will work. It won't work if you go to groups for the purpose and ignore the men in the street. Groups get individuated. Each group is to some degree attacked or opposed and each is trying to do something. This brings about a stagnation of action. You also get a disinterested, often disloyal society.

But it has to be their goal. This rekindles interest, action and hope. It revitalizes society. Also we begin to stand for something they all stand for. If as we progress a lot of people also get processed, then there's also the effect of their beneficial influence added to it. Example: We poll an area or a country regarding desirable social targets with \"What should be done to improve human rights?\" We get a lot of answers. We boil these down to an honest common denominator. We find whatever we find. Maybe it's \"Parking tickets should be given to the person, not left on cars.\" So we liaise with any and all civic groups and put this up to them. What can each one do about it? We keep it rolling. Suddenly the practice is effected. People wake up to the fact that something can be done about something. So we do it all over again, using perhaps the same original question to individuals. Now that example is developed from a preconceived question. You can do it with a much more general approach \"What should be done in this city to better it?\" The choice of the question of course to some degree regulates the campaign. The im-provement of human rights will be found to be very generally acceptable. If you choose a question which then runs too contrary to the forces of law and order, even more confusion will result. So one tries to get a theta approach to things. People are usually able to agree with getting something stopped. This is not always bad. Sometimes that's all you can get them to agree with. Today we have government by special interest. It ignores to a huge degree what the average citizen really wants. This winds up usually in some weird, special-interest-utopia mess like the book George Orwell's 1984. The number of utopia planners around would amaze you. The average individual shuns utopias like the plague. One has to go to the indi-vidual member and go to many individuals in many strata of society to find out what's really wanted. It's usually pretty simple. The way the question is worded should guide toward a simple action, not some long-term complex action. A lot of actually done, easy actions each one completed will straighten out a lot of vectors. The HCO PLs on targets can help.
