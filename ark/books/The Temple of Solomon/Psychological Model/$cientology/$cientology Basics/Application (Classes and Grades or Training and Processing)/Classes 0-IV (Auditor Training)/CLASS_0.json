Therefore actions which neglect or violate this PolicyLetter are HIGH CRIMES resulting in Comm Evs on ADMINISTRATORS and EXECUTIVES. It is not“entirely a tech matter” as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a 2 year slump. IT IS THE BUSINESS OFEVERY STAFF MEMBER to enforce it.ALL LEVELSKEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKINGHCO Sec or Communicator Hat Checkon all personnel and new personnelas taken on.We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology.The only thing now is getting the technology applied.If you can’t get the technology applied then you can’t deliver what’s promised. It’s assimple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what’s promised.The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is “no results”. Troublespots occur only where there are “no results”. Attacks from governments or monopolies occuronly where there are “no results” or “bad results”.Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if thetechnology is applied.So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P,the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied.Getting the correct technology applied consists of:One: Having the correct technology.Two: Knowing the technology.Three: Knowing it is correct.Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Five: Applying the technology.Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied.Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology.Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications.Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology.Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application.One above has been done.Two has been achieved by many.Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper mannerand observing that it works that way.Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world.Five is consistently accomplished daily.Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently.Seven is done by a few but is a weak point.Eight is not worked on hard enough.Nine is impeded by the “reasonable” attitude of the not quite bright.Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity.Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area.The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Threeabove can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too-bright havea bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shutoff from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselvesagainst anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks toknock out the good and perpetuate the bad.Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight,Nine and Ten.In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide openfor research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of Century hasthoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only ahandful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long run value and none were major or basic; andwhen I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I repented andeventually had to “eat crow”.On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions andwritings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction ofall our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and howinsane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology”. By actual record the percentages areabout twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroygood technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had better steel"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attackedas “unpopular” “egotistical” and “undemocratic”. It very well may be. But it is also a survivalpoint And I don’t see that popular measures, self- abnegation and democracy have doneanything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorse degradednovels, self- abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses,and democracy has given us inflation and income tax.Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had nosupported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that in itsformative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume,will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done.There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which willbe valuable-only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications.The contributions that were worth while in this period of forming the technology werehelp in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, ofadvices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are,appreciated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discoverycontribution was not however part of the broad picture.We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank.We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact-the group left to its own devices would nothave evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called “new ideas” wouldhave wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workablemental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve-psychiatry,psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infinitum.So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense,and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlesslyfollowed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish.So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I havenot failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’s not goodenough for just myself and a few others to work at this.Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight. Nine and Ten has been relaxed the wholeorganizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.l., Wichita, the early organizations andgroups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, whenthey were all messed up you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. But ahead of that theyceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons.The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks havedifferent responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bankprinciples. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual andseldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid cravingfor agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement hasbeen what has made Earth a Hell-and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it wouldcertainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the greatgovernments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on theplanet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasantthings on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by theGroup Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by “public opinion” media.Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves.Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group offreed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that isdestructive."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bankdominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it,(b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and(d) encourage incorrect application.It’s the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the Bank thatsays we must fail.So just don’t play that tune. Do Seven. Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out ofyour road all the future thorns.Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pcspin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C.Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak on Threeabove and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the CaseSupervisor “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly at each of One toSix above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door tothe introduction of “new technology” and to failure.What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s all thathappened. This is what he should have done: Grabbed the Auditor’s report and looked it over,When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the restmissed: that. Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but thatnear session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while itstill gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B’s own manufacture, which nearlyspun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A wasfound to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The CaseSupervisor was found to be “too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases”.All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven,Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That process X didn’twork.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s your auditor’sreport for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stoppedProcess X. What did you do?” Then the Pc wouldn’t have come close to a spin and all four ofthese would have retained certainty.In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct processrecommended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one had (a)increased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable.Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process crackedthe case. Yet they were reported as not having worked!Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every timeinstruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the auditor,is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten areeven more important in a course than in supervision of cases.Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “because hegets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisions asession are reported. “Of course his model session is poor but it’s just knack he has” is alsoincluded in the recommendation. A careful review is undertake because nobody at levels O toIV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read anE-Meter dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered thathe “overcompensated” nervously swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed togo to place the needle at “set”. So everyone was about to throw away standard processes andmodel session because this one student “got such remarkable TA”. They only read the reportsand listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were makingslightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hidden under a lot of departuresand errors.I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot ofoff-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The academy students were in a stateof electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought under control andthe student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck.Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wifedied of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough instructor at that moment couldhave salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to dowhatever they pleased.Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes aboutfrom non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but someearlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood.When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can becounted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came fromorgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology under instruction inScientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And theorgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened outeasily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. hence, adebacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So properinstruction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must bemerciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student,dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be thecause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology gothome to him.With what we know now, there is no student we enrol who cannot be properly trained.As an instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards insideout personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeve rolled up can crack theback of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole classonly. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don’t wait untilnext week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him. If you can’t graduate them with theirgood sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll havenightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three inthem and they’ll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing.When somebody enrols, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of theuniverse- never permit an “open-minded” approach. If they’re going to quit let then quit fast. Ifthey enroled, they’re aboard, and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the same terms as the restof us- win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. Thefinest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pambybunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It’s a tough universe. The socialveneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive-and even they have a hard time. We’llsurvive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly hebecomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scaredto enforce, we don’t make students into good Scientologists and that let’s everybody down.When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in he eye into afixed, dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. Theproper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist Now we’re going to makeyou into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you dead that incapable.”Fitting that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the crosswe have to bear.But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and timewe will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow. Fast. And as wegrow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less.So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s ourpossible failure to retain and practise our technology.An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of“unworkability”. They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or notdone.If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all therest.We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to do forlack of something better.The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and yourown destiny for the next endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now withand in Scientology.This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we maynever again have another chance.Remember, this is a our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of thepast.

Auditing skill tends to become adapted to one pc and deteriorate. This does notmake a good pro, it makes only a co- auditor. I’m making you into a pro, not aco auditor regardless of classification status. I can’t do that by giving you justthe pc you are already educated to run. You’d be a one pc auditor.2. Mutual withholds develop in teams and restrain auditing results.3. Your auditing skill tends to look better or worse than it is.We don’t even wholly guarantee you and your co-auditor that you will co-audit in theLevel Vl Co-audit for one team member may be Case type A and the other B. A Case type Acan run through anything. A Case type B stops at a comma. Thus one gets too far out of pacewith the other and it’s just too hard on one member of the team who would be, of course, theType B and already in trouble. It would be selfish indeed of a Type A to force a Type B to runGPMs far beyond where he or she has had them run. We will try to put the team together inthis Level VI Co-audit and mostly do but this AB factor is a technical one and we can’t doanything about it short of good auditing.Student RulesA lot of students come a cropper on the rules and try to carry on without concurrence.You are only here for a few months. In your hands is your next multi-trillion years.The rules are there to get you through. Breaking them, in my opinion, is too pricey."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Rapidity of ProgressA few new students arrive here in a high state of “know it all, just want a few newgimmicks”.Students who have this state of mind just don’t learn or progress. And they really getstuck in. We’re not doing it to them. They are trying to learn over the top of their own postulatethat they already know it (when they don’t) and so get into a ridge. They’re not stuck in thecourse. They’re stuck in this conflict.In the first place, no new student at Saint Hill has ever been known to give a standardsession on arrival, despite all the data being available. But they don’t know enough aboutauditing to know whether they’re doing well or not, much less know how to audit. Factuallythey usually look pretty pitiful. There they are making Gross Auditing Errors in an avalanche,missing comm cycles, feet in the pc’s face with their meter upside down, telling the Class Vlauditor who is his Instructor “I know all about it. We had a course in Slobovia much better thanthis one. The pcs audited the auditor and it . . . .”Well you can’t blame the instructor if he seems to be having a hard time to keep fromlaughing in the new student’s face. It’s only their courtesy that keeps them from reaching overand connecting the unconnected cans this new genius has failed to plug into the meter as afitting touche.Some auditors trained elsewhere with great ARC but precious little “do it”, don’t haveenough training to know they aren’t trained. And it’s always the very worst trained auditorswho how; the loudest about how they don’t need to know. The majority relaxedly study andimprove their skill, get results and there it is.I myself periodically study auditing and put a polish on my own skill. I don’t have tosay “I don’t know”, but I’m not so arrogant as to believe I’m above knowing how to do things.So if every year or two I can study how to audit without going into a long rigmarole about howI’m above all that, I can reasonably expect others to have a sane view of their own skill too.Any skill can be improved—one can know more about an subject—unless one has alreadydecided he or she already knows all about it.The successful progress of a student is inversely proportional to the studentpreconception of knowing it already. An arrogant assumption of total knowing withoutinspection is the surest way to make no progress.One does or does not know the data before him. That’s elementary. Why should itbecome involved with emotionalism?The fast student is not concerned with necessities to maintain status by asserting howmuch he or she already knows. The fast student is only interested in knowing what he does notknow, studying it and then knowing that he knows it.The slow student is so busy putting on that he knows that he never finds out he doesn’tin fact know. To do this before a lot of experts such as Saint Hill Instructors seems prettypointless.Results today are by the text book. Lack of results are always attended by departures.One can or cannot get results with auditing. This means that one is or is not doing a text bookjob.In our case the text book has 14 years of hard won experience behind it. So text bookauditing gets the best results. It’s that simple."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The statement “I know all about Scientology but I don’t get very good results” is apretty silly statement today. It’s saying in fact “I pretend to more than I know and the flubsshow up in my results”.Well, that’s getting right down to the reasons for slow progress and calling a spade aspade, but it’s awful true. It’s really the only reason back of slow progress on course.The speed with which you complete your course and get to OT is entirely regulated bythe speed with which you discover there’s something here to learn.Most students handle this very early. I’m sure you will.I give you my good wishes for a fast progress.L. RON HUBBARDLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1964by L.

They are three different sets of symptoms.( 1 ) Education in the absence of the mass in which the technology will be involved isvery hard on the student.It actually makes him feel squashed. Makes him feel bent, sort of spinny, sort of dead,bored, exasperated.If he is studying the doingness of something in which the mass is absent this will be theresult.Photographs help and motion pictures would do pretty good as they are a sort of promiseor hope of the mass but the printed page and the spoken word are not a substitute for a tractor ifhe’s studying about tractors.You have to understand this data in its purity—and that is that educating a person in amass that they don’t have and which isn’t available produces physiological reactions. That iswhat I am trying to teach you.It’s just a fact.You’re trying to teach this fellow all about tractors and you’re not giving him anytractors—well he’s going to wind up with a face that feels squashed, with headaches and withhis stomach feeling funny. He’s going to feel dizzy from time to time and very often his eyesare going to hurt.It’s a physiological datum that has to do with processing and the field of the mind.You could therefore expect the greatest incidence of suicide or illness in that field ofeducation most devoted to studying absent masses.This one of studying the something without its mass ever being around produces the mostdistinctly recognizable reactions.If a child felt sick in the field of study and it were traced back to this one, the positiveremedy would be to supply the mass—the object or a reasonable substitute— and it would clearit up."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"(2) There is another series of physiological phenomena that exist which is based on thefact of too steep a study gradient.That’s another source of physiological study reaction because of too steep a gradient.It is a sort of a confusion or a reelingness that goes with this one.You’ve hit too steep a gradient.There was too much of a jump because he didn’t understand what he was doing and hejumped to the next thing and that was too steep and he went too fast and he will assign all of hisdifficulties to this new thing.Now differentiate here—because gradients sounds terribly like the 3rd one of these studyhang-ups, definitions—but remember that they are quite distinctly different.Gradients are more pronounced in the field of doingness but they still hang over into thefield of understanding. In gradients however it is the actions we are interested in. We have aplotted course of forward motion of actions. We find he was terribly confused on the secondaction he was supposed to do. We must assume then that he never really got out of the firstone.The remedy for this one of too steep a gradient is cutting back. Find out when he was notconfused on the gradient, then what new action he undertook to do. Find what action heunderstood well. Just before he was all confused what did he understand well—and then wefind out that he didn’t understand it well.It’s really at the tail end of what he understood and then he went over the gradient yousee.It is most recognizable and most applicable in the field of doingness.That’s the gradient barrier and one full set of phenomena accompanies that.(3) There is this third one. An entirely different set of physiological reactions broughtabout through—a bypassed definition. A bypassed definition gives one a distinctly blankfeeling or a washed-out feeling. A not-there feeling and a sort of nervous hysteria will follow inthe back of that.The manifestation of “blow” stems from this 3rd aspect of study which is themisunderstood definition or the not comprehended definition, the undefined word.That’s the one that produces the blow.The person doesn’t necessarily blow on these other two—they are not pronouncedlyblow phenomena. They are simply physiological phenomena.This one of the misunderstood definition is so much more important. It’s the make-up ofhuman relations, the mind and subjects. It establishes aptitude and lack of aptitude and it’s whatpsychologists have been trying to test for years without recognizing what it was.It’s the definitions of words.The misunderstood word.That’s all it goes back to and that produces such a vast panorama of mental effects that ititself is the prime factor involved with stupidity and the prime factor involved with many otherthings."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"If a person didn’t have misunderstoods his talent might or might not be present but hisdoingness would be present.We can’t say that Joe would paint as well as Bill if both were unaberrated in the field ofart, but we can say that the inability of Joe to paint compared with the ability of Joe to do themotions of painting is dependent exclusively and only upon definitions—exclusively and onlyupon definitions.There is some word in the field of art that the person who is inept didn’t define orunderstand and that is followed by an inability to act in the field of the arts.That’s very important because it tells you what happens to doingness and that therestoration of doingness depends only upon the restoration of understanding on themisunderstood word—misunderstood definition.This is very fast processing. There is a very swift wide big result obtainable in this.It has a technology which is a very simple technology.It enters in at the lower levels because it has to. This doesn’t mean it is unimportant, itmeans it has to be at the entrance gates of Scientology.It IS a sweepingly fantastic discovery in the field of education and don’t neglect it.You can trace back the subject a person is dumb in or any allied subject that got mixed upwith it. The psychologist doesn’t understand Scientology. He never understood a word inpsychology so he doesn’t understand Scientology.Well that opens the gate to Education. Although I’ve given this one of the misunderstooddefinition last it is the most important one.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdjhCopyright ©1971, 1974by L.

It means altering Scientology, off-beatpractices. It is a bad thing. I have found a way to explain why.Scientology is a workable system. This does not mean it is the best possible system or aperfect system. Remember and use that definition. Scientology is a workable system.In fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone, Man never evolved a workablesystem. It is doubtful if, in foreseeable history, he will ever evolve another.Man is caught in a huge and complex labyrinth. To get out of it requires that he follow theclosely taped path of Scientology.Scientology will take him out of the labyrinth. But only if he follows the exact markingsin the tunnels.It has taken me a third of a century in this lifetime to tape this route out.It has been proven that efforts by Man to find different routes came to nothing. It is also aclear fact that the route called Scientology does lead out of the labyrinth Therefore it is aworkable system, a route that can be travelled.What would you think of a guide who, because his party said it was dark and the roadrough and who said another tunnel looked better, abandoned the route he knew would lead outand led his party to a lost nowhere in the dark. You’d think he was a pretty wishy-washyguide.What would you think of a supervisor who let a student depart from procedure thesupervisor knew worked. You’d think he was a pretty wishy-washy supervisor.What would happen in a labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in a pretty canyon andleft her there forever to contemplate the rocks? You’d think he was a pretty heartless guide.You’d expect him to say at least, “Miss, those rocks may be pretty, but the road out doesn’t gothat way.”All right, how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his precleareventually clear just because the preclear had a cognition?People have following the route mixed up with “the right to have their own ideas.”Anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitions—so long as these do notbar the route out for self and others.Scientology is a workable system. It white tapes the road out of the labyrinth If therewere no white tapes marking the right tunnels, Man would just go on wandering around andaround the way he has for eons, darting off on wrong roads, going in circles, ending up in thesticky dark, alone.Scientology, exactly and correctly followed, takes the person up and out of the mess."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"So when you see somebody having a ball getting everyone to take peyote because itrestimulates prenatals, know he is pulling people off the route. Realize he is squirreling. Heisn’t following the route.Scientology is a new thing- it is a road out. There has not been one. Not all thesalesmanship in the world can make a bad route a proper route. And an awful lot of bad routesare being sold. Their end product is further slavery, more darkness, more misery.Scientology is the only workable system Man has It has already taken people towardhigher I.Q., better lives and all that. No other system has. So realize that it has no competitor.Scientology is a workable system. It has the route taped. The search is done. Now theroute only needs to be walked.So put the feet of students and preclears on that route. Don’t let them off of it no matterhow fascinating the side roads seem to them. And move them on up and out.Squirreling is today destructive of a workable system.Don’t let your party down. By whatever means, keep them on the route. And they’ll befree. If you don’t, they won’t.L.

Inmates ofinstitutions commonly trace their state back to contact with such personalities.Thus, in the fields of government, police activities and mental health, to name a few, wesee that it is important to be able to detect and isolate this personality type so as to protectsociety and individuals from the destructive consequences attendant upon letting such have freerein to injure others.As they only comprise 20% of the population and as only 2l/2% of this 20% are trulydangerous, we see that with a very small amount of effort we could considerably better the stateof society.Well-known, even stellar, examples of such a personality are, of course, Napoleon andHitler. Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Christie and other famous criminals were wellknownexamples of the anti-social personality. But with such a cast of characters in history we neglectthe less stellar examples and do not perceive that such personalities exist in current life, verycommon, often undetected.When we trace the cause of a failing business, we will inevitably discover somewhere inits ranks the anti-social personality hard at work.In families which are breaking up we commonly find one or the other of the personsinvolved to have such a personality.Where life has become rough and is failing, a careful review of the area by a trainedobserver will detect one or more such personalities at work.As there are 80% of us trying to get along and only 20% trying to prevent us, our liveswould be much easier to live were we well-informed as to the exact manifestations of such apersonality. Thus we could detect it and save ourselves much failure and heartbreak.It is important then to examine and list the attributes of the anti-social personality.Influencing as it does the daily lives of so many, it well behooves decent people to becomebetter informed on this subject.ATTRIBUTESThe anti-social personality has the following attributes:"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"1. He or she speaks only in very broad generalities. “They say ...” “Everybodythinks...” “Everyone knows...” and such expressions are in continual use, particularly whenimparting rumor. When asked, “Who is everybody . . .” it normally turns out to be one sourceand from this source the anti-social person has manufactured what he or she pretends is thewhole opinion of the whole society.This is natural to them since to them all society is a large hostile generality, against theanti-social in particular.2. Such a person deals mainly in bad news, critical or hostile remarks, invalidation andgeneral suppression.“Gossip” or “harbinger of evil tidings” or “rumormonger” once described such persons.It is notable that there is no good news or complimentary remark passed on by such aperson.3. The anti-social personality alters, to worsen, communication when he or she relaysa message or news. Good news is stopped and only bad news, often embellished, is passedalong.Such a person also pretends to pass on “bad news” which is in actual fact invented.4. A characteristic, and one of the sad things about an anti-social personality, is that itdoes not respond to treatment or reform or psychotherapy.5. Surrounding such a personality we find cowed or ill associates or friends who,when not driven actually insane, are yet behaving in a crippled manner in life, failing, notsucceeding.Such people make trouble for others.When treated or educated, the near associate of the anti-social personality has no stabilityof gain but promptly relapses or loses his advantages of knowledge, being under thesuppressive influence of the other.Physically treated, such associates commonly do not recover in the expected time butworsen and have poor convalescences.It is quite useless to treat or help or train such persons so long as they remain under theinfluence of the anti-social connection.The largest number of insane are insane because of such anti-social connections and donot recover easily for the same reason.Unjustly we seldom see the anti-social personality actually in an institution. Only his“friends” and family are there.6. The anti-social personality habitually selects the wrong target.If a tyre is flat from driving over nails, he or she curses a companion or a non-causativesource of the trouble. If the radio next door is too loud, he or she kicks the cat.If A is the obvious cause, the anti-social personality inevitably blames B, or C or D.7. The anti-social cannot finish a cycle of action.Such become surrounded with incomplete projects."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"8. Many anti-social persons will freely confess to the most alarming crimes whenforced to do so, but will have no faintest sense of responsibility for them.Their actions have little or nothing to do with their own volition. Things “just happened”.They have no sense of correct causation and particularly cannot feel any sense of remorseor shame therefore.9. The anti-social personality supports only destructive groups and rages against andattacks any constructive or betterment group.10. This type of personality approves only of destructive actions and fights againstconstructive or helpful actions or activities.The artist in particular is often found as a magnet for persons with anti-social personalitieswho see in his art something which must be destroyed and covertly, “as a friend”, proceed totry.11. Helping others is an activity which drives the anti-social personality nearly berserk.Activities, however, which destroy in the name of help are closely supported.12. The anti-social personality has a bad sense of property and conceives that the ideathat anyone owns anything is a pretense made up to fool people. Nothing is ever really owned.THE BASIC REASONThe basic reason the anti-social personality behaves as he or she does lies in a hiddenterror of others.To such a person every other being is an enemy, an enemy to be covertly or overtlydestroyed.The fixation is that survival itself depends on “keeping others down” or “keeping peopleignorant”.If anyone were to promise to make others stronger or brighter, the anti-social personalitysuffers the utmost agony of personal danger.They reason that if they are in this much trouble with people around them weak or stupid,they would perish should anyone become strong or bright.Such a person has no trust to a point of terror. This is usually masked and unrevealed.When such a personality goes insane the world is full of Martians or the FBI and eachperson met is really a Martian or FBI agent.But the bulk of such people exhibit no outward signs of insanity. They appear quiterational. They can be very convincing.However, the list given above consists of things which such a personality cannot detect inhimself or herself. This is so true that if you thought you found yourself in one of the above,you most certainly are not anti-social. Self-criticism is a luxury the anti-social cannot afford.They must be RIGHT because they are in continual danger in their own estimation. If youproved one WRONG, you might even send him or her into a severe illness.Only the sane, well-balanced person tries to correct his conduct."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"RELIEFIf you were to weed out of your past by proper search and discovery those anti-socialpersons you have known and if you then disconnected, you might experience great relief.Similarly, if society were to recognize this personality type as a sick being as they nowisolate people with smallpox, both social and economic recoveries could occur.Things are not likely to get much better so long as 20% of the population is permitted todominate and injure the lives and enterprise of the remaining 80%.As majority rule is the political manner of the day, so should majority sanity express itselfin our daily lives without the interference and destruction of the socially unwell.The pity of it is, they will not permit themselves to be helped and would not respond totreatment if help were attempted.An understanding and ability to recognize such personalities could bring a major changein society and our lives.THE SOCIAL PERSONALITYMan in his anxieties is prone to witch hunts.All one has to do is designate “people wearing black caps” as the villains and one can starta slaughter of people in black caps.This characteristic makes it very easy for the anti-social personality to bring about achaotic or dangerous environment.Man is not naturally brave or calm in his human state. And he is not necessarilyvillainous.Even the anti-social personality, in his warped way, is quite certain that he is acting forthe best and commonly sees himself as the only good person around, doing all for the good ofeveryone—the only flaw in his reasoning being that if one kills everyone else, none are left tobe protected from the imagined evils. His conduct in his environment and toward his fellows isthe only method of detecting either the antisocial or the social personalities. Their motives forself are similar—self-preservation and survival. They simply go about achieving these indifferent ways.Thus, as Man is naturally neither calm nor brave, anyone to some degree tends to be alertto dangerous persons and hence, witch hunts can begin.It is therefore even more important to identify the social personality than the anti-socialpersonality. One then avoids shooting the innocent out of mere prejudice or dislike or becauseof some momentary misconduct.The social personality can be defined most easily by comparison with his opposite, theanti-social personality.This differentiation is easily done and no test should ever be constructed which isolatesonly the anti-social. On the same test must appear the upper as well as lower ranges of Man’sactions.A test that declares only anti-social personalities without also being able to identify thesocial personality would be itself a suppressive test. It would be like answering “Yes” or “No”"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"to the question “Do you still beat your wife?” Anyone who took it could be found guilty. Whilethis mechanism might have suited the times of the Inquisition, it would not suit modern needs.As the society runs, prospers and lives solely through the efforts of social personalities,one must know them as they, not the anti-social, are the worthwhile people. These are thepeople who must have rights and freedom. Attention is given to the antisocial solely to protectand assist the social personalities in the society.All majority rules, civilizing intentions and even the human race will fail unless one canidentify and thwart the anti-social personalities and help and forward the social personalities inthe society. For the very word “society” implies social conduct and without it there is nosociety at all, only a barbarism with all men, good or bad, at risk.The frailty of showing how the harmful people can be known is that these then apply thecharacteristics to decent people to get them hunted down and eradicated.The swan song of every great civilization is the tune played by arrows, axes or bulletsused by the anti-social to slay the last decent men.Government is only dangerous when it can be employed by and for anti-socialpersonalities. The end result is the eradication of all social personalities and the resultantcollapse of Egypt, Babylon, Rome, Russia or the West.You will note in the characteristics of the anti-social personality that intelligence is not aclue to the anti-social. They are bright or stupid or average. Thus those who are extremelyintelligent can rise to considerable, even head-of-state heights.Importance and ability or wish to rise above others are likewise not indexes to the anti-social. When they do become important or rise they are, however, rather visible by the broadconsequences of their acts. But they are as likely to be unimportant people or hold very lowlystations and wish for nothing better.Thus it is the twelve given characteristics alone which identify the anti-social personality.And these same twelve reversed are the sole criteria of the social personality if one wishes to betruthful about them.The identification or labelling of an anti-social personality cannot be done honestly andaccurately unless one also, in the same examination of the person, reviews the positive side ofhis life.All persons under stress can react with momentary flashes of anti-social conduct. Thisdoes not make them anti-social personalities.The true anti-social person has a majority of anti-social characteristics.The social personality has a majority of social characteristics.Thus one must examine the good with the bad before one can truly label the anti-social orthe social.In reviewing such matters, very broad testimony and evidence are best. One or twoisolated instances determine nothing. One should search all twelve social and all twelve anti-social characteristics and decide on the basis of actual evidence, not opinion.The twelve primary characteristics of the social personality are as follows:1. The social personality is specific in relating circumstances. “Joe Jones said...” “TheStar Newspaper reported...” and gives sources of data where important or possible."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"He may use the generality of “they” or “people” but seldom in connection with attributingstatements or opinions of an alarming nature.2. The social personality is eager to relay good news and reluctant to relay bad.He may not even bother to pass along criticism when it doesn’t matter.He is more interested in making another feel liked or wanted than disliked by others andtends to err toward reassurance rather than toward criticism.3. A social personality passes communication without much alteration and if deletinganything tends to delete injurious matters.He does not like to hurt people’s feelings. He sometimes errs in holding back bad newsor orders which seem critical or harsh.4. Treatment, reform and psychotherapy particularly of a mild nature work very wellon the social personality.Whereas anti-social people sometimes promise to reform, they do not. Only the socialpersonality can change or improve easily.It is often enough to point out unwanted conduct to a social personality to completely alterit for the better.Criminal codes and violent punishment are not needed to regulate social personalities.5. The friends and associates of a social personality tend to be well, happy and ofgood morale.A truly social personality quite often produces betterment in health or fortune by his merepresence on the scene.At the very least he does not reduce the existing levels of health or morale in hisassociates.When ill, the social personality heals or recovers in an expected manner, and is foundopen to successful treatment.6. The social personality tends to select correct targets for correction. He fixes the tyrethat is flat rather than attack the windscreen. In the mechanical arts he can therefore repairthings and make them work.7. Cycles of action begun are ordinarily completed by the social personality, ifpossible.8. The social personality is ashamed of his misdeeds and reluctant to confess them. Hetakes responsibility for his errors.9. The social personality supports constructive groups and tends to protest or resistdestructive groups.10. Destructive actions are protested by the social personality. He assists constructive orhelpful actions.11. The social personality helps others and actively resists acts which harm others."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"12. Property is property of someone to the social personality and its theft or misuse isprevented or frowned upon.THE BASIC MOTIVATIONThe social personality naturally operates on the basis of the greatest good.He is not haunted by imagined enemies but he does recognize real enemies when theyexist.The social personality wants to survive and wants others to survive, whereas the anti-social personality really and covertly wants others to succumb.Basically the social personality wants others to be happy and do well, whereas the anti-social personality is very clever in making others do very badly indeed.A basic clue to the social personality is not really his successes but his motivations. Thesocial personality when successful is often a target for the anti-social and by this reason he mayfail. But his intentions included others in his success, whereas the anti-social only appreciatethe doom of others.Unless we can detect the social personality and hold him safe from undue restraint anddetect also the anti-social and restrain him, our society will go on suffering from insanity,criminality and war, and Man and civilization will not endure.Of all our technical skills, such differentiation ranks the highest since, failing, no otherskill can continue, as the base on which it operates—civilization—will not be here to continueit.Do not smash the social personality—and do not fail to render powerless the anti-social intheir efforts to harm the rest of us.Just because a man rises above his fellows or takes an important part does not make himan anti-social personality. Just because a man can control or dominate others does not makehim an anti-social personality.It is his motives in doing so and the consequences of his acts which distinguish the anti-social from the social.Unless we realize and apply the true characteristics of the two types of personality, wewill continue to live in a quandary of who our enemies are and, in doing so, victimize ourfriends.All men have committed acts of violence or omission for which they could be censured.In all Mankind there is not one single perfect human being.But there are those who try to do right and those who specialize in wrong and upon thesefacts and characteristics you can know them.LRH:lb-r.rd.jh L.

The student sets up the E-Meter and worksheetsexactly as in a session - as follows:1. Set up E-Meter as for E-Meter drills.2. Set up shield (to prevent TA and admin being seen by PC - doll).3. Have extra pens under the E-Meter.4. Have C/S face down between the bottom of the E-Meter and the table.5.

In the chairopposite the Auditor is a doll, as the PC. Coach sits beside doll and is the bullbaiter and givesanswers as PC, not about his own case.TRAINING STRESS: The drill is the same as for auditing in that the “PC” Coach bullbaits thestudent Auditor using “fruit” answers during the session in an attempt to throw the student of asession. Where necessary, the Coach squeezes the cans to simulate reads. He still using “fruit”answers (six apples, blue pears) when asked to speak.The PC bullbaiter can throw in situations, originate troubles or gains, be tricky, etc . Buthe must never lose sight of HCOB 24 May 1968, “Coaching”, especially the second paragraph,“Coach with reality”.Once the Coach throws out a situation, etc., he must allow the student Auditor to carry itout, and handle the situation before the Coach calls a new situation.Stress is on training the Student Auditor to have his TRs 0-4 IN on the bullbaiter.The Coach (bullbaiter) does the “Start”, flunking or “That’s it”. Flunks are given for anyimproper commands, procedure, comm lags, break in TRs or improper sessionEach Drill is to be done thoroughly building up the speed of Auditor commands andactions (“It’s the number of auditing commands per unit of auditing time which make gains in asession.” LRH)The Drill is passed when the student can do the Drill flawlessly with excellent TRs 0-4,correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion.These are the Drills that train the student Auditor to handle all the elements in a session, tobe exact and be real.ED-1 HOW TO GET A PC UNBULLBAITEDED-1HOW TO GET A PC UNBULLBAITEDREF: HCOB 5 March 1971 C/S Series 25 The Fantastic New HGC Line."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"PURPOSE: To teach the student Auditor how to get a PC.

When the Coach calls off situations, for example, the D of P says hedoesn’t have any PCs. Or, all PCs on lines need actions you cannot audit, etc. How will youget a PC? Keep throwing situations at the student Auditor until you are confident he could get aPC no matter what barriers existed. Flunks are given for any mishandling, or failing tosatisfactorily obtain a PC. The student is passed when he knows how to get a PC.STEPS:1. Inform the D of P that a PC is needed.2. Hound the D of P to assign you a PC, if he hasn’t.3. Independently go through current PC folders looking for any ready for an action youcan do, get their Auditor to complete them to where you can audit them, fast.4. Hound the D of P if he won’t prepare you a PC.5. Study PC folders of PCs currently not on lines with your Org. Also study the person’sCF folder, find out from the study:A. What hasn’t been handled.B. What goals he has had for processing.C. What the person’s own statement is of what is wrong with him or what he wantshandled or improved.D. What person came into Dianetics/Scientology for. (Above are usually liberaly statedthrough-out PC and CF file but almost always on first White form or letter Reg.questionnaire.)Get in comm with the person through a letter and get him in to see the Registrar.PC must sign up with the Registrar and pay the Cashier for processing.

Take a copy of HCOB 25 Sept 71 Rev. 15 Nov 71, Tone Scale in Full.2. Starting with bottom of the scale and going up towards the top - clear each word of theTone Scale per Method 8 HCOB.PART 2 - EXAMPLES:1. The student Auditor tells his twin coach examples of actions that would indicate aperson’s tone level.

They are never recopied.The Auditor should always read over his W/sheets before turning in the folder to the CaseSupervisor and if any words or letters are missing or cannot be read, they should be put in inblock print, in red.Example:This can be overdone, to the extent that it is almost sarcasm. At the most it should just runinto one or two corrections to a page. If the Auditor is having to correct the page more than thathe should learn how to write rapidly and legibly. See HCOB 3 Nov 71, C/S Series 66,“Auditor’s Worksheets”, which also appears as Auditor Admin Series 15 and comes next inthis series.NECESSITY OF WORKSHEETSIt is a CRIME to give any session without making an Auditor’s Report (i.e. actual W/Staken at that time) or to copy the original W/sheets after the session and submit a copy insteadof the real reports.Assist Reports that use only Contact or Touch Assist are written after the session and sentto HGC Admin to be filed in the pc folder. The pc is sent to the Examiner after an assist.References: HCO P/L 19 Nov 65 “Auditing Reports” HCO B 7 May 69 “Summary of How to Write an Auditor’s Report” Tape 12 June 71 “Welcome to the Flag Intern Course” HCO B 3 Nov 71 C/S Series 66, “Auditor’s Worksheets” Tape 7 April 72 Exp Dn Tape 3, “Auditor Administration”  Training & Services BurRevised & Reissued as BTBby Flag Mission 1234  I/C: CPO Andrea Lewis  2nd: Molly HarlowAuthorized by AVUfor theBOARDS OF DIRECTORSof theCHURCHES OF SCIENTOLOGYBDCS:HE:AL:MH:MM:mh.rd.jhCopyright © 1972, 1974by L.

Major Out Tech in session which could cause Pc trouble.7. Flunked Declare? accompanied by a BER.When a Red Tag Exam occurs the Examiner clips a red tag to the Exam Form.

If he ishaving 75 hours now, this Assessment Sheet is done at the beginning of the 75 hours. If thepreclear comes back for a further 25 hours one week later, another Assessment Sheet iscompleted by the Auditor processing him whether it is the same Auditor or not. The reason forthis is the preclear changes, his memory improves, and things can have happened in that oneweek he has not processed.Is this part of the Preclear’s Auditing timeYes, it is. The questions asked are to a degree auditing because the Auditor is asking thepreclear to look and to recall.Purpose of Preclear Assessment SheetThe purpose of this form is to establish Auditor control over the preclear, to betteracquaint the Auditor with his preclear, and to provide essential information required.To Whom is the Preclear Assessment Sheet RoutedThis Sheet is routed to the Director of Processing as soon as possible, at the firstsession break if the Auditor can do so. It must be routed at least by the end of the auditing day.After the Director of Processing reviews the Sheet, it is returned to the Auditor for keeping inhis folder on the preclear.Neatness of Preclear Assessment SheetIf you cannot write plainly and neatly, print all the data required.

The auditing skill of any student remains only as good as he can do his TRs.2. Flubs in TRs are the basis of all confusion in subsequent efforts to audit.3. If the TRs are not well learned early in Scientology training courses, THE BALANCE OFTHE COURSE WILL FAIL AND SUPERVISORS AT UPPER LEVELS WILL BETEACHING NOT THEIR SUBJECTS BUT TRS.4. Almost all confusions on Meter, Model Sessions and Scientology or Dianetic processesstem directly from inability to do the TRs.5. A student who has not mastered his TRs will not master anything further.6. Scientology or Dianetic processes will not function in the presence of bad TRs. Thepreclear is already being overwhelmed by process velocity and cannot bear up to TR flubswithout ARC breaks.Academies were tough on TRs up to 1958 and have since tended to soften. CommCourses are not a tea party.These TRs given here should be put in use at once in all auditor training, in Academy andHGC and in the future should never be relaxed.Public courses on TRs are NOT “softened” because they are for the Public.

Anything added to BEING THERE is sharply flunkedby the coach. Twitches, blinks, sighs, fidgets, anything except just being there is promptlyflunked, with the reason why.PATTER: Student coughs.

It is repeated until the coach is satisfied it arrived where heis.POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart.TRAINING STRESS: The command goes from the book to the student and, as his own, tothe coach. It must not go from book to coach. It must sound natural not artificial. Diction andelocution have no part in it. Loudness may have.The coach must have received the command (or question) clearly and have understood it beforehe says “Good”.PATTER: The coach says “Start”, says “Good” without a new start if the command isreceived, or says “Flunk” if the command is not received. “Start” is not used again. “That’s it”"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"is used to terminate for a discussion or to end the activity.

The coach reads lines from “Alice in Wonderland” omitting “he saids” and thestudent thoroughly acknowledges them. The coach repeats any line he feels was not trulyacknowledged.POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other at a comfortable distance apart.TRAINING STRESS: Teach student to acknowledge exactly what was said so preclear knowsit was heard. Ask student from time to time what was said. Curb over and underacknowledgement. Let student do anything at first to get acknowledgement across, then evenhim out. Teach him that an acknowledgement is a stop, not beginning of a new cycle ofcommunication or an encouragement to the preclear to go on.To teach further that one can fail to get an acknowledgement across or can fail to stop a pc withan acknowledgement or can take a pc’s head off with an acknowledgement.PATTER: The coach says “Start”, reads a line and says “Flunk” every time the coach feelsthere has been an improper acknowledgement. The coach repeats the same line each time thecoach says “Flunk”. “That’s it” may be used to terminate for discussion or terminate thesession. “Start” must be used to begin a new coaching after a “That’s it”.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to teach new studentsthat an acknowledgement ends a communication cycle and a period of time, that a newcommand begins a new period of time. Revised 1961 by L. Ron Hubbard.NUMBER: TR 3 REVISED 1961NAME: Duplicative Question.PURPOSE: To teach a student to duplicate without variation an auditing question, each timenewly, in its own unit of time, not as a blur with other questions, and to acknowledge it. Toteach that one never asks a second question until he has received an answer to the one asked.COMMANDS: “Do fish swim?” or “Do birds fly?”POSITION: Student and coach seated a comfortable distance apart.TRAINING STRESS: One question and student acknowledgement of its answer in one unitof time which is then finished. To keep student from straying into variations of command.Even though the same question is asked, it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyonebefore."},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The student must learn to give a command and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in oneunit of time.The student is flunked if he or she fails to get an answer to the question asked, if he or she failsto repeat the exact questions, if he or she Q and As with excursions taken by the coach.PATTER: The coach uses “Start” and “That’s it”, as in earlier TRs. The coach is not boundafter starting to answer the student’s question but may comm lag or give a commenting typeanswer to throw the student off. Often the coach should answer.Somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student in to a Q and A or upset the student.Example:Student: “Do fish swim?” Coach: “Yes.” Student: “Good . “ Student: “Do fish swim?” Coach:“Aren’t you hungry?” Student: “Yes.” Coach: “Flunk.”When the question is not answered, the student must say, gently, “I’ll repeat the auditingquestion,” and do so until he gets an answer. Anything except commands, acknowledgementand, as needed, the repeat statement, is flunked. Unnecessary use of the repeat statement isflunked. A poor command is flunked. A poor acknowledgement is flunked. A Q and A isflunked (as in example). Student misemotion or confusion is flunked. Student failure to utterthe next command without a long comm lag is flunked. A choppy or prematureacknowledgement is flunked. Lack of an acknowledgement (or with a distinct comm lag) isflunked. Any words from the coach except an answer to the question, “Start”, “Flunk”,“Good” or “That’s it”, should have no influence on the student except to get him to give arepeat statement and the command again. By repeat statement is meant, “I’ll repeat the auditingcommand.”“Start”, “Flunk”, “Good” and “That’s it” may not be used to fluster or trap the student. Anyother statement under the sun may be. The coach may try to leave his chair in this TR. If hesucceeds it is a flunk. The coach should not use introverted statements such as “I just had acognition.” “Coach divertive” statements should all concern the student, and should bedesigned to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of whatthe student is doing. The student’s job is to keep a session going in spite of anything, usingonly command, the repeat statement or the acknowledgement. The student may use his or herhands to prevent a “Blow” (leaving) of the coach. If the student does anything else than theabove, it is a flunk and the coach must say so.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to overcome variationsand sudden changes in sessions. Revised 1961 by L. Ron Hubbard. The old TR has a commbridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in Model Session and is nolonger needed at this level. Auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered. ThisTR was redesigned to improve that frailty.NUMBER: TR 4 REVISED 1961NAME: Preclear Originations.PURPOSE: To teach the student not to be tongue-tied or startled or thrown off session byoriginations of preclear and to maintain ARC with preclear throughout an origination.COMMANDS: The student runs “Do fish swim?” or “Do birds fly?” on coach. Coachanswers but now and then makes startling comments from a prepared list given by Supervisor.Student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach.POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other at a comfortable distance apart."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"TRAINING STRESS: The student is taught to hear origination and do three things. 1.Understand it; 2. Acknowledge it; and 3. Return preclear to session. If the coach feelsabruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he corrects the student intobetter handling.PATTER: All originations concern the coach, his ideas, reactions or difficulties, none concernthe auditor. Otherwise the patter is the same as in earlier TRs. The student’s patter is governedby: 1 . Clarifying and understanding the origin. 2. Acknowledging the origin. 3. Giving therepeat statement “I’ll repeat the auditing command,” and then giving it. Anything else is aflunk.The auditor must be taught to prevent ARC breaks and differentiate between a vital problem thatconcerns the pc and a mere effort to blow session. (TR 3 Revised.) Flunks are given if thestudent does more than 1. Understand; 2. Acknowledge; 3. Return pc to session.Coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on TR 3. Student’s failure to differentiatebetween these (by trying to handle them) and coach’s remarks about self as “pc” is a flunk.Student’s failure to persist is always a flunk in any TR but here more so. Coach should notalways read from list to originate, and not always look at student when about to comment. ByOriginate is meant a statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case. ByComment is meant a statement or remark aimed only at student or room. Originations arehandled, Comments are disregarded by the student.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to teach auditors to stayin session when preclear dives out. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditormore about handling origins and preventing ARC breaks.As TR 5 is also part of the CCHs it can be disregarded in the Comm Course TRs despite itsappearance on earlier lists for students and staff auditors.TRAINING NOTEIt is better to go through these TRs several times getting tougher each time than to hang on oneTR forever or to be so tough at start student goes into a decline.L.

It gets to “3.1” by his meter. So he gets the pc totalk a bit more to get the TA between 2 and 3 and F/N. The TA suddenly rises to 3.8.Pc and Auditor go desperate. What has happened is that the TA was a false read. It wasreally reading 2.9 and F/Ning but for reasons given below it read “3.1”. Thus the auditoroverran the F/N and by keeping on invalidated the release, pulled the pc’s attention out ofsession and demanded more than the pc had to give.Example: Auditor 2 way communicating with pc to get the TA up from “1.8”. The TAsuddenly sinks to 1.6, pc goes into apathy.What happened was a missed F/N. For reasons covered below the TA at 1.8 was falseand was really at 2.1 and F/Ning.Example: Pc being asked for an earlier similar incident because TA is at “4.0”. Pc can’tget one, gets desperate, TA goes to 5.0.For reasons given below the TA was at 3.0 but was reading falsely at “4.0”.Some cases get upset at the very idea of F/N when these mistakes are made.More than one case has missed all his wins for a year because of a false TA.So it is very important to know how a false TA comes about and how to avoid it.A properly set up meter with cans (electrodes) fitted to a pc who is holding them properlyIS ALWAYS CORRECT.However, totally false Tone Arm readings can exist and an auditor must know how thesecome about.TRIMA meter can be improperly trimmed (not set at 2.0 with the trim knob) and can give a falseTA position."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Further, when a meter is not left on a minute or two before trimming, it can drift in thesession and give a slightly false TA.The trim can be quietly checked in mid-session by snapping out the jack where the cordgoes into the box and putting the TA on 2, seeing if the needle is now on SET. If not, the trimknob can be moved to adjust it. The jack is quietly slipped back in. All without distracting thepc.DISCHARGEDA cadmium cell meter discharges very suddenly when it does go flat.In mid-session the meter can run out of battery. The TA will cease to act well and may govery false.The remedy is to keep a meter charged at least one hour for every 10 of auditing for 240AC volt charging current, or 2 hours for every 10 of auditing on a 110 AC volt chargingcurrent.A meter lasts much longer than this in practice but the above is very safe.Before each session snap the knob over to TEST. The needle should hit hard on the rightside of the face. It can even bounce. This guarantees lots of charge in the battery and no chanceof a meter going flat in session.If the needle doesn’t snap to the right hard or if it doesn’t quite get there on TEST, thenthat meter will go flat in mid-session and give false TA and no reads or TA on hot subjects.ONE HAND ELECTRODEA single hand electrode with two terminals separated by a rubber works. BUT it alwaysgives a falsely high TA.A Solo auditor who does not know this can get a release point and go half madwondering why he is F/Ning at 4.0!The answer is to make a “single hand” electrode out of two small cans (about 33 inchesby 21/8 inches or 91/2 cm by 51/2 cm) (or even smaller for a very small-handed pc). Glue athin circle of foam rubber solidly to the bottom of one can so it reaches out slightly around thebottom. (Don’t glue it up the sides.)Put the alligator jaw clips one to each can. Now put the can bottoms together and holdthem in one hand. Mark the TA (1)—meaning one hand (such as 3.75 (1) ). Now take the cansone in each hand and mark the TA (2)—meaning two hands (such as 3.0Audit with them in one hand. Keep your worksheet with (1) marks (such as 3.5 (1) ).Check at start and middle and end by taking a can in each hand and putting down the 2 can read(such as 2.5 (2) ).It is too much trouble to totally change cans and the distraction can change the TA read.This two small can arrangement is not quite accurate. It gives a lower TA than big cans.But the difference is slight. It can scare you with a 1.9 when trim is 2.0 and real TA is 2.0. Ifthis happens check with big cans.(As an added tip a solo auditor usually keeps the back of his hand on his leg while soloauditing. The small 71/2 volt current gives a tingle to the leg that is distracting when one’s hand"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"is moist. Put a piece of foam rubber in a plastic sack. Lay the sack on the leg, put your hand onthis pad. It insulates the area and is very comfortable.)MOIST HANDSWhen a pc’s hands sweat a lot you will get a low TA.Contrary to 19th Century superstition the meter does not work on sweat. Very sweatyhands as found on nervous persons give a false TA. It goes low.Many “low TA cases” are just sweaty hand cases.Paper handkerchiefs (Kleenex) are a standard item for an auditing room—for griefcharges and burning eyes, etc. These should be available.If the TA is low, check if the pc’s hands are wet. If so, have him wipe them and get anew read. It is usually found that the 1.6 was really 2.0. Or the 1.6 was really 1.8 and the trimwas 1.8 = 2.0.Have the pc wipe hands, check and correct trim before you by-pass all a “low TA’s”F/Ns!TAs can go low. Invalidation of the pc, lousy TRs can drive one low. If so the TA comesback up on repair.But don’t brand a case a low TA case until you make sure his hands are dried and themeter trimmed.Also, very small cans or cans too small for the pc can give a slightly low reading.DRY HANDSSome pcs have extremely dry hands, usually from industrial chemicals such as chlorine indishwater or skin scale.This can give a wildly high TA.The pc can be worried to death with high TA repairs when in fact he just doesn’t havecontact with the electrode.Metal foot plates connected to the meter and the pc barefooted in session will usuallyhandle.A quick test is have the pc put the cans under his armpits and you’ll see if it’s hiscalloused or chemically dried-out hands.ARTHRITIC HANDSA rare pc is so crippled with arthritis that he doesn’t make contact fully with the cans.This gives a high TA.Use foot plates or wide wrist straps and you’ll get a right read."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"SLACK GRIPSometimes a rare pc lets his hands go slack on the cans, particularly if they are the wrongsize cans, too big.This gives a mysterious “high TA”. It is false. The TA will come down only to 3.2 andF/N and of course an overrun then really gives a high TA. And the pc goes a bit frantic andbegins to believe things don’t erase or release.Keep the pc’s hands in sight. Check the pc’s grip. Get smaller cans.CAN SIZEThe most common fault is wrong can size.For a normal or large-handed pc the can size is about 4 7/8 inches by 2 5/8 inches or121/2 cm by 7 cm. This can be altered as big as 41/2 inches by 3 inches diameter or 11 cm by 8cm. This is Standard.This can is too large for people with small hands. These should use a can 33/4 inches by2 1/8 inches or 9 cm by 5 cm diameter or thereabouts.A small child would be lost even with that can. So a small 35 mm film can could be used.This is 2 inches long by 1 3/16 inches diameter or 5 cm by 3 cm. This works but watch it asthese cans are aluminum. They do work but test for true read with a slightly larger can and thentrim to adjust for the aluminum if any different.Cans of course should be STEEL with a thin tin plating. Regular soup cans.Can size to match the pc avoids slack can grip or tiring the hands into going slack, givingthe auditor 3.2 F/Ns and trouble.COLD PCA pc who is too cold sometimes has a falsely high TA.Wrap him in a blanket or get a warmer auditing room.The auditing environment is the responsibility of the auditor.LATE AT NIGHTBetween 2 and 3 AM or late at night a pc’s TA may be very high. The time depends onwhen he sleeps usually.This TA will be found normal in regular hours.RINGSRings on the pc’s hands must always be removed. They don’t influence TA but they givea false Rockslam.FLOATING TA"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Many an auditor before now has gone a bit mad trying to handle a floating TA. They arenot very common and are startling.What happens is the pc is so released the needle can’t be gotten onto the dial. The needleis swinging wider than the meter dial both ways from center and appears to lay first on one sidethen the other. The TA can’t be moved fast enough to keep the extreme floating needle on thedial.This gives a false TA of sorts as it can’t be read.Some auditors seeing it for the first time have even sent the pc out of the room so theycould “adjust” the meter or get another one!Thus the very highest state of release can be invalidated as where is the TA?RUSTY CORRODED CANSYou’d think soup was very expensive the way some auditors hold onto old cans.Corroded cans can falsify TA. Get new ones now and then.TIGHT SHOESAnd then there was the vain lady who wore shoes too small for her feet.She removed them every session. The session went well each time.Then she put on her agonizing shoes and went to the Examiner and the C/Ses andauditors all went mad trying to find out why every Exam had a high TA.Tight shoes.The E-Meter is accurate. It is a lovely instrument.You have to fit the pc to it.Good luck.LRH: nt.rdL. RON HUBBARDCopyright ©1971Founderby L.

Falsified data came from lack of knowledge of the mind. This made its practitionersDISHONEST.We do not and must not follow that fatal road.The technology we have WORKS to definite positive predictable results.Results are obtained if the auditor has honestly studied and understood his materials andhonestly applies them.Falsifying study leads to falsifying meters and this gives bad results on pcs.HONEST use of the materials and the meter gives an honest result.One who does not know his materials and who cannot do his drills then thinks he has tomake a meter cheat.HONEST use of the meter by an HONEST auditor is the route to GOOD RESULTS.LOW TAsA bad practice has arisen to “beat” the low TA."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"This is to have the pc wipe his hands every few minutes to get the TA up above 2.0.Not only does this distract the pc and yank him out of session, but it is by inferenceputting his attention on the meter, a thing a good auditor does NOT do in a formal session. Thepc’s attention must be on his own case in a session, not on the meter or his hands.An answer to low TA because of wet hands is foot plates.But the best answer is to get the pc up scale so he doesn’t have perspiring hands.Overwhelming TRs is the commonest reason for low TAs. Not all the hand wiping in theworld will cure poor TRs.Some auditors “spook” (leap off the road like a horse frightened by something blowingalong) at the very thought of high or low TAs. This is because they haven’t got the TRs tohandle a low TA nor the tech to handle a high one.Making a meter read falsely low with cream or falsely high with talcum powder or wipinghands continually will not handle the pc’s CASE.That is what the auditor is there to do, not make his session look good!The funniest one I have ever heard was a Solo auditor who had high TA trouble. So heused to fill up a bathtub with scalding water, fill the bathroom full of clouds of steam and thensit in the bath, holding onto his electrodes “Solo auditing”.It gave him a lower TA but it sure didn’t give him any case result.We maybe ought to have a contest as to who can come up with the most comical actualinstances of falsifying meter reads.One “auditor” “solved it” by just calling F/Ns whenever she got tired of the pc regardlessof TA position. After a year or more of this she saw the light and put herself in Ethics.The funny part is that her co-auditor had been doing the same thing on her!HONEST TA IS THE BEST POLICY.  L.

Since no research had been done they were censured.Research has now been done on this matter of dry and wet hands.Apparently when a person has taken certain medicines or chemicals, or uses detergentsoaps or is in contact with certain chemicals (such as those in some furniture polishes) theordinary skin oils vanish. These oils are needed to make an electrical contact with the cans.When these oils are absent, there is no adequate electrical contact and the “TA is High”.When a person is deficient in certain minerals or vitamins such as magnesium or Bcomplex, his hands can be excessively wet.Either of these two conditions in hands or feet can produce an incorrect TA position.The dry condition produces a false high TA.The overly wet condition produces a false low TA.The TA depends on normally moist hands. This does not mean the meter works on“sweat”. It does mean the meter works only when there is a correct electrical contact.Too much and too greasy hand cream could produce too low a TA.Too much powder or drier could produce too high a TA.Therefore one must not go to extremes.DRY HANDSThe excessively “dry” hand is seen as shiny or polished looking. It feels very dry.The correct treatment is to use a “vanishing cream” (obtainable from any cosmetics store)not a greasy hand cream.The “vanishing cream” is so called because it rubs all the way into the skin and leaves noexcess grease.This restores normal electrical contact."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"There are many such creams. It makes no difference which is used so long as it vanishesinto the skin.It is doubtful if it would have to be applied more than once—at session start—as it lastsfor a long while.This would apply to some footplate cases as well (whose hands are defective or tooheavily calloused).If a cream leaves smears on a can, it is too heavily applied or too little absorbed.Vanishing type cream is usually smeared on, rubbed in and can then be thoroughly wipedoff. The hands (or feet) will usually produce, then, a normal TA and meter response.WET HANDSAnti-perspirants can be applied to too wet hands. There are many brands of these, often apowder or spray.It can be wiped off after application and should work for two or three hours.It can be applied to hands or feet (for footplates).If the TA then goes too high, use vanishing cream on top of it.SUMMARYWhile much work could be done still, the above is enough for a practical result.WARNINGHi TAs and Lo TAs do not widely F/N.

All grades below that are subjectto overrun.Life subjects are subject to overrun before Scientology. The mechanism is this: oneconceived a purpose. He or she succeeded in it, then kept on and overran it. In auditing onehits the purpose and the overrun of it and gets a free needle on it. That doesn’t mean the personwas a release then. It means that the spotting of the purpose and the overrun by auditingproduces a free needle today.It may be necessary to find whole track overruns on some pcs in rehabilitation of grades.If a lot of levels have been run past free needle it may be necessary to take apart the mess like abundle of yarn to get the first free needle. In such a case one rehabs any grade the pc has beenrun on that the pc can remember. One handles this briefly until the pc is happy but notnecessarily to free needle. One then finds another overrun, does the same. One goes on and onlooking for moments the pc felt good about processing at one or another time. If you keep thisup, suddenly you will see a free needle on the pc! Establish what grade it is free on, thenquickly get the needle free on the remaining overrun grades (but not grades pc was never runon). It may be necessary to take into account a whole track overrun of a purpose or even thepurpose to get release, clear or OT.It is all very quick, deft auditing, very much on procedure using standard rehab tech—butno repetitive grind.--------------You won’t see a freeing up of a needle unless you set your sensitivity on a Mark V to astiff needle for the pc. You can increase sensitivity or decrease it as the pc progresses but bysetting the sensitivity so the needle is pretty still and stiff you will see easily a freeing up of theneedle and then a free needle. Using sensitivity 128 will obscure every free needle as the needleis too loose already for the auditor to see any change.--------------Pcs are most apt to go free needle after a big cog. So don’t be so engrossed in looking atthe pc during cognitions. Keep an eye on that needle. And if it goes free, don’t ask anythingelse. Just gently give the pc a “That’s it” and without a chop of comm, ease the pc off to“Declare?” in Qual.

It shows in Dianetics that basic on that chain and flow has beenerased, and in Scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run. A new flowor a new process can be embarked upon, of course, when the END PHENOMENA of theprevious process is attained.DIANETICSFloating needles are only ONE FOURTH OF THE END PHENOMENA in all Dianeticauditing.Any Dianetic auditing below Power has FOUR DEFINITE REACTIONS IN THE PCWHICH SHOW THE PROCESS IS ENDED.1. Floating needle.2. Cognition.3. Very good indicators (pc happy).4. Erasure of the final picture audited.Auditors get panicky about overrun. If you go past the End Phenomena the F/N will packup (cease) and the TA will rise.BUT that’s if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena, not past a floating needle.If you watch a needle with care and say nothing but your R3R commands, as it begins tofloat you will find:1. It starts to float narrowly.2. The pc cognites (What do you know—so that’s . . .) and the float widens.3. Very good indicators come in. And the float gets almost full dial, and4. The picture, if you inquired, has erased and the needle goes full dial.That is the full End Phenomena of Dianetics.If the auditor sees a float start, as in 1, and says, “I would like to indicate to you yourneedle is floating,” he can upset the pc’s bank."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"There is still charge. The pc has not been permitted to cognite. VGIs surely won’t appearand a piece of the picture is left.By being impetuous and fearful of overrun, or just being in a hurry, the auditor’spremature (too soon) indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pc’s end phenomena.SCIENTOLOGYAll this also applies to Scientology auditing.And all Scientology processes below Power have the same end phenomena.The 0 to IV Scientology End Phenomena are:A. Floating needle.B. Cognition.C. Very good indicators.D. Release.The pc goes through these four steps without fail IF PERMITTED TO DO SO.As Scientology auditing is more delicate than Dianetic auditing, an overrun (F/N vanishedand TA rising, requiring “rehab”) can occur more rapidly. Thus the auditor has to be morealert. But this is no excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena.The same cycle of F/N will occur if the pc is given a chance. On A you get a beginningF/N, on B slightly wider, on C wider still and on D the needle really is floating and widely.“I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating” can be a chop. Also it’s a falsereport if it isn’t widely floating and will keep floating.Pcs who leave session F/N and arrive at Examiner without F/N, or who eventually do notcome to session with an F/N have been misaudited. The least visible way is the F/N chop, asdescribed in this session. The most obvious way is to overrun the process. (Running a pc afterhe has exteriorized will also give a high TA at Examiner.)In Dianetics, one more pass through is often required to get 1, 2, 3, 4 End Phenomenaabove.I know it said in the Auditor’s Code not to by-pass an F/N. Perhaps it should be changedto read “A real wide F/N”. Here it’s a question of how wide is an F/N? However, the problemis NOT difficult.I follow this rule—I never jolt or interrupt a pc who is still looking inward. In otherwords, I don’t ever yank his attention over to the auditor. After all, it’s his case we arehandling, not my actions as an auditor.When I see an F/N begin I listen for the pc’s cognition. If it isn’t there, I give the nextcommand due. If it still isn’t there, I give the 2nd command, etc. Then I get the cognition andshut up. The needle floats more widely, VGIs come in, the F/N goes dial wide. The real skill isinvolved in knowing when to say nothing more.Then with the pc all bright, all end phenomena in sight (F/N, Cog, VGIs, Erasure orRelease, depending on whether it’s Dn or Scn), I say, as though agreeing with the pc, “Yourneedle is floating.”DIANETIC ODDITY"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Did you know that you could go through a picture half a dozen times, the F/N gettingwider and wider without the pc cogniting? This is rare but it can happen once in a hundred. Thepicture hasn’t been erased yet. Bits of it seem to keep popping in. Then it erases fully andwow, 2, 3 and 4 occur. This isn’t grinding. It’s waiting for the F/N to broaden to cognition.The pc who complains about F/Ns is really stating the wrong problem. The actualproblem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and themeter a moment too soon.The pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward.Charge is then left in the area. A pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often willbegin to refuse auditing.Despite all this, one still must not overrun and get the TA up. But in Dianetics an erasureleaves nothing to get the TA up with!The Scientology auditor has a harder problem with this, as he can overrun more easily.There is a chance of pulling the bank back in. So the problem is more applicable to Scientologyas a problem than to Dianetics.But ALL auditors must realize that the END PHENOMENA of successful auditing is notjust an F/N but has 3 more requisites. And an auditor can chop these off.The mark of the real VIRTUOSO (master) in auditing is his skilled handling of thefloating needle.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH.jz.ei.rdCopyright © 1970by L.

This also occurred inPower when it was run all in one day). The auditor would attain a bona fide full dial F/N. Thepc was still cogniting, still in a big win. The auditor would “clear the next process command”,he would see an F/N. He would “clear the next process command”, and see an F/N.BUT IT WAS THE SAME F/N!Result was that processes 2 and 3 WERE NEVER RUN ON THE CASE.This is really what is meant by “Quickie Grades”.In 1958 we got real Releases. You could not kill the F/N for days, weeks.Several processes had this effect. Today’s real Clear also goes this way. You couldn’t killthe F/N with an axe.By running a lot of Level Zero processes, for instance, you can get a real swingingunkillable F/N.It not only gets to the Examiner, it comes in at the start of the next day’s session!Now if in one session you ran all of Level Zero and went on up to Level One, you wouldjust be auditing a persistent F/N.

However, on some pcsmaybe that’s good enough. May take him several sessions, each one getting a final session F/Na bit wider. Then he gets an F/N that gets to the Examiner. After that, well audited on acontinuing basis, the F/N lasts longer and longer.One day the pc comes into session with a dial-wide floating swinging F/N and anythingyou say or do does nothing whatever to disturb that F/N.It’s a real Release man. It may last weeks, months, years.Tell him to come back when he feels he needs some auditing and chalk up the remaininghours (if sold by the hour) as undelivered. Or if sold by result, chalk up the result.If the F/N is truly persistent he will have no objections. If it isn’t, he will object.

Misapplication of this definition can result in underrunand overrun processes or actions and the pc snarled up with BPC.TYPES OF EPsIn Power Processing the auditor waits for a specific EP and does not indicate an F/Nuntil he has gotten the specific EP for the process. To miss on this in Power is disastrous, thusPower auditors are drilled and drilled on the handling of Power EPs.In Dianetics, the EP of a chain is erasure, accompanied by an F/N, cognition and goodindicators. You wouldn’t necessarily expect rave indicators on a pc in the middle of an assist,under emotional or physical stress until the full assist was completed though. What you wouldexpect is the chain blown with an F/N. Those two things themselves are good indicators. Thecognition could simply be “the chain blew”.In Scientology, End Phenomena vary with what you’re auditing. An ARC Broken pc onan L-1C will peel off charge and come uptone gradually as each reading line is handled.Sometimes it comes in a spectacular huge cog and VVGIs and dial F/N, but that’s usually aftercharge has been taken off on a gradient. What’s expected is an F/N as that charge beinghandled moves off.In Ruds it’s the same idea. When you’ve got your F/N and that charge has moved off,indicate it. Don’t push the pc on and on for some “EP”. You’ve got it.Now a major grade process will run to F/N, Cog, VGIs and release. You’ll have anability regained. But that’s a grade process on a set up flying pc.F/N ABUSEMistakenly applying the Power EP rule to Ruds will have the pc messed up by overrun. Itinvalidates the pc’s wins and keys the charge back in. The pc will start thinking he hasn’tblown the charge and can’t do anything about it.In 1970 I had to write the HCO B “F/Ns and End Phenomena” to cure auditors ofchopping pc EPs on major actions by indicating F/Ns too soon. This is one type of F/N abusewhich has largely been handled.That bulletin and Power EP handling have been in some instances misapplied in thedirection of overrun. “The pc isn’t getting EP on these chains as there’s no cognition, just ‘it"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"erased’,” is one example. Obviously the C/S didn’t understand the definition of cognition orwhat an EP is. Another example is the pc spots what it is and F/Ns and the auditor carries on,expecting an “EP”.OTs and EPsAn OT is particularly subject to F/N abuse as he can blow things quite rapidly. If theauditor misses the F/N due to too high a sensitivity setting or doesn’t call it as he’s waiting foran “EP”, overrun occurs. It invalidates an OT’s ability to as-is and causes severe upsets.This error can also stem from auditor speed. The auditor, used to auditing lower level pcsor never trained to audit OTs, can’t keep up with the OT and misses his F/Ns or reads.Thus overruns occur and charged areas are bypassed.This could account for those cases who were flying then fell on their heads with the sameproblems that blew back again.REMEDYThe remedy of this problem begins with thoroughly clearing all terms connected withEPs. This is basically Word Clearing Method 6, Key Words.The next action is to get my HCO Bs on the subject of EPs and also related meteringHCO Bs fully understood and starrated. This would be followed by clay demos of various EPsof processes and actions showing the mechanics of the bank and what happens with the pc andmeter.TRs and meter drills on spotting F/Ns would follow, including any needed obnosis drillsand correction of meter position so that the auditor could see the pc, meter and his admin at aglance.Then, the auditor would be gradiently drilled on handling the pc, meter and admin atincreasing rates of speed including recognizing and indicating EPs when they occurred. Whenthe auditor could do all of this smoothly at the high rate of speed of an OT blowing things byinspection without fumbling, the last action would be bullbaited drills like TRs 103 and 104, ona gradient to a level of competence whereby the auditor could handle anything that came up atspeed and do so smoothly.Then you’d really have an OT auditor.

As onehas DONE the lists without F/Ning each item, one now has the mystery of what is wrong?The error is reading items from Ruds or prepared lists cleaned to no read but not carriedto F/N.This action (amongst many such refinements) is what makes Flag auditing so smooth andindeed makes it Flag Auditing.When an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible.Yet it is simplicity itself. If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find anearlier item if something does not release. What has been found as a read on a prepared listwould F/N if it were the basic lock. So if it doesn’t F/N, then there is an earlier (or an earlier oran earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/Ning.So the RULE:NEVER WALK OFF FROM A READING ITEM ON A RUDIMENT OR APREPARED REPAIR LIST BEFORE YOU CARRY IT DOWN (EARLIER SIMILAR) TOAN F/N.Example: ARC Brk reads. Pc says what it is, Auditor does ARCU CDEI. If no F/N,Auditor asks for an earlier similar ARC Brk, gets it, ARCU CDEI, etc until he gets an F/N.Example: PTP reads. Carry it E/S (earlier similar) until a PTP F/Ns.Example: L4B: Has an item been denied you? Reads. Answered. No F/N. Is there anearlier similar denied item? Answered. F/N. Go on to next reading item on the list.Example: GF assessed once through for reads. The next C/S must take every item on itthat read, by 2wc or other process, to an F/N.So there is a much more general rule:EVERY ITEM THAT READS MUST F/N.In Dianetics you get the F/N when you run E/S secondaries or engrams to an erasure,F/N, Cog, VGIs.In Rudiments, every out rud you get a read on is run E/S to F/N."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"On a prepared list you take each read to an F/N or E/S to F/N.On an LX list you run each flow chain to an F/N.On GF you get by whatever process an F/N.On Listing by the Laws of Listing and Nulling, your eventual item listed must F/N.So another rule:EVERY MAJOR AND MINOR ACTION MUST BE CARRIED TO AN F/N.There are NO exceptions.Any exception leaves by-passed charge on the pc.Also, every F/N is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained.You take too soon an F/N (first twitch) you cut the cognition and leave by-passed charge(a withheld cognition).I could take any folder and simply write out the ruds and prepared list reading items andthen audit the pc and carry each one to F/N and correct every list so disclosed and wind up witha very shining, cool calm pc.So “Have reading items been left charged?” would be a key question on a case.Using lists or ruds on high or low TAs that are not meant for high or low TAs will getyou reading items that won’t F/N.So, another rule:NEVER TRY TO FLY RUDS OR DO L1B ON A HIGH OR LOW TA.One can talk the TA down (see HCO B on Talking the TA Down).Or one can assess L4B.About the only prepared lists one can assess are the new Hi-Lo TA HCO B 13 Mar 71and possibly a GF+40 once through for biggest read. The biggest read will have a blowdownon it and can possibly be brought to F/N. If this occurs then one also handles all other itemsthat read.The most frequent errors in all this are:Not taking a read earlier similar but just checking it and leaving it as “clean”.Not using suppress and false on items.And of course leaving a pc thinking things are still charged by failing to indicate the F/N.Indicating an F/N before Cog.Not going back through the folder to handle ruds and items that read but were called“clean” or were simply abandoned.A pc audited under tension of poor TRs has a hard time and does not F/N sometimes,inviting overrun."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The rules then to happy pcs are:GOOD TRs.F/N EVERYTHING FOUND ON RUDS AND LISTS.AUDIT WITH TA IN NORMAL RANGE OR REPAIR IT SO IT IS IN NORMALRANGE.L.

He would have tobe run at Sens 3-32 two cans to keep him on a dial or detect F/Ns.This is a very important matter as the auditor will miss F/Ns, think beginning F/Ns arereads and as the Pre-OT is off the dial, miss reads.Thus uncharged areas are run and charged ones are missed.The result is very chaotic to repair.Some lower level pcs also have a need for lower Sensitivity settings.SUMMARYSometimes an easy pc looks very difficult just because of wrong Sensitivity settings.Set the Sensitivity for the pc for a half dial F/N maximum or minimum."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Don’t get repairs.Get wins.LRH:ntm.rdL.

The coach’s needle is dirty. The student’s out comm cycle has cut his comm insome way, but PRIOR to that the coach failed to flunk the part of the comm cyclethat went out. Correct flunking by coaches equals students with no dirty needles.2. If a coach’s TA starts climbing on a drill and the needle gets sticky, it means that thestudent’s comm cycle has dispersed him and pushed him out of PT. The coach iseither ( 1 ) not flunking at all (2) flunking the incorrect thing.3. The correct flunking by the coach of an out comm cycle, which has dispersed himand pushed his TA up, will always result in a TA blowdown. If there is noblowdown, the coach has flunked the wrong thing.4. Needle not responding well and sensitively on assessment drills, although theneedle clean. Coach has failed to flunk TR 1 (or TR0) for lack of impingement andreach.5. Coach reaching forward and leaning on the table, means TR 1 is out with thestudent.6. Student asking coach for considerations to get TA down, but TA climbing on theconsiderations—the coach is cleaning a clean, instead of flunking the out commcycle, which occurred earlier and pushed his TA up.7. Student getting coach’s considerations off to clean the needle, but needle remainingdirty—student is cutting the coach’s comm while getting the considerations off andthe coach is not picking this up.8. Students shouting or talking very loudly on assessment drills to try and get theMeter to read by overwhelm. The reason for this is invariably—”but I’m assessingthe bank!” They haven’t realized that banks don’t read, only thetans impinged uponby the bank—therefore the TR1 must be addressed to the thetan. The meterresponds proportionately to the amount of ARC in the Session.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH:emp.rdCopyright © 1965by L.

The basic answer to aquestion is, obviously, a question if one follows the duplication of the Comm formulacompletely. See Philadelphia Congress 1953 tapes where this was covered very fully. A laterdefinition was “Questioning the pc’s Answer”. Another effort to overcome it and explain Q &A was the Anti-Q and A drill. But none of these reached home.The new definition is this:Q AND A IS A FAILURE TO COMPLETE A CYCLE OF ACTION ON A PRECLEAR.A CYCLE OF ACTION IS REDEFINED AS START—CONTINUE—COMPLETE.Thus an auditing comm cycle is a cycle of action. It starts with the auditor asking aquestion the preclear can understand, getting the preclear to answer it and acknowledging thatanswer.A process cycle is selecting a process to be run on the preclear, running the Tone Armaction into it (if necessary) and running the Tone Arm action out of it.A programme cycle is selecting an action to be performed, performing that action andcompleting it.Thus you can see that an auditor who interrupts or changes an auditing comm cycle beforeit is complete is “Q and A-ing”. This could be done by violating or preventing or not doing anypart of the auditing cycle, i.e., ask the pc a question, get an answer to a different idea, ask thedifferent idea, thus abandoning the original question.An auditor who starts a process, just gets it going, gets a new idea because of pccognition, takes up the cognition and abandons the original process is Q and A-ing.A programme such as “Prepcheck this pc’s family” is begun, and for any reason leftincomplete to go chasing some new idea to Prepcheck, is a Q and A.Unfinished cycles of action are all that louse up cases.Since Time is a continuum, a failure to carry out a cycle of action (a continuum) hangs thepc up at that exact point."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"If you don’t believe it, prepcheck “Incomplete actions” on a pc!

The needle of course isfalling to the right.That is a period of charge blowing off the bank. It is accompanied by realizations for thepc. Sometimes the pc does not voice them aloud. They nevertheless happen.If the auditor speaks or moves beyond adjusting the TA quietly with his thumb the pcmay suppress the cognitions and stop the blowdown.To see if a needle floats the TA must be halted for the moment between 2 and 3 on acalibrated meter. A floating needle cannot be observed during a blowdown.For an auditor to sit up suddenly and look surprised or pleased, or for an auditor to saythe next command or “That’s It” during a blowdown, can jolly well wreck a pc’s case. So it’s areal goof to do so.To get auditing results one must audit with a good comm cycle, accept the pc’s answers,handle the pc’s originations, be unobtrusive with his auditing actions, not hold the pc up whilehe writes, not develop tricks like waiting for the pc to look at him before giving the nextcommand, not prematurely ack and so start compulsive Itsa, and be very quiet during and justafter a blowdown.LRH:ml.cden L.

He isn’t well. Analysts had people talk for five yearsand they seldom got well.So how is it supposed to happen today that a pc, let talk enough, will get well.It won’t.The auditor does not know the very basics of auditing skills. That’s all. These are theTRs.An auditor who can’t do his TRs can’t audit. Period.Instead he says he is “letting the pc Itsa”.If by this he means he is letting the pc drive all over the road and in both ditches, then thisisn’t auditing.In auditing an auditor guides. He gives the pc something to answer. When the pc answersthe pc has said “IT IS A ......” and that’s Itsa.If the pc answers and the auditor acknowledges too soon the pc tends to go into ananxiety—he has been chopped. So he talks more than he wanted.If the pc answers and the auditor does not acknowledge, then the pc talks on and on,hoping for an acknowledgement that doesn’t come, “runs dry”, tries again, etc.So premature or late-or-never acks result in the same thing—the pc running on and onand on.And they call it “letting the pc Itsa”.

When running a process newlyor whenever the preclear is confused about the meaning of the commands, clear the commandswith the preclear, using the dictionary, if necessary.It could take a long time to clear the command. The worse off the pc, the longer it takes.Example:Auditor is going to run 0-0 on the pc. Auditor reads the commands one at a time to the pcand asks the pc “What does this command mean to you?” From the pc’s answer the auditorrealizes that the pc has a confusion on the words “willing” and “talk”. He tells the pc to lookthem up in a dictionary. The pc now understands “talk”, but still seems slightly puzzled about“willing”. Now the auditor could tell the pc to use the word “willing” in a few sentences. Whenthe pc understands it, the auditor again gets the pc to tell him what the whole command meansto him.If necessary, the auditor could get the pc to define each word of the command to be used.UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS THE AUDITOR TO EVALUATE FOR THE PCAND TELL HIM WHAT THE WORD OR COMMAND MEANS.The worst fault is the pc using a new set of words in place of the actual word andanswering the alter-ised word, not the word itself, (see HCOB 10 March 1965, “Words,Misunderstood Goofs”).LRH:ml.cdenL.

Always have a good dictionary in the auditing room. Have a copy of the ScientologyDictionary and any other materials necessary to define Scientology terms.If the PC’s native language is not English, have a dual dictionary for that language andEnglish. A simple grammar book may also be required. For a foreign language case oneshould also have a dictionary of the foreign language itself.Eg. English “apple” - looks in English/French, finas “pomme” - looks in Frenchdictionary to define “pomme”. So for the foreign language case 2 dictionaries are needed -(1) English - to foreign language, (2) foreign language itself.2. Clear the commands (or questions or list items) by first clearing in turn each word inbackwards sequence of the words in the command. (Eg. if command is “Do fish swim?”clear “swim” then “fish” then “do”). This prevents the PC starting to run the process byhimself while you are still clearing the words.3. What a word reads when clearing an assessment or listing question does not mean that thequestion has read. Misunderstood words read on the meter.4. F/Ns obtained on clearing the,words does not mean the process has been run.5. Next, clear the command itself. Auditor asks the PCs “What does this command mean toyou?” LRH. If it is evident from the PC’s answer that he has misunderstood a word as itis used in the context of the commands.a. reclear the obvious word (or words) with the dictionary.b. have him use each word in a sentence until he has it. (Clear all definitions of amisunderstood word.)c. reclear the command.d. If necessary, repeat steps 2 & 3 to make sure he understands the command.e. “Under no circumstances is the auditor to evaluate for the PC and tell him what theword or command means.” LRH"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"6. You clear the first command (or bracket) that you are going to run, then run it. Then clearthe second command (or bracket) and run it etc. Don’t clear more than one command (orbracket) at a time.7. When,clearing the command, watch the meter and note any read on the command (perHCO B 28 Feb ‘71 C/S Series 24 “Metering Reading Items”)8. Have the PC on the cans throughout the clearing of the words and commands - exceptwhen the PC is doing demos as needed. The Auditor holds the dictionary ,for the PC.9. As it is difficult to clear all the words of a correction list on a PC over heavy by-passedcharge, it is standard to clear the words of an L1C and Ruds - very early in auditing andto clear an L4BRA before commencing listing processes or an L3RF before runningR3R. When the need for those correction lists arises one does not then need to clear allthe words as it has already been done, thus such corrective lists can be used when neededwithout delay.“ARC breaks and lists should be word cleared before a PC gets into them and should betagged in a folder, on, a yellow sheet as cleared.” LRHIt is also standard to clear the words of the Word Clearing correction list early in auditingand before other correction lists are cleared. This way, if the PC bogs on subsequentword clearing, you have your Word Clearing Correction list ready to use.10. However, if, for example, your PC is sitting in the middle of an ARC Break (or otherheavy charge) and the words of the L1C (or other correction list) have not been clearedyet, you go ahead and assess the list to handle the charge. “Don’t clear first. Just verifyby asking afterwards if he had any misunderstoods on the list...(otherwise it’s auditingafter an ARC Break).” LRHAll the words of the L1C (or other correction list) would then be cleared thoroughly at thefirst opportunity - per your C/S’s instruction.11. Do not re-clear all the words of assessment lists each time the list is used on the same PC.Do it once, fully and properly the first time and note clearly in the folder, on a yellowsheet for future reference, which of the standard assessment lists have been cleared.12. These rules apply to all processes, listing questions and assessments.13. The words of the platens of Advanced Course materials are not so cleared.Any violation of full and correct clearing of commands or assessment questions, whetherdone in a formal session or not, is an ethics offence per HCO PL 4 April 1972 (revised 7 April72) “Ethics and Study Tech” section 4, which states:“ANY AUDITOR FAILING TO CLEAR EACH AND EVERY WORD OF EVERYCOMMAND OR LIST USED MAY BE SUMMONED BEFORE A COURT OF ETHICS.The charge is OUT-TECH.” LRHTraining & Services AideApproved byL.

The auditor must state why.The Case Supervisor, Director of Processing or Director of Review, nor any of theirseniors, may not discipline the auditor for refusing to audit a particular pc.An auditor who refuses to audit his quota of hours or sessions is of course subject toaction.Thus refusing to audit a particular pc, so long as one is not refusing to audit other pcs, isnot actionable.“I do not wish to audit this pc because______. I am willing to audit other pcs,” is thelegal auditor statement in the matter.Some pcs get a bad name with some auditors, some don’t appreciate the auditing, someconflict with a particular auditor’s own personality. There are such instances. It does not meancertain pcs cannot be helped by others.It is also true that an auditor who dislikes a pc may not do a good job so the rule also hasa practical side to it.One auditor disliked young men and did a bad job on them. Another disliked old ladiesand chopped them up in session. One pc had messed up several Scientologists and couldn’tfind anyone to audit him at all."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"We are not auditing people to make amends to the world.Thus an auditor has a right to reject or accept the pcs he is given.ACCEPTING A C/SWhen the auditor gets a C/S to do on a case and if he thinks it is not the correct thing todo he has the right to reject the C/S for that pc and require another one he can agree to.The auditor does not have the right to start doing a C/S and change it during the sessionexcept as noted below.The auditor may NOT C/S in the auditing chair while auditing the pc. If he has NO CaseSupervisor at all the auditor still audits from a C/S. He writes the C/S before session andadheres to it in session.

The pc of last week when the C/S was written mayhave been well and happily employed but a week later may have headaches and reprimand fromthe boss.It is dangerous to accept a Repair (Progress) Pgm if it is old.The auditor who sees his C/S is old and sees the pc has Bad Indicators is justified indemanding a fresh C/S giving his reasons why.A program written in January may be completely out of date in June. Who knows whatmay have happened in between.Use fresh C/Ses and fresh Pgms.Stale Dates only occur in poorly run backlogged Divisions anyway. The real remedy isreorganize and hire more and better auditors.ENDING THE SESSIONWhen the C/S he has is proving unworkable during the session, the auditor has a right toend the session and send the folder to the C/S.Ending the session is totally up to the auditor.If the auditor just doesn’t complete an action that was producing TA and could becompleted it is of course a flunk. Such a case is just not running a basic engram the one moretime through that would bring the TA down and give a proper end phenomena. This and similaractions would be an auditor error."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The judgement here is whether or not the auditor’s action is justified in ending thesession.Even though he may have made an error, the auditor cannot be blamed for the ending offof the session as that is totally up to him. He can be given a flunk for the errorAUDITING OVER OUT RUDSAuditing a pc on something else whose ruds are out is a MAJOR AUDITING ERROR.Even if the C/S omits “Fly a rud” or “Fly ruds” this does not justify the auditor auditingthe pc over out ruds.The auditor can do one of two things: He can Fly all ruds or he can return the folder andrequest ruds be flown.The DIANETIC AUDITOR is not excused from auditing over out ruds and in an HGCmust be specially cautioned not to do so but return the folder for a new C/S. Better still heshould learn to Fly ruds.INABILITY TO FLY RUDSIf an auditor cannot get a rud to F/N, cannot get any rud to F/N, he is justified in startinga Green Form.The auditor solution to no F/N on ruds is to do a GF whether the C/S said to or not.This is an expected action.It is understood the auditor would use Suppress and False in trying to Fly ruds.SESSIONS FAR APARTWhen a pc has not had a session for some time, or when a pc gets sessions days apart,RUDS MUST BE FLOWN. Otherwise the pc will get audited over out ruds. This can developmental mass.Optimum session scheduling is a series of sessions or a whole program done in a blockof sessions close together. This prevents the world from throwing the pc’s ruds out betweensessions.Giving sessions far apart barely keeps up with life. The auditing time is absorbed inpatching life up.Rapid gain gets above life’s annoyances and keeps the pc there.UNREADING ITEMSWhen an item the auditor has been told to run doesn’t read on the meter, even when theauditor puts in Suppress and Invalidate on it, the auditor MUST NOT do anything with the itemno matter what the C/S said.It is expected he will see if it reads and use Suppress and Invalidate on it.

(A read is an actual fall, not atick or a stop.)LIST TROUBLEWhen an auditor has trouble doing a list and getting an item it is expected he will use aPrepared List like L4B to locate the trouble and handle it.As it is very hard on a pc to mess up a list it is expected the auditor will handle thesituation then and there with no further C/S directions.HIGH TAWhen the auditor sees the TA is high at session start yet the C/S says to “Fly a rud” orrun a chain, the AUDITOR MUST NOT TRY TO FLY A RUD and he must not start on achain.Trying to bring a TA down with ARC Brks or ruds is very hard on a pc as ARC Breaksaren’t the reason TAs go up.Seeing a high TA at start the Dianetic auditor or Scn auditor up to Class II does not startthe session but sends the folder back to the C/S and for a higher class auditor to do.Seeing a high TA at start the Scientology auditor (Class III or above) (a) checks forexteriorization in a recent session and if so the session is ended and the C/S is asked for an“Interiorization Rundown”; (b) if the pc has had an Interiorization Rundown the auditor asksthe C/S for permission to do a “C/S Series 53” or a Hi-Lo TA assessment or whatever the C/Sindicates. The Int RD may have been (usually is) overrun and needs rehab or correction and itis usual to check it—it is included in a “C/S 53” and a Hi-Lo TA.These actions are expected of the auditor even when not stated in the C/S.GOING ON HOPINGWhen a case is running badly session to session the LAST thing you do is go on hoping,either in auditing or C/Sing.“Let’s try _____”, ‘‘Then this”, “Then this”, is not going to solve the case.YOU GET DATA. You can get data by a White Form (Pc Assessment Form). You canget data from a GF fully assessed (Method 5). You can get data by 2-way comm on varioussubjects. You can have the D of P interview and get answers. You can even ask his mother.You look for case errors. You study the folder back to where the pc ran well and thencome forward and you’ll find the error every time.DO NOT JUST GO ON SESSION AFTER FAILED SESSION HOPING.

Now, if the auditor starts a major action on acase not “set up” we get 2 things to repair where we only had I as the major action won’t workeither.Repair = patching up past auditing or recent life errors. This is done by prepared lists orcompleting the chain or correcting lists or even 2-way comm or prepchecks on auditors,sessions, etc."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Rudiments = setting the case up for the session action. This includes ARC Brks, PTPs,W/Hs, GF or O/R listing or any prepared list (such as L1C, etc).Set up = getting an F/N showing and VGIs before starting any major action. It means justthat—an F/N and VGIs before starting any major action. Such may require a repair action andrudiments as well.Major Action = any—but any—action designed to change a case or general considerationsor handle continual illness or improve ability. This means a Process or even a series ofprocesses like 3 flows. It doesn’t mean a grade. It is any process the case hasn’t had.Grade = a series of processes culminating in an exact ability attained, examined andattested to by the pc.Program = any series of actions designed by a C/S to bring about definite results in a pc.A program usually includes several sessions.The vast bulk of auditing errors come about because C/Ses and auditors seek to use aMajor Action to repair a case.It is a responsibility of an auditor to reject a C/S which seeks to use one or more majoractions to repair a case that isn’t running well.The auditor must understand this completely. He can be made to accept a wrong C/S forthe pc and even more importantly can in his own session make the error and mess up the case.Example: Pc has not been running well (no real TA or had a grumpy Exam report).Auditor sees C/S has ordered a major action, not a repair by prepared lists, ruds, etc. Theauditor must reject the C/S as he will be made to fail in session by it.Example: Auditor gets a C/S, “(1) Fly a rud; (2) Assess LX3; (3) Run 3-way recall, 3-way secondaries, 3-way engrams on all / / X items”. The auditor can’t get a rud to fly. Does theLX3. In other words he flunks by failing to SET UP the case. It could also go this way.Auditor can’t get a rud to fly, does a GF, gets no F/N. He MUST NOT begin a major actionbut MUST end off right there.It is fatal to begin any new process on the case designed to change the case if the case isnot F/N VGIs.The pc who starts processing for the first time and is surely not F/N VGIs must be set upby repair actions! Simple rudiments, life ruds, O/R list on life, even assessing prepared lists onlife, these are repair actions. The pc will sooner or later begin to fly. Now at session start youput in a rud, get F/N VGIs and CAN start major actions.So the auditor has a responsibility not to be led up a garden path by a C/S which orders amajor action on a pc who isn’t repaired or by not being able in session to get an F/N VGIs byrepair.The only exceptions are a touch assist or life ruds or the Dianetic assist all on atemporarily sick pc.

That violates the program and also the grade.If the pc is running badly, a repair should be ordered. If not, the program should becompleted.Example: An effort is being made to get the pc to go backtrack. This is a programcontaining several major actions which probably consists of several sessions. Before thisprogram is complete and before the pc has gone backtrack, the C/S orders “(1) Fly a rud, (2) 3S & Ds”. The auditor should recognize in 3 S & Ds a major action being run into the middle ofa program and reject it. The correct action is of course the next backtrack process.GRADE VIOLATIONSA pc who is on a grade and hasn’t attained it yet must not be given major actions not partof that grade.Example: Pc is on Grade 1. C/S orders a list having to do with drinking. It is not aprocess on that grade. It could be done after Grade I is attained and before Grade II is begun.The C/S is incorrect and should not be accepted.ABILITY ATTAINEDNow and then before the full major action is complete or before all the grade processesare run, the pc will attain the ability of the grade or the end phenomena of the action.This is particularly true of valence shifters or Interiorization Rundowns and can happen ingrades.The auditor should recognize it and, with the F/N VGIs always present at such moments,end off.I know of one case who had a huge cog about Interiorization on Flow I Engrams and waspushed by both C/S and auditor to do Flows 2 and 3 who bogged so badly that it took a longwhile—weeks—to straighten the case out.The ability itself gets invalidated by pushing on.On the other hand this should never be taken as an excuse. “I think he cogged to himselfso we ended off.” It must be a real “What do you know!” sort of out-loud cog with a big F/Nand VVGIs and directly on the subject to end off a major action or a program or a grade beforeits actions are all audited.REVIEWING REVIEWSAn auditor who gets a C/S or an order to repair a case that is running well should rejectdoing the action.I have seen a case ordered to repair who had Ext Full Perception Doing Great. The repairbogged the case. The case then got running well again but a second C/S ordered a new repairwhich of course bogged it. Then major actions were done. The case was again repaired andrehabbed and became ok.

This sometimes spots a false auditing report. But it also sometimes is a falsereport by the pc.In any event, the auditor has a right to know. Then he can either correct his auditing orhis know-how or he can advise the C/S the pc’s report is untrue and better repair can be doneon the pc.Savage action against an auditor is almost never called for. He was trying to help. Somepeople are hard to help.Not only does an auditor have the right to be told what was wrong but he must be giventhe exact HCO B, date and title, that he violated.Never take a verbal or written correction that is not in an HCO B or tape."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"Don’t be party to a ‘‘hidden data line’’ that doesn’t exist“You ruined the pc!” is not a valid statement. ‘‘You violated HCO B page____” is thecharge.No auditor may be disciplined for asking, ‘‘May I please have the tape or HCO B thatwas violated so I can read it or go to Cramming.”If it isn’t on a tape, a book or an HCO B I T IS NOT TRUE and no auditor has to acceptany criticism that is not based on the actual source data.“If it isn’t written it isn’t true’’ is the best defense and the best way to improve your tech.These are the rights of the auditor with relation to a C/S. They are all technical rightsbased on sound principles.An auditor should know them and use them.If an auditor stands on these rights and gets beaten down he should put all the facts beforehis nearest OTL or SO ship as something would be very wrong somewhere.Auditing is a happy business—when it is done right.LRH:nt jhL.

Herethey are given names and assigned to Levels so that they can betaught more easily and so that general auditing can be improved.(Note 2: These have not been written before because I had notdetermined the results vital to each Level.)There is a Style of auditing for each class. By Style is meant a method or custom ofperforming actions.A Style is not really determined by the process being run so much. A Style is how theauditor addresses his task.Different processes carry different style requirements perhaps, but that is not the point.Clay Table Healing at Level III can be run with Level I style and still have some gains. But anauditor trained up to the style required at Level III would do a better job not only of CT Healingbut of any repetitive process.Style is how the auditor audits. The real expert can do them all, but only after he can doeach one. Style is a mark of Class. It is not individual. In our meaning, it is a distinct way tohandle the tools of auditing.LEVEL ZEROLISTEN STYLEAt Level 0 the Style is Listen Style Auditing. Here the auditor is expected to listen to thepc. The only skill necessary is listening to another. As soon as it is ascertained that the auditoris listening (not just confronting or ignoring) the auditor can be checked out. The length of timean auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be a factor. What the pc does isnot a factor considered in judging this style. Pcs, however, talk to an auditor who is reallylistening.Here we have the highest point that old-time mental therapies reached (when they didreach it), such as psychoanalysis, when they helped anyone. Mostly they were well below this,evaluating, invalidating, interrupting. These three things are what the instructor in this styleshould try to put across to the HAS student.Listen Style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this:Listen to the pc without evaluating, invalidating or interrupting.Adding on higher skills like “Is the pc talking interestingly?” or even “Is the pc talking?”is no part of this style. When this auditor gets in trouble and the pc won’t talk or isn’tinterested, a higher classed auditor is called in, a new question given by the supervisor, etc.It really isn’t “Itsa” to be very technical. Itsa is the action of the pc saying, “It’s a this” or“It’s a that.” Getting the pc to Itsa is quite beyond Listen Style auditors where the pc won’t. It’sthe supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to Itsa."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"The ability to listen, learned well, stays with the auditor up through the grades. Onedoesn’t cease to use it even at Level VI. But one has to learn it somewhere and that’s at LevelZero. So Listen Style Auditing is just listening. It thereafter adds into the other styles.LEVEL ONEMUZZLED AUDITINGThis could also be called rote style auditing.Muzzled Auditing has been with us many years. It is the stark total of TRs 0 to 4 and notanything else added.It is called so because auditors too often added in comments, Qed and Aed, deviated,discussed and otherwise messed up a session. Muzzle meant a “muzzle was put on them”,figuratively speaking, so they would only state the auditing command and ack.Repetitive Command Auditing, using TRs 0 to 4, at Level One is done completelymuzzled.This could be called Muzzled Repetitive Auditing Style but will be called “Muzzled Style”for the sake of brevity.It has been a matter of long experience that pcs who didn’t make gains with the partiallytrained auditor permitted to two-way comm, did make gains the instant the auditor wasmuzzled: to wit, not permitted to do a thing but run the process, permitted to say nothing butthe commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgmentwithout any other question or comment.At Level One we don’t expect the auditor to do anything but state the command (or ask thequestion) with no variation, acknowledge the pc’s answer and handle the pc origins byunderstanding and acknowledging what the pc said.Those processes used at Level One actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst tomisguided efforts to “Two-Way Comm”.Listen Style combines with Muzzled Style easily. But watch out that Level One sessionsdon’t disintegrate to Level Zero.Crisp, clean repetitive commands, muzzled, given and answered often, are the road out—not pc wanderings.A pc at this Level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him, exactly what the auditorwill do. The pc is even put through a few “do birds fly?” cycles until the pc gets the idea. Thenthe processing works.An auditor trying to do Muzzled Repetitive Auditing on a pc who, through past “therapyexperience”, is rambling on and on is a sad sight. It means that control is out (or that the pcnever got above Level Zero).It’s the number of commands given and answered in a unit of auditing time that gets gains.To that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have a release in short order, usingthe processes of this Level.To follow limp Listen Style with crisp, controlled Muzzled Style may be a shock. But theyare each the lowest of the two families of auditing styles—Totally Permissive and TotallyControlled. And they are so different each is easy to learn with no confusion. It’s been the lack"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"of difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about. Well, these two aredifferent enough—Listen Style and Muzzled Style—to set anybody straight.LEVEL TWOGUIDING STYLE AUDITINGAn old-time auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names: (a) Two-Way Comm and (b) Formal Auditing.We condense these two old styles under one new name: Guiding Style Auditing.One first guides the pc by “two-way comm” into some subject that has to be handled orinto revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitivecommands.Guiding Style Auditing becomes feasible only when a student can do Listen Style andMuzzled Style Auditing well.Formerly the student who couldn’t confront or duplicate a command took refuge insloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or “Two-Way Comm”.The first thing to know about Guiding Style is that one lets the pc talk and Itsa withoutchop, but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitivecommands.We presuppose the auditor at this Level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy theviewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc. We also presuppose at thisLevel that the auditor, being able to occupy a viewpoint, is therefore more self-determined, thetwo things being related. (One can only be self-determined when one can observe the actualsituation before one: otherwise a being is delusion-determined or other-determined.)Thus in Guiding Style Auditing, the auditor is there to find out what’s what from the pcand then apply the needful remedy.Most of the processes in the Book of Remedies are included in this Level (II). To usethose, one has to observe the pc, discover what the pc is doing, and remedy the pc’s caseaccordingly.The result for the pc is a far-reaching re-orientation in Life.Thus the essentials of Guiding Style Auditing consist of Two-Way Comm that steers thepc into revealing a difficulty followed by a repetitive process to handle what has been revealed.One does expert TRs but one may discuss things with the pc, let the pc talk and in generalone audits the pc before one, establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisprepetitive auditing, but all the while alert to changes in the pc.One runs at this Level against Tone Arm Action, paying little or no heed to the needleexcept as a centering device for TA position. One even establishes what’s to be done by theaction of the Tone Arm. (The process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fellwhen he was running what’s being run, now belongs at this Level (II) and will be re-numberedaccordingly.)At II one expects to handle a lot of chronic PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks with Life (but notsession ARC Breaks, that being a needle action, session ARC Breaks being sorted out by ahigher classed auditor if they occur)."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"To get such things done (PTPs, overts and other remedies) in the session the auditor musthave a pc “willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties”. That presupposes we have anauditor at this Level who can ask questions, not repetitive, that guide the pc into talking aboutthe difficulty that needs to be handled.Great command of TR 4 is the primary difference in TRs from Level I. One understands,when one doesn’t, by asking more questions, and by really acknowledging only when one hasreally understood it.Guided comm is the clue to control at this Level. One should easily guide the pc’s commin and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time. As soon as an auditorgets the idea of finite result or, that is to say, a specific and definite result expected, all this iseasy. Pc has a PTP. Example: Auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimulate thePTP so pc is not bothered about it (and isn’t being driven to do something about it) as the finiteresult.The auditor at II is trained to audit the pc before him, get the pc into comm, guide the pctoward data needful to choose a process and then to run the process necessary to resolve thatthing found, usually by repetitive command and always by TA.The Book of Remedies is the key to this Level and this auditing style.One listens but only to what one has guided the pc into. One runs repetitive commandswith good TR 4. And one may search around for quite a while before one is satisfied he has theanswer from the pc needful to resolve a certain aspect of the pc’s case.O/W can be run at Level I. But at Level II one may guide the pc into divulging what thepc considers a real overt act and, having that, then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasn’tan overt and so eventually blow it.Half-acknowledgment is also taught at Level II—the ways of keeping a pc talking bygiving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone TR 2.Big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going offthe subject.LEVEL IIIABRIDGED STYLE AUDITINGBy Abridged is meant “abbreviated”, shorn of extras. Any not actually needful auditingcommand is deleted.For instance, at Level I the auditor always says, when the pc wanders off the subject, “Iwill repeat the auditing command” and does so. In Abridged Style the auditor omits this when itisn’t necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it.In this style we have shifted from pure rote to a sensible use or omission as needful. Westill use repetitive commands expertly, but we don’t use rote that is unnecessary to thesituation.Two-Way Comm comes into its own at Level III. But with heavy use of repetitivecommands.At this Level we have as the primary process, Clay Table Healing. In this an auditor mustmake sure the commands are followed exactly. No auditing command is ever let go of until thatactual command is answered by the pc."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"But at the same time, one doesn’t necessarily give every auditing command the processhas in its rundown.In Clay Table Healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time. This isdone more often by observation than command. Yet it is done.We suppose at III that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe.Thus we see the pc is satisfied and don’t mention it. Thus we see when the pc is not certain andso we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question.On the other hand, one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and getsthem executed.Prepchecking and needle usage is taught at Level III as well as Clay Table Healing.Auditing by List is also taught. In Abridged Style Auditing one may find the pc (being cleanedup on a list question) giving half a dozen answers in a rush. One doesn’t stop the pc fromdoing so, one half acknowledges, and lets the pc go on. One is in actual fact handling a biggerauditing comm cycle, that is all. The question elicits more than one answer which is really onlyone answer. And when that answer is given, it is acknowledged.One sees when a needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate allthe pc’s relief. And one sees it isn’t clean by the continued puzzle on the pc’s face.There are tricks involved here. One asks a question of the pc with the key word in it andnotes that the needle doesn’t tremble, and so concludes the question about the word is flat. Andso doesn’t check it again. Example: “Has anything else been suppressed?” One eye on pc, oneon needle, needle didn’t quiver. Pc looks noncommittal. Auditor says, “All right, on “ andgoes on to next question, eliminating a pc’s possible protest read that can be mistaken foranother “suppress”.In Abridged Style Auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it impedescase advance. But that doesn’t mean one wanders about. One is even more crisp and thoroughwith Abridged Style Auditing than in rote.One is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected result.By “Abridged” is meant getting the exact job done—the shortest way between twopoints—with no waste questions.By now the student should know that he runs a process to achieve an exact result and hegets the process run in a way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time.The student is taught to guide rapidly, to have no time for wide excursions.The processes at this Level are all rat-a-tat-tat processes—CT Healing, Prepchecking,Auditing by List.Again it’s the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time thatmakes for speed of result.LEVEL IVDIRECT STYLE AUDITINGBy direct we mean straight, concentrated, intense, applied in a direct manner.We do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide. We mean it isdirect.By direct, we don’t mean frank or choppy. On the contrary, we put the pc’s attention onhis bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"It could also mean that we are not auditing by vias. We are auditing straight at the thingsthat need to be reached to make somebody clear.Other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed.At Level IV we have Clay Table Clearing and we have Assessment type processes.These two types of process are both astonishingly direct. They are aimed directly at theReactive Mind. They are done in a direct manner.In CT Clearing we have almost total work and Itsa from pcs. From one end of a sessionto another, we may have only a few auditing commands. For a pc on CT Clearing does almostall the work if he is in session at all.Thus we have another implication in the word “direct”. The pc is talking directly to theauditor about what he is making and why in CT Clearing. The auditor hardly ever talks at all.In assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pc’s bank and wants no pc in front of itthinking, speculating, maundering or Itsaing. Thus this assessment is a very direct action.All this requires easy, smooth, steel-hand-in-a-velvet-glove control of the pc. It lookseasy and relaxed as a style, it is straight as a Toledo blade.The trick is to be direct in what’s wanted and not deviate. The auditor settles what’s to bedone, gives the command and then the pc may work for a long time, the auditor alert, attentive,completely relaxed.In assessment the auditor often pays no attention to the pc at all, as in ARC Breaks orassessing lists. Indeed, a pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of a list.And in CT Clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at a stretch.The tests are: Can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without ARC Breakingthe pc? Can the auditor order the pc to do something and then, the pc working on it, can theauditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour, understanding everything and interrupt alertlyonly when he doesn’t understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him? Again without ARCBreaking the pc.You could confuse this Direct Style with Listen Style if you merely glanced at a sessionof CT Clearing. But what a difference. In Listen Style the pc is blundering on and on and on.In Direct Style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to Itsa, let us say, with no claywork and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay, you’d see theauditor, quick as a foil, look at the pc, very interestedly and say, “Let’s see that in Clay.” Orthe pc doesn’t really give an ability he wants to improve and you’d hear a quiet persuasiveauditor voice, “Are you quite certain you want to improve that? Sounds like a goal to me. Justsomething, some ability you know, you’d like to improve.”You could call this style One-Way Auditing. When the pc is given his orders, after thatit’s all from the pc to the auditor, and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruction.When the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc. Only when the assessmentaction hits a snag like a PTP is there any other auditing style used.This is a very extreme auditing style. It is straightforward—direct.But when needful, as in any Level, the styles learned below it are often also employed,but never in the actual actions of getting CT Clearing and Assessment done.(Note: Level V would be the same style as VI below.)"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"LEVEL VIALL STYLESo far, we have dealt with simple actions.Now we have an auditor handling a meter and a pc who Itsa’s and Cognites and getsPTPs and ARC Breaks and Line Charges and Cognites and who finds Items and lists and whomust be handled, handled, handled all the way.As auditing TA for a 2l/2 hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions (compared to 10 or15 for the lowest level), the pace of the session is greater. It is this pace that makes perfectability at each lower level vital when they combine into All Style. For each is now faster.So, we learn All Style by learning each of the lower styles well, and then observe andapply the style needed every time it is needed, shifting styles as often as once every minute!The best way to learn All Style is to become expert at each lower style so that one doesthe style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs.It is less rough than it looks. But it is also very demanding.Use the wrong style on a situation and you’ve had it. ARC Break! No progress!Example: Right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty. The auditor can’tcontinue—or shouldn’t. The auditor, in Direct Style, looks up to see a-puzzled frown. Theauditor has to shift to Guiding Style to find out what ails the pc (who probably doesn’t reallyknow), then to Listen Style while the pc cognites on a chronic PTP that just emerged andbothered the pc, then to Direct Style to finish the Assessment that was in progress.The only way an auditor can get confused by All Style is by not being good at one of thelower level styles.Careful inspection will show where the student using All Style is slipping. One then getsthe student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it a bit.So All Style, when poorly done, is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one ormore of the lower level styles. And as all these can be independently taught, the whole can beco-ordinated. All Style is hard to do only when one hasn’t mastered one of the lower levelstyles.SUMMARYThese are the important Styles of Auditing. There have been others but they are onlyvariations of those given in this HCO Bulletin. Tone 40 Style is the most notable one missing.It remains as a practice style at Level One to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to gethis command obeyed. It is no longer used in practice.As it was necessary to have every result and every process for each Level to finalizeStyles of Auditing, I left this until last and here it is.Please note that none of these Styles violate the auditing comm cycle or the TRs.LRH :jw.rd L.

To get into communication with that which you are trying to process.2. Do something for him.There is many a pc who will go around raving about his auditor, whose auditor has notdone anything for the pc. All that has happened is that a tremendous communication line hasbeen established with the pc and this is so novel and so strange to the pc that he then considersthat something miraculous has occurred.Something miraculous has occurred but in this particular instance the auditor has totallyneglected why he formed that communication line in the first place. He formed it in the firstplace to do something for the pc.He very often mistakes the fact that he has formed a communication line, and the reactionon the pc for his having formed one, with having done something for the pc.There are two stages.1. Form a communication line.2. Do something for the pc.Those are the two distinct stages. It is something like (I) Walking up to the bus, and (2)Driving off. If you don’t drive off you never go anyplace.It is a very tricky and no small thing to be able to communicate to a human being who hasnever been communicated to before. This is quite remarkable, and is such a remarkable feat thatit appears to be an end-all of Scientology to some.But you see that’s just walking up to the bus. Now you have got to go someplace.Any upset that the individual has is so poised, it is so delicately balanced, that it isdifficult to maintain. It is not difficult to get well. It is very hard to remain batty. A fellow hasto work at it."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"If your communication line is very good and very smooth and if your auditing disciplineis perfect so you don’t upset this communication line and if you just made a foray of no moreimportance than saying something like—What are you doing that’s sensible and why is itsensible?—and kept your communication line up all the while and kept your affinity up with thepc all the while, did it with perfect discipline, you would see more aberration fall to pieces persquare inch than you ever thought could exist.Now that’s what I mean when I say do something for the pc.You must audit well, get perfect discipline and get your communication cycle in. Don’tARC Break the pc, let your cycles of action complete.All of that is simply an entrance. You see, the discipline of Scientology makes it possibleto do this, and one of the reasons why other fields of the mind never got anyplace and couldnever get near anybody was because they couldn’t communicate to anybody.So that discipline is important.That is the ladder that goes up to the door and if you can’t get to the door you can’t doanything.The perfect discipline of which we speak, the perfect communication cycle, the perfectauditor presence, perfect meter reading—all of these things are just to get you in a state whereyou can do something for somebody.So when you’re real slow picking up the discipline, real slow picking up keeping in thecommunication cycle, when you’re pokey on the subject you are still 9 miles from the ball.You’re not even attending yet.What you want to be able to do is audit perfectly. By that we mean keep in acommunication cycle, be able to approach the pc, be able to talk to the pc, and be able tomaintain the ARC. Get the pc to give you answers to your questions. Be able to read a meterand get the reactions.All of those things have to be awfully good because it’s very difficult to get acommunication line in to somebody anyway. They all have to be present and they all have to beperfect. If they are all present and they are all perfect, then we can start to process somebody.THEN we can start to process somebody.I’m giving you an entrance point here of, if all your cycles were perfect, if you were ableto sit there and confront the pc and meter that pc and keep your auditing report and do all thesemultiple various things, and keep a pleasant smile on your face and not chop hiscommunication, well then there is something you do with these things. It takes a process now.We used to have it all backwards. We used to try and teach people what they could do forsomebody. But they could never get in communication with him to do it, so therefore you hadfailures in processing.The most elementary procedure would be—’’What do you think is sensible?’’—oranything of that sort. The pc says, “Well, I think horses sleep in beds. That’s sensible. ‘‘ Theauditor says, ‘‘Alright Now why is that sensible?’’ The pc says, “Well ... ah .... Hey! . . .That’s not sensible. That’s nuts!” You actually wouldn’t have to do anything more than thatHe’s cognited. You’ve flattened it. It’s so easy to do, but you keep looking for some magic.Well, your magic is in getting into communication with the person. The rest is very easyto do, all you have to do is remain in communication with the person while you are doing this,and realize that these huge aberrations he’s got are poised with the most fantastically delicatebalance on little pinheads. All you have to do is to phooph and these things crash"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Now if you’re not in communication with this person he doesn’t cognite. He takes it asan accusative action. He tries to justify thinking that way. He tries to make himself look goodto you and tries to put on a public front of some kind or another. He tries to hold up his status.Anytime I see a bunch of pcs around who want to jump happily to something elsebecause sane people run on that and crazy people run on something else, and they never have tobe run on the crazy one, I right away know their auditors are not in communication with themand that auditing discipline itself has broken down because the pc is trying to justify himselfand trying to uphold his own status. So he must be defending himself against the auditor.The auditor couldn’t possibly be in communication with him.So we are right back to the fundamental of why didn’t the auditor get into comm with thepc in the first place.You get into communication with the pc in the first place by doing proper Scientologydiscipline. That is not any trick. It goes off 1, 2, 3, 4You sit down and you start the session and you start handling the pc and his problemsand that sort of thing and you DO IT BY COMPLETING YOUR COMMUNICATIONCYCLES AND NOT CUTTING HIS COMMUNICATION—THE VERY THINGS YOUARE TAUGHT IN THE TRs, and you find you are in communication with the person. Nowyou’ve got to do something for the person.Unless, having gotten into communication, you do something for the person, you loseyour communication line because the R-Factor of why you’re in communication with the pcbreaks down. He doesn’t think you’re so good, and you go out of communication with him.That having happened, the person will be in a sort of status defensive and wonder why he isbeing processed.On the other hand, if you have done something for the pc and he has had his cognition,and you try and go on and get more TA action out of the fact that “all horses sleep in beds”—you don’t get there as you’ve already flattened the process.You can over-audit and you can under-audit.If you don’t notice that one answer come your way, that indicates you have donesomething for the pc and if you keep him working on that same thing, your TA action willdisappear, your pc will get resentful and you’ll lose your communication line.He’s already had the cognition you see. You are now restimulating the pc. You havegotten your key-out destimulation factor—it has occurred right before your eyes. You havedone something for the pc. One more mention of the subject and you’ve had it.There are a lot of things you could do with the pc, without doing anything for him. Youcan turn on some very very handsome somatics on a pc at one time or another without turningthem off either. You’ve got to do something for the pc, not to him.Now you can be doing something (A), and the pc is doing (B), and you go on doing (A),while the pc is doing (B) then somewhere on down the line you wind up in a hell of a mess andyou wonder what happened.Well the pc never did what you said so you didn’t do anything for the pc. There was inactual fact no barrier to your willingness to do something for the pc but there must have been atremendous barrier to your understanding of what was going on.That you could ask (A), while the pc answered (B), in itself showed the auditorobservation was very poor so therefore the auditor wasn’t in communication with the pc."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"So again the communication factor was out and once more we weren’t doing anything forthe pc.It requires of the auditor discipline to keep in his communication line. He has got to stayin communication with his pc. Those cycles have got to be perfect. He can’t be distracting thepc’s attention onto the TA, e.g. “I’m not getting any TA action now.” That’s not staying incommunication with the pc—has nothing to do with it. You’re distracting the pc from his ownzones and areas.Don’t put the pc’s attention out of session. Keep him going and keep that communicationline in. And the next requirement is to do something productive for the pc using thecommunication line.LRH:nt:jhL. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1971, 1974  Founderby L.

The first is the Pc’s line to his bank. The Itsa Maker line.2. The second is the Pc’s line to the Auditor. The Itsa line.3. The third is the Auditor’s line to the Pc. The What’s-it line.Now the definition, “Willing to talk to the Auditor”, is very easy to interpret as “Talkingto the Auditor”. So the Auditor cuts the line the Pc has to the bank in order to get the Pc to talk,because “It’s the Itsa line that blows the charge,” he says.So the Auditor cuts the Pc’s communication line with his bank in order to bring about anItsa line—and then he wonders why he gets no TA action and why the Pc ARC Breaks.This cut communication line is not perceivable to the naked eye. It’s hidden because it’sfrom the Pc—a Thetan unseen by the Auditor—to the Pc’s bank—unseen by the Auditor.The Auditor is simply there to use the What’s-it line in order to get the Pc to confront hisbank. The charge blows off it to the degree that it’s confronted and this is represented by theItsa line.The Itsa line is a report on what has been as-ised, that gives it its flow.The sequence of use of these lines in an auditing cycle is 3, 1, and then 2.Where the Auditor neglects this hidden line from the Pc to the Pc’s bank, where hedoesn’t understand that hidden line and can’t integrate it or do anything with it he is going tofail.

The only thing that connects them andmakes an auditing cycle, is the fact that the Auditor, on his communication cycle, hascalculatingly restimulated something in the Pc which is then discharged by the Pc’scommunication cycle.What the Auditor has said has caused a restimulation and then the Pc needs to answer thequestion to get rid of the restimulation.If the Pc does not answer the question he doesn’t get rid of the restimulation. That is thegame that is being played in an auditing cycle and that is the entirety of the game. (Someauditing breaks down because the Auditor is unwilling to restimulate the Pc.)There is a little extra communication cycle on here. The Auditor says, “Thank you” andyou have this as the acknowledgement cycle.C----------------------Command------------------------->EAuditor E<----------------------Answer ---------------------------C PcC-----------------Acknowledgement-------------------->ENow there are some little inner cycles that can throw you off and make you think thatthere are some other things to the auditing cycle. There is another little shadow cycle: it is theobservation of “Has the Pc received the auditing command?” This is such a tiny “cause” that"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"nearly all Auditors who are having any trouble finding out what’s going on with the Pc aremissing this one. “Does he receive it?” Actually there is another cause in here and you’remissing that one when you’re not perceiving the Pc.You can tell by looking at the Pc that he didn’t hear or understand what you’d said or thathe was doing something peculiar with the command he was receiving. Whatever that messageis in response, it rides on this line.  Did Pc receive,c--------------------Understand and-----------------------c answer commandC----------------------Command------------------------->EAuditor E<----------------------Answer ---------------------------C PcC-----------------Acknowledgement-------------------->EAn Auditor who isn’t watching a Pc at all never notices a Pc who isn’t receiving orunderstanding the auditing command. Then all of a sudden somewhere along the line there is anARC Break and then we do assessments and we patch up the session and all kinds of things gowrong.Well, they actually needn’t ever have gone wrong in the first place if this line had been in.What is the Pc doing completely aside from answering? Well, what he is doing is this otherlittle sub-cause, distance, effect line.Another of these tiny lines is the cause, distance, effect line of—”Is the Pc ready toreceive an auditing command?”This is the Pc causing and it rides up the line across distance, is received at the Auditorand the Auditor perceives that the Pc is doing something else.It is an important one and you find that Auditors goof that one very often; the Pc’sattention is still on a prior action.Now here’s another one—”Has the Pc received the acknowledgement?” Sometimes youviolate this one. You have been acknowledging but you’ve never seen that he didn’t receive theacknowledgement. That perception has another little tiny one in it that actually comes on thisline; it is—’’Has the Pc answered everything?’’The Auditor is watching the Pc and the Auditor sees that the Pc has not said all that the Pcis going to say. You sometimes get into trouble with Pcs that way. Everything at “cause” hasn’tmoved on down the line to effect and you haven’t perceived all of the “effect” and you go intothe acknowledgement one before this line has completed itself.That’s chopping the Pc’s communication. You didn’t let the communication cycle flow toits complete end. The acknowledgement takes place and of course it can’t go through as it’s aninflowing line and it jams right there on the Pc’s incomplete outflowing answer line. Is the Pc readye<-----------------for the command?----------------------c  Did Pc receive,c--------------------Understand and-----------------------c answer commandC----------------------Command------------------------->E"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Auditor E<----------------------Answer ---------------------------C PcC-----------------Acknowledgement-------------------->EDid Pc complete thee<----------------answer and receive---------------------c acknowledgement?So if you want to break it all down, there are six communication cycles which make upone auditing cycle. Six, not more than six unless you start running into trouble. If you violateone of these six communication lines you of course are going to get into trouble which causes amish-mash of one kind or another.There is another communication cycle inside the auditing cycle and that is at the point ofthe Pc. It’s a little additional one and it’s between the Pc and himself. This is him talking tohim. You’re listening to the inside of his skull when you’re examining it. /t actually can bemultiple as it depends upon the complications of the mind.This happens to be the least important of all the actions except when it isn’t being done.And of course it’s the hardest to detect when it isn’t being done. Pc says: “Yes. “ Now whathas the Pc said yes to? And sometimes you are insufficiently curious. And that in essence isthis internal perception of line. It includes this cause, distance, effect backflash here—”Is thePc answering the command I gave him?”So with this, there are seven communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle. It is amultiple cycle.A communication cycle consists of just cause, distance, effect with intention, attention,duplication and understanding. How many of these are there in one auditing cycle? You’d haveto answer that with how many principal ones there are because some auditing cycles contain afew more. If a Pc indicates that he didn’t get the command (cause, distance, effect), the Auditorwould give a repeat of it (cause, distance, effect) and that would add 2 more communicationcycles to the auditing cycle, so you’ve got 9—because there was a flub. So anything unusualthat happens in a session adds to the number of communication cycles in the auditing cycle, butthey are still all part of the auditing cycle.Repetitive commands as an auditing cycle, is doing the same cycle over and over again.Now there is a completely different cycle inside the same pattern. The Pc is going tooriginate and it’s got nothing to do with the auditing cycle. The only thing they have incommon is that they both use communication cycles. But this is brand new. The Pc sayssomething that is not germane to what the Auditor is saying or doing and you actually have tobe alert for this happening at any time and the way to prepare for it is just to realize that it canhappen at any time and just go into the drill that handles it. Don’t get it confused with the drillthat you have as an auditing cycle. Consider it its own drill. You shift gears into this drill whenthe pc does something unexpected.And, by the way, this handles such a thing as the Pc originates by throwing down thecans. That’s still an origin. It has nothing to do with the auditing cycle. Maybe the auditingcycle went to pieces and this origination cycle came in. Well, the auditing cycle can’t completebecause this origin cycle is now here. That doesn’t mean that this origin has precedence ordominance but it can start and take place and have to be finished off before the auditing cyclecan resume.So this is an interruptive cycle and it is cause, distance, effect. The Pc causes something.The Auditor now has to originate as the Auditor has to understand what the Pc is talkingabout—and then acknowledge. And to the degree that it is hard to understand, you have thecause, distance, effect of the Auditor trying to clarify this thing; and every time he asks aquestion, he’s got a new communication cycle."},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"You can’t put a machine action at that point because the thing has to be understood. Andthis must be done in such a way that the Pc isn’t merely repeating his same origination or the Pcwill go frantic. He’ll go frantic because he can’t get off that line—he’s stuck in time and itreally upsets him. So the Auditor has to be able to understand what the devil the Pc is talkingabout. And there’s really no substitute for simply trying to understand it.There is a little line where the Pc indicates he is going to say something. This is a line(cause, distance, effect) that comes before the origination takes place so you don’t run into ajam and you don’t give the auditing command. The effect at the Auditor’s point is to shut upand let him. There can be another little line (cause, distance, effect) where the Auditor indicateshe is listening. Then there is the origination, the Auditor’s acknowledgement of it and thenthere is the perception of the fact that the Pc received the acknowledgement.That’s your origination cycle.An Auditor should draw all these communication cycles out on a scrap of paper. Just takea look at all these things; mock up a session and all of a sudden it will become very straighthow these things are and you won’t have a couple of them jammed up. What’s mainly wrongwith your auditing cycle is that you have confused a couple of communication cycles to such adegree that you don’t differentiate that they exist. That’s why you sometimes chop a Pc who istrying to answer the question.You know whether the Pc has answered the question or not. How did you know? Even ifit’s telepathy it’s cause, distance, effect. It doesn’t matter how that communication took place,you know whether he’s answered the command by a communication cycle. I don’t care howyou sense this.If you are nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing and if that’s givingyou trouble (and if you get into trouble by suddenly breaking it down and analyzing it) then itshould be broken down and analyzed at a time when you’re auditing something nice andsimple.I’ve given you a general pattern for an auditing cycle; maybe in working it over you canfind a couple of extra communication cycles in the thing. But they are all there and if you madesomeone go through each one painstakingly, you would find out where his auditing cycle isjammed up. It isn’t necessarily jammed up on his ability to say “Thank you”. It may very wellbe jammed up in another quarter.L. RON HUBBARDFounderLRH:nt jhCopyright © 1971, 1974by L.

Thereafterit should be taken up exclusively with the observation of what the pc is doing or is not doing.Your handling of a communication cycle ought to be so instinctive and so good thatyou’re never worried about what you do now.The time for you to get all this fixed up is in training. If you know your communicationcycle is good you haven’t any longer got to be upset about whether you’re doing it right or not.You know yours is good, so you don’t worry about it any more.In actual auditing, the communication cycle that you watch is the pc’s. Your business isthe communication cycle and responses of the pc.This is what makes the auditor who can crack any case and when absent you have anauditor who couldn’t crack an egg if he stepped on it.This is the difference, it’s whether or not this auditor can observe the communicationcycle of the pc and repair its various lapses.It’s so simple.It simply consists of asking a question that the pc can answer, and then observing that thepc answers it, and when the pc has answered it, observing that the pc has completed the answerto it and is through answering it. Then give him the acknowledgement. Then give himsomething else to do. You can ask the same question or you can ask another question.Asking the pc a question he can answer involves clearing the auditing command. Youalso ask it of the pc so that the pc can hear it and knows what he’s being asked.When the pc answers the question be bright enough to know that the pc is answering thatquestion and not some other question.You have to develop a sensitivity—when did the pc finish answering what you’ve asked.You can tell when the pc has finished. It’s a piece of knowingness. He looks like he’s finished"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"and he feels like he’s finished. It’s part sense; it’s part his vocal intonation; but it’s an instinctthat you develop. You know he’s finished.Then knowing he’s finished answering you tell him he’s finished with anacknowledgement, OK, Good, etc. It’s like pointing out the by-passed charge to the pc. Like-”You have now found and located the by-passed charge in answer to the question and you havesaid it.” That’s the magic of acknowledgement.If you don’t have that sensitivity for when the pc is finished answering—he answers,gets nothing from you, you sit there and look at him, his social machinery goes into action, hegets onto self auditing and you get no TA action.The degree of stop you put on your acknowledgement is also your good sense becauseyou can acknowledge a pc so hard that you finish the session right there.It’s all very well to do this sort of thing in training and it’s forgivable, but NOT in anauditing session.Get your own communication cycle sufficiently well repaired that you don’t have toworry about it after training.

Therefore the auditor has to assumeresponsibility for all comm breakdowns in it.EVALUATIONFar more serious than Invalidation above, is the accidental evaluation which may occurwhen the auditor repeats what the pc said.NEVER repeat anything a pc says after him, no matter why.Repeating not only does not show the pc you heard but makes him feel you’re a circuit.The highest advance of 19th Century Psychology was a machine to drive people crazy.All it did was repeat after the person everything the person said.Children also do this to annoy.But that isn’t the main reason you do not repeat what the pc said after the pc. If you say itwrong the pc is thrown into heavy protest. The pc must correct the wrongness and hangs upright there. It may take an hour to dig the pc out of it.Further, don’t gesture to find out. To say, pointing, “You mean this item, then,” is notonly an evaluation but a nearly hypnotic command, and the pc feels he must reject verystrongly."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Don’t tell the pc what the pc said and don’t gesture to find what the pc meant.Just get the pc to say it again or get the pc to point it out again.

Itdrives in anchor points and makes the pc reject the auditor.ROCK SLAMMERThe reason a person who Rock Slams on Scientology or auditors or the like can’t auditwell is that they are wary of a pc and feel they must repeat after the pc, correct the pc or gesturetoward the pc.But Rock Slammer or not, any new auditor may fall into these bad habits and they shouldbe broken fast.SUMMARYA very high percentage of ARC Breaks occur because of a failure to understand the pc.Don’t prove you didn’t with gestures or erroneous repeats.Just audit, please.

Imagine my making one on the Comm Formula after all theseyears.Do people ever explain to you long after you have understood?Do people get cross with you when they are trying to tell you something?If so, you are suffering from Premature Acknowledgement.Like body odor and bad breath, it is not conducive to social happiness. But you don’t useLifebuoy soap or Listerine to cure it, you use a proper comm formula.When you “coax” a person to talk after he has begun with a nod or a low “yes” you ack,make him forget, then make him believe you haven’t got it and then make him tell you atGREAT length. He feels bad and doesn’t cognite and may ARC Break.Try it out. Have somebody tell you about something and then encourage before he hascompletely told you all.THAT’S why pcs Itsa on and on and on and on with no gain. The auditor prematurelyacknowledged. THAT’S why pcs get cross “for no reason”. The auditor has prematurely andunwittingly acknowledged. THAT’S why one feels dull when talking to certain people. Theyprematurely acknowledge. That’s why one thinks another is stupid—that person prematurelyacknowledges.The quickest way to become a social pariah (dog) is to prematurely acknowledge. Onecan do it in many ways.The quickest way to start the longest conversation is to prematurely acknowledge for theperson believes he has not been understood and so begins to explain at greater and greaterlength.So this was the hidden ARC Break maker, the cognition wrecker, the stupidifier, the Itsaprolonger in sessions.And why some people believe others are stupid or don’t understand.Any habit of agreeable noises and nods can be mistaken for acknowledgement, ends cycleon the speaker, causes him to forget, feel dull, believe the listener is stupid, get cross, getexhausted explaining and ARC Break. The missed withhold is inadvertent. One didn’t get achance to say what one was going to say because one was stopped by prematureacknowledgement. Result, missed w/h in the speaker, with all its consequences."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"This can be counted on to make you feel frightened of being “agreeable with noises orgestures” for a bit and then you’ll get it straight.What a piece of tech to remain incompletely explained.

Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"E METER DATA: INSTANT READSPART IA lecture given on24 May 1962Thank you.Well, I’m glad to be in your midst. Actually, I enjoy lecturing to you. I do.And last night enjoyed giving a session. I thought that was the most, you know? You saw melay a couple of eggs with this pc here earlier, you know, and remember, the earlier sessionswere not particularly productive of any vast gain; pc didn’t go downhill or anything. And lastnight, why, you see, I just got the idea that I’d better show you how to do some fishing andfumbling, and you might not have noticed what it did. It might have been all something orother.All I did was let the meter wave until it ticked, and I just steered the pc on to a double tick. Ijust set out to clean up a dirty needle and actually, in that hour, made a stage of cleaning it up,and we got some of the stuff cleaned off it. And what do you know, it was right on his goalline (you don’t mind my mentioning it). It was right on his goal line and everything was fine.And you notice, I didn’t go out of this lifetime. I didn’t even go back into his childhood,nothing. I held him securely anchored in the last three years. Remember? See that? Well, that’ssteering the pc. That’s just fish and fumble. You can clear up some of the most remarkablethings, particularly if you’re aided and assisted by the fact that the pc has a meter pattern to startwith.But there was something very tricky last night that you might have missed—and that was justthis and nothing more: was the handling of the stuck picture. Pc has a stuck picture; pccomplains about stuck picture; you find session in which picture was first found; get the missedwithhold off of that session. See? Don’t you go running that engram, because it’s a stuckpicture, so obviously it won’t run.Well, enough of that. I’m going to talk about the meter.Now, what’s the date? 25th?Audience: 24th.Fourth?Audience: 24th.Well, what are you doing in the 24th? I was in the 25th. Well, I’ll come back to the 24th. Allright. It’s the first lecture, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course, 24th May, ‘62.We have a lecture about the E-Meter. Once there was a cat, and he went sniffing alongcorridors in the open cracks below auditing-room doors. Heh, heh, heh. And after beingbaffled for a very long time, he became a very wise cat. And out of all this we have a singleplea: Use the E-Meter. I know that seems like a lot to ask, but if you use it, it’ll treat you right,and if you misuse it, wrong.Once again we have a complete breakdown in progress that occurred here in September of 1961whereby everybody fashionably was reading the E-Meter cross-eyed with the rudiments wildlyout and everybody was plowing into the ground. And we have come again into that particularperiod."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Now, till recently I have talked to you scoldishly and I’ve said, “Why don’t you make your pcslook good?” Remember? Well, I’ll tell you, your pcs don’t look good because you’re notreading an E-Meter. That’s all. It’s a gross auditing error~imple, factual, horrible tocontemplate, but true. It isn’t the way you are holding your little finger in a session. It isn’t thefact that your thumb is insufficiently callused on the tone arm. It isn’t any one of a thousandthings. It isn’t because you don’t have a command of Model Session. It isn’t because ofsomething weird or wonderful in the pc. It’s just that you’re not reading an E-Meter. That’s all.Now, that sounds horrible, but I don’t think this applies to all of you. It couldn’t. But it mustapply in some degree to all of you because I don’t see anybody listening to this lecture threefeet off his chair.Today all you have to do is just exactly what you have to do. You don’t have to do anythingfancy. And that is a very, very rough thing to get through to you. We actually are there, as faras technology is concerned—been there for some time, but been improving, improving,improving, little bits, little bits, little bits. But, do you know, I don’t know a thing today thatyou could audit on somebody that wouldn’t produce a remarkable gain. See? I don’t knowanything we’re using that wouldn’t produce a remarkable gain on the pc.And I caught you out this way: I audit a pc with exactly what you’re using, he shines. Youaudit a pc, and I get an instructor to check it and your rudiments are all out. How could yourrudiments be out? It isn’t that you’re not asking the exact, proper question. Oh, you’re askingthe right question. But the needle goes over, hits the pin, bends; blue smoke comes out of themeter connection, the sensitivity knob becomes incandescent, and you say, “That’s clear,” andgo on to the next question. And that’s all that’s happening. Honest. Honest. I plead with you.Now, I know you think you aren’t doing it. But Fred was telling me in the break up there, hesays, “You know,” he said, “I had to practice quite a while in practical, and I’ve suddenlyrealized I was just not seeing instant reads. And all of a sudden I started to see them.”There is some kind of an oddball phenomenon that goes this way: Your eyesight shuts off.That’s the only way I can explain it. Now, what shuts off your ruddy eyesight? What shuts itoff?So I had to ask myself this embarrassing question: Did we know what made an auditor turn offwhen he turned the meter on? Do we know that? And up till last night, we didn’t.So I had to figure out what happened. Well, of course, I had the data, but I had to assemble it.And so I can give you this cheerful information. You can stop looking as though I have justbeaten you, because I haven’t just beaten you. You see, if I hadn’t confidence in you, why, Iwouldn’t even try But a few weeks ago I took a look at you all, and I realized that the graysunken cheek, the thick and muddy eye, the dragging of oneself up the stairs, was not beingcaused by your late hours or lack of food or anything else, but must somehow or another becaused by the auditing. And r started on a campaign, at that time, to locate what was wrong.Now, actually I wasn’t trying to look for anything I was just looking to see what was there.This is always a good idea. When you are looking for something, don’t make up your mind,like the psychologist, that you know the something you are looking for before you look. It’svery remarkable. You can look across a whole beach of white pebbles for a white pebble, don’tyou see, and never find one, if you’ve already specified that in order to find a white pebble, ithas to be black, you see, or something odd like this. No, the thing to do is just to go down tothe beach and look, and not even look for a white pebble. Just look and see what’s there.That’s always very good in research. The Ford Foundation, I think it’s 100 million dollars amonth—I think that’s the value of the research as done by the Ford Foundation. About 100million dollars—oh, well, that’s an exaggeration; it’s actually 100 million dollars worth aminute, because of course they get no place. If the Ford Foundation’s research along these"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"various lines was to be chalked up in value, why, it couldn’t be, you see, because they haven’tgotten anyplace.Actually, the Ford Foundation was founded at the—exactly the same day (did you know this?)of the first Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation for exactly the same purposes: to discoverthe basics of human life and the mind. It’s fascinating. And there they are. And it’s cost them,since that time, several billion dollars. And they recently, a few years ago, just after theyinvestigated a HASI in Phoenix, Arizona—they sent a representative down, and he gave areport of some kind or another—they wrote a letter to an enquirer that they had ceased toinvestigate in that particular field. Now, out of that we didn’t know quite what to imply, but wewhipped them.But the idea is that fantastic sums can be spent in research by taking records and compilingrecords and comparing records to records; and the next thing, when you get through, you’vegot some records. They make nice bonfires; you can toast weenies over them.But to date, this type of research which does all the lookingness on a via through symbols . . .You know? We’re going to mathematically compute it all. See, we’ve got a white tree in frontof us, so we’re going to mathematically compute as to whether or not a white tree can exist.And then we figure out that it can’t, and we walk away. See? And that’s very commonly thefate of research.Who was it? Hegel or Hume, or . . . Hegel, I think it was. It was some such bird. Somebodyor other had up and looked through a telescope and had found the eighth or ninth planet or—eighth planet, that’s it—and somebody like Hegel, I think it was, said, “Couldn’t exist becausethe perfect number was seven!” And for several years nobody would admit that it existed. Allthey had to do was train a telescope on it, but it couldn’t exist because the perfect number-wasseven. Therefore, there couldn’t be more than seven planets in this system. That’s what’sknown as looking at the figures, you see, not looking at anything else.So all of this kind of thing, I start narrowing it down. Now, the first observation was youdidn’t glow, see? I’m always looking, and this one I found. See, you didn’t glow. That wasobviously a fact. There was nobody glowing. To prove it: you’re in the basement, aren’t you,here? We’re still using coal. See? That’s enough, see? Proves itself, doesn’t it! So . . . If youwant some mathematical computation to go along with it, I’ll just throw that one in, you see?So from that, I made a couple of assignments. Not necessarily sneakily. I really did just makethese assignments. You see? And the assignments I made was (1) I gave an auditor a list ofquestions—Prepcheck questions to be cleaned on a pc—and I gave another auditor a list ofquestions that had already been asked, to check over whether or not they were live. The bestway to repair a case, you see, on a Prepcheck is to pick up all the questions left alive and cleanthem. That’s the best thing to do. Ho-ho-ho, ho-ho-ho.I also got some rudiments checked by your auditing supervisor, and I was coordinating tonearm against out rudiments. And one of the earlier discoveries on this: when the rudiment is out,the tone arm, she don’t move. Important fact. That’s a new fact. If the rudiments are out, notone arm action. That applies to anything.All right. I went ahead, then, and you saw the results last night of one of these people Ichecked out. This is not necessarily derogatory to the auditors who did this. There’s no point inyou going out and blowing your brains out, because we’ll just have to pick you up in the nextlife and clear you again, see? Nobody is being condemnatory on this particular line. But it isindicative of something, and the thing it’s indicative of is somebody wasn’t reading the meter,because I’m absolutely sure—absolutely sure—that the auditor checked those questions butthey didn’t read right—something. Something, see?Now, a further discovery of this: I find out that the auditor believed the meter did not react, andthat there was some belief present that TR 1 must be out—that the auditor isn’t delivering thequestion hard enough, you see, to the pc, or hasn’t enough control over the pc to make the"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"meter register. See, that could enter in, you see? And a lot of other things. You can explain thisa dozen ways.I actually don’t buy any of that. I think the meter reacted and it wasn’t observed. That was justas simple as that. Let’s take the gross auditing error just as a gross auditing error, not a lot ofmathematical figure-figure over alongside of the thing. Let’s not try to figure out why,particularly, on that basis. Let’s not say the meter didn’t operate and the pc didn’t operatebecause look, this has been several widely scattered pcs, which picked up immediatelyafterwards—one of them by an instructor he could cheerfully strangle (the pc could: thatinstructor couldn’t possibly have anything with that pc but an ARC break)—and every singleone of them reacted.But we can’t attribute it to some other mechanism except just this: He was a-lookin’ at themeter, and the meter wobbled—the needle went bap!— and the auditor didn’t do a thing aboutit. The auditor didn’t see it. That’s the only available explanation. Because other people hostileto the pc, in the pc’s estimation, found the meter operating for them.Do you think it’s easy to sit up in front of that TV camera? It isn’t, man. Not for a pc. Not easyat all. Takes quite a bit as an auditor to hold him in. And you saw those questions falling off thepin, but those questions had just been checked over, and some statement was made that theywere mostly clear. Now, afterwards we found out, although they’d been stated mostly clear atfirst, the auditor said that not all of them were. However, there was one there that the auditorhad said was clear that was not clear on my test, see? Well, that wipes it out. The things werereacting, in other words. In other words, something was happening with the meter and it wasnot observed.And listen to me! You see me crossing this bridge right now. You’re going to cross this bridge.Hm? There’s hardly a one here that isn’t going to cross this bridge sooner or later. You’regoing to stand there speechless, whether in the HGC or an Academy, or with somebody who’shelping you out as an auditor or something of the sort. I don’t care where it’s going to be,you’re going to cross this same barrier, and you’re going to say, “Mrs. Glutz is not doingbetter. Did you notice the blood dripping out of both her eyes when she left the session today?”And the auditor will say—whether student or staff auditor or whoever it’ll be, see—will say,“Well yes, but she’s just a very difficult pc. She’s very difficult.” And if you don’t know whatto do at that point, you yourself will go figure it all out mathematically.The thing to do is to get ahold of the pc and take a look at the pc. That’s your first thing. Andthe pc isn’t better. See? That’s good enough with modern processes. The pc isn’t better. The pcdoes not look better. Therefore, somebody isn’t reading the meter. Bing, bing—something.You wait! You’ll be on this hot seat. And you’ll get Mrs. Glutz and you’ll put her down in achair and you will hand her the cans, and you will say, “Well, now, let’s see, now. Now, letme see. You just had a session. Now, in that session did you tell any half-truth? Untruth?”Tone arm action! “Did you try to impress the auditor?” “Did you try to damage anyone?”There’s no sense going on checking it because the tone arm is now at 7.0. And you’ll turnaround to this auditor and you will say, “Hey, Mike. Hey, hey, hey, bud. What the hell? Whatgoes on?”He’ll say, “Well, they were all in when she left the session.”And you, you idiot, may fall for it. And you’re liable to say, “But then what might it havebeen? Might it be that his TR 1 is bad? Or actually that the pc is so ARC broke that it doesn’tread on the meter for that auditor? Or is it the fact that they were clear at that moment for himbut not for me? Or do they have mutual withholds between themselves which are then comingout because I am checking . . . ?” You know, you can just figure yourself crazy.Now, this is the one you want to figure: The meter wobbled and the auditor was looking outthe window. Don’t figure it any other way, because if you do figure it any other way, you willmiss its cure. Thing to cure is not necessarily the auditor’s eyesight."},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"How can an auditor get in that condition? By invalidating the meter, of course. An auditor cango stone-blind on a meter.Now, how does this come about? The auditor is audited by an auditor who is stone-blind. Justexactly how do we get this chain reaction, see? He’s sitting there early in his career, mindinghis own business, and his auditor says to hiIn, “Do you have a present time problem?”And he thinks, “Oh, my God, if I don’t pay the rent by two o’clock, I’m going to be thrownout,” you see? And he can just feel this thing seethe, you know? And the other auditor—theauditor who’s across from him says, “Thank you. That’s clear.”“Huh,” he says. “You know, that says that didn’t register.” You understand, he couldn’t seethe dial so he doesn’t know whether it doesn’t register or not. He makes the assumption that itdidn’t register. “Didn’t register, see? Feels like a present time problem to me. I guess the Ineteris . . . Well, all right. And I’ll just. . .” He just kind of suppresses it and goes through thesession gritting his teeth.Next session: The night before, see, he was on a drinking bout with this guy’s girlfriend, see,or something like that—whatever it was, it doesn’t matter. “Since the last session, have youdone anything,” or something like this, “that you’re withholding?” See?“Oh boy,” he says. “Man, when he gets this . . . I don’t khow whether I can get this withholdoff or not. Think . . . Ohooooor. I can just imagine him going out and buying a sound truckand driving up and down the streets, you see, with this particular withhold, because that’s whatthey always do with hot withholds, you see? Well therefore, at no time will I . . .” you know?“But if I sit here real quietly and don’t breathe at this moment as he asks the question, be allright.”And the auditor looks at him and says, “That’s clear.”And the guy says, “ Whooh! boy. That was lucky. Man. Whooh! Got away with that.”And this happens often enough to a point where a guy gets the idea that meters don’t read. See,all it requires is for one auditor, auditing another auditor, to make one error—be lookingelsewhere when the meter bangs. Just requires one of these, and you start this chain going.You think the meter didn’t read. And this is very invalidative to the meter. You think metersdon’t read. That’s where that comes in.Well, of course, that happens while you’re in session and you’re kind of non compos mentis atthe time or too interested in withholding what you’re withholding or something like that, yousee, to go into this thing deeply, and so you close that one out. That’s a total suppression. Youforget it, and it lays the most beautiful chain in you ever heard of.You know it should have read and it didn’t read. Therefore, the meter is no good. But yourassumption is the incorrect assumption, so it lasts in space, which is “meter didn’t read.” Thatis a lie. The meter read. And as any lie, it’ll hang up. And it builds a whole chain up withsomebody who is audited this way—builds an enormous chain.The way you clear that chain is you just prepcheck the question “Has any auditor ever failed tofind a meter read on you that you thought should have reacted?” That gets the unknowns out ofit because that’s the most likely area of unknown, even though it’s kind of motivatorish. It’sactually neither an overt nor motivator; it’s just hanging in space. But it’s quite unknownbecause it happened in the middle of the session while the pc was very interested in otherthings, see? So it’s a quick one.One of the ways the ancient medicine man operated . . . I actually, at one time or another, havestudied in this particular field. I remember about 1930 I was very disgusted; I did some study"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"in North America on the subject of becoming an Indian medicine man. One of the fine ways togo about it is to learn how to scream. And if you can let off a good scream, see, that’s gotsawtoothed edges, that is twice as loud as any psycho’s scream, see?—just a good,totalvolume scream—you can stand close to somebody, scream suddenly, utter a commandphrase, and then continue your scream. It’ll go in as a total implant. That is a crude and savageway of implanting, but very effective. This is your old medicine man. Make a terrific amount ofnoise, no noise for a second and utter a command phrase like “You are a pig,” see, interrupt thescream at that point, and then start it again at exactly the same pitch that you stopped it, and goon and finish the scream.The person who heard this scream is unaware of its ever having been interrupted and after thesession will look at you attentively and say, “Oink.” Really will. I mean, this is quiteeffective—quite effective.There would be many ways to go about it. You could take a pistol and put somebody in suddenterror and shoot past his face, and then stop shooting for a moment and say something to him,and then shoot the other three shots, you see? He’d never have any idea that you ever saidanything. It goes into an unknownness and makes a compulsion.This is probably how the ancient magician enchanted things. Possibly princes have turned intodeer in the forest. If you took a period in the magic universe when thetans were still capable ofmocking up their own bodies, and you pulled some shocking stunt on the person andsandwiched them in there that “You are now a deer,” why, he’d cease to mock up the princeand start mocking up a deer, don’t you see, and he would be an enchanted deer. That would behow enchantments were accomplished. I mean, the mechanism of enchantment is no cruderthan that.So when you lay something in like a hellish invalidation of the meter, the person is so involvedin their own think-think and worried, you see, about something or other, already verysubmerged and very withholdy—they get a further withhold on top of the darn thing, just asthough they were being screamed at. You see, they’re with . . . “Meter doesn’t work,” andthen “Meter doesn’t work.” But they don’t know that. E:xcept they can’t read meters. See howyou could do it to somebody?But actually it wouldn’t be just that motivator that made this thing come true. I’m afraid, forany prince to get enchanted, I’m afraid in the former life when he was a magician, he ran into aprince and committed an overt which was actually a motivator. And I think that’s how it all gotmixed up. He did the enchantment and somebody in front of him turned into a deer to hang theguy with his own enchantment. And then, of course, walked around the other side of the treeand became 8 prince again. See, you’d have to haste an incident of that particular kind—theguy commits an overt that he thinks is an overt that is actually a motivator, but he doesn’t knowit is—in order to get some such goofiness started.In other words, a pc is to some degree at an auditor’s mercy. And when an auditor doessomething weird, makes some evaluative remark, the pc might be fogged up at that kind of aninstant, and if it’s too bad—poohie! It isn’t that your auditing, on a long range, is going to doanything, providing you eventually get rid of the person’s GPM. Because all of this hangs upon the GPM. When you eventually blow the GPM, it’ll blow all the rest of it, don’t you see?So therefore, you have to audit in such a way as to not impede the pc from getting Clear. Itisn’t that you can actually hurt a pc, you understand? But the stuff is laying in against theaberrations and the GPM, see? And you got to audit a pc so that the GPM is nor thoroughlyrestimulated, and so at the other end he goes Clear and the GPM blows to pieces. Got it? Andthen all the auditing and everything else comes off.But in the meantime, if you do a rough job of auditing, because the pc is in a rough state, why,of course, you get these implantations inadvertently— quite inadvertent. You have to be carefulwhat you say to a pc who is in session, as you know very well."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Psychiatry, by the way—we find psychiatry hard to understand because the psychiatrist isalways doing something on a goal line that we don’t understand. We say we have a goal line. Iask all of you about this: what your private opinion of why you audit a pc is concerned. But it’suniformly to do something for the pc, help him out, something like that, you see? You all hadthat idea. Actually, psychiatry doesn’t have that idea in treating a patient. They are not trying tomake the patient better or cure insanity or anything like that. They have entirely different goallines. So you find them incomprehensible.By the way, in doing a 3GA, all the people who are incomprehensible are the people whowould not want your goal. Those are the true incomprehensibles of this universe. You justcan’t understand them. And of course, you stop and think of a president of the United Stateswho wants to be a piccolo player, or something like that; you’d have a hard time understandinghis foreign policy. You’d think he was being inefficient in running the nation, whereas heknows he’s being efficient in running the nation. He is handing out enormous sums of moneyto disabled piccolo players, you see, or something like this. So he knows how to mn a nation.He is president so he can go to concerts, see, and that helps out—it’s comprehensible.This would be the way most nations are run. Supposing, by the way, you got all the heads ofstate there are in the world that cause all this upset and misery and got them down the line andactually did a Goals Assessment on each one of them. I imagine it would be terribly revelatory.It would be a kick, man. I mean, you wouldn’t believe it. God! The reasons they want to bepresident or king or commissar, generalissimo . . .Well, this goal line that the individual has is quite important. He’s trying to get Clear, andthings that cross against it are all those things which we classify as auditing errors. You see,he’s apparently being batted back on the subject of his goal. Well actually, smooth auditing isdesigned not to bat his goal back. See? And that’s the definition of what’s right and wrong inan auditing session. Now, that doesn’t mean specifically we have to know what his goal is oranything else. We just don’t impede him on going forward. See? So the things that impede himwe delete from the session.And we get some incomprehensible, like “Do you have a present time problem?” Yes, theindividual does have a present time problem. Oh, my God! you know. It’s an antisocial presenttime problem, or something of the sort, and he really doesn’t want to fess up to it, and he’sright in the line of having to make a horrible admission of some kind or another, and the auditorsays, “That’s clear.”Well, of course, he wanted to get rid of his present time problem, was his basic goal, and hedidn’t get a chance to get rid of it so you’ve gone across his goal line, and you’ve laid one in,and that one that comes in is “The meter doesn’t work.” And he inevitably will make thatconclusion at that moment. It’s actually very upsetting if you go back and analyze the thing andgo over this. You sit there very upset. You’re saying to yourself, “My God! It’s a good thing Igot away with that withhold. Thank God I didn’t have to get off that withhold.” It’s whatyou’re thinking, kind of analytically, you know? “Whoa, oh boy! would that have beenembarrassing. This girl auditor and . . . oh, gee. So happy I didn’t get off—have to get off thewithhold, you know? She said it was clear.... I don’t think it was clear.”Hour and a half later—he’s getting audited all this time, you see—”What the hell was the matterwith the E-Meter?” you know? Well, he has to come to the conclusion it didn’t work. See, theconclusion is—automatically, the response is “The E-Meter doesn’t work.” That’s what’s laidin. FIe knows it should react; it didn’t react. So therefore what should react doesn’t react, sotherefore it doesn’t react. And there’s quite an upset about that.I’ve seen this myself. I’ve had an ARC break—something like this—and the auditor wouldn’tregister, but I would, on the meter. In other words, I could ask myself the question, “Do I havea present time problem?”—the meter would go plang! you see? And the auditor would ask me,“Do you have a present time problem?”—it would sit there absolutely motionless. It was quiteinteresting. I’ve actually seen a meter myself, see? Now, with the auditor I said, “Well now,"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"come on now, let’s look at this. Let’s look at this damn thing, you see? Here’s a weirdphenomenon.” The auditor asked me the question—no reaction I asked the question—reaction.See, I was holding the cans. Fantastic!So the meter can be ARC broke out of existence. But even so, the shock in not seeing the meteroperate was quite something—a considerable shock involved in that operation. You know? Sheasked me a question: “Do you have a present time . . . ?”—doesn’t operate. I ask the question“Do I have a present time problem?”—it operates. “What the hell is going on here?” See? I justcouldn’t believe it, you know? Just stoney-eyed disbelief. Dahhhh. Already have a goodsubjective reality on it—quite a shock. Patched up the ARC break, of course the meter operatedfor the auditor. Wasn’t anything more to it than that.I even remember the time and date of this, because I studied this a little bit further and thenfound out that a meter could be inoperative in the process of an ARC break. But you’d have toARC break the living daylights out of the pc before you got to this phenomena, and I don’tbelieve we really reached this phenomena.That meter, by the way, I don’t think was tuned to sensitivity 16. I think it was at a lowsensitivity. I think it still would have read, one way or the other. But it was quite a shock tome.Meter gets invalidated. At the same time the pc is ATAC broke. Now, the next time this personis auditing, it sweeps, it reacts—perhaps minorly because his rudiments are already kind ofqueasy and the pc is halfway ARC broke. He gets a reaction; he doesn’t believe it when he seesit. You could stack these up to a point where an auditor would simply be stone-blind on themeter. He’d just never see a reaction, that’s all. Or he’d try to explain the reaction, which is thesame thing, you see?You got one going right now which is very laughable. You know all about this, and yet I’vehad a despatch about it, and somebody else has had a despatch about it today. And that is, doyou take the reading during the sentence? Ahh, this is just silly! If you ask yourself, what thehell? What is a reading which you get during the sentence? It’s reading on the various words inthe sentence, not on the sense of the sentence, so of course you ignore it. There’s a prior read;you ignore it. There’s a latent read; you ignore it. The only read you read is the instant read.Bang! If you don’t get an instant read and you want to be sure, try it again. You saw one lastnight when I was auditing. You saw a prior read. Now, you didn’t see me buy it. I said,“Well, we’ll check it,” and there it went that time—it fired. But we were getting some kind of arandom read. Random needles are apt to read almost anyplace, but they won’t ordinarily readtwo times running accidentally. Do you see?Now, you only buy an instant read. Just lay that in with iron, man— instant read. Actually,there is actually no time period at all between the receipt of your question and the response fromthe reactive mind. If there’s any time period, it is consumed electronically. Might be anelectronic lag. I’ve said a half, and a fifth, and a tenth, and I’m just trying to give you an ideaof a small amount of time.I was studying it the other day and I found out it was zero time. It’s actually zero time plus theelectronic lag. That electronic lag is pretty darn— pretty darn instantaneous unless your meter isdamped. And to your eye, you can’t really detect any lag. That’s the only thing you pay anyattention to.There’s only one other time when you use any other kind of read. You never use a prior read.You never use a late read, except this one. There is one exception, and that is when you’rehelping the pc by steering. You’re steering the pc’s thinkingness. You saw me do it last nighton a very broad scale, fish and fumble—very, very broad. I was practically sitting therewaiting for the needle to hit on something so I could ask the pc what he was thinking about,you see? And then you’ve asked a question, you’ve got an instant read, you’ve asked him whatit is, and a moment later you see that instant read repeated, but this time as a needle pattern."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"You see, you see the same read so you say, “What was that?” see, “What’s that?” and so on.That’s steering. See?So it doesn’t matter whether you steer it in a fish and fumble—just sit there and wait for theguy to react on something and say “What were you looking at, at that moment,” you see? “That. . . that . . . that.” That’s just steering. It doesn’t matter whether you do it after you’ve got theinstant read or without any instant read. You could use a meter in that fashion. It doesn’t tellyou anything. You just want to steer the pc’s attention to something. And he, “Oh, well, that.That . . . oh, well, I keep seeing this stuck picture. Uh . . . that’s what that is.” It wouldn’tmatter what the “that” was or what his withhold was. It’s just steering. It’s the only time youever use anything but an instant read.Your instant read is never prior. It never happens before the end of the sentence. These must besingle-clause sentences. It never happens except at the end of the sentence, the end of the word.Now, you can say, “Have you ever damaged anyone?” and get a “you have”—and the personis all ARC broke on havingness, see? “Have,” clink. “You”—do you know, “you” nearlyreacts on all pcs?~link. “Damaged,” clank! See? “Someone,” tick.Oh, you could say to yourself, “Where the hell am I?” Well, just ignore all that earlier stuff,see? Just ignore the lot, see? Just . . . And if you’re not sure, say, “I’ll repeat that. Have youever damaged someone?” and clang, you’ll get your instant read right on the end of “someone “It’s right exactly—it’s just as the tail of the e comes up, you’ll get the instant read. Particularlyon a second repeat, because you kind of have worn a groove, see? You want to take a questionapart—you’ll get “have.” “What about ‘have’?” You’d be a real idiot to do this, see, but “Whatabout.’have’?”“Oh, I don’t know.”“Well, what was that?”“Oh, well, that was the havingness session I had today. The auditor said it was my processbecause it kept tightening the needle.”“All right. ‘You.’ All right. What’s that . . . that . . . that . . . that . . . that . . .”“Well, I don’t know. It must be listing. We keep putting ‘you’ down on the list.”“All right. Fine. Fine. ‘Damaged.’ Yeah, what’s that . . . that . . . that . . .”“Well, I don’t know what that is.”“That. . . that. . .”“Well, what am I supposed to be answering?”“Just that. Uh . . . that!”“But what am I supposed to be answering?”“Well, just that! That’s all.”Idiocy reigns, don’t you see? That’s—this is your prior read. Just ignore the basketful, see? Tohell with them. Same as latent. You wouldn’t do anything with a latent read; well, don’t doanything with a prior read.When does a read become prior? Well, I would say anything up to a non-instantaneousnessbefore you ended the sentence. And when does a read become latent? Any non-instantaneousness after you have ended the sentence. I mean it’s just as idiotic as that. I means"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"we’re actually defining a cheese knife, or something like that. Crazy. I mean that, it’s so easyto read that you could keep missing it, you see? You don’t have to compartment the questionany more to amount to a hill of beans. Ask it two or three times if you’re not sure what it is. Itall of a sudden will straighten out and read.You see, you’re actually talking to a thought to the reactive bank. Most of you make thisfantastic mistake: you think the pc analytically can influence the meter, and he cannot!Absolutely impossible! He can do it on a via by thinking of something that he knows auditorsalways call on him. See, he remembers a session in which he had a missed withhold thatnobody has ever pulled, see? So he could actually go about this kind of a weird one: Every timethey ask him about something, he could think of that session, you see, and he’d get a reaction.But there must have been an unknown in the session. See, he could not-know enough about it,you see, so that he’d get a reaction by thinking of something that he knew he didn’t knowanything about. He could get a reaction. That’s as close as he can get to it. And do you know,it always has a lag? You know, it will always give you a latent read? Because the guy has to sitthere and think about the session, and the time it takes-him to think analytically about thesession gives you a latent read.Now, an instant read can’t ever go through the analytical mind and doesn’t. It Roes strai rht tothe reactive mind. stra.ght as a bullet. See, the reactive mind by definition is something that hasnever been timed, something that is still happening, something that is always now. And itsalways-nowless deletes all time, and that is why you get an instant read. There’s no time in thereactive mind, which is what is wrong with it. So of course it reads reactively nOlV. And youthink the pc knows the answer to what just flicked the needle. Now, look: he can’t move theneedle anal) tically, so how the hell could he know it? See, there must be an unknown onanything that goes flick. I don’t care whether it’s a dirty needle or anything else.Of course, you ask him if he has a present time problem, and he knows he’s got a present timeproblem; he got reminded Of it, you see, just at that moment. Terrific unknowns in this presenttime problem. It’s the unknowns that fire. See? If something is not unknown to the pc, it won’tfire, which is the other denominator of the reactive mind. It is a caldron of unknowns whichexist in “now” always.So, you ask the pc something—it’s because you only get a reactive response—the needle willnot react. You sit there prepchecking somebody. You could get very impatient about it. But itsure makes the pc think if he sees his auditor getting a little bit—crowding him. And he kind ofruns, and he thinks and grinds, and he looks and that sort of thin. The auditor can steer himaround and say, What’s that?” Why does the auditor have to steer him? It’s because he doesn’tknow what it is.Try this on a pc someday, if you don’t like him, if you’ve just been given a bad session by himyourself, or something like that; try this on him: “Say, uh . . . have I missed a withhold on youin this session?” And the pc suddenly feels funny because, you see, he feels the surge just asyou get, electronically, the surge on the meter, you see? So he feels this surge, and he kind ofknows yes, you know?You say, “Well, what was it?” you know? “What was it?” Don’t help him out. Just sit there.And he finally says, “Well, I can’t find—I don’t know what it is. Uh . . .” and so forth.You say, “You know what it is. Tell me.” Don’t help him out. Don’t steer him. You can go onlike this for hours.But the pc is kind of looking around, you know, and you see a flick, you say, “That. . . that.”He’s looking at a table. He’s looking at a picture of a table. Where the hell did that come from,you know? “Hah-hah-hah . . .”"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"“That,” the auditor says.“It’s a picture of a table.” Well, of course, it develops a little bit. He sees a little bit more of it.“Oh, oh, oh, the missed withhold. Oh, oh, oh, yes! I was—that. . .” He recognizes what thetable is. It’s the table on which the E-Meter sits. He was thinking that the thing was awfullycreaky, and he didn’t say anything about it to the auditor, and it springs to view and all of asudden you haven’t got a reaction anymore. Why haven’t you got a reaction? Because it’sknown.So the more unknown underpinnings you have on something, the less reaction—I mean, themore reaction you’ve got, you understand? And the less unknown there is there, the lessreaction. So magnitude of action . . . I beg your pardon, consistency of action—not reallymagnitude, but consistency of action—is determined by consistency of unknown and itsimmediacy in present time, so of course you can get a goal, and the goal will go bang, bang,bang, bang.Well, you don’t know what the hell the goal is sitting in. That’s how that goal fires. We don’tknow the mass that surrounds it. How’s it stay in place? What is all of it? What life did welead? How come we got into that? You know, all kinds of questions like this. And yet the thingwill still fire on the E-Meter. You say the goal—bing. See the goal—bing, bing, bing. Say itevery time, bing, bing, bing. You say, ‘what is the goal?” to the pc, and the pc can tell youwhat the goal is? Of course, that ought to wash out, shouldn’t it? Uh-uh. Bing, bing, bing-bing. That’s why you have to audit them. See, it’s a firing proposition.All right. Now, this unknownness can get buried in. You can bury unknownness in the middleof an auditing session. You can sandwich it in just like the screaming witch doctor. They gotone down in South Africa, yeah— or mostly Central Africa. They walk around . . . Not havingseen it in South Africa; they kind of chased it out underneath the brush, I guess. But get ahorsetail switch for flies, fill it full of fleas, shake it all over somebody, and while he’s tryingto brush them off, say something to him. That’s a version of that. That’s implantation magic.The Russians, being rather Asiatic, do this consistently and continually. Guy is enroute to aquestioning chamber, and a woman dentist with forceps and so forth steps out of a hidden doorin the hall and examines his teeth and disappears through the same door. Shatters him! “Wherethe hell was she from? You know? What is going on?” Typical modern Russian tactic. Boy,these Russians, they go around this way, you know? This was what Pavlov taught them. Idon’t think he had to teach them very nard, for some of them.I notice they made a terrific bid for popularity tonight. Fifteen-year-old boy swam across theriver to get into West Berlin tonight, so they put, from the commie side, seven bullets in him.Mobs of people watching this, and they took him to the hospital with a bullet in his lungs andin a critical condition. Their bids for popularity are really marvelous to behold. They probablythink it’s the thing to do, you know?But they do these surprising things. See? They do a sudden surprise in the middle of an action;that makes an implant. Don’t give them credit for being smart on this. It’s probably adramatization, because they don’t do anything with it. You see?You, knowing that, figuring out “And let’s see, how could we use this politically? Oh, well,easy. We’ll have this guy—we’ll play some Beethoven, and we’ll have some soft perfume inthe room, and lying on a soft couch, and we’ll play some Beethoven, see? And under the table,out of sight, why, we will have the Moscow air-raid-warning siren, the biggest one. And justas he’s all relaxed and listening to this thing, you see, we will press this button, stop pressingthe button and say ‘You are a communist,’ and start pressing the button again.” Guy wouldwalk out; he’d tell everybody he was a communist. We’d have done the trick, since acommunist is more or less a robot anyhow."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"I mean, you could apply these things intelligently. The Russians don’t. You know, it takesthem seventy days to brainwash, and they only get 22 percent. Isn’t that interesting? Youknow, they only get 22 percent? I think this is marvelous, you know? Why do they try? Whydo they try?But this all comes under the heading of that sort of thing. Something that is invalidated secretlyor privately—bang, like that—in a guy’s mind. What is it? It’s sort of interesting. You go overthis. It’ll make more sense when you get these things checked off, because it wouldn’t takevery long to check these things off.You can go on and check it over, of course, on more of an overt proposition, just talking aboutgetting rid of this meter blindness. “As an auditor, have you ever deliberately ignored asignificant meter response?” When I first looked at that question, I thought, “My God!” I justhad E-Meters all over in front of my face. I wrote the question down. All of a sudden thismorning, I was sitting there looking at E-Meters. And I was willing to swear that I must havedone it just every session. For just a moment, just having thought the thought: I must havedone this every session, you know? I just must have ignored significant meter responses. So Ijust sat there, forced myself to remember exactly when they were. They amounted to exactlythree.One of them on you. I said r would take up the rudiments question in the middle of thePrepcheck session. In other words, I said, “Are you willing to talk to me about yourdifficulties?” So r said, “We won’t bother with it now because we’re gonna take it . . .”Another guy I checked out a criminal, and I couldn’t clear it and didn’t believe the meter. Andthe guy ran away with the crown jewels afterwards—you know, some such comparable action.And an early one, I asked somebody a question, and I got a response—an immediate and directresponse on the question—and couldn’t and didn’t follow it up, and never developed it. Andboy, was that fraught with havoc.And there are only three. Think of the thousands of hours I’ve audited. There were three, andthey had stacked up enough to give me an automaticity of meters, meters, meters, meters,meters, meters, meters, meters, meters, meters, meters.... My God, I saw meters going thisway and that way. Get the idea? I mean, they had it stacked right in, see?Of course, the obvious one: “Have you ever invalidated an E-Meter?” And then anotherobvious one: “As a preclear have you ever successfully persuaded an auditor the meter waswrong?” That’s more hazarding it, but I know there are a few who have. And then: “Have youever attempted to invalidate a meter read in order to keep something secret?” And I know somepcs have done that, but you notice in each case it says, “or any version thereof, or any versionthereof, or any version thereof,” and so forth. So you’d have to fool around with it and get thething clear.I don’t mean to invalidate or make you believe that you are going blind and can’t see anymore,or something like that, but the alternative is, is you’re just plain wicked. And you aren’t thateither. The mistakes which could be made are you’re just not seeing the meter bang. See? Youthink that it’s swinging all the time anyway, and you don’t quite see the change of pace. Youreye isn’t educated to seeing the change of pace, that’s all. That would be one.Another thing: Before you investigate this thing and before you investigate your pc, you’vealready got him so ARC broke that the meter won’t read at all. See, it’s your TR 1 just is notresponding on the pc because of the ARC break.And the other one would be some confusion about what is an instant read. Just what is one?Well, of course, you see one, you see one.Last night Suzie was calling off for you just any read that came along, naturally. She wasgiving you read practice, and some of you took it that she was calling them all reads and"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"thought she should have only been calling the instant read. I’ll stop that. Why, she can call justinstant reads next time. You will see these things read. It’s the educated eye.This is the grossest auditing error there is. It is the hardest one to put across. Nobody is tryingto make you guilty, particularly. Well, I have got some ways and means by which you can feeleasier about it. And I don’t say that all of you are doing it, and I don’t say that all of you aredoing it always, but there’s enough of it being done so that those pcs which I have checkedout, or had checked out, in the last few weeks have been found to not—they weren’t clean onwhatever was being asked. Not only weren’t clean on the meter but weren’t cleanphysiologically on the questions.You see, there are other ways to watch . . . You ask a pc a question, and he goes zuuhmm,nyah and uhh and huh-huh and blushes and squirms and . . . Honest, it’s as good as an instantread. You get all those reactions of one kind or another. Of course you add it up.Observation. Observation: that’s the whole thing. The ability to look. I have always been tryingto teach you how to look, here is a direction to look; here is an instrument with which to look.And if I ever will just teach you just to look and to see what you are looking at, without anyinterference or interpretation or anything else, well, I probably would have made a greaterphilosophic splash than any philosopher we’ve had on this planet, don’t you see? So this is thetoughest one to get anybody to do, is just to observe. That’s the tough one, see? Don’t feel toobad. Just work on it. Get practiced up. All of a sudden you’ll be right in there pitching. Okay?Remember, once upon a time somebody delivered me a thing, and they said it was anelectropsychometer, and Jim and I sat up most of the night trying to find out what it did. And itwas actually a week or two before I found out that it read on the needle. So you’re in goodcompany.Thank you."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"E METER DATA: INSTANT READSPART IIA lecture given on24 May 1962Thank you.24 May, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course, A.D. 12.All right. Now, you seem to be considerably interested in what meters do, and you seem to behaving an awful lot of trouble, one way or the other. I was going to talk to you about GoalsAssessments in this particular lecture, but I won’t. I will talk to you definitely about meters.You know, you can get into more holes full of complication than anybody could easily dig youout of in a long while. You get complicated. And if you just would stop figuring and startlooking . . .I remember when, one time, got a motorcycle off the boat, and I was straightening themotorcycle up and trying to get the thing to function out in Camden, New Jersey. I was tryingto get this motorcycle going, so . . . Lights wouldn’t light, you know, and so we keptthrowing a switch, and so forth. And it was just at that time this first cliche—first time I hadput out this cliche, and so on; it was “Look, don’t think,” see, which was very funny.And this little Francis-Barnett British motorcycle had a very complicated Lucas light system—headlamp and everything else. And it was very complicated, very hard to get apart. All kinds ofwires and condensers, and all sorts of things.So I started taking it apart, and took the bulb out and took the wires apart and unhookedeverything. We had parts that were lying around a good square yard. And then I happened tolook down at the battery, and the terminals weren’t connected. We had all the job of putting itall together again. It would have taken about one minute to have put the terminals on thebattery.That was a marvelous example of “Look,-don’t think.” Because I’d sure done a lot of figuringright there on that motorcycle, you see, and the net result was dismantling the works.You get doing this, and you get to figuring out what this is and the significance of that, and thecomplications of something else, and so on. And I know what you’re up against, because . . .There’s a textbook called “Dutton’s” which teaches navigation, and it is the textbook used bythe United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. It’s their key book on the subject. And nodoubt about it, it’s a marvelous textbook. There is no doubt whatsoever that “Dutton’s” is justabsolutely wonderful as a textbook. Not a single datum of any kind on the subject of navigationthat is not to be found in “Dutton’s.” They modernize it, also, every year—it’s marvelous!You open it up, and sentence by sentence they machine-gun you with exact pertinent data withno amplification or further definition of any kind whatsoever. They don’t bother to tell you it’sa textbook on navigation of ships from here to there. They simply start in telling you “This isthe earth and the sun and the planets and the alidade-amplitude angle dihedral in betwixt....”“A barograph is an instrument used to measure barometric pressure. It is read at two o’clock,four o’clock and eight o’clock.” I don’t know; what do you read? You read its directions? Whatdo you read? You read the manufacturer’s label on the bottom of it? What do you do? Well,“Dutton’s” never bothers to inform you about that. They’re above all that, you see?Unfortunately I collided—on a restudy of earth navigation—I collided with “Dutton’s” back inthe middle thirties, hard, you see? There was everything there but an understanding. See?"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"There was no understanding of what this was all about whatsoever, but there sure were hotdata. Man, every datum in it was hot.But there was never any side amplification, such as “You must always precisely locate the exactposition of a battleship.” See? See, it never says, also, that it is sometimes disastrous not tolocate the position of a battleship. Your imagination is never invited. It is a dry feast of barebones. It drove me stark, staring mad. I never learned how to navigate from it.Finally got a book that—I think Mixter’s Primer of Navigation, or something like this, and readthis book, and it didn’t treat it very seriously, and it was very happy about the whole thing, andI dug up a few data from that.Actually, though, I thought it would be easier to go back and evolve the whole thing, so I did.Some time in ‘44 an admiral was walking around on the bridge, and I was calculatingsomething or other, and he says, “Well, I see,” he says, “that you—how is this?” He’d justflown in, you know, from stateside. He wouldn’t be there long because it wasn’t very safewhere we were. And he said, “I see”—he said—”But—but how is this? You’re usingCommander Weems’ new textbook on aerial navigation.” And it puzzled him because it wasjust now in print in the States, and we couldn’t possibly have connected that fast. No, r hadaccidentally evolved it as a simple method of navigation, and somebody else had evolved it.That was all. But it didn’t come from “Dutton’s,” but I imagine it’s now part of “Dutton’s.”And I imagine nobody can savvy it now. I mean, I imagine that’s totally, totally lost.But this is a method of losing information, is you just give a bunch of machine-gun data andexpect everybody to hew the mark on that exact data, and it’s never amplified, you see? So wehave lots of examples of that particular character.It is the importance of a datum that must be weighted. Weighted. You weight the importance ofa datum. And you are so accustomed on this planet— you are terribly accustomed—to studyingunweighted data.Somebody opens up Krishnamurti, and he shows you three places in this book ofKrishnamurti’s whereby it’s exactly parallel to exactly what we say in Scientology, so thereforeKrishnamurti is Scientology. And poor old Peggy Conway—I showed her one day that thesewere totally unweighted data. They had no importance assigned to them whatsoever, but werethere with equal importance with about three or four thousand other datum. These other datawere all there of equal importance, and they were—some of them were really wild data. See”So they were all equally important. in other words, there was no selection of importances.And people keep forgetting this. They think all data are equal, and it’s as big a mistake as toconsider all people are equal or anything else is all equal. Because it’s pretty hard to get anequality. Mathematically it’s impossible to get an equality. You take an apple out here off a tree,and if you had another apple which is exactly the same size, shape, age, skin thickness, patternof the skin, everything else, you’d say, “Well, that apple is equal to that apple.” No, they’renot equal. They’re not occupying the same space. How could they be equal? All thecharacteristics of one apple would have to be equal to all the characteristics of the other apple,and they’re both occupying different positions in space, so they can’t possibly be equal.Now, in order to study . . . I’ve heard this phrase “learn how to study.” I’ve had it thrown atme in very fine universities, very fine schools, and so on. “Learn how to study,” they say, andthen they sit back. We should remember this: that there are several ways of laying out data. Oneis to lay it all out with equal weight with no amplification, no other explanation, nothing toassist understanding; we just machine-gun out a whole bunch of data—brrrr, see? That’ssupposed to be real good. Your technical-scientific writer of today is educated to do this andsometimes criticizes the writings of Dianetics and Scientology because it doesn’t do only this.All right. Now, there’s another way of handling this stuff, and that is to throw it all out withtremendous obfuscations. You sort of interlard it with “Of course, you boob, you couldn’t"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"understand this anyway because it’s all so complicated.” And they do that in various ways.With footnotes: “Refer to Jervis Crack, page 39,” you see? Of course, that book hasn’t beenavailable for the last century. So you’ve had it, you see? Well, what they’re doing is doing apriesthood type of action. And most of the professors writing in modern university, and so on,are guilty of that. They’re trying to create a priesthood.Now, the reason navigation sprung to mind, and the reason I talk about navigation, is they’reexclusively devoted—not this “Dutton”; it’s of another kind—but the navigator himself isdevoted to the development of a priesthood. It is not for nothing that the early navigators of theSouth Pacific were a priesthood. And they were the reigning priesthood of Polynesia. Well,those birds, with a hole in a coconut shell and that sort of thing, navigated themselves all overthe place. Quite interesting how they did it, but it was a priesthood. And they surround thiswith a bunch of magic, and they surround it with a bunch of nonsense of one kind or another.Well, a chemistry professor is just as guilty. He gives you a whole bunch of nonsense.But the reason a navigator springs to mind: if you were to go on a bridge of a naval vessel thathad a navigator and to ask him how he was finding his position . . . He won’t have you shotbecause that’s illegal. Instead of that, he will either ignore you with a contemptuous sniff orutterly overwhelm you with a bunch of irrelevant bunk. That man is totally dedicated to theprotection of a cult. Navigation is what makes him important, and if every fool knew how tonavigate he wouldn’t be important anymore. And that’d be that.The textbook “Bowditch” on this subject... I’m choosing an esoteric field—navigation—notthat you’re interested at all in navigation but just because it’s far enough afield that it won’tconfuse the issue.Bowditch was a fellow up in the New England states who decided that celestial navigationshould be decelestialized. So he did a bunch of tables and things of this character, and he wentout on a China trip; and out of his little manual, which was about quarter of an inch thick, hetaught even the cook to navigate by star sights. It was marvelous. He taught everybody on theship. He was teaching everybody up and down the New England coast how to navigate out ofthis little, tiny book.You should see that book today! Ha-ha-ha! It’s also published by the United States Navy, andit is that thick, it’s that high and it’s that broad. It’s the most marvelous thing for keeping apassageway door open you ever saw.But it has everything in it that has nothing to do with navigation, and it has tables developedwhich nobody has used for ages. And his original tables, I don’t think, are even in it anymore.And yet it’s called “Bowditch.”See, the whole thing has been obfuscated. Whole thing has been masked.That is the way somebody swells up his importance. He makes himself very important: He’sone of the twelve men in the world that can understand Einstein. Oh, I don’t know. If therewas anything there to understand, I think that more than twelve men could have understoodEinstein. I took one of the twelve men in the world who could understand Einstein, and I wentaround to him to have him explain it to me, as the associate editor of the college paper, in ashort article. (I was making friends in those days.) I wanted him to give me a short article forthis college paper so that I could explain Einstein to the student body. He was very insulted. Hewas very upset, but his—I wrote an article.But years afterwards, I was talking to a friend, and he was a pretty good scientist. He wasgood enough to be kicked out of the government; he was one of the sixty-four that werereleased for doing their duty. And he said, “Theory of relativity? Well, let’s see. Mass equalsMC2 well, let’s see if we can’t do . . . I wonder if it couldn’t be explained rather simply.”"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"And so we boiled it down and told it to a kid, and he understood it perfectly. There wasn’tmuch to this. Except what? The vast importance of the person. See? Somebody is using this asa cloak of rare bird feathers, you see, so he can stand before the idol and tell everybody howimportant he is, see?Well, these methods of communication of thought, methods of communication of data . . .Now, we’re in an interestingly peculiar field, because the data that is being communicated is inactual fact totally new data that everybody already has. That makes it very peculiar data indeed.Now, there’s no language that embraces this because language comes after the fact—before thefact, rather— of the data. And so you get a few terms mixed up in it. It’s nothing compared tomedical terms or other fields. Nevertheless, it has the frailty of having new terms. But youhave to have new terms, otherwise everything you described would be a whole package.I could probably dream up an example and say, “Well, the combined impulses derived fromforce and duress in the past which have become forgotten but which are capable of impingingthemselves upon the individual . . .” Wouldn’t you like to say that every time you said “reactivemind”? That would be pretty grim, wouldn’t it?So naturally, you get conversant with this, you start developing a bit of a shorthand. But theshorthand mustn’t itself be terribly obscure, and most of our stuff is not obscure. We don’tinvent words where we don’t need them, but we do invent words where we shouldn’t beconfused.Now, we lack a complete dictionary. That we should have—there’s no doubt about that—sothat you could look up any phrase and understand it better. We’ve been in the throes of makingup a dictionary for years. I had the notes on my desk recently—just a few days ago—to startrecompiling the thing.Trouble is, it’s costly. That’s the only thing that’s wrong with a dictionary. You’d have to puttwo or three people on it for several months to really knock a dictionary together, becauseyou’d have to listen to every tape on which every word had ever been defined at any time andput all the definitions down for a single word immediately following it, and then that would bea worthwhile dictionary. Would also he quite a worthwhile textbook.But it happens to be a labor. It’s mostly labor: listening to tapes, taking down every definition;looking up all the textbooks, taking down every definition, you know; writing each word on apiece of paper, and then writing each definition that has ever been defined for it, becausethey’ve been defined several times.Well, we—that is a barrier. There is no doubt about that. But. what 1 try to do, the way I try toteach you this, is teach you one very simply and try to give you the weight of the datum—youknow, how heavily this is weighted in comparison to other data, see?I tell you, “This one is important,” see? And then because there are quite a few importantdatum, I very often make the mistake of not saying to you that there’s a lot of data along thisline that’s not important, see—that don’t amount to anything; they’re merely interesting. Well, Itell you that—even that too, occasionally. That’s an awful lot of bric-a-brac and phenomena.Well, what happens is that I give you a datum that’s important, and you very often pick up apiece of bric-a-brac that’s right next door to it that is interesting, see, and you get the two thingsconfused. You know, this other one is fascinating. There’s no doubt about it. You start foolingaround with things in the mind and there are fascinating things. The floor of the ‘ead is strewnwith them, man. I don’t know how you can live in there.See? There are many fascinating data—they are terribly, terribly interesting. Why, if I sat downand wrote everything I knew about needle phenomena or phenomena which could be disclosedby a meter, my God, it’d be something on the order of four or five million words! I know"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"tremendous lot of oddities —fantastic things that you can do—all of which amount to a hill ofbeans. They’re just of no importance at all. Amongst all of that, there are only a few importantdata and they are boiled down into that savagely condensed book E-Meter Essentials.Now, that is an example, by the way, of a terrific boildown. The instant read, however, is notdescribed in that book. It is now described in the second edition, but in the original edition it’snot described.Now, obviously, it should also be part of my responsibility to tell you what’s not important.But look, but look: that’s four or five million words, see, compared to a few hundred. Thatwould be a job, man!And you want to know about teaching you some of this stuff . . . What is utterly, staggeringlyfantastic, you see, is trying to guess what you’re going to do wrong next. And I tell you, man,that would keep somebody awake all night if he really worried. You know? I worry about itenough. But trying to guess which way the mistake is going to go . . . Because, you see, it cango into any of those unimportant channels. See? And they’re just infinite in number.Now, right now you’re riding the hobbyhorse of the interim read; the prior and interim read,because the word latent read is forbidden, you see—I mean, the subject of latent reads we’renot interested in. I’ve omitted saying that there’s such a thing as a prior read, see? Well, it isalso forbidden. See? A prior read is as bad as a latent read. You only want an instant read.But what is an instant read? It is that read which takes place immediately after the expressedthought. Now, if you sum that up as a definition, you will see that it precludes—that it isthoughts that impinge, not words, on the reactive mind. It’s thought, not words. You mayexpress them in words, but they impinge in thought. The reactive mind doesn’t actually react towords. The words translate through symbolism into thought, you see? You got the symbols ofthe words, and then that melts down into thought. The reactive mind responds to the thoughtimpulse. So you can have a lot of thought impulses in one thought.“Have you seen any gorgeous, good-looking, luscious, marvelous, sensational women lately?”How many reads would you get? Man, that’s up to you and the gods.Now, because you are thinking the thought, and if you read this as a straight thought through,the reactive bank, at first—only at first—will impinge on every thought contained in the majorthought. So you get a whole bunch of prior reads. And then it finally grooves in that this iswhat you’re talking about, see?The major thought is “Have you seen any women lately?” see? “Have you seen any gorgeous,beautiful, luscious, you know, women lately?” That’s the big thought. And it’ll register as“Have you seen any beautiful women lately?” as well as “you” and “seen” and “gorgeous” and. . . Get the idea?Well, the funny part of it is, is you can groove in the major thought or the minor thought.“Have—you—seen . . .” See? You’re going to get reactions by this time. That’s a sort of apunctuated reading of something. You’re going to get action, action, action, action, and thenaction on the thought.Well, you saw an example in the demonstration I gave you last night of a prior read, and Ithrew it away and asked the pc again because I couldn’t tell if it was a read or not a read. I justthrew it away. I didn’t pay any attention to it. It was the one time in the session when thatoccurred, that something fell on the middle of the last word. Obviously invalid, but it showedthat it might have been instant; it all depended. So I just checked it again. But that onlyhappened—in a whole hour of session, only happened once. See how rare that was?Now, you got the packaged thought. Now, if you repeat that thought through to the pc, youhave restimulated the thought majeure, see—not the thought mineure, the thought majeure. We"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"could have a lot of fun if we were really, fish-end tails, white tie, you know, type of subjecttreatment, you know, on the subject of Dianetics and Scientology, you know? And you wouldbe learning about the thought majeure, you see, and the thought mineure. Oh yeah, we could befancy. Don’t let me kid you.Actually the trick of communicating the whole subject of the human mind with as few words—new words—as we use is quite a trick. That is actually one of the big things that we got, youknow? We don’t have to go four years to study Latin so that we can abuse it.No, the thought “You seen any beautiful women lately?” is inherent in your statement, and somost of the time you simply read it—and “you” almost always will get a reaction, by the way,and so on—whatever it is.All of your interim spots may get a reaction, but you’re only interested in the reaction whichoccurs with the last word—the end of the last word. It’s not after you stop speaking, it’s whenthe whole thought is completed.Therefore, you’d never use more than one clause, but you can even get away with usingseveral clauses and still get a reaction—lot of phrases and clauses, and so forth.But it may take you two, three or four reads to ring it in. That is one of the reasons you read agoal three times: it might fall interimly, might fall randomly. But you want to get the thoughtexpressed. The thought has got to be expressed through to the pc. So you could never read itreally successfully less than three times aloud to get the whole thought, that’s all. The wholethought delivers through.Most of the time, oddly enough, the whole thought does deliver through and react. But just thatonce in the hour’s session, you see—well, we got some other interim reads, but only oneinterim read came so close to the end that a fellow could have made a mistake.Indistinguishably close, halfway through the last word.Well now, the point is this, is the pc’s thinkingness isn’t turning on the read. It’s the pc’sreactingness which is reading. So there’s no understandingness of any kind consulted on an E-Meter read. It is all stimulus-response. There is no understanding of any kind. It’s as thoughthe reactive bank can listen and react. Oddly enough, it can.It is the auditor to the reactive bank, not the auditor to the analytical mind to the reactive bank.That always gives you a latent. read. You got an instantaneous proposition here. Doesn’t matterhow mysterious it is or isn’t. It’s just, you’ve just got an instantaneous proposition. It’s, youread the thought, and it reacts in the reactive mind. And honest, the pc can be doped off, nine-tenths unconscious, goofed off, everything else, and it will still read. I’ve seen a pc sittingthere practically snoring and everything reading. I made several tests on this. I wasflabbergasted! You could have said to him, “Women, women, women.” You got react, react,react, see, just this nice pang! pang! pang!—three instant reads, nice strong ones. And youcould have said, “What did I say?” And he’d say, “(snort) What? What’s this? What? I don’tknow. What did you say?” He didn’t know, either. See how crazy that is?Until you actually explore that, it still looks to you as though you say something, the pcanalytically hears you and then reacts to what you said, and it is not that cycle at all. That is notthe cycle which takes place. I don’t care to elucidate even what cycle takes place rather thaninvent knowledge, but that cycle does rat take place. See, I can tell you which one doesn’t takeplace.You say it and he reacts. What reacts? Reactive mind. And that’s got to contain timelessnessand not-knowingness in order to get a reaction. If you don’t have timelessness and not-knowingness, you don’t get a reaction on the meter. It’s as simple as that. If he thinks ofsomething in order to get a reaction, you always get a latent read; you don’t get an instant read."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Oh, you want black magic? There it is. The reactive mind of most people is black enough.Look at the GPM sometime.But of course, you have all of your latent reactive thinkingnesses of former identities arestacked up there like Genghis Khan’s pyramid of skulls. There’s plenty of them. And all of thatcombined thinkingness and reactingness and so forth has amounted to a GPM. So it’d bewonderful and marvelous that it didn’t respond. But remember it—it, I said. It, not the pc.Actually, this is technically incorrect: “How did the pc respond on the meter?” The pc neverresponded on the meter! It did. It did. And when it responded, it did it instantaneously, exactly,peculiarly, at the end of the thought majeure.I’ll hang you with one just so you can feel upstage. So if you’re at some party sometime wherethere’s nothing but professors, you could say, “Well, we mostly deal in the thought majeure.”But there is this weirdity. Now frankly, you think sound travels at eleven hundred feet persecond, and so forth, and such. And undoubtedly there are lags developed in here because ofsound, and so forth, but remember, I don’t know that. See, this is to some degree an inventedpiece of knowledge.And we could calculate it out and say that the auditor’s length of time to pour out to the end,plus the length of time of his voice impulse to the pc’s ears, plus the length of time to thereactive bank, plus the time consumed in restimulating the electrical responses of the reactivemind, plus the lag of the E-Meter would be how long it took for the read to read instantly.Now, I don’t know, maybe we could sit on one mountain top and have an E-Meter lead fromMont Blanc over to Mt. Punk, or something of the sort. And we yodeldeehoo, you see, acrossand ask some restimulative question and see how long it takes, and measure the electricalcurrent and measure the amount of time in the air; and maybe we could do a lot of things likethis and maybe we could learn a great deal. And I’m sure if some professor liked to mountainclimb, he would spend the rest of his life establishing that fact. However, we’re moreinterested in the subject majeure rather than the subject mineure. Anyway.So, the main thing we’re interested in is the thing reacts instantly, and it reacts instantly at theend of the thought. And, of course, it will react to interim thoughts. You say, “Have you, youswine, damaged any pigs lately in this session?” See? Well, now you’re throwing yourself acurve if you add “in this session” because it’s a clause after the thought. The modifying clausecoming after the thought fumbles the whole thing up. So you should say, “In this session,” andthen you should drop the interjection “you swine,” and you say, “In this session, have youdamaged any pigs?”Now, this is the liability of reading a meter. Supposing the pc has an item called pigs. Nowyou’ll get into one of the world’s most marvelous tangles, because it’s reacting on the word“pigs,” and you don’t know whether it’s acting on the thought majeure or the thought mineure.You don’t know which is which. And that’s the only time you can really get tangled up.Say the pc’s goal: “to catch catfish.” And you’re trying to test out the way to list it. Now,“Want to catch catfish,” you know, “Who or what would not want to catch catfish?” “Who orwhat would not oppose catching catfish?” “Who or what would oppose catching catfish?” willall react on an instant read just like the goal, won’t they? Isn’t that horrible? That’s veryconfusing, because then you can’t tell which is the right phrasing to line up on unless you readthem two or three times to groove it home, at which time, oddly enough, the goal will nolonger react as the goal but will only react as a thought majeure. And that’s a little test that youought to make just to convince yourself, show yourself what it is.Take some highly restimulative interimly-worded sentence—I don’t care what it is—that as amajor thought adds up to a whole, that you know would be hot on the pc. He’s got some olditem that’s still in, see? Some kind like this. Put that on the end. And then you will see, after"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"you have read it about three times, that it only acts on the thought majeure and will not act onthat item. But the item will act separately.You can take the item out of the sentence. Even though it occurs to the end of the sentence, youcan take it out of—it’s just marvelous, you know?— and you can set it out there all by itself,and you say, “Pigs, pigs.” First time, it doesn’t react; it’s cautious, see? “Pig.” Now you say,“Pigs, pigs, pigs, pigs.” After that, “Pigs, pigs, pigs, pigs, pigs.”You put it back in the thought majeure: “In this session, have you injured any pigs?” No read.This is mysterious, man. Of course, it might read the first time as just an additional “pig,” butthen groove it in again—groove it in again. “In this session, have you injured any pigs?” No, itwon’t react. Mysterious!Now, the mysteriousness of it is, is below the unknowingness there is a terrific power ofretention in the reactive bank. It is another one of its characteristics. It has fantastic continuity,fantastic survival. Otherwise it wouldn’t be here. And what is put into it then acquires thischaracteristic of fantastic survival. So you have time, not-knowingness and survival. So whatyou pour into it will continue to react.The delicacy of its operation is another astounding thing. If the goal is “to injure pigs”—that’sthe actual goal—and the wording which you have on the list is “to injure a pig,” at first “toinjure a pig” will react and will then cease to react, and will react and it’ll splutter and monkeyaround, and you won’t quite know what you’re doing on the thing, and all of a sudden thepc—you can never change it for the pc—the pc is liable to say, “Oh, well, that’s—that . . .that’s to injure pigs.” Pang! It’s a marvelous precision. This is an old study in Dianetics, is thefantastic precision with which this thing will do it. “To injure pigs,” that’s fine. it’ll react fromthere on out. See? But “To injure a pig”—sporadic, not in.Don’t also think that total retention is total wisdom. It isn’t. So you get this kind of acircumstance where if you’re a tiny bit offbeat you won’t get the reaction.Now, oddly enough, you can get a generalized thought which is close enough in to get thereaction, and that’s where you get your What questions from. That’s why you actually ought tofish for your What question. “What about wrecking cars? What about stealing and wreckingcars?” The pc unfortunately used the word “swiping cars,” and you’re trying to get on “stealingcars,” and my God, you never get a What question.Last night we had a word. If I’d used any other word than that exact What question, if I hadn’tused the word conned, it wouldn’t have reacted. The pc said it so that must be at the base of thechain of the overt. Your clue must be taken from the pc.Now, you can play ducks and drakes with this thing. You can throw it all over the place, andso forth, as long as a central pin stays there to hook in and identify. You got to have somethingthat will identify. You got to have a thought that associates, and so on.Well, you’re doing an interesting thing. You’re taking the whole of an overt act, which was allin terms of action anyhow, and you’re putting it in terms of English, which it might not evenhave occurred in, and that thought embraces the action which took place which was the overt.Oh, my God! Nobody would be able to build a machine that did it. That would be utterlyincredible. And yet the reactive mind can do that much of a stretch.But “What about stealing a lot of cars? What about stealing cars? What about stealing andwrecking cars?” Bang! On another instance the pc said, “Well, I swiped a—a scooter.” Andyou say to him, “What about stealing children’s toys?” You know? BBC, you know, type ofresponse. Nothing happens. See, you have to sound out your What question.Now, you can alter it this far: “What about swiping toys?” That’ll be dead on. That’s okay."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"But you altered the doingness, you see? And the thought of the doingness shifted. You have tokeep that pretty well the same, don’t you see? And you have to have at least some associatedobject, to make this thing react, but it will react every time.The odd part of it is, why does it react after “toys”? Why does it go “toys,” see—”toys” click.Why? It’s the total thought. All I can tell you is it does. And if you have a question which reads“What (tick) about (dirty needle) stealing (tick) toys? (fall),” you ignore everything but the fall.You don’t do another blessed thing with a prior read. You just skip the lot. If it doesn’t fall atthe instant you said “ s.. .” See, “toys,” “toys” (fall). If it falls at “t—” (fall), it’s not an instantread.Don’t tell me why the reactive mind does this. I couldn’t care less. Just take it from me that itdoes. Then it cleans up and everything squares up and the pc feels better and it falls apart. It’salmost as if it’s drawn itself a complete plan of “how you take me apart.” Most fantastic thing.All you had to know about the whole thing from beginning to end was exactly—you had to beable to look and observe.Interim reads are so common that if you tried to pay any attention to an interim read on “Haveyou tried to damage—in this session, have you tried to damage anyone?” Suppose you’reasking such a question, and it fell on “damage”—you knucklehead! The worst you could do—you saw me do it one time on an earlier session; I wrote “damage” over in the margin. I knew itwould be a hot Prepcheck question, but ignored it for that because it didn’t fall on “anyone—.”See? It’s just a curve of the e and then the action. See, “In this session, have you tried todamage anyone”—uhp! There it goes, right on that e, see? Not earlier, not later, but right on.Marvelous. Why it works this way, God knows.You know, I think even people with the big-thetan theory would—would doubt—would doubtit. It’s too incredible. But that is the fact. And you’ll find out this pans out every time. You findout if you clean off that instant read at the end of the thought major, you’ll be all set. And if youstart monkeying around with the interim reads of the thought minors, you are going to fall onyour ‘ead every time.Now, you very often will get into severe trouble putting together goals. “To go out and pickpotatoes and sometimes have a girl in the potato patch.” Man! And it falls on “to go out,” and itfalls on “and pick potatoes” and “to have a girl,” and it falls on “potato patch.” And there’s noinstant read after “patch.” After you’ve said it three times, there is no instant read after “patch.”Well, I’d say it has something to do with the goal, probably, in some version or form oranother, as it will eventually arise. And I’d get all the invalidations and the missed withholdsand suppressions off of listing.That’s another one I should take up with you. I’ll take it up with you right now. When I say“listing,” I don’t mean items. When I say “Take it off the subject of listing,” I don’t mean takeit off the items of listing. When I say “listing,” I just mean listing. You say, “Is there anymissed withhold on listing?” See? “Have you suppressed listing?” “Have you invalidatedlisting?” “Have you ever committed an overt with listing?” That’s the way you phrase it, see?That’s listing. Listing. It is a subject. You could even say “goals listing.” And when I tell you“items” or “individual items,” why, then, I mean a goal or an item or a straight line.“Is there any item on this list which has been invalidated? Thank you. Is there any item on thislist on which there is a missed withhold?” Too complicated a phraseology, you can’t get acrossthe thought majeure easily, so you say, “Is there any item on this list which has beeninvalidated?” Say it the second time. And you get your click. Marvelous to behold; you’ll getyour click, and you clean that click off.There is the subject of listing, and then there’s the subject of goals, there’s the subject of itemsin general; all of these things are different things that you can do things with, you understand?"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Now, in this rundown of the goal, if you don’t get your instant read on the end of the goal bythe third time you’ve read it, it ain’t it. And you certainly better ignore it. But very possibly—not positively at all, but very possibly— potatoes have something to do with this goal, ormaybe it’s girls have something to do with the goal. Of course, we can’t guess.Now, I’ve even gone so far, experimentally, as to try to pick out all of the various words thathave reacted and put a goal together for the pc. Doesn’t work. Evaluates for the pc and throwsthe whole thing into that. The pc will give it to you eventually. You get all the withholds off thesubject of listing, all the withholds off the subject of auditing, all the withholds off the subjectof items, goals, that sort of thing, any overts that might have occurred in this direction—justexplore around, get them all over—and all of a sudden you say, “Well, are there any moregoals?”“Oh, yap, yap, yap, yap, and yap, yap, yap and yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap,‘To lay girls in the open.’”All right. You’re nulling on down. There was your potato patch. See? Only this one will go“open” (bang!), “open” (bang!), “open” (hang!). You see your read? instant read, instant read,instant read every time.It does not matter how many reads you get that are prior to the instant read. You ignore them.Please believe me. You just ignore them. it does not matter how many reads you get after theinstant read. Ignore them. But you must put across your thought majeure to the pc. And if yougot the thing all participially occluded, why, prepare to stand there for several reads before it’llfinally embrace.But oddly enough, no matter how complicated it is—I don’t know, I think you could probablyget a fall on Uncle Tom s Cabin where it says “The End”; you get your instant read, you know?But you would have had to have read it to the reactive mind fifty or sixty times, and I don’tthink anybody could stand that.So, that stable datum—get used to that stable datum, live with it, and you won’t have anytrouble on the thing. And God almighty, never ignore one. Teowuwtsw! Never ignore one.On the subject of rudiments, middle rudiments, something like that: “A little while ago when Iwas talking to you about that goal, did you get an ARC break?” And it goes zumph-zzm—ARCbreak, goal—zzzm-zzzumph, you know? “A little while ago when I was talking to you aboutthat goal, did you get an ARC break?” Now you’ll notice there’s less randomness in it. “A littlewhile ago when I was talking to you about that goal, did you get an ARC break?” Clank! Youput the thought majeure across, and it now is impinged, and it will react. But why did it take solong? That’s because it’s so complicated.You would have gotten your instant read like this: “In this session, have you had an ARCbreak?” Clank! See? Simple: fast. Complicated: takes you a while. A complicated thoughtmajeure takes a lot of pounding before it is finally embraced and will give you an instant read.Now, you say, “In this session, have you told a half-truth? Untruth?” see? That packagequestion possibly leads you astray, because there you are using a packaged bunch of instantreads. Actually, you’re shorthanding “In this session have you told a half-truth? In this sessionhave you told an untruth? In this session have you tried to impress me? In this session haveyou tried to damage anyone?” See? Oddly enough, you could package the whole thing togetherand use the interim reads. Oddly enough, only that one will go down; particularly after the thirdor fourth or fifth session with the pc, because the reactive bank is now grooved into thatthought majeure. They’re very obliging. A pc who is under control really responds.This is all rather incredible. Why does the reactive mind react? Why does the E-Meter work?Well, I won’t be so stupid as to try to force on you the same orders that the six hundred had atBalaklava. (Which is some sort of musical instrument they didn’t play well!) There’s this type"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"of think about this: I could say to you, the instructors could say, everybody could say to you,“Now, look! When it gets an instant read, read it! Now, you don’t have to understand it.Just—when it gets an instant read, read it that way. That—that’s it!” See?And you say, “Yeah, but why does it read that way?” see, and so forth. You’ve got a perfectright to ask that question, see? Got a perfect right. Why does it only give an instant read? Andwhy can you groove in a thought majeure? And why does it sometimes read on the thoughtmineure? See? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Like little Arthur says, see? You’ve got aperfect right to say that.And I got a perfect right to tell you “I don’t know!” It just does! This is a whole set offortuitous accidents based on direct lookingness and on no figureness. There’s very little thinkinvolved with this thing, you see?The E-Meter itself, I think, was a Decca voltmeter which a guy held both sides of, and itreacted, in its most primitive state. I think it was Richard Saunders at Elizabeth, New Jersey,was monkeying around with this. He wanted to show doctors that there was a response, and heknew they would look at meters. So he pinched the living daylights out of a pc, you know—made him black and blue, you know—while they were holding on to this thing, and then toldhim to recall it and got the same response on the meter.Well, fortunately today we’re not dealing with that level of insensitivity on the subject ofmeters, because think of how you’d look at the end of session.But this was picked up one way or the other or independently gone at by Mathison. I gave alecture, described what kind of an instrument we really had to have. Mathison went home andhe breadboarded one up. It functioned remarkably well for its original state. It was verylimited. Pcs went off the top of it and went off the bottom of it with the greatest of ease. I thinkthey possibly still do on Mathison’s.But anyway, time went on and around Washington, why, I eventually thought it would be agood thing to have this one, and Don Breeding and the rest of the boys got scratching theirhead over this thing, and old Joe Wallace, and so on. And they kept hanging things together.And then they’d do a perfect one, you know, and then they’d scrap it because they could doone that, you know, behaved electronically better, you know? And I’d take a pistol out of mydesk and hold it on them and make them build the first plan.And then they’d put fifty on the line or twenty-five on the line, or something like that, andcome back and tell me that if they just eliminated the ruddy rod and put a couple of condensersthere that it’d work much better. And I’d say, “No, you don’t. You build the original one,”see?And they built some of these other ones, and they responded perfectly electronically, but theydid not respond mentally. This meter responds mentally. Anybody alters that meter, it’spractically over our dead body because it’s just empirically worked out. It’s marvelous that itworks at all.But, do you know, people give you explanations for the working and for the circuit and for thisand that about this thing. They’re talking in their hats. They’re talking through their hats. Theycan give you all of the stuff, and so forth, but that stuff all got assembled in there on the basisof just breadboarding something.Now we’ve developed theories as to how this thing works. Now we’ve developed all kinds ofthings. There’s a magnetic thing in here that swings that.... We’re dependent on James Watt,Edison, all the modern electronics guys, transistors, everybody else, on all of their know-how,but this hung together makes an E-Meter. Why? I don’t know."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"We’ve got a doctor’s meter. Costs several times what one of these things cost. Reg got me one.We played around with that thing. It doesn’t work. We don’t know what it does, but it doessomething else. The needle goes by so fast, you can’t even see it go. We’ve learned exactlynothing from it, which I think is marvelous, except this one fact—you all knew that—that’sdoctors are frauds. But we have an example of this: they’ve tried to copy our E-Meter, and theyjust haven’t gone anywhere with it. They couldn’t tell anything with this thing. It’s marvelous!And we got it, and I’m glad to have it! It’s not a wasted instrument. There is the peak ofmedical electronics.Now, why does it work? Why does the reactive mind do this?What you figuring for? For God’s sakes, the thing is laid out on a red carpet. This is how itworks, this is how it reacts and this is how you use it. Oddly enough, it’s invariable—utterlyinvariable.Now, one of these days you’re going to get Clear, you’re going to get very bright, you’regoing to figure out exactly why an E-Meter responds this way, exactly what wavelengths thethetan operates on in order to put a reactivity together, exactly how many condensers fittogether amongst the ruddy rods. You understand? And how you can all do it on thoughttransference and set up an EC-Meter on a table and read President Coolidge’s reasons why hewouldn’t run, you see? Read through time.Yes, by all means get in that shape! Yes, by all means get that design. When you do, write mea letter. I’ll publish it.There’s more phenomena around this subject—not just this meter—than you could easily countup on an IBM Comptometer, and there’s an awful lot of particles in one of those.Now, where do we got the figure? Where’s the think?Reg’s engineer, who is a sharp apple—you see him around here once in a while—he has a hardtime with this, man. It violates all of his principles of electricity and the body and everythingelse. This thing is a ghost instrument. He concluded the other day that, well, there’s nothingelse to register there but thinkingness, or what did it? or how did it? or something.It wasn’t that he was baffled that this reacted against the mind, because that’s rather common.He’s baffled about other things. He always thought it worked on the amount of sweat, and thenhe suddenly realized that you can’t sweat and unsweat that fast. So there must be somethingelse involved here, and a lot of things. But you walk up to most guys and they’ll tell you it’ssweat—measures sweat. All right. Good. Measures sweat. I don’t know what that’s got to dowith it either. It doesn’t measure sweat. It measures think.But there’s a lot of boys can put these meters together that don’t measure think. Oddly enough,you can put the commonest type of Wheatstone bridge together and give it no damping, and thething oddly enough will register even think. So there’s nothing very mysterious about it.The mind is hung together electronically, it’s hung together with electricity. There are standingwaves, standing masses, in it which are timeless. These things are drifting along in presenttime—and it obeys all of your electrical laws and impulses.But remember something: the human being is the author of this universe and he’s also theauthor of all the electronics in this universe. Actually, there are flows and currents in the humanmind that have not yet been discovered in electronics. See? That a junior subject can now studya senior subject is, of course, a weird joke. But it can, which is quite peculiar."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"Now, you’re not interested in why an E-Meter reads really, unless you want to do someresearch in that particular line—beyond this one thing: a thetan is an electric eel and it measureselectric currents. That’s about as close as I care to come to it myself. I never speculate on this.But you talk about oddball, offbeat data on the subject of the E-Meter. Why does the meter gotickity-tick, back and forth, with an exact pattern every time when a person wants to leave or goaway or blow out of his head, or so forth?The theta bop. The study of the theta bop could be very long and very involved. I can tell younumerous ways to produce a theta bop. Lots of ways. “Did you ever think of leavinganybody?” You get a theta bop, you see? “Did you ever think of dying?” You get a theta bop.“Try not to be three feet in back of your head.” You get a theta bop. Shoot him with a .45,you’ll get a theta bop. I mean, it’s an interesting thing. Well, we get the coordinative actionthen, and one of the ways that you could deduce or surmise that people could exteriorize andwhat exteriorization was and how people leave their bodies at the time of death and that sort ofthing can be traced with a theta bop.What do you want to trace it for? Why don’t you just learn how to get out of your head and seehow it is and get back in again. See? You don’t have to figure these things out because you’reon the main road anyhow. You don’t have to go at it with a bunch of logics and substitutes,because it’s there to look at. So you can go around picking up pebbles all over the road. Youcan get them in your shoes. You can fall in the ditch. You can run into milestones and culvertsand bridge abutments and the neighbor’s fence. You can do all of these things, but let me call toyour attention that there is a main highway, and you can go down it at 110 miles an hour.And it’s the instant read; prior reads don’t count; latent reads don’t count. Just instant reads,that’s all. And the instant read will abide by the major thought that you’re putting across to thepc and, oddly enough, will occur exactly as though somebody over there had been informedwhen you were going to stop talking. Probably the OGPU or the NKVD. I don’t know, theyhave an intelligence service involved.You can be very mysterious about the whole thing, but the funny part of it is, it becomesterribly simple. And when you look at it in that way, when you clean up everything in thisway, E-Metering becomes very odd.Now, if you’re so involved in prior reads and so involved in latent reads and so involved inwhy it reads, and if you also have a number of invalidations of the meter and also suspect that itdoesn’t work because it hasn’t worked on you—you see, one day it didn’t read when youknew it should have read—why, naturally you’re going to have a hell of a time with a meter.So break it down to that simplicity. Look at the only important read that is on the machine andyou’ve got it.The only other thing I can tell you about a read is when it goes more than one simple read, it isa dirty needle and is measuring, somewhere on the track, a missed withhold.All the goals and items that you want have a single tick. The only reaction you will get on aproven goal item—single tick.Double tick? Then the whole goal or item is a missed withhold. Soon as you get the missedwithhold off, it’ll no longer read. Missed withholds are always more than one tick. You neverhave goals and items finally proven out with any other pattern.I have seen some prove out with a rock slam. I’ve seen some prove out with a rock slam. Butlaterly, I have realized that there wasn’t much of a list every time that occurred. If there’d beena little bit more of a list, they would have proved out with a tick. It’s all right as a goal, but Isee these things months and months afterwards when they’ve settled down, and they all proveout with a tick. You understand? That’s all you’re really interested in with a meter."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Now, you talk about speeded rises, speeded falls, slowed rises, slowed falls—yeah, but thoseare all instant reads. Now you’re talking about out rudiments. Now you’re talking aboutreading the significance of the thought majeure, but it’s still an instant read. It is merely achange of needle pattern. So there’s significances about what this read is and what that read is,and I’ve just rattled them off to you. See?There are no more than that, you see? The dirty needle is always a missed withhold. That’s adouble-tick arrangement. Any change of needle pattern at the instant you’re finished is aninstant read. And that goals and items when they check out, if they’re valid, turn out to besingle ticks.Frankly, you could get along with just the data which I’ve given you in this lecture, and if youapplied that and didn’t go scrambling around the road for a bunch of new data, why, man,you’d have all the rudiments in, you’d be sailing and everything would be fine. Okay?Audience: Yes.I don’t say stop thinking. Think all you want to. But don’t stop looking.Thank you."},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"COMM CYCLES IN AUDITINGA lecture given on25 July 1963All right. Beautiful, sunshiny day here; cherish it. Go out and make a facsimile of it.This is what?Audience: 25 July.25 July. What do you know about that? A.D. 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course.The auditing cycle. Once upon a time there was an auditor and he knew he could audit; he knewhe could audit. But pcs, they just wouldn’t pc worth a nickel. And the auditor said, “Well, I’llhave to get out of Scientology because pcs are no good.”You’d be surprised how often this line of logic—ha—gets in the road. Most auditors, early on,have a definite idea that there’s tremendous variation in pcs, and that some pcs can be auditedand some pcs can’t be audited, and that there are good pcs and bad pcs, and all different kindsof pcs.Well, there are worrisome pcs, but just to the degree that you can’t get them to get tone armaction. And some pcs are closer to aquiver on the subject of a communication breakdown thanothers; they’re more nervy. Those things are true. But practically no pc can stand up against agood auditing cycle, you know, and say, “Well, I’m going on being aberrated for the rest ofmy days because that makes everybody wrong and makes me right.”The difficulty that an auditor gets into is normally found in his own auditing cycle and his ownimpatience. His disabilities in this particular line are last detected by himself. In other words,he’s really the last to find this out.If an auditor wants to polish up his auditing, I recommend putting a piece of session on a tape,at least a piece of a session, and then listening to that tape back, and not listening to theramifications or the flubs. Anybody is liable to make a duplicative-type flub, you know. Like,you’ve had to change your auditing command—you heard me make one the other day on thattape. I had to change the command, because I was getting so much bang out of “mainly” that Ihad to put “mostly.” And then I was grooved into saying “mainly,” and my concentration, ofcourse, was for the pc, and I was slipping up and I was occasionally saying “mainly” againwhen I was trying to say “mostly.”Well, you’re liable to pick on that kind of thing as being a very important error. Actually, itisn’t very important. What’s important is: Did you complete your auditing cycle? See, it reallyisn’t how gracefully you completed it, but did you complete it?There are two communication cycles that make up the auditing cycles, and those are: cause-distance-effect with the auditor at cause and the pc at effect; and cause-distance-effect with thepc at cause and the auditor at effect. Those are completely distinct, one from the other.Now, the only place they impinge on each other at all—and this is the only thing that connectsthem and makes an auditing cycle—is the fact that the auditor, on his cycle, has calculatinglyrestimulated something in the pc, which is then discharged by the pc’s auditing cycle.So you see, you’ve kind of got a V lying on its side. You see, you’ve got the upper V herewith the auditor at the top of the wing, you see, and he’s cause, distance, effect; and here at thepoint of the V, you customarily think of that as just one turn. Actually, there’s a complicationright there: It’s what the auditor has said has caused a restimulation at that point, and then the"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"pc is honor bound to start an auditing cycle to get rid of the restimulation. Can you see that?And that is the game that is being played in an auditing cycle, and that’s the entirety of thegame. There’s nothing else esoteric about it at all.Don’t think otherwise than that the auditor is restimulating the pc. Now, some auditing—someauditing—breaks down because the auditor is unwilling to restimulate the pc. Now, you’ll seethis on a gross level when somebody said, “I had to stop auditing him because the somaticswere so great.” You see? I’ve actually heard somebody say that—seriously.And I think to myself, “The poor pc, man.” At that point of the V where those two cometogether and where effect turns into cause, where the pc is there, at that point, you have arestimulation and then the necessity of answering the question to get rid of the restimulation.Now, if the pc doesn’t answer the question, the pc does not get rid of the restimulation. If healter-ises at that point, then every restimulation is going to become an alter-is. And all pcs whoare having any trouble alter-is at that point of the V.Here, I’ll draw you a picture. [See Lecture Chart] Here is your V. And this is cause and this isdistance and this is effect. Now, here’s your auditor, see? And here’s the pc. Now, at thispoint here is where you get your restimulation factor. And this point is again, now, cause-distance-effect, see? So we get cause-distance-effect, see? And that’s what an auditing cycle inactual fact looks like.Now, there are some little inner cycles—there are some little inner cycles that throw you offand make you think that there are some other things to the auditing cycle. And these little innercycles are when you get cause-distance-effect, and he has answered the question, the auditorthen says, “Thank you.” Well, actually, that’s a shadow. And this now starts the shadow back,you see? You understand?See, there’s a little extra communication cycle on here; it’s an extra cycle, see? And you havethis as the acknowledgment cycle. So you have here an ack, and of course that goes this way,you understand, and is received over here; and that’s all there is to it. That’s a little fade-out,don’t you see?Well, I very often berate you for being not perceptive, and not auditing the pc and not seeingwhat’s happening to the pc, or what’s going on there, don’t you see? So I get this kind of anaction here: There is another one of these little shadow cycles. The pc has received the auditingcommand. And that is such a tiny cause that nearly all auditors who are having any troublefinding out what’s going on with the pc are missing that one.You say, “Do birds fly?” and then you fail to perceive that the pc received the auditingcommand. Now, that’s because he doesn’t say anything. See, here’s your main cycle: cause-distance-effect; “Do birds fly?” See?And the pc says, “No.”Well, actually, there’s another cause in here; there’s another little tiny one, and it’s right hereand it’s a little c, see? And you’re missing that one where you’re not perceiving the pc. Does hereceive it?You say, “Do birds fly?”And he says . . . That’s all the cause that is emanated at this point, by the pc. See, he just . . .See, that would be exaggerating it.But you can tell by looking at him that he didn’t understand what you’d said, or that he wasdoing something peculiar with the command he was receiving, you see? Doing somethingpeculiar with this command."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Well, it’s actually whatever that message is that is in response here, whatever message that is,does ride on this line. And an auditor who isn’t watching the pc at all then never notices a pcwho isn’t receiving or understanding the auditing command; and all of a sudden, somewherealong the line, there’s an ARC break, and then we do assessments and then we patch up thesession and all kinds of things go wrong. Well, they actually needn’t ever have gone wrong inthe first place.What is the pc doing, completely aside from answering? Well, that what he-is-doing is thisother little sub-cause-distance-effect line. So a complete auditing cycle consists of no less thansix communication cycles, if you really want to get it down to the last ramifications. But theimportant ones are four. You’ve got four communication cycles.Well, where are the other two? Where’s the other two? They’re so tiny that you wouldn’t reallynotice them, but they are there. Cause-distance-effect of “Is the pc ready to receive an auditingcommand?” See, is he ready to receive an auditing command? He’s going, “Oh, rum-rum-rum-rum-rum.” Well, that action is actually pc causing, isn’t it? And it has to ride up the line acrossdistance and [be] received at the auditor; and the auditor perceives that the pc is doingsomething else.You say, “That’s not very important,” you see? But it is; it is. You’ll find auditors goof thatone very often. And the pc is going... And the auditor says—he’s nulling, let us say—and hesays, “catfish,” “cat fur,” and so forth. And the pc is going like this, you see? See, he’s notnoticed this first one.That causes this kind of trouble: You’ve got the item “fur” on a list that you’re nulling, and youhit the item “fur” and it goes through, actually, a complete auditing cycle, one way or the other,because you very often say thank you after you’ve done so. It’s a very jammed-up auditingcycle, but it’s there, you see?And then you go on to “catfish” on the next one, without performing this top cycle: Is the pcready to have “catfish” read to him? No, he’s hung up on “fur,” and the only time you ever getinto real catastrophe is when the pc is really hung up on “fur.” God, when you said “fur,” thepc went, “Ew-w-w-w.” Dong! and there he is, see?“What’s happened? Where is it? Ho! What’s happened?” See? You ever have that happen toyou? Somebody goes over a line—bong! it goes. And the next thing you know, in the far-offdistance you hear “catfish,” “cat whiskers . . . “And you say, “What’s that? Where’s this? Who’s what?” This one becomes terribly importantwhen you run into a situation like that. You don’t really pay too much attention to it. But itexists. Got it? It exists.And there’s another one down here. There’s another little one down here: Pc received theacknowledgment. And sometimes you violate that sixth one. You say, “Thank you!” and the pcgoes like this. Or that you say, “Thank you,” and the pc . . . If you were to do old-time ModelSession end-of-session mid ruds at that point, you’d find out the pc asked you why you neveracknowledged him. See? You have been acknowledging him, but you’ve never seen that hedidn’t receive the acknowledgment, don’t you see?That perception has another little tiny one in it, is: Has the pc said everything? But that actuallycomes on this line here: Has the pc answered everything, see? And it becomes—the auditor iswatching the pc, see? And the auditor sees that the pc has not said all he was going to say.Sometimes get in trouble with pcs that way.Pc says, “Oh, yeah, it was sometime in the later days of the Roman Empire. . .” You knowhe’s going to say something else, see? Well, this one isn’t complete. So everything at causehasn’t moved down the line here to you, effect. And you haven’t perceived all of the effect. Soyou go into the acknowledgment one before this line has completed itself, don’t you see?"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"“Well, it was in the early days of the Roman Empire. Um . . .”“Thank you! Now, we will . . .” Duh-uh-uh-uh. You’ve seen that happen. That’s chopping apc’s comm, see?They didn’t let this line here, which is the fourth communication cycle, flow to its completeend. And then this one, the acknowledgment, takes place. And of course it can’t go throughbecause this, the fifth communication cycle, is sitting up here on the fourth communicationcycle.So you say, “Thank you,” and of course you’re right back against—and it’s an inflowing lineand they jam right there.So there are six—if you really want to break it all down—there are six communication cyclesthat make up one auditing cycle. Six—not more than six, unless you start running into trouble.And when you violate that—one of those six, when you violate one of those six—you ofcourse are going to get into trouble, then, which causes a mishmash of one kind or another.Now, I’ll go over these again. I think you would care to have me do that, wouldn’t you?Audience: Yes.All right. Up here we have number one: the pc. His emanation at that point is simply hisappearance and presence. That’s number one. Is he ready to have an auditing command givento him? See, are we all set here for the auditing command? That’s number one. That’s acommunication cycle consistence of cause, distance, effect.Your next communication cycle on the thing—we had better go into number three—is yourauditor’s communication straight down to the pc. That is the auditing command and that younormally consider the communication cycle. Got it? That’s what you normally say: “Do birdsfly?” That’s cause-distance-effect received at the pc’s—here.Now he has to take care of and handle the charge at this point (and I’ll cover this in a minute),he’ll have to handle the charge at this point which has been restimulated by the auditor. Andnow he originates (although we use another designation; I’ve used origination otherwise, andso forth): He has his answer, which is what you normally call it. His answer, however, is acause. And that’s a cause, a distance and an effect. You understand?Now, your next one is an acknowledgment by the auditor which goes over cause, distance,effect, is received by the pc; and this is the perception of whether or not the pc receives theacknowledgment. Got that?But you go over this, work this thing out, you’ll find out that it’s a very complicatedarrangement. And you can count on anybody studying this, promptly and immediatelyafterwards not being able to audit at all. It’s something like taking a golf pro and say, “How doyou handle your club?”But this is your main show.Now, what you’ve considered ordinarily the auditing cycle has been this first V which I drew,which is cause-distance-effect—with the pc at effect, the auditor at cause. And then, at that V,the restimulation takes place and you get cause -distance -effect.Now, I’m not going to go into the rest of the auditing cycle till I show you the center of thisthing, okay?There is another communication cycle inside the auditing cycle—another communication cycle.And that is at the point of the V. [See Lecture Chart] Here’s your pc and here’s your auditor,"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"and here was your cause, your distance, effect; here is your cause, your distance, effect andhere was a C and here was an E. Don’t you see? Cause-distance-effect at the pc. That’s theauditing command. And then you’ve got cause-distance-effect which is the auditing response.Well, we’ve opened up the point of the V. And here is your little additional one, and that’sbetween the pc and himself. Here—see what this is. Now, this actually can be multiple, and itdepends upon the complications of the mind. But because there has been an effect there, thatcauses a cause. See? Because you have an effect at this point of impact, you get a restimulation.Now, that stimulation brings about charge, which then causes the pc to emanate to get rid ofthat charge. So you have an internal one, here, of cause-distance-effect inside the pc’s skull.Well, that gives us seven communication cycles.Now, I said this could be multiple. This is him talking to him, see? And you say, “Do birdsfly?” and this causes a picture of birds. He receives the effect of the picture of birds, and hecauses a query of the picture. “Are they flying?” And as a result, the answer comes back of theflapping of the wings and he says, “Yes, they’re flying.” And so with his thought he transmits,then, the causative action to the auditor—now directed at the auditor—”Yes.” You see how thatcan be multiple?Now, you’re listening to the inside of his skull when you’re examining that V down there.Now, if you think that the inside of the skull is more important than the rest of the cycles,you’re going to be very, very disabused. This happens to be the least important of all of theactions, except when it isn’t being done. And of course it’s the hardest to detect when it isn’tbeing done. It’s the hardest to detect.Pc says, “Yes.” Well now, what has the pc said yes to? And you sometimes are “insufficientlyincurious.” You’ve said, “Do birds fly?” and the pc receives this, and he gets a picture of adinosaur who is eating, and perceives that dinosaurs eat and says, “Yes.” And carrying out theremaining part of the sentence, it would be, “Yes, dinosaurs eat.”So this is actually what it sounds like to the auditor: “Do birds fly?”“Yes.”“Thank you.”See, that’s what it sounds like to the auditor—that’s the big V.Actually, this is what happened: “Do birds fly.?”And the point of the V is haywire; we get a dub-in, see? Picture of a dinosaur flies up, becausethat’s safer to look at than birds, for some reason, or more interesting or different. It’s an alter-is of some kind or another—happens on an automaticity.The pc thinks he understands the question now on the basis of “Do dinosaurs eat?” and says,“Yes.”And the auditor says, “Thank you.”Hey, wait a minute. What’s going to happen to this pc? What’s going to happen to the pc? Andthat, in essence, is this internal perception of line, which I showed you on the other side. Thiscause-distance-effect backflash here, and so forth, happens to include “Is the pc answering thecommand I gave him?” Question.Now, all of this is very complicated, isn’t it? And it’s sufficiently complicated that any auditorought to sit down with a piece of paper and work it all out—and not expect me to tell them. Ithink there are very few auditors ever really inspected that to the degree that it’s a multiple"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"cycle. There are seven or more communication cycles involved in an auditing cycle. Now, it’sactually weighty enough that standing up here giving you a lecture on the subject, off the cuff,see, it’s very easy to get mixed up on which cycle is which, because it requires a little bit ofconcentration. You have to actually mock up a complete session, see—complete auditingcycle—and pick out every communication cycle in the auditing cycle.Now, a communication cycle consists of just cause, distance, effect, with intention andduplication. That’s all—that’s a communication cycle. How many of these are there in oneauditing cycle? And that would include every nuance of the auditing session. So you have toanswer with how many principal ones are there? Because some auditing cycles could contain acouple of more.The pc says, “Huh?” You see, that’s a cause. That goes over distance, effect.And the auditor says, “Do birds fly?” He says, “I will repeat the auditing question. Do birdsfly?” And that goes cause-distance-effect. But you immediately have added two more cyclesand so you’ve got nine—because there was a flub, see? You got that?So anything unusual that happens in the session adds to the number of communication cycles tothe auditing cycle, but they’re still all part of the auditing cycle.Now, we’ve got repetitive commands as an auditing cycle, and that’s doing this same cycleover and over and over.Now, I’ll give you some homework here; this is for your own good. You draw out all thesecommunication cycles on a scrap of paper for yourself. Just take a look at all these things andmock up a session, like you do this and the pc does that, and so forth. And all of a sudden it’llcome very straight in your skull how many of these things there are, and you won’t have acouple of them jammed up. Because actually, what’s mainly wrong with your auditing cycle isyou have confused a couple of communication cycles to such a degree that you don’tdifferentiate that they exist. That’s why you sometimes chop a pc who is trying to answer thequestion, see?You know whether he has answered the question or not.Well, how did you know if he has answered the question or not? By esoterics? New subjectmatter: esoterics. If you’re very skilled at esoterics, you could probably manage it. But thereare no esoterics involved. Even if it’s telepathy, it’s cause, distance, effect. Doesn’t matter howthat communication took place; you know whether he’s answered the auditing command by acommunication cycle. I don’t care if the distance was zero. It was permeation from samelocation in space; you were in the pc’s head. I don’t care how you sense this or if you knowthat ordinarily this pc is green when he answers an auditing command and he turns pale whitethis particular time. You realize he’s not answered the auditing command. Well, how did youknow that? Well, obviously, it’s a communication cycle inside the auditing cycle.So, I’ll give you a little assignment there. You work that thing out. How many of these thingsare there? And then expect to drop the mashie and the niblick and hook one into the woods for aday or two. So that’s perfectly all right to do that, see?I myself occasionally take apart a piece of auditing and find myself gapping briefly in a session,because I’ve been trying to put together a very flexible R2H, because R2H (the way it wasoriginally released) is a very skilled activity. It’s too much for me. That’s right! It’s just tooconfoundedly skilled. I know you can’t do it. Impossible! It’s too prone to error. Goodtraining: Man, if you can do that, you can do anything! I mean it If you can do that, you can doanything.But, boy, by the time you get some pc who’s got an insignificant ARC break that doesn’t havethe punch of an engram or anything like that behind it, and you’re trying to date that"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"confounded thing on a meter—it’s just smooth as glass, and so forth—you practically have toARC break the pc again to get the meter to read! Terrific training.But inherent in that process—inherent in that process—there are a great many processes whichgo pretty well south and which will, actually, practically go one shot to OT, see? It’s masked,however, in the exact mechanics that you’re handling.I found out that you have to use ten—a minimum of ten—steps to get the terrific therapeuticresult of which it’s capable. At least ten steps. In fact, I got one version of it on the drawingtable right now, which I’ve been working with: I don’t know, I think it must have abouteighteen separate steps. I’m just trying to milk this thing down for maximum tone arm action,minimal error and maximal ease of auditing. You’re doing a training version now. It won’t bechanged. Go right ahead with it.But this is really putting that process up to make it get its most results, see? And, by the way,there are only nine levels of assessment in this newest version I’m working out—just ninelines, takes care of the lot. But that’s all progress.But I’m running all this on a pc. You get the idea? It’s all brand-new, and it’s impossible toaudit the original version of it anyway. And I’m handling something that has fifteen steps in it,all of which are strange and different, and the pc has done something incredible in the sessionthat I haven’t yet suspected. And boy! You talk about the mashie and the niblick, man! Youknow? That golf ball goes straight through the trees, hits a tree trunk, caroms off a rock, goesstraight up into the sky and vanishes forever.All right. Well, if you’re nervy on the subject of handling the basic tool of auditing, if that’sgiving you trouble and if you can get yourself into trouble by suddenly breaking it down andanalyzing it, then it should be broken down and analyzed at the time you’re auditing somethingnice and simple. That’s the time it should be broken down—not until you have three woods inyour right hand and four irons in your left hand and you’re going to putt with the heel of yourgolf shoe, see? I mean, this is not the time to practice this auditing cycle.So you go ahead and break it down. I’ve given you a general pattern for an auditing cycle.Maybe in working it over you can find a couple of extra communication cycles in the thing. Butthey’re all there, and if you made somebody go through each one painstakingly and painfully,you would find out where his auditing cycle was jammed up. And it isn’t necessarily jammedup on his ability to say “Thank you!” It may very well be jammed up in another quarter. Gotthat?Now, there’s a completely different auditing cycle inside the same pattern.Just wanted to make you comfortable and make you feel relaxed.Let’s work this one out. [See Lecture Chart] Here’s the pc. This pc, “he gonna originate.” Thishas got nothing to do with the auditing cycle. Scrub that other one! This now has nothing to dowith it. The only thing they have in common is that they both use communication cycles. Thatthey have in common. But this is brand-new. This is the bolt from Mars. It comes out of theblue, and an auditor who is already concentrating . . . He’s auditing, you know . . . There arepeople, they used to read—they’d move their lips while they read, you know? And everybodywould make a lot of fun of them, you know, for . . . You know?Well, an auditor who’s handling his communication cycles and his main auditing cycle on a lip-moving level, see—he’s brand-new at this sort of thing: the pc says something, see, that is notgermane to what the auditor is saying or doing. And there is just—well, just trucks go over thecliff, jet ships crash, see? All goes to hell, man!So you actually have to be alert for this thing happening at any time. And the way to prepare forit is just to realize that it can happen any time; and just go into the drill that handles it, and don’t"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"get it confused with the drill which you have as an auditing cycle; and consider it as its owndrill. It’s its own drill. You shift gears into this drill when the pc does something unexpected.And by the way, this handles such a thing as the pc originates by throwing down the cans.That’s still an origin, see? That had nothing to do with the auditing cycle. The auditing cyclewent to pieces, maybe, and this cycle came in. Well, the other auditing cycle can’t completebecause this cycle is now here. Well, that doesn’t mean that this cycle has precedence ordominance, but this cycle can start and take place and have to be finished off before the otherone can resume.So this is an interruptive cycle. And it is cause and distance and effect. And here’s yourauditor. The pc causes something. Now your auditor has to originate, and your V is inverted.Now let’s investigate here. Let’s investigate that point. Let’s expand the point, just as we did inthe auditing cycle. What’s this going to be, a mad spate of question marks or rockets flying offat oblique angles, or what’s going to happen at this point?Well, Dankly, you can’t put a machine at that point. You can’t put a machine action at thatpoint, because this thing has to be understood— has to be understood. So, to the degree that itis hard to understand, you have cause-distance-effect, cause-distance-effect. You understand?This is the auditor trying to clarify this thing. And every time he asks a question, he’s got anew communication cycle.Well, the trick that happens at the open V must not be such as to merely get the original line,cause-distance-effect, repeating itself. You mustn’t have the pc continuing to repeat that line,because the pc is now going to go frantic. Because he can’t get off of that line, he’s stuck intime, and it really upsets him.So the auditor, when this V is expanded here, has to be able to understand what the devil the pcis talking about. Now, there’s really no substitute for simply trying to understand it.The pc all of a sudden says, “But the Roman Empire didn’t have any legs!”“Tell me a little more about that, please.” That’s a good response.And the pc immediately goes off into can gesticulations like mad and explains how because ofNorth Africa being in its situation, you see, Egypt being in its situation, and that sort of thing,the Roman Empire didn’t run on legs. It didn’t run on legs at all; it ran on rivers. We’re nowgetting in deeper.“All right. Good enough; good enough. I hear what you’re saying, now. Give me a little moredope on this so I can get a good grasp of it.”Oh, and the pc will go on and he’ll expostulate and understand it. And he’ll understand it betterthrough telling you. And all of a sudden, you’ll find out that he’s telling you it didn’t have anylegs, and it didn’t have any legs to stand on—that is what he really meant, and so forth. Andhe’s got it all doped out, and all of a sudden you see what the hell he’s talking about. And atthat point, you can resolve this point at the open V, you see? And “Oh, that’s what the hell he’stalking about” is the name of that expanded little V. “Oh, that’s what the hell he’s talking about”is the name of that cause-distance-effect, see? And then you say (cause-distance-effect), “Thankyou.”How many more lines can you put in there? Well, you have to have another little line up here,which is another little cause-distance-effect, before that origination takes place so that you don’trun into a jam and you don’t give the auditing command. He’s originated that he’s going to saysomething. He says—see, whatever it is—and that’s not the time for you to say “Do fishswim?” See? You suddenly notice there’s a flicker across the table and the pc is saying . . ."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"See, that’s another little communication cycle. So it’s cause-distance-effect. And effect at yourpoint is to shut up. See?And then, you actually can have another little one, here, that’s a cause-distance-effect, of “I’mlistening.” Get the idea? And then, of course, there’s your extra ones down here—whenyou’ve said “Thank you,” then it’s your perception of the fact that he has received the thank-you. And there’s your origin.Got it?Audience: Yeah.The building brick out of which all of these things are made are communication cycles. That’sjust cause, distance, effect, with intention and duplication, see? That’s the lot, see?But when you say “duplication”—when you say this—you are carrying, then, thecommunication cycle over into the A and the R. because there must be understanding.Now, this is peculiar: There is a difference between an auditing cycle and a militarycommunication cycle. “Theirs is not to question why; theirs is but to do and die” is definitelythe military attitude toward the whole thing. And whereas this, too, can get into auditing—andactually is not disallowed and is sometimes used, and not without benefit. The guy is not goingto touch that wall. “Thou shalt touch that wall,” you see? This kind of an action very oftentakes place. He’s not going to give up the withhold. “Well, you goddamn well are going togive up the withhold,” you know? Bow! see? That sort of thing is very often better than notdoing anything about it. There are more adroit ways to do it—but this is real crude auditing.But that’s the only time it gets over into the military cycle.Now, the military cycle is simply cause, distance, effect, compliance. And the auditing cycle iscause, distance, effect, understand. So there is an A and an R at the effect point. And therefore,there has to be an A and an R at the cause point, so as to make “understand” acceptable at theeffect point. There doesn’t have to be, but there had better be. You see that?So there’s where A and R fit in on the communication cycle where auditing are concerned.They are very carefully designed.Now, a very syrupy affinity is very often highly detrimental to auditing. But too snarly orabrupt an affinity is also detrimental to auditing.We haven’t completed talking about the auditing cycle by a long ways. The auditing cycle, youwould say, then, is TR 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so forth. Well, the auditing cycle has very little to dowith TR 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, just as such, and only as such. The TRs have to do with thecommunication cycle. And you have to put one all the way together at about TR 5 or TR 6 totake in all of these communication cycles. You understand?What the lower TRs do is teach you to handle one communication cycle— see, from one sideor the other—in varying degrees of complication. Now, of course you’ve got to have TR 0,because all of these things have to do with confront. All of them have to do with confront, soyou’d say TR 0 is native to all of them. TR 1: Well, that’s an emanation. And TR 2 i8 a receipt.So of course, those just handle what? They just handle nothing but the communication cycle.Do you see that?Now, you can go on and build this up from this point on, but you will find that a completeauditing cycle would require a full-dress-parade TR that covered, maybe, at least six. And thenyou could have another TR that covered it up to nine, ten or twelve. And you could haveanother TR that handled an origin through all of its cycles—but that’s supposed to be, rightnow, TR 4."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"See, TR 4—you’ve always had trouble with TR 4. Maybe I’ve shown you why today. Look atTR 4. See, that’s a picture of TR 4. The V is the other way around. This thing is all upsidedown, you see?But that isn’t all there is to the A and the R in connection with the communication cycle. TR 1:How good is somebody’s TR 1? Well, let me tell you that the ability to say “Do fish swim?”might serve, but how about being comprehensible? How about being comprehensible?Enunciatively comprehensible: you can understand the syllables. How about that? We can getover that point. But how about giving it an understandable communication? Now, let’s look atthis in its widest ramifications. The R-factor has to be present there so that it can beduplicatable.You very often, when you leave some auditors loose on making up a command, or askingsomething, or there’s a hole in the routine and it doesn’t give them those words, will do a put-together of the statement to be said to the pc which, at the arrival at the pc, is incomprehensible.And yet an auditor is very often called upon to do this. I’ve noticed this. I’m not beingcondemnatory of auditors in general, but I’ve noticed here and there. When an auditor— someauditors are left completely on their own . . . Well, something like this: “Well, get me a list.Get me a list of the stuff he’s worried about.” And you expect them to put together a questionsomething like “What are you worried about?” see? And you get some entirely different,incomprehensible version, like “What are the worst part of your worries sometimes?”Something like this. Now, that’s almost sensible compared to some of them I’ve seen. They’rejust absolutely incomprehensible. Absolutely incomprehensible.I don’t know how anybody—and I have actually seen somebody run a level fitted into one ofthese five-to-fifteen command brackets, which didn’t make any sense at all, and suddenlyfound to my horror that some pc had actually been running on this for hours and hours andhours, and every time they arrive at it, says, “I don’t have a clue what you’re talking about atthis point.”And the auditor just says, “I will repeat the auditing question.”So there’s this factor in this communication cycle, that the TR 1 aspect must be (1) enunciatedin such a way as to arrive in an understandable form, but very often, when the auditor isformulating something, has to be formulated so that it can be duplicated. So these two otherfactors are involved, besides simply being at cause—is the cause going out with any R? Inother words, can you understand any part of this thing? Is this an understandable statement?“Do fish someti . . . I’ll repeat the auditing question: Do fish somet . . .” Naturally, no auditingcan proceed.You start dropping s’s off of everything; or get somebody with a Japanese curve; you getsomebody doing something that is a little bit offbeat in pronunciation—somebody fromBoston. Let’s go worse—somebody from Maine. You ever hear a “Maine-iac” talk?I was up there finding the Canadian border. The United States government lost it. (They’d losetheir heads, you know, if you didn’t watch them.) Anyway, they lost the Canadian border andwent up and found it again. Found a tree had fallen on it and buried the marker. They have littlepyramids that look like the Washington Monument that mark the border.It was very necessary, because the Prohibition agents didn’t know where their authority startedand ended, see? It caused terrible things. We took the problem off because what we were doingwhen we were surveying is we would stop the rum runners and tell them we were Prohibitionagents, relieve them of their cargo, and we always had a lot to drink!Anyway, we solved this problem practically. The U.S. government could’ve taken a lot ofleaves from, I think, most of us on practical solutions to these problems."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"But I spent the most delighted summer trying to learn to speak “Maineiac.” Gorgeous. And theFrench that had been living up along the St. Lawrence didn’t speak French and they didn’tspeak English. They spoke something else. But it was sure interesting. Got so I could speakthe thing, you know? I’d talk about “Baa-haaba” [Bar Harbor] with the best of them. But itwouldn’t go in an auditing session.And very often, some pc gets saddled with an auditor that he can’t quite comprehend alongsome corner or another. Now, you should recognize what’s out. The only thing that is out isthe R-factor in the TR 1. And an auditor should actually take great care to keep that onesmoothed out. If he knows he’s doing something weird that the pc can’t comprehend, itdoesn’t matter how clumsily he sets it right so long as he sets it right.Supposing you can’t tell the difference between the way he pronounces flue and the way hepronounces six. You can imagine these two getting jammed. The pc, for some reason or other,always thinks the auditor is saying five when he’s saying six, and six when he’s saying five.What do you think’s going to happen in R3R, see?So therefore, it is up to the auditor to be comprehensible. That’s where the R-factor comes in.Be comprehensible. Not only from standpoint of accent, but sense: the comprehensibility.Diction enters into this. I can see some university in the future teaching auditing English, yousee, or auditing speech. Actually, it’d be a big department, because you’d have to have thetranslation of all this stuff into German; you have a translation and then its enunciation inGerman—same factor would apply, don’t you see? The same factor in Swedish, Japanese,Chinese, Russian, all of this stuff. How do you audit these guys, you see? Well, all right. Soyou’re going to have auditors perhaps from that country, but remember, they will have thesame frailties of pronunciation.How about translation of line plots, what line plots actually sum up into. Some of thesecountries don’t have good terminology to follow through on a line plot. And yet the line plotwill only fire on the right terminology. Don’t you see, there’s a lot of stuff to be worked out onthis particular factor. But there’s stuff to be worked out on it right now.An auditor who is not comprehended by the pc isn’t doing his TR 1 right. And therefore the R-factor is very germane to whether the communication cycle can take place at all. And if you say“Do fish ?” You can’t do that. Do you see that nothing happens and no communication cycletakes place at all? So the R-factor can do a complete wipeout. Interesting, isn’t it?Then you have the pc who doesn’t want to be audited. He doesn’t want to be audited at all.Well, how on earth can you start that one going? Because you’ve got to have a communicationcycle before you can even put an R-factor in. See, that’s worse end to. He just won’t listen toany part of Scientology. This is not a speech defect, but actually requires a lower-level processwhich gets him to talk about Scientology anyhow.We used to have one, “Well, tell me why you shouldn’t be audited.” Tricky kind of anapproach of this particular character.This is all very feasible. But this comes under the heading of getting a communication cyclestarted, and the auditor is very often confronted by that. So there is something which actually isprior to the communication cycle, see, and that you are very often happy to see exists. Andwhen it goes out the window, you very often are sitting there with your eyes popped—youdon’t know quite what to do. Well, the thing is, you can’t get the communication cycle going.Now, very often the R-factor is out—wildly. Or the affinity factor is out. The affinity factor isout because the pc is being very misemotional. Well, oddly enough, you can do an ARC BreakAssessment today, and find the bypassed charge and use that to complete the communicationcycle which you started and which wouldn’t complete, because it is the generated charge. Andthat was why I showed you, particularly, the expanded point of the V."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"What has happened there is inadvertently, one way or the other, the point of the V has goneawry. The auditor somehow or another or the pc somehow or another has restimulated a chargewhich has then not been originated either to the auditor or the pc. See, an overrestimulation hastaken place there. It’s quite easy to do. It’s quite easy, though, to pick up these days. So, theseARC Break Assessments is [are] a pilot of completing the communication cycle and getting theauditing cycle going again. See how that fits in?All right. Now, that’s all very well to talk about the auditing cycle and say that’s just all there isto the auditing cycle, but there’s (I mentioned a moment ago) the repetitive auditing cycle. Thiscycle going over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, is a specialized activity.There’s an auditing cycle of one cycle and then there is the auditing cycle of the next cycle andthe next cycle and the next cycle and the next cycle, see? That’s a different thing— doing itmany times. You get your repetitive process, and this is where that gets you in trouble. There isa point where this over-and-over-again gets you in trouble.You must, you absolutely must, complete a communication—all communication cycles of anauditing cycle. Therefore, you must complete an auditing cycle. But you must also differentiatethe difference between one auditing cycle and the repetitive auditing cycle. And why must yougenerate this difference? It’s because one auditing cycle must be completed, and a repetitiveauditing cycles are very often overdone, and don’t need to be completed in some cases. There’sa difference.Ooohh, where am I leading you now? You will say, “What’s this? What’s this? You mean youdon’t flatten a process?” Yes, you always flatten a process. But some auditor can get so eager-beaver with his series—which is flatten the process, see—that he forgets why he is flatteningthe process. And that is your dominant cycle—is ability regained.Why are you auditing the person in the first place? To do an auditing cycle? To do a series ofauditing cycles, known as repetitive cycles, so that you can get a flattened process?Now, you say, “Well, you’re doing that to flatten the tone arm action.” No, that’s right therewith repetitive auditing cycle; that belongs right there with repetitive auditing cycle, don’t yousee? There is something that dominates all of this; there’s a greater domination.I’ll show you what these points are. This will intrigue you; I don’t think perhaps many of youhave ever looked at this before. [See Lecture Chart] Here’s your big cycle, which is majorcycle. See, that’s a major auditing cycle. And its proper name is Ability Regained.Ha. I can see some of you now. You’re auditing engrams like mad and you hit this key engramand you hit the thing and you all of a sudden got an OT on your hands, and the fellow gets upand stretches and that sort of thing, and he’s getting all ready to square away, and he’swondering what he should do with the body, and—you know? He’s all set and you’re goingon: “All right. What is the duration of this engram?” Well, that’s just too much dedication tothis next cycle, see?And this you can call the Process (Cycle—Process Auditing Cycle. This, of course, is justyour single auditing cycle. Your progress of case is up, like this, see? Now, if you don’t haveyour single cycle down, then of course you can’t do a repetitive cycle. Can’t do a repetitiveauditing cycle, you can’t flatten the process, in other words, you see?Now, a process is flattened by tone arm action out, no comm lag left, or cognition—I’ll drawyou a picture of these things—or ability regained. [See Lecture Chart] Now, you understand,we’re going here from the Process Cycle to this Ability Regained cycle, you understand? We’regoing just between those two. You understand here, that if you can’t do a single cycle, then it’scertain that you’re not going to be very successful in completing any process auditing cycle—which is the repetitive cycles—and if you can’t do this, then you certainly are not going toproduce the upper one of ability regained. See? That’s obvious."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"But what is a flat process cycle? You sometimes come a cropper on this and don’t realize whatyou’re coming up against.Now, three equal commands—this is the lousiest one, see? Three equal commands. That’ssmelly, but you say the process is flat, see? Safe to leave it. Well, you’d better leave it at theCCHs, otherwise your pc is going to start being unhappy. But remember that they must beconfidently done, or something like that. You can’t have “He screamed three times,” you see?You very often—you’d be surprised—you very often have this question asked Of you. Youhave some HPA student sometime saying, “Well, but he was angry the same way for threedifferent commands, so therefore the process was flat.”Now, your next level up here—your next level—is a more interesting level from a standpointof that, but it’s perfectly safe to flatten it on a cognition. Guy gets a cognition: “Oh, yes!” see?Even a minor cognition, do you understand? That’s not a major cognition; that’s, you know,minor cognition—he had a win. “Hey, well, what do you know! That’s why elephants fly.”You know, that’s all set. Hasn’t too much to do with the process, but you sort of stop theprocess at that point. The pc is not going to suffer.You understand that these first two levels that I’m talking to you about, of “How do you flattena process?” are just—oh, that’s awful shabby sort of a way to look at the thing, but that’s justthe minimum. That’s the minimum security.Now let’s get to the real one, which is TA Flat—flat by TA. That’s your auditing cycles,repetitive auditing cycles, and you no longer have TA action on it here, don’t you see?And up above this—and there are two levels of this, to make it better—is a Major Cognition.You’ll see that sometimes. You’ll see that sometimes. That takes precedence. You haven’t gotthe TA flat, but all of a sudden he cognites all of the level is flat you’re running. You’ll see himgo pow! pow! pow!—off the meter. You’ve got—”failure to scream” was the level you wererunning, “about cats.” And he says, “Oh! Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah! We used to mock upthese forty-mile-high cats and yeah—oh, well, what the hell! Yeah!” And you see the meterblow down and bang and everything goes to hell. You try to run this process again. He hasn’tgot any level there left to run. In fact, continuing the process after one of those things isinvalidation of the pc.Now, this is Ability Regained and that takes precedence over all of these. This guy couldn’twalk and you’re halfway through this and you haven’t got the TA flat and so forth and hehasn’t had any cognition you’re thinking about and your processing cycle’s a repetitive cycle,and all of a sudden the pc says, “Hey, what do you know!” you know? And he throws theelectrodes down sideways and he gets up and starts walking, you know? “Eh! Yeah, I can doit!” Good, are you going to flatten the process now?You may think I’m pointing out something ridiculous, but you do this quite often. You spoil it.You’ve got to know when to cut and run. See what I mean? What you got coming right up isyou’re all of a sudden going to make an OT—and continue to flatten the process.Now, let’s look at this, then. This single cycle—you got to have that one down cold, andthere’s no doubt about that! Got to be able to complete that. You got to be able to complete itrepetitively, time after time again, and that’s for flattening out a process. And the thing whichtakes dominance over that, of course, is you flatten out the process until you run into the abilityregained.Now, sometimes you don’t run into an ability regained and you go on and flatten the process,and have to do another process before you regain the ability, don’t you see? Sometimes youhave to flatten a lot of these before you get up to that. Sometimes you halfway flatten one andyou’re suddenly up to it. You see, but I’m just talking about auditing cycles—repetitiveauditing cycles—and where they’re aiming toward. You’re aiming toward always getting this"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"one completed, but the only thing that interrupts it, in any single cycle, is a cognition. Similarto repetitive cycles, ability regained—a single auditing cycle that you are doing runs into acognition. What do you do in a case like that? Well, you don’t spoil the cognition bycompleting the auditing cycle. You can start another auditing cycle, if it is necessary to do so.To that degree, to those modifications, these other things must be pushed through to the bitterend.All right. Well, I’ve given you the dope on this. I imagine that you find this somewhatintriguing. It’s a better look, perhaps, than we have had at it. I’ve been meaning to get aroundto it for some time, actually, and I’ve been breaking it down myself so that it could be talkedabout better. And you’re seeing here a bit of gain; this isn’t something which I’ve known all thetime and so forth and so on. But I have been studying this ability regained in relationship tofinishing a whole series of auditing cycles, and then I started breaking down the single auditingcycle in its communication cycles and got it into a more communicable form. And I think you’llfind this very useful, both in teaching people and in auditing, yourself.I wish you luck. Just go on and audit. Don’t try to make me guilty by suddenly knocking theball into the rough because you’ve lost the grip.Okay. Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLESA lecture given on6 August 1963Well, how are you today?Audience: Good. Fine.Good. Well, this is what?Audience: 6th of August.6 August, A.D. 13.Every once in a while somebody says, “Well, why don’t you . . .” something or other,something or other, something or other—that’s the crux of the situation—” Why don’t youchange all administrative actions? Why don’t you alter all central organizational lines?” “Whydon’t you . . .” so forth. “Why don’t we change everything in the course?” and so on. Whatthey’re dealing with is a problem they actually don’t see the breadth and depth of.And that problem is this: The character of this planet and the population hereon makes itpractically impossible to do anything with this planet. Now, I’m not taking off from a failurepoint. The stress and thought and prevention and cure and this and that which you have to gointo on this planet to get anything done and running is absolutely fantastic.Now, you want to ask why this is? Well, we can go into that in a moment. But those of youwho have on the backtrack an experience of you just get some guys together and you dosomething, you see—well, that’s been a common experience, and you still tend to operate inthat zone and sphere of influence. In other words, you said, “Well, it was very easy. We justwhistle up Joe, Bill and Pete, and the four of us will go down there and fix up the signboards,and that’ll take care of that,” see? And you’re all set, see?But that was yesteryear and elsewhere. And you apply that basic feeling to this planet andyou’re in trouble at once. Why? This planet is part of a larger federation—was part of an earlierfederation and passed out of its control due to losses in war and other such things. Now, thislarger confederacy—this isn’t its right name, but we have often called it and referred to it in thepast as the Marcab Confederacy. And it has been wrongly or rightly pointed to as one of the tailstars of the Big Dipper, which is the capital planet of which this planet is.Now, all this sounds very space-opera-ish and that sort of thing, and I’m sorry for it, but I amnot one to quibble about the truth. This gets in people’s hair every now and then, and I don’tsee any point in lying in order to be acceptable. It just doesn’t seem to be a right way to goabout things, particularly in the realm of science. I don’t think a scientist should tell a bunch of“scientific” lies in order to be an acceptable scientist. It doesn’t seem to me to be a sensibleproceeding.However, be that as it may, these various planets united into a very vast civilization which hascome forward up through the last two hundred thousand years [and] is formed out of thefragments of earlier civilizations. No I can’t tell you accurately, exactly what these blokes areup to or where they’re from, but this isn’t quite germane to this galaxy. That’s the first thingyou should know about it; it isn’t quite native to your track. You find a type of mentalimplanting and that sort of thing going on here in the last couple of hundred thousand yearswhich are not native to your earlier track.Now, this is all very important; it’s very important, because they have terrible problem. Theyhave the problem of people who are native to this galaxy and aren’t used to this kind of thing,"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"and they have the basic problem “How do you kill a thetan?” And that’s a terrible problem tomen who have very, very guilty consciences and blood on their hands—a great problem.Probably the best way to hide your overts is to give somebody amnesia you see (then theydon’t know what you’ve done to them), and then tell the something else has happened. Well,this is a dramatization of a very crave intelligence, and that is what is going on here.Now, the fellow who conforms to that society is in no vast trouble. Perhaps some bloke whohas a military record against them, and that sort thing, might possibly (no matter what he did)find himself unable to satisfactorily conform. But the point is that their ideal is the conformist.Now, these conformists are pretty weird, and the personnel of this particular society is prettyscummy, to say the least. Let’s—supposing you were in the last shambling wreckages of a red-light district: you’d have high toned personnel, compared to the personnel which makes up theother planet I’m talking to you about. High-toned personnel, much higher toned than theaverage run. They practice cannibalism. The stuff you get on race tracks once in a while somepc will run into race tracks and race-track drivers—the Roman-circus-type entertainment, don’tyou see? All that kind of stuff—that’s all out of this zone and area. We’re still with thatplanetary system.So, they specialize in the fellow who will conform. Now, he ordinarily is “woiker” [worker]who is content to draw wages and not do another single blessed thing—you know, never reallyget up, improve his lot, you see, and keep on plugging along somehow, or even slump intoindigence. He’s still the choice of personnel. So this leaves the brilliant artist, the brilliantengines the manager, the genius, the criminal, the pervert, non persona grata.And they sentence these people—the upper class (that is to say, the brighter gent) because theycan’t control him and they’re afraid of him, and the lower class because it’s too vicious evenfor them—and they condemn the people to perpetual amnesia. “Dead forever,” they call it—theproblem of killing a thetan—and wrap them up in mothballs and ship them down here and herewe are. And that is the population of this planet.All right. Here’s a population, then, of minimal workers; maximal managers, artists, geniuses,criminals and perverts. What you going to make out of this lot, huh?Now, those are the blokes you’re talking to when you say “Add up the left-hand column of theledger.” Well, of course, the artist says he could add up much more prettily. The guy whoactually, in his own right, was a very skilled manager, he says he could devise a much bettersystem—it’s true too; he probably could. If the bird is a criminal, he’s just sitting there tryingfigure out how he can add it up so he can short you. And there’s your zone operation; there isyour response to 8C in trying to get an organization running. lt’s all alter-is, because the basiccrime was nonconforming. The basic crime wasn’t being a criminal; the basic crime was notconforming.Well, actually, this group has gone ahead and made up, up until recent times, a totally differentcivilization than the civilization which planted it here. In the last ten thousand years, they havegone on with a sort of a decadent, kicked-in-the-head civilization that contains automobiles,business suits, fedora hats, telephones, spaceships—quite interesting, but a civilization whichlooks an almost exact duplicate, but is worse off than the current U.S. civilization .Therefore, you find the current IDS. and Western civilization rather restimulative, because ithas moved up to look like the Marcabian civilization. It’s been moving up here rather rapidly.And now we’re at a point, a very high level of restimulation, because the automobile design,the train design, ship design (why, they’ve got ships in those areas, look just like the QueenMary, you see?), and the fire engines and the stuff you do with men’s clothes particularly—allof these things are the same image. So you’re going into a highly restimulative era, becausewe’ve not had this before. See? We’ve been moving up through strata of civilization, but we"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"hadn’t matched this one. And remember that this society at the present time looks dangerous; itlooks very dangerous.One of the highest crimes you could pull in that Marcabian society, probably even today, isincome tax; you make one comma wrong and it’s “dead forever.” Sounds weird, doesn’t it?So, they got everybody paying income tax—awful restimulative. Probably nothing muchwrong with income tax if it were administered as a tax, but it isn’t; it’s administered as apunishment, even on this planet today. Well, it’s one of their prime punishments in theMarcabian civilization.All of this adds up to what? An era, going on right now, of highly restimulative associations inthe civilization, and therefore a high-felt level of danger. People feel like they are in danger.Scientologists, every once in a while, hearing me talk like this, feel even more in danger. Theysay, “Boy, those guys are liable to land here tomorrow,” you know?of course, I pull this every once in a while. Diana suddenly appeared on my right side last nightwhile eating dinner (and I didn’t even know she was in the room, you see?), and just out of thecorner of my eye, I saw a pair of white spots that looked like the spats a spaceman uses, youknow? And for a split second I said, “Well, here they are,” you know?But anyway, you should realize that the material on the between-lives area has been much morebroadly circulated than any of our material is now, because it was laid down the line in alldirections, to the most unlikely places (including Russia), and was contained in the book Whatto Audit [A History of Man] and other materials, and that was 1951 and ‘52. I consider that’sinteresting, because let me point out to you, that’s eleven or twelve years ago and there hasn’tbeen a ripple. I just want to point that out to you as an interesting point.No, gents of this character who have a system worked out this way would—the last thing inthe world they’d do would be blow their own game, see? All they’d have to do is land onespaceship, and they feel like everybody would go into a convulsion of suddenly rememberingeverything. And they do, do you know? Any rumor of the men from Mars or something likethat and this planet goes into a total convulsion.They produced Orson Welles’s broadcast down in Quito (I think it was), Ecuador, and—theradio station there, I think a seventeen-story building or large building, or whatever the figureswere on it—and mobs tore that building to pieces and killed seventeen people in the process.They practically slaughtered the staff of that radio station. In other words, they went mad.So they know that great riots are attended by this, but a landing in force without anyequivocation that it had been a landing of some type, or like this, would be liable to restoreeverybody’s memory. I think that’s what they feel. Whether this is true or not, we couldn’tworry less.But here you are; that is the point. Here you are; that is this planet.Every once in a while you get mad at government on this planet, when in actual fact you’re madat the Marcabian government. And there’s a great deal of confusion. Every once in a whilesomebody will get awfully furious with an organization, very furious with an organization hereon this planet, when they have actually identified the organization with the Marcabiancivilization.Now, you start hitting people here with restimulative materials of this particular type, and itrestimulates a terrific unreality; it restimulates amnesia.I have to ask you this: How hard do you have to hit somebody to bring about amnesia? Let’stake Joe out here and let’s just see how hard do we have to hit Joe in order to bring aboutamnesia on his part so he doesn’t know who he is, where he is, or anything else. How hardwould we have to hit him? Boy, that’s pretty hard. It’s almost unbelievable force is used to"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"handle a thetan and put him into this kind of condition. I’ve been hit with some awful heavyforce in this universe without losing my mind or forgetting who I am, see? So it’s pretty heavyduress. And you restimulate that very easily by telling people things. It gets awful unreal.But you would find, if you gave them the actual dope, that they would be far more inagreement with you than if you gave them just a touch of the dope, do you see? You won’t findthe citizens of this planet very far in disagreement with what you’re doing. So, therefore,you’ve got some kind of an explosion going.Well, these guys are not going to blow their own show, see. They’re not going to do anythingpeculiar about it. They’ve probably got us all sized up, if they know anything about us at all.They probably have some dim idea of what we’re doing, and saying, “Oh, yes. Ho-hum.” Andgive the devil his due: They might even say, “Well, hey, what do you know? Those guys mightbe producing a type of technology which we ourselves desperately need.” Look at that.See, now, they know the problems exist. They couldn’t have had any decent solution, or theywouldn’t have taken the route to solution which they have. They are beings, too; rememberthat.So when we look at all this: you are (1) organizationally handling people who arerevolutionaries. They are nonconformists. Probably the common denominator of this planet isrevolution. Probably the one thing you could always start on this planet would be a revolution,because it’s a state of perpetual revolution. Trying to hold any organization together of any kindwhatsoever becomes almost impossible, because everybody you’re dealing with is anonconformist.All right. So far goes the civilization. There are just those few statements on the thing I thoughtyou might find of interest.We’re dealing now with what is an auditor?You are handling, therefore, the roughest case that you could find in the universe, because therehabilitation of the individual demands that you rehabilitate his knowingness. If hisknowingness does not increase independently, he himself does not get well. You see, electricalcharge on the case is simply a symptom that measures his knowingness. If he’s got too muchcharge, his knowingness is way down. See, that’s an indirect measure of the amount ofknowingness of the individual.And as the case moves along up the line, you get an odd factor. You get an odd factor: Thiscase continues progressively to remember more. Now, one of the things the case recovers ispicture memory, remembering by pictures. “I have a picture of, so therefore I was.” See, youcan call that a picture memory and that goes from a terrific unreality on it down to a pretty goodcertainty on it. So a person at that stage of the game—an advanced stage of the game ininspecting his own pictures—can tell the difference between a false picture and an actual picturethat has something to do, really, with him on his track. And as his knowingness increases, hecan tell you where it belongs and what date it has and so on. In other words, he can spot it,bang! That’s an increased knowingness. It’s knowingness that is increasing all the way alongthe line.Now, from picture memory, the individual graduates up to simply knowing.Now, right now, you don’t have to get a picture of where you are living to know where youlive. You see that? You don’t have to get a picture of your name to know what your name is. Inother words, you know this. Well, so does knowingness increase as the case improves, andthat knowingness increases up the line to a point where you know who you have been andwhere you have been, independent of any created evidence or cross-proof. You simply know.And that factor is a very slow factor to rise; it’s not a rapid factor. Under present auditing, yes,it is rapid, but that is all within a framework of hundreds of hours, don’t you see?"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Now, I’ll give you an idea of this. For instance, I know—I know where I was and who I was,and know with good certainty, who I was and where I was in the last eighty trillion years. See,I know that; that’s not much of an argument with me. But the small details of that are liable togo fritter-fritter here and there. You know, what did I have for breakfast two trillion years ago?No. Nix, man. Nah. Did I even eat, you see? That sort of thing is getting pretty dim.But now, over the top of that, which is an identity knowingness—which comes before a detailknowingness, you see; between your picture knowingness and your total knowingness is thisstage of just knowing your identity—why, then, this detail knowingness starts to come up andfollow in on this smaller basis. And one of your gains on it: you’ll know why you were here.You’ll have tangled with it in session and that sort of thing, and you’ll have picked data out ofpictures. More and more you know why you were here. You know how you got here. Youknow what you were doing ten thousand years ago, do you see? You know what washappening 11,025 years ago, don’t you see? No pictures involved; you just know it.And that is the restoration of the beingness of the person, and I have given you (in a very crudeway here) a cycle of that restoration of beingness. His beingness returns to him gradually, bitby bit. Perhaps the lowest edge of it is something on the idea of “Maybe I possibly could knowwho I was,” you know? “Possibly I could know what I am doing here, or I might even be ableto know who I am.” Just some sort of a feeling like one might be able to know. And thatcrawls up forward to a picture knowingness, and the unreality of those pictures at first isfabulous. So that anybody shows you any kind of a picture, man, any kind of a picture, thatis—must be yours, and therefore yore must have been there.They could show you a picture of an airplane falling apart and you at once say, “Well, I musthave been in that airplane falling apart.” And later on you suddenly realize, “Hell, I’m lookingat that airplane from two miles away. What am I doing looking at it from two miles away?”This dawns on you after a while. Your valence problem all of a sudden comes up; it hits you inthe face, whether you’re coaxed to do it by the auditor or not. “I’m in that airplane, see, overthere, two miles away,” see? “So, therefore, I must have had an awful fall,” see?And it turns out, eventually—you’d begin to see this thing—you say, “Hey, wait a minute. Icouldn’t have been in that airplane. It was somebody I shot down; maybe it’s somebody I didthis with.” And then you’ll finally say, “Well, shucks. That thing is just a false picture. Thatisn’t my picture at all.” And then whatever picture of yours is holding it in suspense, thatpicture suddenly peels off the front of it like a badly painted chromo, and pshew! and your ownpicture is right behind it. And you say, “Oh, yerp! there I was,” and you’re in valence. Thatvarious cycle of recognition takes place in this picture line.But what does it takes then, to bring about such a total amnesia? Let’s look at that: What does ittake to bring about such a total amnesia? I was riding a spaceship down one day. Side gasketsof the tubes blew out on one side and wiped out the engine-room crew. I went in to drag themout just at the moment when the whole backblast of the rockets moved frontwards through theengine room, and got hit square in the face and managed to crawl out of the place. The shipwent into the atmosphere, melted and crashed. And a couple of minutes or, oh, a couple ofseconds after it hit, all of its fuel sent up and hit me in the face. And I lost my memory; I lostmy memory. It took me quite a while, sitting down very quietly, to remember where base was.And I sat there and figured and figured and figured. Actually, I’d sent some people back tocome and pick up the wreckage and so forth, and I was pretty foggy. And very shortly, Isnapped out of it. You know, “of course!” you know?But just how much force is force? Well, this is the type of scout craft which has the engines ofa battle cruiser all packed into a very tight spot, you see, and all of it red-hot fuel. CapeCanaveral has got nothing like the amount of force one of those things can deliver, don’t yousee? And to get all of that square in your thetan push twice, and get confused about where basewas.... Got the idea?And how much force has it taken to destroy somebody’s memory? It’s interesting. Aninteresting point, isn’t it? Well, that’s how much force you’ve been subjected to. Otherwise"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"you wouldn’t have a case. I’m not trying to make you afraid of force. You get up to a pointafter a while as a thetan—forces, morces, who cares?I had a funny feeling the other day. I didn’t quite feel up to diving into the sun. I just didn’t feelup to it; I didn’t feel it would be a healthy thing for me to do just now. I felt weak. And I feltthe interactive forces of the sun, and I felt sort of drawn a little bit toward the sun, and I said,“No.” I sort of did a suppress and looked the other way. I just didn’t feel like taking a sun bathtoday. You get the idea, you know? You feel queasy. Too much force—too much force.Well now, that force, of course, has to be combined with trickery, and the trickery is mostlyscrambling somebody’s dates and giving them opposite, opposing items that can suspend intime, so that the scrambled dates will suspend in time. You get the combinations; you knowthem in our various technologies.But let’s not move away from the point into the trickery of it; it does require the force. Force.How much force does it take to destroy the memory of a being? Well, that’s how much forcean auditor is getting off a case. And of course you’d much rather get off unknowingness andoddities and oddball things; you’d much rather, because they’re easier to confront than rawforce. And they’re easier for the pc to confront, too.Therefore, you say, “What have you done?”And your pc said, “Well, I had a hostile thought about you the other day. I thought you reallyshould do your hair up in back.”Oh, good—we’ve got a big withhold off. You get the gentle pat-a-cake that you will sometimessee in auditing sessions. The proper auditing response, of course, is “Well, thank you verymuch,” and so forth. And O/W is a bit different than other brands of auditing. You say, “Whathave you done, done, done?” And if you work very, very hard, you can get a done in all thesethinks. You see, behind all these critical thinks is a done, is an actual action. And you can listento critical thinks till the cow comes home, and you will never get anybody raised up the line,until you’ve found an actual action. That is the secret of all Sec Checking, and that is wherepeople fall down in Sec Checking.Now, why do they fall down? Well, it’s much easier to confront this random little think than itis the energy contained in a done. Do you see that?Therefore, the mission of an auditor is the restoration of a person’s awareness, which includeshis memory, his knowingness of himself and so forth. Restoration of awareness. What isholding down that awareness? What is holding down this knowingness? What is sitting on thisknowingness? Well, you can say trickery and force, but it is force used with trickery, so that anindividual will get an ARC break with force and then become the effect of force.So you’re handling, in actual fact, somebody who has lots of ARC breaks with other beings,matter, energy, space, time and location and form. That is in direct definition: this person is outof comm, out of affinity and out of reality with matter, energy, space, time, location, otherbeings and form.Now, that’s the pc. So what’s an auditor? So what’s an auditor? Well, an auditor has to besomebody who can release this tremendously involved force, somebody who can release thisforce from the pc. Obviously, if it’s a deranged force which is bringing about the amnesia ofthe pc, then the auditor, to get a return of memory of the pc, has to be capable of alleviating andremoving that force. I mean, that’s simple. Simple. Elementary, my dear Watson.On your E-Meter you have a tone arm. Force is removing itself from the case as long as thattone arm is in motion. And the wiggle-waggle of the tone arm as the pc is being audited tellsyou that force is being relieved from the case."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"When you start to remove force that is aberrated by some trickery, your tone arm hangs up untilthe trickery is resolved—you know, wrong date or something like that—and your tone armaction is restored. All of these things are all cared for in the processes and technologies ofauditing. But if that TA isn’t moving, you will never make an OT. That’s just it.Now, you oddly enough do not have to run a process, sometimes, to get the TA moving.Providing the TA is moving—providing the TA is moving and you get good motion out ofyour tone arm—a person will eventually go Operating Thetan. Providing you can keep the tonearm moving, the person will eventually go Operating Thetan. If the tone arm is not moving, theperson will not go Operating Thetan and the case may even deteriorate.Let’s just run this case on and on. The case can run an engram, and so you keep runningengrams, engrams, engrams, engrams, and the tone arm is stuck right up here at somewhere inthe vicinity of 5.0. And there it sticks at 5.0, and you go on and audit and audit and audit; andthere it is at 5.0, and there it is at 5.0, and there it is at 5.0, and there it is at 5.0. Uh-hah—you’re never going to make an Operating Thetan.Now, if you run the right significances off the case and produce tone arm action, you make anOT much quicker. But you can get tone arm action without running the right significances. Getthis syllogism here? And you can run the right significances without getting tone arm action.Oh, well, you can run R3R on somebody who can’t handle R3R, and you can run all the rightsignificances and not get into tone arm action; you’re not going to make an OT.Now, let me go over this again now and you’ll see where you sit with regard to a tone arm. Ifyou just keep a tone arm moving on the pc long enough, regardless of how and what you’reauditing on the case, the case will eventually make OT. But if you run the right significances—if you run the right significances—and don’t get any tone arm action, you’re not going to makean OT. You got that now? This is terribly important.Now, it might take thousands and thousands of hours just to randomly keep this tone armmoving on the pc. And lots of pcs can talk forever, you know, without getting any tone armaction. But if you could keep that TA moving, you’d eventually get OT. So you say, then, thata moving tone arm is slightly senior to the right significance.Now, this is right down to bedrock on the subject of auditing. Your job is to keep the TAmoving.Now, what’s this TA doing? The TA is indicating the blowing off of force. That is a measureof the amount of encysted force which is leaving the case —the amount of encysted forceleaving the case. You’ve got a measure of it right there. It goes up and down, and it measuresthe amount of force which is going.Now, of course, you don’t do this arithmetically or mathematically. I imagine someday, one ofthese days, why, we will. We’ll set up a project that measures some guy from scratch, rightstraight through to the end, shows the exact number of motions of the TA on every process ortype of process that is run on the person, and these are all added together. And we say there’sthis many hundred million ergs of energy were released, and at the end of that line we had anOT. But that is in essence what you’re doing; you’re blowing the force, because the more forceis blown off the case the less amnesia the case has.Does it make sense to you now?Audience: Yes.Force created the amnesia and you got to blow it to get rid of the amnesia. Now, there’s aninteresting one-for-one."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"Now, the amount of time in processing—the amount of time in processing —is enormouslyspeeded up if you run the right significances, because you’re running the force off early track,and you start to get force release which you don’t see on the meter. Now, let’s not say that ifthe tone arm isn’t moving, it’s all okay; the tone arm is also moving when this happens.I was sitting down in session one day, and I could feel energy masses disintegrating clear outto Arcturus. It sure wasn’t registering on the meter. If it had, there wouldn’t have been anymore of an E-Meter here; there’d have just been charred wire. You get the idea? It was blowingoff all over the place.Every once in a while we’ll get a blowdown phenomenon. Well, when you see that blowdown,psheuX, pshew, pshew, pshew, pshew—I’ m talking about a repetitive down, see’ You callsee that needle go, pshew, pshew, pshelu, pshew, pshew; it just keeps doing it, and your tonearm is drifting lower and lower and lower. You’re watching a remote force area blow up.Now, if all this force blew up against the pc’s face and the pc’s body, he wouldn’t have anymore body than a rabbit. It’s pretty hard to do research auditing and keep a body over you. Itis, because you make one little mistake here and another mistake there and chew into a GPMsomeplace else, the next thing you know, there goes this and there goes that, and your right earlooks like a pretzel.Anyhow, the point I’m making here is that your force measured through the E-Meter is only apart of the force which is blowing off the case. But if any force is blowing off the case, youhave an additional movement of the tone arm. So if a tone arm is moving you’re blowing force,and if a tone arm is not moving you’re not blowing force. And that’s all you have to knowabout it.Now, there are several significances that can keep a tone arm from moving, such as wrong timeand an ARC-break situation where the pc is out of comm and a few things like this. But we’renot now discussing the no-motion tone arm; we’re discussing a motion tone arm.Therefore it is of great interest to an auditor, then, to make that tone arm move. And to make itmove all he can make it move. And your most fundamental method of making a tone arm moveis not running a process. It is the basic definition of an auditor: n listener. The basic way to let atone arm —get a tone arm move is to listen, and that is the fundamental of auditing.Now, somebody could probably talk for a thousand years and never say the right things, andyou wouldn’t get any tone arm motion. But, similarly, how many pcs talk and get tone armmotion from doing so and are shut up or cut off by the auditor? Ha-ha-ho-ho-ho. Now, there isan inhibition to blowing Clear. The auditor is not then doing his job; an auditor is setting up abarrier to blowing mass. And you’ll find out the pc winds up at the end of the session stupider.At the end of session, he can remember less than he could remember at the beginning ofsession.Why? Well, you’ve done something with the force. You have moved it out of the bank anddumped it on the thetan’s head. Oh, it’ll destimulate; it’ll go out of restimulation and all that sortof thing.The basic definition of an auditor is: to listen. He’s a listener. His basic job is to listen, not torestimulate.All right. Now, we stand around and we say, “Well, the Marcabians are gonna get youtomorrow, man, and the size of the between-lives-area screen is 180 feet by 9 feet,” and soforth. And people sit there and they go dzzzz. That’s doing what? That’s charging them up,isn’t it? That’s charging them up. Well, actually, they talk it over, one with another, andusually blow the charge. It’s not a grave matter; it’s not a difficult matter at all. Theirknowingness increases, and they feel all right about it and so forth. Well, we get away withthat."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Why? Because we can talk to one another about it, that’s why. The only method of blowingreactive charge is by a communication line. There is no other method. By a communicationline. I think that’s very interesting.Here’s the auditor, and he’s supposed to listen. And the only way the pc can possibly get rid ofthe charge is blow it by the communication line.Now, this doesn’t mean, oddly enough, that he’s blowing it at the auditor. He isn’t blowing itat the auditor. But that he can communicate it does cause it to dissipate, and it doesn’t hit eitherthe auditor or the pc. If the auditor wants to get hit by the charge, he should put up a barrier toprevent it from blowing, and the pc has an ARC break; and the next thing you know, theauditor is hit by the charge. You can set up a situation whereby the auditor is hit by the charge,but only if he stops the charge.How do you get rid of charge? Now, get what I just said. How do you get red of charge? Ididn’t say how do you handle charge, restimulate charge or anything like that: just how do youget rid of it? Listen. That’s how you get rid of it. Listen. Elementary, my dear Watson.Now, all therapies since time immemorial have consisted of listening— one way or the other.He is a sympathetic person, and people tell their troubles to him and very often feel a lot better.Well, all of that is very well, and you can add that up to a short-circuited look at auditing, butremember, this factor entered in: Was the pc, or was the patient, talking with tone arm action?Oh, that’s the difference. Or was the pc just mattering or was the pc lying or something? Youlet a pc sit there and lie, or a patient sit there and lie for a while, and you’re going to have oneof the stuckest tone arms you ever wanted to see.So that is the essence of the thing. An auditor is somebody who listens with tone arm action.That’s the difference. But remember, the fundamental of all mental activities was listening.Prayer is based on “God will hear me.” And if there’s no OTs around, who is going to hearhim?Actually, the Mama got so disgusted with this that he put all of his praying on automatic; heputs them on a little wheel. He can turn the wheel and it goes brrrrrrp and a thousand prayersgo up, and he’s got that cared for. And I’ll bet you his tone arm, it didn’t move a bit.So an auditor has the job, and auditing consists, of restimulating a charge (that’s the auditingcommand received by the pc) and then letting the pc blow the charge that is restimulated on thereturn communication line. Simple, isn’t it?I’ll draw you a picture of this thing. You needn’t take a very accurate copy of this because thisis an HCOB (I think 11 August), and I’m having it squared around. But I’ll draw you thisthing. [See Lecture Chart] Here’s cause-distance-effect. That is a communication cycle. Andhere is the auditor and here is the pc. The auditor utters an auditing command, and it goesacross this distance and hits something. What’s it hit—the pc? No, it hits the reactive bank, thataccumulated mass of force which the pc is packing around that is always kicking his head in.And we get what is known as restimulation at this point. There we are; we get a restim. There’sthe living lightning.Pow! goes the auditing command. We know this guy is very sensitive to snakes, so the auditorsays, “Recall a snake.” Pow! See? Bang! Well, now, of course if we’re in some kind of aweird situation whereby we’re fighting the pc, why, we’re not restimulating the bank. We’rejust trying to get the pc to fight us or something like that; we’re not—it hasn’t anything to dowith auditing. Just forget that. The auditor’s address actually is to the reactive bank, and hesays, “Recall a snake.” Bow! Now we get a communication line: bank-distance-effect. Andhere we have the pc—thetan."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"And the pc says, “Hey, what do you know! There is a snake in there.” And he goes: cause-distance-effect, and that’s the end of that. This line must follow in, to take care of the chargerestimulated in your first line.Cause-distance-effect: that’s the auditing command. Bow! There’s the charge. He recalls thesnake. Boom! It starts to hit the thetan and the thetan recognizes it, knows what it is andimparts that information on his cause-distance-effect line, back to the auditor. And there goesauditing. Your cycle then occurs, and the charge is blown. And you see it reacting on the E-Meter as blown.These are not all the communication cycles there are in an auditing cycle, but this doesn’thappen to be a lecture on that. I’m showing the principal action of these basic lines.Now, remember that life is always giving him commands that restimulates things—here at E—on the pc. This is our old PTP and other things of that character. If you don’t believe that, putin your “since” mid ruds on the pc and see how superior your tone arm action is. You usuallyget marvelous tone arm action on “since” mid ruds unless the pc is protesting them and wantsto get on with the session. And you get marvelous tone arm action.Well, that’s just the restimulated charge that’s been slapped at him out of this mucked-up hankthat he is gratuitously handed, in full restimulation with much added force, in every between-lives session he’s had with the little boys elsewhere. He’s trying to blow that charge. So hecomes into session, and he sometimes will sit there and talk to you for quite a while; and thetone arm would just move and move and move and move. He’s getting rid of the between-sessions charges. Interesting, isn’t it?You notice, after he’s talked for fifteen, twenty minutes sometimes, even somebody who hashad a big upset on the thing, you’ve got in your “since” mid ruds (or you haven’t gotten inyour “since” mid ruds), you notice that your tone arm. action dies down. And then suddenly,mysteriously, the pc is in session .What’s happened? You’ve emptied this reservoir of restimulation which life has handed him,restimulated in him during the session—between sessions, you see? And you’ve emptied thatthing out. Now, you want to know why your pc doesn’t go into session sometimes. Well, he’sjust—he’s got a lot of restimulated charge that is all ready to fall back.Now, you’ve got “Is it kinder to audit somebody one hour a week or twenty-five hours aweek?” Well, of course there is no comparison, because in the one hour you can’t even get ridof life’s restimulative action in this reservoir here at all, so you spend that one hourindifferently getting rid of three days of the week which you’re trying to cover, don’t you see?And it’s a losing proposition. There’s a make-break point in auditing where a person has to beaudited enough to get rid of this charge which is being consistently and continuallyrestimulated. Got that?Well now, this line here then—this lower line with the pc at cause answering this question backto the auditor, who in this case is at effect: then that line must have some seniority to the upperline. The auditor cause-distance-effect, then, is not quite as important as—they’re both terriblyimportant—but is not quite as important as the line, cause-distant-effect, of the pc. In otherwords, between the seniority of the two lines (both in the same order of magnitude), you’ll findthat the pc’s line to the auditor is slightly more important than the auditor’s line to the pc.And in this line of cause-distance-effect to the pc—in that line and an inspection of that line—you will find all auditing failures, providing any process at all that we have has been run. Inother words, if a case was loused up by auditing, we don’t inspect the process run as the firstconsideration. We inspect the tone arm as the consideration, because if you got good tone armmotion running that process, then that bottom line—the C-distance-E of the pc—was in."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Now, we’ve had processes for years. It’s true, our processes have to be very neat. They haveto be very important. They restimulate the exact amount of charge that then blows the outerbank charge and so forth, and it’s all figured out very neatly. And on some pcs it’s almostimpossible to get tone arm action; and you have to know what stops tone arm action; you haveto know all of these various things.But I’m now just talking about the fundamentals of auditing; and we inspect on a failed case theC-E (the C-distance-E) of the pc, not the process run. That’s the first thing we’d inspect: Wasthe auditor auditing?Now, anybody could sit there and say, “Recall a snake, recall a snake, recall a snake, recall asnake, recall a snake, recall a snake.”And the pc says, “Well, I . . .”“Well, that’s all right. Just don’t bother with that. Recall a snake, recall a snake,” and all of asudden the pc is da-da, da-da-da, you know? And he’s swamped.All right. What happens in a case like that? Well, this is very, very easy. This restimulation,when the pc puts it on this line, goes bang! straight back at the pc. Got it? When that line goesout, where else can it go? It’s only got one place to go, and that’s the pc. So whatever yourestimulate in a pc comes home on the pc, unless it is picked up on the reverse communicationline.Now, the penalties of this: the first symptom of the pc’s cause-distance-effect line—the firstsymptom of its disappearance is a dirty needle. You can go down any line of auditors who arebusy auditing, right down any line of auditors, and watch their meters. You don’t even have tolisten to them. You just see a dirty needle, bang! this line’s out: the auditor isn’t listening. Thefirst definition of auditor is missing.Pc is saying, “Well, that’s a snake. I . . . uh . . . Snake . . . uh . . . Well, there was one in azoo urm-uh-uh-urm. I think it was a zoo—there was one in a zoo . . .”The auditor said, “Okay! Thank you! Good! Good! Thank you! Thank you! Good! Recall asnake.”And the pc said, “Well, um-stla-stlassle hum. Yes, yes.”“Good! Good! Thank you!”Got this nonsense? He’s just backing up all the charge of the process on the pc.Ah, I see some of you have seen this happen. What occurs then? Well, frankly—frankly, intime, the C with the pc at cause-distance-effect line, in terms of time (the one here from the pcover to the auditor) may take upwards to a hundred times as much time in the session as the lineC-E from the auditor. Oh! It only took three seconds to ask that question “Recall a snake.”And the pc says, “Mmm “ and “Mmm. “ He finally says, “Was it in a zoo? I don’t know.Zoo?” and so on. What you’re seeing is identification turning into differentiation. You’reseeing force and charge blow off. The pc is inspecting this thing. And the tone arm moves, andit keeps moving, it keeps moving; and the pc says, well, he doesn’t know and so on. Was it agreen snake or a blue snake? He’s not quite sure if it was a green snake or a blue snake and soon. He can’t recall a snake and so forth and so on. “Snakes . . . nightmare about a snake . . .but was that recalling a snake? Uh . . . if . . . I’m not quite sure on it. There was one down atthe zoo when I was a little . . . Yeah, yeah, I got one. Um . . . yeah. Yeah, it was a greensnake. Oh, yeah. Yeah. There was one. Yeah. Houston Zoo. Yeah. Got it. Got one: a greensnake at Houston Zoo, when I was eight. Ha-ha.”"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"And you will see the cycle of the blowing force on your meter (tone arm) accompany returningknowingness on the part of the pc.And the more you get that thing wobbling, the more positive the pc sounds. You just watchthat, because that in itself is a little tiny proof of what I’m saying, is as you get the force off,the pc’s knowingness comes back. And you can see it in one cycle.One auditing cycle: the pc says, “Snake? My God. I’d never . . . oh, a snake, what snake?Where? What? Why? I’ll . . . oh, so . . . sss . . . I’m . . . I guess there was. See, where dothey keep . . . now, I just, why, uh . . . yeah . . . I was in a zoo at one time. Yeah, there arezoos. Let’s see, now . . .” so on and so on. “Zoos, and I. . . uh . . . must have been in a zoosometime or another. Uh . . . zoos . . . When I was a little bo . . . Well, they used to take meto a zoo when I was a little boy. Uh . . . the . . . uh . . . zoo . . . uh . . . uh . . . the snakehouse. Oh, yeah. There must have been one in the snake house and so forth. Uh . . . that . . .yeah, they had a glass,” and so forth, see. “Yeah. Yeah, t used to be fascinated by some cagein there. Let’s see, I can. . . I got. . . uh. . . yeah. They—it was a glass-fronted ca—they had agreen snake in there. Oh, I remember now. Yeah, I was eight. Yeah.” Bing, bang! He knows!You’ve pulled him up all the way through the force that tells him he doesn’t know, up to apoint where he knows. And you think it winds up with his simply seeing the picture clearly.No, no, he goes all the way through the picture stage, which I have just given you. Youunderstand?Audience: Yes. Yeah.Now, these two lines have names, regardless of what they will be called on your—the commcycles of your auditing cycles; they have numbers on the auditing cycle—but they have nice,colloquial names that you can remember very easily. And this is the whatsit line, and this is theitsa line. [See the Lecture Chart on page 123 of the Appendix.] Now, the whatsit line is fromthe auditor to the pc, and the auditor is saying “What’s it?” He says, “Recall a snake,” youknow? “What’s it?”And the pc says fumble, fumble, fumble, fumble. He’s looking for an itsa, see?Itsa: “Green snake, Houston Zoo.” That’s the itsa. And you’ll see the tone arm blow downwhen he hits it, too.So your tone arm, then, follows this pattern; your tone arm follows this pattern. Here is yourtone arm here—two tone arms. And here is (this is already in HCOB August 4)—here’s yourregular tone arm positions, and here is a nice solid arm, and here is a dotted arm; and here’s anarrow showing the motion as up from 3.0 to 4.0, and that’s a whatsit. You got that? Wehaven’t quite determined the low-tone-arm case, but I think they run in reverse. But that’s awhatsit; that’s the upward throw of the tone arm. That’s whatsit.The pc says, “Let’s see, snake, snake, wha . . . what . . . what . . . what . . . sa . . . Recall asnake. It’s a . . . let’s see . . . wha . . .” He’s saying whatsa, whatsa, whatsa, whatsa, whatsa,whatsa, see? And you’ll see that tone arm go up. And then he’ll get a little bit of an itsa, andyou will see the tone arm go down. And your tone arm, dotted at 4.0, falling to solid at 3.0,and that’s itsa.And you, frankly, can monitor a pc’s tone arm on one question like mad. He has an ARC breakwith somebody, and he sees that there’s some difference— some similarity—or he thinksmaybe he knows somebody who looked like the person he had an ARC break with. Thiswould be a research test. See, he sees— he knows now already that there’s some similarincident earlier, that he’s got this person associated with somebody he shouldn’t have itassociated with—got an identification going. And you say, “Well, what reminded you”—well,you don’t even know who that earlier person is, see?—but “What reminded you (in the person"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"you had the ARC break with), now, what reminded you of the person in the past?” See?Whatsa. And you’ll see that pc’s tone arm go right up. You say, “Whatsa?” Tone arm goes up.The pc says figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure— “Was it his . . . was ithis tie, his shirt? His . . . uh . . . it’s a . . . uh . . .uh . . . uh . . . tie, shirt. Uh . . . yup . . . uh. . . Or is it . . . there some way he held . . . I think it was the way he must’ve held his head.”Then you’ll get an itsa. And it’ll go right down: “Yes, just think it was the way he held hishead.”And you say, “Well, was there anything else?” Whatsa? And it’ll go right up. It goes right intothe whatsit.And the pc says, “Well, it could’ve been . . . it could’ve been the way . . . way he . . . ah . . .way . . . the . . . he’d stand there the kind of clothes he was wearing.... Must’ve been the kindof clothes he was wearing.” Itsa. And down comes the tone arm.And you actually can sit there as an auditor and control the motion of the tone arm. You cancontrol it. You can say “Whatsa?” and every time you give him a whatsa, you’ll see it goes up.And make sure he gives you a full itsa. And then feed back in again another fragment of thewhatsa, see? And up goes the tone arm again. And he gives you the itsa, and down comes thetone arm again. And you can just sit there and call your shots. (That’s a research project; younormally wouldn’t handle comm like that.)But you’ll see it in running almost any process. When you say whatsa, up she goes. Andyou—he says itsa, and down she comes. You say What’s it?” to the pc, and you get the uparm. That charge is restimulated and unresolved, and that high tone arm shows yourestimulated but unresolved charge. It’s sitting there in the bullpen; it’s sitting there in thereservoir, and it’s going to hit somebody or something. And the pc plows through this chargethat’s been restimulated here, and he puts it over on this line and he says itsa. And if he’spermitted to give you the itsa line, then the charge channels right—doesn’t hit the auditor; it justdisintegrates, see? And there it goes. Boom! It’s gone. You see that?The crudest auditing cycle is the whatsit-itsa; whatsit-itsa; whatsit-itsa. And of course it doesn’ttake any time to say whatsit, and sometimes takes quite a while to say itsa. So, consequently,this line is much more prone to be out than the upper line—than the whatsa line.Definition of an auditor: to listen.Now, you’re handling a case: if you knew Scientology in the Galactic Confederation at thisparticular moment, man, they’d practically put you on a throne, see? Cases! Well, boo. Youtake some of the old Route 1, and you say, “All right. Be three feet back of your doll. All right.Be on planet A, planet B. planet A, planet E, planet A, planet B. Got it? You’re getting alongfine. Planet A, planet B. Good. OT. Thank you.”Guy would say, “Gosh. You know, this is terrific”—provided you listened. Guy’d say, “Thisis terrific. I feel much better now. I don’t see why I have to be pinned in that doll’s head. I’mgoing around getting my sergeant’s stripes as an OT.”The situation would be very different from what you’re operating with. The character of the pcyou’re operating with is operating under an enforced and continuously-each-life-reinforcedamnesia. And if the course of the case upward is to knowingness, think of what stands in yourroad auditing an Earth case. And if you were up around in some other locales, it would beabout the same difference as right now auditing an Earth case; you would sort of feel odd as—how the hell do you audit an ant? Do you see? Well, it’d be that same gap between an Earthcase and an ant, as a case of more or less a free thetas out there in space (who doesn’t haveyour technology) and an Earth case. Do you see that?"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"So I can feel for you, trying to get wins on the cases you’re trying to get wins on, but youshould recognize what type of case you’re trying to get wins on and should recognize whereyour line is breaking down. Now, I have never been able to describe this to you as succinctlyas this. I myself wasn’t making much of this mistake; it didn’t call too much to my attentionwhat it is, but it must have been there if the original word which identifies you, auditor, meanslisten—must have been there all the time, well understood.Now, what’s the course of having that line out? What’s the source—course of it? Here’s, first,(1) dirty needle; (2) stuck TA; (3) ARC break. One, two, three—as inevitable as nonsense fromWashington. One, two, three—just like that. If your pc has a dirty needle, a stuck tone arm isincipient on that case. It’s liable to happen any minute. Man, you’re already three-quarters ofthe way over the cliff! In fact, the beginning of the piercing, dwindling scream is about tosound. And your ARC break will follow immediately afterwards: bypassed charge.The most fruitful source of bypassed charge, then, is the itsa line—just it. And that’s all, thatline.That is the most fruitful source of bypassed charge, then: Restimulate an engram, don’t let thepc tell you about it; restimulate an engram, don’t let the pc tell you about it; restimulate anengram, don’t let the pc tell you about it; restimulate an engram, don’t let the pc tell you aboutit; restimulate an engram, don’t let the pc tell you about it. If you haven’t got an ARC break bythat time, the pc must have been dead to begin with!Do you see that simply by filling up this reservoir full of charge and then not putting in the itsaline—not letting the pc tell you all about it—you’re bypassing charge? This is elementary.That gives you a change in your auditing-training program at Level W. At Level W we’re goingto teach an auditor to be an auditor. We’re going to teach them to listen before they restimulateanything. Life restimulates quite a bit of charge. The auditor should at least be able to handlethat.Level I—Scientology I auditing—will consist, then, mainly of listening. You see his TA stopmoving, you must have seen earlier a DN and not noticed it. So therefore, if you see a DN, youknow that your TA motion soon is going to cease. It may not be the exact next session; it maytake two sessions for it to really stop. Two sessions of the same kind of treatment, see? Andyou know, that’s going to wind up in an ARC break.These people who are ARC-breaky pcs are not ARC-breaky pcs; there is no such thing. Thereare only auditors who don’t listen. It’s very simple. It’s very elementary.I don’t wish to give you too much stress on this, because you’re liable to go completelyoverboard and just sit there and let your pc do nothing but talk. But the only crime that you cancommit on letting the pc talk—the only crime you can commit—is if the pc doesn’t move histone arm by talking. Pc is talking for a while, and you see that the tone arm isn’t moving: Well,you go on letting him talk forever, you’re foolish, because the case is getting no place.And this question will come up: The pc is motivatoring, motivatoring, motivatoring, nattering,nattering, nattering. First question that was thrown at me. We had a student here one time thatonly talked in motivators—didn’t talk English, talked motivators. And the question was askedof me, “Well, what if we just let that person talk?” Well, in the first place, she never wouldhave gotten any TA as a result of all this talk. And the other thing—she was already in an ARCbreak! Do you follow that? You don’t let people talk when they’re in an ARC break: you findwhat the bypassed charge is. Because your itsa line has already gone so far out that it won’t putitself back in.So you say “When shouldn’t you let a pc talk?” No TA action or the pc already in an ARCbreak. The time [thing] to do, then, is act."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"And the no TA action: Well, let’s give them another auditing command or something like that,but that normally isn’t what’s wrong when you get stuck TA in that particular fashion. Ifyou’re doing ARC breaks of some kind or another like “Recall ARC breaks,” and the pc hashad an ARC break in present time with themselves having recalled an ARC break in the past,that sort of thing can happen, see? Or they’ve suddenly bypassed and haven’t answered fifteenor twenty ARC breaks. They haven’t given them to you; they threw them all away, suppressedthem. That sort of thing is happening. Something weird has gone on in the session, and yousuddenly cease to get tone arm action. Now, the pc could sit there and talk forever, andwouldn’t get him out of it. No, it requires the auditor to locate what bypassed charge, what hashappened here? He has two remedies for this: he has the ARC Break Assessments and he hashis big mid ruds. He has ways of getting people out of this mess.But that is your basic problem. We’re not talking about the ramifications of it. Let the pc talkand let him talk with tone arm action. And let them talk as long as they want to talk and let themtalk as long as you can get tone arm action by their talking. Where did you get so industrious?If I could sit there for two and a half hours with the pc telling me all about early track engramsand it’s this way and that way, and I’ve got a TA that is banging here from 2.5 to 4.25, backand forth and back and forth, I’m afraid I would just sit there. And I know some of you sit andacknowledge. Oh, no. I wouldn’t short that off. I’d just sit. there and look intelligent Iwouldn’t acknowledge a thing—no interim acknowledgments.Once in a while they look up and they seem brighter about it, so I look brighter and nod. Whatdo you want to work so hard for? You realize that we’re talking now about Case-Level-IIauditing, because that is Case-Level-II auditing. But all you’d have to do is let the pc starttalking about his backtrack and get tone arm action and never give an auditing [command]. Startand end sessions; that’d be all there was to the auditing session. See, it’d get that elementary.Well, of course, it can get that elementary all the way down. But the worse off they are, themore their attention has to be directed, the more particularized the process has to be. The way tobypass charge is not let the pc tell you.Now, there’s the basic anatomy of what you’re doing, and it should make an awful lot ofsense. And if you were to teach somebody just to listen (Scientology I, see)—you say, “Well,you should go listen to people’s problems” —they’ll have some weird little wins. You’re noteven teaching them to run an E-Meter, see; just to let somebody talk to you. Then eventually,he’ll find out that there’s talk and talk. There’s the talk that moves E-Meters and the talk thatdoesn’t. By that time they’d be a pro. Learn to listen, and you’ve got it made.You got this all wrapped up and figured out and you see it and you got it taped now?Audience: Yes. Yeah.Well, watch those DNs and get that itsa line in.Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"THE ITSA LINEA lecture given on20 August 1963How are you today?Audience: Good.

There are numerous communication lines between the auditor and the pc and theaggregate of these make up what you call the auditing cycle. The auditing cycle is made up ofseveral communication lines. A communication line is cause-distance-effect. I call yourattention to Dianetics 1955! for the full definition of a communication line. What is acommunication: intention, attention, duplication at the point of effect, and so forth.All those are quite important and technically accurate, but what you’re mainly interested in iscause-distance-effect. Cause-distance-effect is a communication line. A communication line isnot cause-distance-effect, cause-distance-effect—that’s two communication lines.Now, a communication line can be very faint, and one of those that you’ll find out routinely onan auditor is the attention line: line 1 minor; line 1 minor, the attention line. And that is justconsistently out. But as I say, there are numbers of these and we’re not particularly going intothem. That’s the first line. That’s get the pc’s attention; how do you get the pc’s attention tocause the pc to put his attention on the auditor? And that line is the one that is put in.Now, that line itself can be complex and become two lines or three lines. Pc sitting there andhe’s saying, “Gob-gob, walla-walla,” something, and the auditor wants to get his attention onhim. See, it has to have attention on the auditor. Now, the auditor can’t really give an auditingcommand or do anything with his command unless he gets his attention line in. Now, that canbe done very crudely. You can drop the E-Meter, you can cough loudly in the pc’s face, tipover your chair, get angry. There’s, in essence, numbers of ways to get this line in very, verywrong. And the line has to be put in, however, and very often you find a pc fogging around atthe beginning of session and his attention is not on the auditor, it’s really not on his case, it’snot on anything you’re trying to do, and so forth. Well, how do you get it there? Well, one ofthe ways of getting it there is, having an attention line already extant, you then convert it to anitsa line.Now, this is the whole trick, because there’s another attention line. There is attention on what,see? And this looks like another attention line—it’s actually 1 minor. It just isn’t putting theattention on the auditor, it’s putting attention on something else. And this is a little trick I usedto do that used to baffle everybody in ACCs. They used to get baffled, and everybody woulddrop his jaw and look at me dully when I would try to get them to do this—and it’s beenwholly unsuccessful—but by dividing down the auditing cycle into these variouscommunication lines and component parts, I will bravely take another crack at it."},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"It’s slippy. I know if I give this to you, it’ll become a repetitive-command process, which itisn’t. It’s Hippy, that’s all—is you just very adroitly, without really putting the pc’s attentionon anything except what his attention should be on, just flick the pc’s attention over to what itshould be on. I’ll give you an idea.Pc is saying, ‘Oh, I just . . . just . . . just can’t stand . . . can’t stand these uh . . . these wildparties. Just can’t stand them. Had one last night and just can’t stand them, and so forth.There’s just too much . . . too much music and everything. And I’ve got an awful present timeproblem, because this guy’s— this . . . this . . . this girl’s b . . . b . . . boyfriend came overand wanted to pop me in the eye because I was getting too familiar, and it’s terrible.” Andpresent time problem, present time problem, present time problem.And you know you’re running the GPM “to be sexual,” see? This you know about the case.This is—this I’m giving you, also, is the itsa line.Hey, we’re getting a nice storm tape here. We’ll cut the storm off of it, and so forth, and sell it.They go great in the Middle West. They love storm tapes. It reminds them of home.I had a green tornado one time in Kansas—never been back since. Twenty-five-pound blocksof ice were falling out of a pea-soup-green sky, and the visibility had dropped down to aboutfifteen feet—bright green. Never quite recovered. Was impossible. Couldn’t have happened—but it did.Now, your pc’s attention being all over the confounded place, the auditor sits back and sayshe’s going to put in the itsa line. Now, usually by this— unless he is well trained and has thisdata, and so forth—this means he’s going to sit back and leave the pc’s attention totallyuncontrolled. The itsa line, when you first start giving it to people, is just never doing anythingbut listen. And that’s because people think it is simply a communication line, and it isn’t. Butwe will go on to this in a moment.Now, therefore this pc is running on and on and on about this party—and this is slippyauditing. I can sit and do this by the hour. Pc never finds out about it, and there’s no commandprocess being run and everything else, and tone arm moves like mad, and so forth. It requires acertain estimation of effort, you understand? And I actually, years and years ago, despaired ofgetting anybody to control attention that lightly. This is another effort to do so, see?So, you say—he’s going on and on, “And this guy came over and he almost bopped me, butthis was a nice-looking girl, and so forth. And t had a terrible problem because of my wife, youknow, and so on, and . . .” Here we go, see?Now, the auditor who is not well informed and who is not well skilled just sits back and listensto this whole thing. Now, to do anything about it suddenly is to put line I minor in on theauditor. Clank! And boy, the pc will ARC break, see, because it’s a sudden shift of attention.So the whole thing is the skill by which you can take line 1 minor and flick it over onto whatyou were doing or want to do in the session—the skill with which you can do this.And, believe me, this is a skill maneuver. And when you are really skilled at this, you couldalmost sit down and run a full auditing session, and even a casual observer would think youwere simply listening to the pc, which you weren’t at all; you were actually directing the pc’sattention very closely. The pc was talking exactly about what you wanted that pc to talk aboutand nothing else, and the pc never realizes that their attention has been grooved on it.Now, that would be the tremendous difference between psychoanalysis listening andScientology auditing. You see, these things could look quite alike.The psychoanalyst (1) did not really know what to direct anybody’s attention to, see? He didn’tknow the anatomy of the bank. He thought if he could direct somebody’s attention to sexualincidents in early childhood, he had it made. Well, now, a pc—a pc—actually follows in his"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"case, at any given moment, the least-charged line. A pc will always follow the least-chargedline. Get this. Get this good, because that’s one of those remarks that goes by in the night andyou wonder someday—you’re sitting there auditing somebody and you don’t know what todo, and so forth. And it’s one of those things that if you knew that well, you’d know exactlywhat to do. He always follows the least charged line with his tone arm action. If you’re goingto get tone arm action, it is on the least-charged aberrative line—not the least-charged thing hecould talk about, but the least-charged aberrative line. The tone arm action exists on the least-charged aberrative line at any given moment in a case progress— always the least-chargedaberrative line.Now, give you what I mean by that. Let’s take dynamics. You’ve got eight dynamics youcould audit on the pc. The third dynamic is what the pc is always coming up with. Well, if youkept the pc on the third dynamic, you know, you would get tone arm action because thishappens with the pc to be the least-charged line. You got it?Now, the other lines do not give tone arm action, and this does not mean they are not charged;it means they are overcharged. There is too much charge on them. Got that? So you’re alwaystrying to snake through the mine field on the least-popping firecrackers to get your tone armaction. You got that? You want little ones that’ll just tingle his feet; you don’t want those that’llblow his legs off. You understand?Well, the mind is so regulated and safety-valved that it will not release charges which the pcconsiders over his ability to tolerate. Now, an auditor can actually punch these charges intoview; he’s got all the materials in his hand. And therefore he could actually throw the pc intoareas which are overcharged areas to be run—the areas are overcharged.The result of an overcharged area is a stuck tone arm. Stuck tone arms have many peculiaritiesand particularities. You can say that if you want to really get tone arms moving you have to getthe GPMs on a case run; that’s the most likely to give you tone arm action. It’s the mostaberrative in terms of time. You can say a lot of things about tone arm action. You say tone armaction sticks because of time—these things are all true. But with regard to charge, what youreally want to know with regard to charge is that in the presence of too much charge—too muchcharge—the TA ceases to operate. TA action ceases when you have too much charge.That doesn’t say that you couldn’t bleed it, that you couldn’t work your way around it, thatthere aren’t means of getting off the charge anyhow, and all that sort of thing. But when yousee a TA ceasing to operate, and ceasing to act, then you have entered an area of too muchcharge—particularly on an extremely high or an extremely low TA. Do you follow that, now?Too much charge.It’s not because there’s nothing there to run; it’s because there’s too cockeyed much there. Seethat? And if you don’t get tone arm action, then the charge that holds the significances andideas, postulates, cognitions, and that sort of thing, in place—just the corny, electrical charge,you understand, no other significance connected with it—this thing packed up and held infacsimiles, masses, all of this sort of thing, won’t, then, let the case advance. And you get nocase advance in the absence of tone arm action. That is—that’s it! I mean, there aren’t anyands, ifs, areas or buts about it. No tone arm action: no case advance!I don’t care if you erased a somatic, I don’t care if the pc has ceased to have lumbosis, I don’tcare about any of these things—because you’re not auditing a body. As far as this pc isconcerned—no tone arm action: no case advance.Now, can you worsen no tone arm action? Yes. You can bring about no needle action on top ofno tone arm action. Hu-hu-hu-hu. And if you insist on running a pc without tone arm action,you soon will begin to see it expressed over here in the needle, which will get tighter andtighter and tighter. And after a while everything locks up. And then if you use real desperatemeasures, why, you can just freeze the pc into something that’ll feel to him like solid rock."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"The longer you run a case without tone arm action, the more you will freeze the case into notone arm action. And the more the case is frozen into no tone arm action, the less chance youhave of getting charge off by any means. You see this? I mean, you’re walking away from thepoint of resolution. The further you go with no tone arm action, the less likely you are tofortuitously produce some. So it’s not just “Well, he’s running without tone arm action,” andbrush it off, you see? It’s “Oh, my God! He’s running without tone arm action! Whew. Huh.Hey, hey, hey! Bo-bo-bo-bo! No tone arm action! Hey, hey, hey, hey! No tone arm action.Get some tone arm action. Ha-ha.” You know? It gets that type of emotional response, youknow? Not “Well, he’s running without tone arm action, so he isn’t getting any better,” and soon, see?Guy being run without tone arm action is somebody you’re watching go down the bigtoboggan. And the longer this goes on, the harder it’s going to get to get tone arm action.Now, the most likely way to get tone arm action on any condition, any case or any anything, isgetting in the itsa line. This has processes connected with it. These processes are designatedRoutine 1C (C for communication). Routine 1C: this is the soft-touch process. This is theprocess that will be given to Scientology I auditors, and after you’ve studied it and used it ayear or two, you’ll find out that there’s a lot more to know about it.It is at once the clumsiest use—it’s the workhorse, you see? You say, “Well, you’ve got twoprocesses to make an OT. You’ve got 3N, you got R3R.” No, you’ve always got threeprocesses. See, if you’ve got two like that, then you’ve always got one more, and that’llalways be the itsa line, or 1C, see? This is the workhorse. This is the workhorse.And, yeah, somebody in a co-audit; yes, sure, somebody in a—doing a book-auditing job;yeah, somebody, some student in the academy; yeah, these people, oh, yes, these guys will beable to make progress with this thing. But before he’s gone very long in the academy andbefore he’s done very much auditing, he’ll all of a sudden begin to believe—he’ll do one oftwo things: either, “Well, I just get tired of just sitting there listening to him talk and talk andtalk and talk, you know? I just net tired of this. So this itsa line isn’t so good.” See? He didn’teven know what it was in the first place, see? Or he will all of a sudden begin to realize thatthere is a certain deftness required here or one will just continue to sit and listen and listen, andthe pc goes on and talks and talks.Well, look, they talked for five years in psychoanalysis without getting anyplace. See we don’tknow that they had tone arm action, but we sure know they didn’t get anyplace. They did.They did—pardon me, pardon me. That— I’m maligning the boys. I’m maligning them. Theygot careful. Their did get someplace.Well, look-a-here. You learn, then, that an overcharged case can most easily be bled down bythe itsa line, and you’ll restore tone arm action. So the best way to restore tone arm action toany case that has become overcharged through being run in the wrong departments is getting inthe itsa line. Now, that’s your base process. You can restore: one arm action, no matter howbadly the case has been jammed up, if you are clever in handling the itsa line.Now, when I say “itsa line,” and when I say “clever,” yes, they’re very definitely joinedtogether. Clever. It is not a process; it’s a cleverness. And the biggest trouble you haveanything with is (as we’ll come back to this) line 1 minor. Why put the attention on the auditorwhen all you’ve got to do is shift it slightly in the pc?This guy is saying, “Well, and so forth, and we had this big . . . big hassle at this party and I .. . this . . . my wife bawled me out, and everybody bawled me out and so forth. And I’ve gotthis terrible present time problem. I got this awful hangover and I’m having an awful time inthis session,” and so on and so on and so on. Yeah, under a long series of runs you couldprobably take apart this present time problem, but you were running on the pc the goal “to besexual.” The pc is having trouble with being sexual, that’s for sure."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Well, that’s where the cleverness is, is was there anything that happened —you know, is whatthe pc’s talking about got anything to do with what you were doing, see? So, of course, theadroit question practically walks up and hits you in the head. The adroit question is. . . Pc takesa long breath and momentarily he isn’t going on any further. Just momentarily, see? Heactually hasn’t run his communication line out terribly, but he’s just been floundering, you’regetting minimum tone arm action. And you say, “Did our last session have anything to do withthis?”“Oh. Let’s see, what the hell were we doing in the last session?”“Well, I don’t know. Just review what we were doing.”“Well, let’s see, uh . . . so and so on, so on, then we had an ARC break and we were doingsomething or other and uh . . . so on. We were running out some kind of items; there’s thisbacktrack and there’s this stairs or something there. Let me see, now. I . . . I’ll . . . I’mgetting’ it now,” and so forth. “Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we were running . . . uh—yousee, I . . . I really can’t get anywhere near this, I’m so worried about my present timeproblem—but uh . . . we were uh . . . we were urn . . . urn . . . running some goal, somegoal, some goal, urn . . . some goal, something along this line and so on. Oh, yes, ‘to be sex’Say, what do you know! (sigh) Yeah, I sure do have a lot of trouble with . . . with this thing‘to be sexual.’ I ha . . . Yeah, I sure do. Uh . . . yeah, I . . . I have a lot of trouble with that.”“Well,” you say, “well, what items did we have there, right toward the last?”“Well, I think we arrived at this point on the line plot, and uh . . . I think it was . . . I think itwas . . . uh, ‘absolutely’ uh . . . No, it was ‘nix’ . . . uh, yeah. Well, all right. There we are.”And you’re starting to see your tone arm move and your needle start to twitch.And he never knew what happened. Magic, man, magic! It’s gently taking line 1 minor,without actually putting it on the auditor, and putting it back to the subject of the auditing. And,you see, there’s no process that you could announce that will do this, because the auditing istremendously variable and the pc’s worries and concerns are fantastically agglomerate.Now, sometimes, the pc has legitimately had a present time problem and somethingcatastrophic has occurred between sessions, something like this is just using this factor for justa present time problem—and it’s something way off. And the only thing you can do is to keepflicking that attention line Flick—it’s really not a whatsit line; your whatsit’s already in, yousee? And you just keep moving it around till the pc will ventilate the PTP that he’s worryingabout.Now, the crudest—but still acceptable—example of this is simply “Tell me about it.” See,that’s crude. See, that’s something like we’re going to build house so we pile up some bricks.That’s crude. That’s about as adroit as the cow doing the twist, see? But nevertheless, it’sfunctional. You do get some motion. I couldn’t forbear to milk that gag.Now, so there’s the pc, see? And the pc can’t get his mind on what you’ doing becausesomething else has happened. And this something else is re worried, and maybe it’s worrieddown to the level of grief charge, or something like this, see? Well, all you can do is move thislittle attention line around onto things that’ll give him itsas. And you can cut it down from—well, actual failing to relieve the situation, that’s how bad it can be, see? You just didn’t reallyrelieve his problem, or you relieved it somewhat, or you—next gram is you spent the sessionmaking him feel better about that present tin problem. See, we’re well into the acceptable band,if we’ve got to be. Or, N handled it in the first two hours of the session, or we handled it in thefirst ho of the session, or we handled it in the first fifteen minutes of the session. All thatdifference of time has very little to do with the seriousness of the problem it has everything todo with the cleverness of the auditor—without putting t attention line on himself, withoutcutting the itsa line—adroitly shifting the little attention line there to this and that."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"“Well,” the person says, “but uh . . . this . . . But I don’t see . . . I don see why we had tofight half the night after we got home. I told her I just was attracted by blondes, and so forth,and she just wouldn’t listen,” and so forth.And the auditor says, “What have you found out about arguments like that with your wife?”“Well, itsa, itsa, itsa, itsa, itsa, itsa, itsa.”“Well, that’s fine. All right. Now, how do you feel about this problem now?”“Well, the problem is all right.”Well, he’s still a little bit fluttery, so, “Well, let’s review now what we were doing onsomething or other.” Got the idea?“Well, we were doing so-and-so and, well, you know what we were doing well as I do.”“Well, all right, yeah, probably. But I may not have full records here this. There might havebeen something that came up during the session, something like this, or between sessions youmight have thought of something else.”“Oh, yes! I did, as a matter of fact.” You’re away, see? Got the idea?Actually, it’s just about as skilled as building a watch, but because there’s no apparent skillthere, don’t you see, it gets slightly into disrepute. People watch a session in which this isoccurring, and they really never even hear auditor say anything, see? And the pc never reallyhears the auditor; anything, because the attention line isn’t “All right, now. All right. Okay.right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I. . . er got all that you’re talking about. Now, right. Now we’regoing to give you . . . going to give you the next . . . next . . . next auditing command—thenext . . . the next . . . the . . . the next auditing command. You got that now? Got that now. Allright. Here are, now. All right. Do birds suffocate? Okay? Got that now? Do birds suffocate?”Now, you’ve restimulated some charge. I won’t say what charge you’ve restimulated.See, now that can grade on down from just too much, you see. That can grade on down to “Dosuffocating birds have anything to do with this?” “Were there any birds suffocating in that?”See? To “Well, do you think your processing has bettered this situation?” Now we’re reallygetting feather-light, aren’t we? Pc hardly heard you say it and neither would anybody else,you see?“Well, let’s see. Let’s go over what we’ve covered so far in auditing. Well now, you had acouple of cognitions in the last session there that had something to do with this. Have you hadany other cognition with regard to goals, and so forth—these implanted goals?” This is gettingawful adroit, see? You’ve actually got something he’s already been talking about, and you putit in by the duplication factor. You duplicate what he has been talking about and you just pullhis itsa line a little bit further and put it on something, see?I’ll give you an idea of doing this. He says, “Well, auditing, auditing. I get these awfulheadaches in auditing and that sort of thing.”“Well, have you particularly gotten them while we’ve been running goals?”Few sessions later—he’s forgotten all about these headaches, and so forth—we’re having ahard time getting his itsa line in: “How about these headaches? Are they troubling you as muchnow? When we run these goals and that sort of thing, how are these headaches?” Soundsmerely solicitous. It isn’t, it’s a itsa line, see? See, you’ve taken a dead-ended communicationline someplace back down the line and you’ve repeated its subject, so therefore you have madea duplication, so you’ve created a communication line. It’s all very technical. And the person’sattention goes back onto this and he has to make a comparison. He has to say his headaches are"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"better or worse or there’s no change, and while he’s doing this he has to put his attention onGPMs, or whatever you’re trying to run on it.And you say, “Well, with this last one that we were running in the last session—the last one,‘to be nutty,’ ‘to be crazy in the head,”’ so forth, something like that, “how were the somaticsin the head getting along there? Were they turning on and off, and so forth, while we’ve beenrunning that?”“Oh, well, you shouldn’t really remark on this, because I had them pretty well off.”“Well, what item did they go off on?”“Well, they went off on uh . . . Well, I really don’t know. Someplace in the first part of it. Um. . . urn . . . urn . . . I had an item in there . . . is . . . uh, ‘idiotably . . .’ I think it was‘idiotably nutty.’ Yeah. Yeah, that was the one. Hey, I got that headache again, you know?”You say, “Well, give me ‘nix idiotably nutty.”’ You’re away, see? See? He doesn’t know whathit him, see?It’s moving that attention line adroitly, adroitly, see? Adroit. With the little pinky—the littlefinger, you know—raised just right on the teacup, see?Now, you’ll see an auditor who really hasn’t got much feeling for it, and no tools and so forth,why, he’s got this teacup with both paws wrapped around it, you see? And you’ll seesomebody else has poured the tea into the saucer with both paws wrapped around the saucerand inhaling at a very large number of decibels. See? So, that you’ll see this in all of its shadesof gray, you see, down to outright black.But before you understand anything much about the itsa line, you have to understand that thereis such a thing as an attention line—line 1 minor—and unless you can handle that attention lineslightly, adroitly, greatly, smoothly . . . You’ll curse yourself sometimes. Even the best of anauditor will say, “Well, let’s get to running this GPM now,” or something . . . Cut your throat,you see? You spend the next fifteen minutes getting out of this hole. See, it was just too muchin the wrong place, see, and it just smashed everything up and the pc busy explaining to youthat he is eight thousand light-years from that GPM and his attention wasn’t on it, you know?You find yourself making these mistakes. Don’t knock yourself in the head and say “Well, I’mterrible at this” and run a big make-guilty on self because you don’t handle this well always.Just, those times you have been clever, pat yourself on the back. That’s the one to pay attentionto. I’m not kidding you because . . . Well, I gave a session last night and I dropped—threetimes. Or I dropped a handful of-anvils on the floor—shook up the session mostinterestingly—and another time I put off a whole chain of firecrackers in the midst of theauditing table, and another time practically ran the mains volts through the cans, see? But thatwas three, see? That was three. But there was two hours’ worth, and probably something onthe order of 150 that were handled, you know, with such aplomb, man, that nobody everfound out anything about it, and it got the pc out of the woods gorgeously. So Quantitatively,see? ‘Course what you put your attention [on] are those things that had to be patched up, see?“Oh, oh. Well, your attention wasn’t on it. Well, I’m very sorry, and so on. Have I cut yourcommunication?” You know, “Sorry,” and so forth. “Well what would you have said if Ihadn’t have interrupted that?” See? Got a recovery, see, level, and so forth. Nevertheless, ifyou really were self-critical to a vast degree, you would have been practically kicking yourbrains out for having pulled any one of these three.Pc is going on and saying, “Well, I think I have blown that last GPM think I have blown that.”"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"“Well, all right. All right. Good. Let’s check some of its items.” Oh-oh, your throat, man, see?Just put the pc’s attention on the wrong thing, wrong place, it’s all going crash, the pc’s needlegoes dirty. Get the idea?You see, you’re split between wanting the pc to think well of you, and getting your job done.And these two things are very often at—they’re diapola [dipolar] phenomena. You try and getyour job done sometimes uphill against something and in the final analysis it just merelydepends on, did you get the job done, see? That’s what it really depends on in the finalanalysis. But in process of getting your job done, you happen to have ARC broke the pc andthe pc’s communication line several times. Well, the difference between a good and a badauditor is not whether the auditor always audits smoothly; never cutting an itsa line, butwhether or not he attains his eventual objective without creating so many ARC breaks that thepc’s case has not improved. That’s the test!If you go around training people on the basis of “You must never cut itsa line; you must nevercreate an ARC break; you must never upset pc”—all of these things, you see—it’s somethinglike laying in a GPM, know? Oh, in the first place, it’s an impossible attainment. Always trainthem with “Be as clever and adroit as you can,” and “You can be a little more accurate thanthat.” He dropped his E-Meter in the pc’s lap halfway through session. Poor handling of theattention line. Why? Pc’s attention went on meter, not on own case.All right. Now, how many dozen ways are there to shift the pc’s attention I don’t know—dozens, thousands. Thousands. I’ll give you an idea. You got an alcoholic. You’re trying toprocess this alcoholic, see? Alcoholic’s drunk during sessions and you know you’re notsupposed to audit somebody who’s drunk. All the alcoholic’d do is sit there and say, “Well,Alcoholics Anonymous will say you can’t cure anybody of alcoholism.” That’s all he’s goingto say, see knows you can’t help him. He’s saying, well, it’s impossible, see? And you say“Well, the case is unauditable.”Yes, the case is unauditable to everybody except those who are surpassingly skilled with theattention line and the itsa line, see? The whatsit line is practically missing.“Now, what have you learned about Alcoholics Anonymous?”“Oh, well, that’s something else, uh . . . Well, I met this fella down the street, this fella, and soforth, and he gave me this book, see? And I read this book and I threw it in a garbage pail.Couldn’t teach me anything. But I learned better after a while.”“When was that?”“Oh, in about a few days later I learned better, see? I had this awful hangover, and I just gotfired and I was being sued for divorce, and I found out they were your friends. That’s what Ifound out then.” You’re going to see that tone arm starting to move, man.He has just told you that you can’t possibly audit him. He has just told you that you can’tpossibly help him. So you just—Hhh-hhh—polish up the fingernails, audit him, help him, andsomewhere up the line he finds out about it as a major cognition.But all the way up the line he’s improving. Because if you can get tone arm motion and get theguy with the session, see, by flicking that little old attention line right where it lives—parallelwhat the mind is doing, and it will do everything you want it to. Nothing new—that’s thebeginning lines, I think, of one Of the first-book things. But nevertheless, this gives you theanatomy of how that’s done. You just find out about what this guy’s mind is on, see? And ifyou can produce tone arm action by having him locate things about it, then he will recover fromany obsessive or compulsive tendencies about it or toward it. It’s the tone arm motion that takesoff the compulsion, not the significance of what he digs up. Given enough tone arm motion onany given subject, and that subject will right itself in the head of the pc. And, man, I’m talkingfrom hard-won experience. I’d say, if we’ve learned anything in the last thirteen years, man,"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"we’ve learned that. ‘Tisn’t the significance alone. It’s the tone arm motion that can be obtainedin relation to the significance that brings about the recovery.Now, that’s, the fastest recovery is, of course, the tone arm motion plus the right significanceto be run. Now, that’s your fastest recovery. But your recovery takes place somewhat andeventually if you just produce tone arm motion. That’s all you have to do, is produce tone armmotion on the case, regardless of what’s run, and eventually—at some vast distance—why,this pc is going to recover from these various targets and so forth in the case. He’s going torecover from them. That’s for sure. But if you audit the right significance and get no tone armaction, the pc will never recover. See,-those are terribly important data.Well now, the most overcharged areas of the case are the case’s—parts of the case that give thehigh TA. The high TA and the overcharged area compare. The least-charged aberrative areagives tone arm action.You very often will find some alcoholic that gets no tone arm action on the subject ofalcoholism, but he’s got corns. You can get tone arm action on the subject of corns, you see?In other words, he can’t face that highly a charged approach. So that sometimes the absolutedirect approach to a compulsion or obsession of some kind or another will get you nowhere atall, because it’s such a highly charged area that it’s over the pc’s head, and you get no tone armaction on that.Well, the answer to that is don’t abandon it; just get tone arm action! See? That’s the thing todo. Just get tone arm action! Very remarkable. Because the mind is stacked up the way it is, ifyou continue to get tone arm action, he’ll all of a sudden walk up on that thing, do you see?Now, undirectedly—that’s just not directing him toward any specific target or goal oraberration or anything else, or any reason he’s not able or anything at all, anything—you gettone arm action and he’ll eventually collide with something. And he will know processing ishelping him!You’ll be utterly flabbergasted sometime. You have this surprise in store for you, if youhaven’t collided [with] it already. Knowing the idea about tone arm action, you sit there andthis pc babbles on and on and on, and it doesn’t have anything to do with anything you cansee, but my God, that tone arm is moving. You’re getting up and down motions on thatthing—not a quarter division every twenty minutes, man. You’re getting—it’s got to be a bithealthier than that for a pc to know something about it—but it’s certainly getting a whole tonearm division every ten minutes, and that’s pretty fair tone arm motion, see? And that’sacceptable. I wouldn’t buy much less than that myself—tone arm division every ten minutes.And that would say only down but you realize that it also has to rise in order to go back downagain. So if you added the plus and minus, that’d be two tone arm divisions, you see—one upand one down—in ten minutes. Well, that’s just barely, marginally acceptable see, to producethis phenomena.You get that?All right. Pc talking about his grandmother’s jam making. Well, cripes you know? This isabout as aberrative, don’t you see, as petting the pup. But my heavens, you’re getting tone armmotion on it, man. Well, you can’t do anything else much. You’ve tried something else andgotten a stuck tone arm so let’s let him go on, see? And just completely neglect your attentionline. I you were very skilled, you would be unable to totally neglect it. You would punch itaround a little bit and increase your tone arm motion, see?Pc leaves the session feeling fine—feeling fine, wonderful. Pc always makes gains if they havetone arm motion, see? If they have real tone arm motion, they always make gains. If they don’thave tone arm motion, they don’t make gains."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"Now, I can tell you at the three-quarter point of a session whether or no the pc will haveanything to say decent in the goals and gains. It’s just how much tone arm motion has therebeen during that session. That’s all; it’s; direct monitoring factor, see?So this becomes burningly necessary to produce tone arm motion. At any cost, produce tonearm motion. And now you come into your own about the itsa line, because tone arm motiononly occurs when the itsa line is in, and tone arm motion does not occur with the itsa line out.Now, a lot of you think the itsa line is a communication line. It’s not. That’s a surprise, isn’t it?Just because it’s labeled C-distance-E and because it is a communication line, why don’t wejust call it the preclear’s line to auditor? That would make it a communication line. But wedon’t. We call it the itsa line. Why the itsa? Why? Why?Well, one of the ways to get this across is to give the student a drill. Just imagine a thetan invarious circumstances, you know, like a guy in jail. Alright, now how is his itsa line cut? See,it isn’t just on the graph. That isn’t the only way you can show how the itsa line is cut—in anauditing session. Let’s just take it out in life. And we say, “All right, this guy is in jail. Giveme; number of ways this fellow’s itsa line is cut.” And you may get some awful comm lags onthe part of the student, but he’ll eventually dig it up, see? How’s his itsa line cut?Well, let me give you some notions, then, for definition of the itsa line. Well, he can’t goanyplace else to see if “itsa.” He can’t go anyplace else to itsa. He’s right there in jail, isn’t he?Let’s say he was up in London in jail. All right. Well, he couldn’t go down and itsa the coast,could he? He couldn’t say “Itsa water, and itsa beach, and itsa resort, and itsa Brighton,” couldhe? He can’t get there. How the hell can he itsa it?Well, he can itsa it on a via, if somebody’d give him a map or a book or a novel that’s about thecoast, or something like that. That’s itsa on a via— substitute. Itsa by substitutes. So it’s a kindof an itsa. Well, itsa by facsimiles is an itsa by substitutes, too. So this is not ineffective. Buthis itsa line—direct itsa line—is sure cut.Now, there are other ways his itsa line can be cut by reason of being in jail. I won’t go intothose particularly.We have a fellow sitting at a table. We put a blindfold on him. How is his itsa line cut? Do yousee how his itsa line is cut? He can’t itsa! That’s what an itsa line is.What’s a nightmare? What’s a nightmare? A nightmare is the inability to itsa, followed bymocking up something that can be itsa’d that’s wrong.A thetan likes to be oriented. He orients himself. How does he orient himself? Itsa. “Itsaceiling, itsa floor, itsa wall. Itsa. Therefore, I’m a . . .”You hide somebody. You hide somebody. The itsa line is cut on himself. Nobody else can sayitsa. Nobody can say itsa. Do you see that?Disassociate somebody from his identity. How’s his itsa line cut? He can’t say “Itsa me. Itsame, Joe Jones,” see? Can’t be done. He hasn’t got an identity now.Well, we get into a whole tangled web of aberration and we find out that that’s the basicaberration: inability to orient or declare or identify or recognize. Not just solve, youunderstand. It isn’t cure versus cure versus cure. That’s also itsas, but that’s only part of thepicture. How do you know you’re here? Well, that’s easy. That’s easy. You say, “Itsa chapel,itsa chair, itsa notebook.” Where you are, “Itsa body.” Up here, “Itsa Ron,” see? You knowwhere you are. Your itsa line is in. You’re oriented, so you feel happy about the whole thing,see? Fine. You know where you are."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"It isn’t necessarily how dangerous the environment is. You could be out in the jungle, andyou’d be surprised how happy some hunter looked when he says “Itsa lion!” Hasn’t reallyanything to do with safety, security, and—none of these. These are just extra considerations,see? So you just shred all these extra considerations off and itsa. See? “Itsa jungle, itsa me, itsagun, itsa lion, itsa bearer up a tree. Well, at least I know I was killed by a lion. My itsa line isin on the subject of that death.”Well, look, if this is so important to power, and it is; and if this is so important to sanity, and itis; and if this is so important to memory, and it is; and if this is so important to ability, and itis—then we would expect the major tricks on the track to comprise of cutting itsa lines one wayor the other.So, you’re standing up there loud and clear on the parapet, gripping dramatically the flag of thelilies of France, being shot at in shot and shell, and all of a sudden there’s a snick, and you isdisconnected. Well, you at least know how you died. You got some idea that it was a flyingobject, unfriendly directed. And by God, in the next half an hour or something like that, they’retelling you you died some other way. It’s correct? Spoils your itsa line.And then in the ensuing actions that take place on it, why, they give you a completely falseposition as far as you’re concerned and a false situation and a false here and a false there andthey throw your itsa out on time and they give you a little GPM to carry home with you veryhappily, give you some nice somatics to go along with it. You’re an idiot to ever go back, youknow?I mean, you move right around the corner of the thing, and itsa where? If it’s 70.6 trillion-seven years ago, which is right now, that itsa is certainly for the birds, isn’t it? Youunderstand, they’ve misdated a somatic on you, because they say, “Now we’re going to giveyou your future,” and somehow or another restimulate your facsimiles of the past and saythey’re in the future and . . . What’s happening here? Well, enough happened so thateverybody on the planet believed they lived only once. And that’s how serious the cutting ofitsa line can be. You combine this with plenty of force and you got it made man!I can see it now, the development of a new psychiatry. A new medical psychiatry can bedeveloped out of this. You can get people so mixed up that they’d report back to the medicaldoctor every time. They do. Insane patients are always reporting back for their shocks, and soforth, see? Well-known fact. The report-back mechanism is just used and used and used andused and used by these nuts.By the way, I thought of a difference between a Scientologist and the world at large on thisparticular planet. The people think that what we doing is unreal, but we know the substance oftheir unreality, which of course makes us top dog every time. We know the substance of theirunreality.In other words, we know where their itsa line is out. See, they know what—they’re notidentifying. Their itsas are just for the birds, you know “Man is an animal. He is a biochemicalprotoplasm which goes no place. At death there is a cessation of cellular commotion.” That’s agood itsa, isn’t That just immediately makes nothing out of everybody.Ah, so there’s a formula. There’s a formula involved here. And that your itsa line can be out onARC, and KUCDEI Zero and F. How many ways can an itsa line be? Well, it’s that wholescale I gave you for R2H. Known, unknown, curious, desired, enforced, inhibited, none of itand false—absent and false. This is how many itsa aberrations there can be, see?Well, false, that’s the easiest one of all. You hold up somebody—you “Here, have a piece ofcandy, sonny.” Give him a piece of chalk, see? He bit it. His itsa line is out, man. Got theidea?"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"You say, “There is nothing here, boys. There is nothing haunting our planet; there is nobodyafter you; nothing happens. I mean, you’re just natural and there’s nobody after you, see?”That itsa line is for birds, see? “You’re paranoid! You think people are pursuing you!” Ofcourse nobody is pursuing us—they don’t have to. They got us, man!So they say something isn’t, which is. Well, of course you can get reverse of that. They saysomething is which isn’t, such as the Darwin theory, which is just an old implant.Inhibited. Inhibited: Give a guy a pair of distorting glasses or make look at things in a twistedmirror, like a fun-house mirror. His itsa line is inhibited. Tell him he must not examine such-and-so and so-and-so because it is very dangerous, and of course his itsa line is inhibited atonce.And of course, enforced itsa: “You better damn well know about that or you will be shottomorrow morning without cigarette or blindfold.” Enforced itsa.Desired itsa—see, that’s a “want to know” sort of itsa: Somebody is happy to know that you’reall right. You see? That’s a desirable itsa.And the itsa of curiosity is not just being curious about what is; it’s an itsa which is curiosity.It’s a curiosity itsa, don’t you see?Now, you go up higher than that and you get an unknown itsa. Hey, you know, there is anunknown itsa. I just gave you an example of one. You had complete reality on the unreality ofpeople on this planet. See, the itsa is the unknownness, see? You recognize they don’t know!Well, that is an itsa. it’s pretty high-scale stuff for a thetan to be able to recognize that it isunknown. This thing really boxes him around, because, of course, it mix with the actual desireto make something known which can be known. And amongst that, you get the accumulationsof unknownnesses that are unknown and will always be unknown, will never be anything else,because they’re tailored to be unknown. And if you don’t think that can’t be, look at the wordunknown. See, there’s a perfect example. Yes, there is such a thing as an unknown. There’s aword, there’s the concept that you back it up, u-n-k-n-o-w-n, unknown, and that is asomething which is unknown, isn’t it? I mean, this is getting idiotic.There’s many a religion, man, which is built 100 percent on a beautiful building which housesa nonexistence. And they have created an unknown. That’s what they have created! See, it issomething that can be created. And a thetan’s tolerance, as it rises, eventually gets up to a pointwhere he can actually confront an unknown without doing a thing about it. He can recognizethat it is unknown; it’s a manufactured unknown.Like x, in algebra. There’s another example. Somebody writes x. All right, he can confront thefact that x is unknown. Of course, if he’s nowhere near an algebra teacher he probably won’teven be forced to find out a known for that unknown, either. He probably won’t even do theequation. x + y - z = 0. Of course, you don’t even know what the equation applies to andneither does anybody else. A mathematician is somebody who’s gone overboard on the subjectof unknownnesses and he has to solve all of these unknownnesses.Now, if you don’t think that isn’t prevalent—if you don’t think that isn’t prevalent—there isone of the things that holds up auditors in auditing, is they get so upset about the pc being in anunknown while he’s trying to itsa that they eventually grab hold of the meter and they say,“Oh, well, let’s see. Is it twenty years ago? thirty years ago? It’s thirty years ago. Yeah, well,we know about that now.” They say they’re just helping the pc. It’s just they can’t confrontthat “Well, and so, and so, za-za-za, za-za, [etc.]. I don’t know. I just don’t know. It couldn’thave been so.” And they think, “Oh, my God, if this goes on a minute longer,” you know?And they get the itsa line in for themselves.And then, of course, an itsa line can be too known. Every once in a while some murder-mystery characters... The thing is out because it is known. Every once in a while, some"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"murder-mystery writer has the postman do it, because nobody ever sees a postman. See? It’stoo known. I bet there’s crime after crime on the books down here that remains unsolvablebecause it was committed in too known a fashion. See? It’s a known itsa. Itsa of knownnesses.Every once in a while you’re doing an ARC break on some pc on R2H and can’t quite find outwhat it is, and you eventually will hit “known communication,” you know? Known. Well, ofcourse he knows it. He thought it was something else. Why? Because he knew it. So you gethow slippy that can be, see? That’s this “everybody knows” that is talked about in Dianetics:Evolution of a Science, you see? Everybody knows these things—that’s known itsas—so younever examine them. That’s another way of having a known itsa.But the pc’s attention with his itsas rises up and down this whole new version of the CDEIScale, see?—goes up and down, each one in those various stages. And he picks out this and hepicks out that and he picks out something else, and all he’s doing is saying “It is a . . .” He isidentifying, in other words. He’s identifying something. And when he cannot identifysomething, then he identifies by classification—identification by classification. “This is a typeof . . .”Psychiatry does this all the time. They say, “This is dementia praecox case . . .” They’ve gottenso idiotic with it now that if somebody goes to that Chestnut Lodge, where Graham—thatpublisher of News week and the Post that was so against Scientology—where he went, andwent home on vacation and killed himself. He went home for a day; he was supposed to comeback. Up there at Chestnut Lodge . . . I’ve told you about it before. That’s actually the name ofthe joint; it’s up around . . .And it’s very remarkable. But it’s very remarkable up there. But if a person is transferred toChestnut Lodge, regardless of their symptoms before they now have schizophrenia. And I haveasked this several times, trying to get the answer. And I finally did get the answer andunderstood it was the answer and after that it didn’t plague me. But it’s a very interestingexample of interesting variation of itsa, see? And that is, they are a schizophrenic because theywere transferred to Chestnut Lodge—because that’s all there are Chestnut Lodge!Well now, that’s by classification plus idiocy, see?When you say “It is a cupboard,” you have a pleasant sensation familiarity and knowingness.You seldom stop to think that you have classify something. You know something because youknow of a similar something, so you get your gradients. Your gradients of classificationestablish familiarity in that particular direction.Every once in a while this familiarity gets betrayed or something like that and you get an ARCbreak with it. You say, “It is a cupboard,” and you open it up and find out that it’s a mousehome, or something, see? Somebody’s using it to breed white mice for something, orsomething. Or “It is an automobile,” you get into it and find out it’s a stage prop. A little minorARC break then false itsa, don’t you see?That’s quite common in GPMs. Pc goes halfway through the GPM and of a sudden does theright itsa. “Ha-ha, ha! These are just railroad carriages with a painted backdrop of a train goingoff in the distance. They’re not trains.” See? Identified the character of the itsa.This is all, then, on the subject of identification; it’s all on the subject of familiarity; it’s all onthe subject of finding out; it’s all on the subject making oneself comfortable with what he islooking at; it’s all on the subject of straightening out one’s various grades of ARC with theuniverse. Now, what gives a thetan such a passion for this, this is something else and not thesubject of this lecture, nor, actually, the subject of cases at the present moment. But it opens upa very interesting channel of research. What’s this passion to itsa? See, that’s an interestingquestion."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"But, that you do get tone arm action when you itsa and the case does improve, this is wellestablished. And this is germane to all cases. So getting the itsa line in has nothing to do withgetting the pc’s communication in. It’s “nothing to do,” that’s another action. That’s more aptto be the attention line—to you—or something of this sort. Don’t you see? That’s gettingcommunication in. That’s not the itsa line. No, getting the itsa line is getting the pc to identify,separate, compartment, differentiate, inspect, decide about, things in his bank—or, in anobjective process, in the room.You want to see a tone arm fall, you could probably produce it normally by saying “What’sthat? What’s that? What’s that? What’s that?” and have the pc itsa.You say, “What’s that?” pointing at the fireplace.Pc says, “It’s a fireplace.”Actually, you run it for a very little while . . . This is not a broad, general thing, because thereare other factors involved here. Pc is so introverted that it’s painful for him to extrovert hisattention, and he can only extrovert attention on a broad via. And other special conditions arisehere that does make this a pat process, you understand? It’s a pat process, though, as far as hisbank is concerned, always—not necessarily objectively. But I’m giving the objective versionhere, which is a limited version of it.And you say, “What’s that? What’s that? What’s that? What’s that?”Every time the pc says “ltsa.” Normally, if a pc is not having too bad a time and he isn’t fouledup and you haven’t got him stuck on the track someplace and interested in something else,you’ll see your tone arm fall.You can also see a pc getting very interested. All of a sudden, he—”What is it? Yeah, it’s afireplace, but uh . . . but . . .” And he’ll want to go over and take a closer look at the thing tomake sure it’s a fireplace built out of a certain kind of brick, see? His itsa’s getting sharper.You will see his identification rise.Now, this is so good that a Touch Assist works. Familiarization processes permit people to getdrivers’ licenses who couldn’t, by just touching cars—you know, “Itsa, itsa, itsa car” is allhe’s running, you know? He thought it was a buffalo for a while or something. Well, listen, ifhe couldn’t drive the thing, he must have thought something weird—that I assure you.So itsa, itsa, itsa, itsa—that’s familiarization.You want to teach some girl to type. Well, just have her familiarize herself with the tools of thetrade. Very funny. She can get up to an itsa, itsa, itsa to a point, and her ability will rise, rise,rise along with it, which is very peculiar. But then this has something to do with charge. Thechange of case has to do with the release of charge because of the itsa. There’s two thingshappen: The individual who is really itsaing things is also blowing off encysted charge causedby former confusions about them. And that charge is encysted, and that is a force aspect and amass aspect with regard to this.Here’s the phenomenon, see? Here’s this encysted little thing here, see? And you said, “What’sin there?” see?And he says, “Oh, tsfoo-uh-zoo, and zoo-oo, zoo-oo, zoo-oo.” Tone arm is moving, see?Picking up those fingers one by one off the clasped hands, you see? And “Well, that’s off.Well, that’s off also. I don’t know. Let’s see, see what . . . what it is, what it is . . . Oh!Palms!”You didn’t think anything was in there, did you?"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"That’s just charge. And you see that tone arm start moving; well, that’s charge coming off ofone of these bundles, and the guy is looking and it’s just a method of as-ising.Now, while he’s doing this, what drives some auditors around the bend is he puts in a lot ofadditional itsas. Why, that’s of no great harm, see?He says, “Itsa house. No, itsa car. No, itsa . . .” See? “Itsa fingernail—no, oh, no. No, no.Oh, I know what this is! I . . . I know what this is. I know what this is. A watermelon!” Andthen (as an auditor said to me last night) we get all set and we’ve both got a watermelon andthen all of a sudden he says, “No, it isn’t a watermelon, it’s a diamond ring.”And the auditor starts feeling kind of confused, because, you see, his itsa line is being thrownaround by the pc. But only, only if the auditor doesn’t completely understand what he is doing.He’s trying to find something and then be content with it. Well, that isn’t auditing, man. Anauditor’s superior knowledge should be that if the guy says it’s a watermelon, he for sure isgoing to call it a diamond ring shortly. And if it really is a diamond ring, he’ll never mention itthereafter, because it’s itsa’d.But until it is itsa’d, he’s going to call it all sorts of things. It’s going to be at a billion years,and it’s going to be 5 years into the future, and it’s going to be back trillions-five years, and it’sgoing to be 465 years ago, and it’s going to be yesterday, and it’s going to be now, and it’sgoing to be fifteen minutes ago, and it’s going to be trillions-ten ago, and it’s going to be 18trillion years ago, and then all of a sudden it settles down to 125 billion trillion years ago.Period. Bang—that’s it.You don’t hear about it anymore than that, because he got it, see? It’s itsa’d.So, a lot of apparent itsas come off in the process of obtaining an itsa. And you almost couldsay that all the running of a case, from the first moment of processing on through to the finalcognition of the case, consists of conditional itsas. Conditional itsas. That’s the way it is forthat circumstance and that certain place, you see? An auditor should never have any thought thathe’s going to get nothing but permanent itsas. Naturally, you go through a GPM, you take offthe items according to a plot—well, that’s the itsa of it!Reason I don’t have any trouble running a GPM is I have no doubt about the itsa of a GPM,see? Thats it. It just is what it is. There was nothing there to understand. It was put there tolouse you up and immobilize you and cut down your power and ability, you see, and it’s abunch of electronic circuits which go into a couple of boxes, and they have a couple of thingsthat fire both sides of the thing, and they start you in the top, turn you upside down at thebottom, and that’s all there is to it. And you go through and you see “Pow, pow, pow, pow,pow, pow, pow, pow,” and that’s the end of the GPM. It’s false itsa, see? Actually, in mostcases, not even much of a protest. You know he’s not saying “It should be some other way.”Once in a while a spotted intent with a false idea of the intention will hang it up for a moment.But that’s itsa, see?You don’t have the immediate and direct itsa of “How come I got into a situation where Istarted getting these things in the first place?” you see? Well that’s one of these big itsas, see?This finally starts dawning on the pc. “What the hell was I doing delivering myself up to acomedy like this,” you see, “every few trillion years?” you know? “What’s the matter with me?What’d I do? What happened to me? Well, what’s wrong with me ‘ead? How come?”And you’ll find most pcs will start chewing on this after a while, and they chew on it and chewon it and chew on it and chew on it and chew and—they sometimes chew on it for two, three,four, five, six, seven, eight hundred hours, see? “How come?” There’s no reason to blow yourbrains about it or stretch your medulla oblongata all out of shape. It all of a sudden will rise upin your midst and there it will be: the itsa of “It is . . .” See? “a that’s why!” you see?"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Now, the adroitness with which an auditor can use a little attention to put the pc’s attention intoareas that can be explored, that are easy enough for the pc to see into, that will produce tonearm action . . . is a very skilled auditor. And that is what is known as getting in the itsa line.Getting in the line does not consist of sitting back and letting the pc talk for hours at nothing.You understand, we do not frown on that if you can’t do anything about it. You understand?But there is a much more adroit level by which you put attention on things that can be identifiedby him, and which will there unsnarl the thing called a problem or the bank or that aberratedarea.And it’s the degree that you can obtain tone arm action—that you can get that—that marks theskill of the auditor. That is the most skilled center zone of auditing. It’s almost so skilled that Ihesitate to mention it again because I’ve had loses along this line.Now, if you can do that, there is its anatomy. If you can do that, would be known as thisfantastic thing called “the touch,” “intuition” these other things would mount up back of this.It’s quite awesome. So get in the itsa line isn’t just sitting there. It’s actually doing somethingelse.Now, letting the itsa line exist is descriptive of the lowest level of auditing on this, you see—just letting the itsa line exist. We’ll get somewhere, see? We get somewhere if we just do that.But don’t go speaking carelessly of getting itsa line in unless you’re doing just that. You’retaking the pc-to-auditor communication line, and you are putting it right into zones and areaswhere he will find itsas. You’re putting the pc’s attention in there to where that line be “itsa a. .. .” and a “itsa a. . .” and “Rur-rurrumda-ummrnmm. Well, a . . .” you see and “rrrrr ra-ra-ra-rm, and so on, and so on, and so on. Well . . . I guess—l guess it was my complacence incollege. That’s what got . . . Yes, that’s right.. That’s what really got me in trouble. I wascomplacent about everything. I was—that’s it!” Bang! You will all Of a sudden see your tonearm go right on down, see? You see the charge come off of the case in the bucket loads.This is actually so skilled that it’s the production of cognitions. You can produce cognitions ifyou want to. You can be that skilled. This is something that takes some familiarization withyourself. You should know what the tools are: The tools is [are] the line 1 minor, and that isused to produce a searching attention on the part of the pc; your whatsit line is left there more orless alone, to produce this kind of phenomena. Why? Because the universe is full of whatsitlines. The pc is suffering from too much whatsit and too little itsa. And the net result of this isof course to jam his itsa line. And you, the auditor, by letting it flow, pull him out of the soup.Of course, the direction of significances as powerful as a GPM, as powerful as a super-duperengram, as powerful as this sort of thing on the way backtrack, God ‘elp us, and so forth—man, that’s putting in the itsa line on a significance with magnitude. And that thing actuallyrequires considerable skill. You’ve got to have line plots and the idea of cross listing, and thedoingness of the auditor is considerable. The skill is considerable, his drills are considerable,and so forth. Nevertheless, even those fail if you don’t let the itsa line exist. You got to leavethat itsa line alone and let it roll.Now, it also consists of not cutting it, and there are numerous ways the itsa line can be cut inauditing. It’s a good drill to get somebody to come around and show you that August 4 plot.Have him find the number of ways you can cut that pc’s itsa line. Then make him pass the drill:How many ways could you aberrate somebody by cutting the itsa line? And then he has to findout what the itsa line is. That’s an awfully good drill, and that drives it home with a thud.All right?Audience: Mm-hm.I hope you get a good grip on this one, because it’s a slippy one. And of course it’s—troublewith it is, it’s so known, see? It’s an “everybody knows,” you know? Itsa line—obviously it’sthe pc’s communication line. Even though we went on saying “itsa” and calling it an itsa line—well, why is it called an itsa line, and so forth? And you’ll see this one drift on through"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Scientology and always, forever, in some part of Scientology, this one will be too known.

We could cover an awful lot of stuff here. Be very easy to do.The main things in which you are involved at the present moment probably look far morecomplicated to you than they are.I’m going to talk to you some more about the tone arm and the itsa line, and forms of sessions.Things look to you a lot more involved than they actually are.Sitting somewhere back of every thetan’s bank is some tremendous insecurity in which hebelieves implicitly that the universe is dangerous, or that he himself is in danger or that hecannot live or survive as a powerful being. And whatever that state is, and however that state iscreated originally is not particularly germane to this lecture.But the discovery of the itsa line may look to you to be a highly simple little thing, perhapseven a duplication of psychoanalysis. After all, they talked. And if you didn’t know anythingabout the itsa line, you could draw all sorts of wild conclusions, you see? Make the mistake ofsaying, “Well, it’s a communication line, and therefore any communication line is an itsa line,and therefore if you let anybody talk about anything, why, he will get better.”We already know if you let a fellow talk on an entheta line very long, he’ll run his havingnessout the bottom. So the complexities of the itsa line are really quite something. It sits on atremendous amount of technology, but in itself is very simple to understand. There’s nothingmuch to understanding it. If you understand it you’d see actions like this very readily andimmediately, and these actions would be something like this:Pc said, “I—I don’t know uh . . . whether it was . . . Let’s see, now, it was uh . . . uh . . .twenty, twenty, twenty uh . . . I guess about twenty years ago. And uh . . . the fellow saiduh—I don’t know what he said, but I know what I think about it. I—I—I know that uh . . .I—I know I think it was a big swindle of some kind or another. And uh . . . Come to thinkabout it, I don’t know whether I said that or he said that.”Auditor: “It reads that he said it.”Oh, wait a minute. What happens at this point? What occurred there, exactly? Well, you knowat once what occurred, if you know the itsa line. The auditor put in the itsa with the meter,leaving the pc in a zone and area of insecurity.Now, we say, all right, the line plot. The line plot: that tells the pc what items are in the GPM.See, just like that, see? So obviously we say, well, this to some degree puts in the itsa line forthe pc. Well, no, no. That could be said to, but we get across the proposition of the lesser oftwo evils. If you’ve ever seen a pc wrapped around a telephone pole with undisclosed chargefrom running a GPM he knew not what of, or did not know any of the elements of, you willuse line plots.If the thing is a known line plot, we will use it. Why? Because that was a predesigned plot inthe first place. It was an other-determined design— you understand that somebody else"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"determined the design. What’s important about it is the charge that is on it, and what’simportant in the auditing is to get off the charge and get the pc to identify, to his own reality,that itsa.See, if the line plot you handed him on a sheet of paper didn’t agree with the thing he wasrunning, you will very shortly hear about it. He can get wrapped around a telegraph pole withgreat speed. But that’s a shadow of putting in an itsa line, isn’t it? That’s a shadow of puttingin the itsa line with the pc—but a necessary action.Now, I’ll give you its similar borderline: Pc says, “Oh, it’s twenty years ago, it was fifteen—no, it’s eighteen . . . eighteen, four . . . twenty, twenty-two . . . It’s twenty-two year . . . Ithink it was twenty-two year . . . No, no. It—it must have been twenty-five—thirty. No, uh . .. twenty-one . . . I—I don’t know. I don’t know. I just don’t know when it was. (sniff)” Hequit, see? He quit cold.What you going to do? Sit there with a pc who has quit cold? Or are you going to say, “Allright, I’ll give you a hand. Was it more than twenty years ago, less than twenty years ago? Wasit twenty years ago? All right, it’s more than twenty years ago. Is it more than twenty-five yearsago? Less than twenty-five years ago? Less than twenty-five years ago. You got some idea of itnow?”“Yeah! It was twenty-three years ago.”Or, “Was it more than twenty-five? Less than twenty-five? It was less than twenty-five.Twenty-three? Twenty-three? I’m getting a read here on twenty-three.”“Yeah. It was twenty-three.”Get that? So you didn’t totally put in the itsa line. See, you could start putting the itsa line inand the pc catches the ball, put it almost totally in and the pc catches it, see, and get right ontothe hour and the minute, and the pc never caught it, but at least you don’t have somethingwrong-dated. And those are the gradients of putting in the itsa line. And the last one—it’s alittle bit of a lose to have to put it all the way in for the pc, see?All right, now, look at the length of time you and other fellows around have been stumblingaround on this planet. There’s a number of thousands of years. And the number of thousandsof years you’ve been in the Marcab Confederacy are quite numerous. They probably run up totwo or three hundred thousand years that you’ve been inside this system. And let me call toyour attention, never during that time could you put your foot on the first step of the roadwhich led back to a better life and some happiness and freedom, see? You couldn’t get a footon that road at all.All right. Right now you have technology. You have a map. The map has got all kinds of blankspots in it, but nevertheless, there’s the type of map it is, don’t you see? And those arepersuasions toward an itsa line. And the only time you totally lose—the only time you totallylose—is when you have to put the whole itsa line in.Give somebody the pattern for a goal: All right, he has to list for the actual goal in that sequenceand find it. And he has to list for and get the top oppterm, to make it, in order to fit the pattern,and then he’s got to fit the pattern together. And this is an awful lot of itsa. See?Well, all right, so you’ve got the preprinted pattern. Give him this, and he just reads it off. Youunderstand? This is less desirable, but it’s still feasible.All right, now let’s put it totally in. Let’s put it totally in. Let’s just hit him with a lightning boltso that he can’t contact any of the facsimiles in it, and we have medical psychiatry. See, the evilinvolved in this is putting in an itsa line in such a way as to have no self-determinism, nopower of choice left in the pc at all. Total wipeout of power of choice, don’t you see?"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Now, you can fall short of that in various degrees. Little kid is going around, see? He’s realunhappy about the whole thing, he’s real unhappy about life and he’s walking around in circlesand so forth. And you say to him, “That is your bed.” Well, you haven’t really done very muchfor him, but you have improved his state of mind or his peace, see? Just to that degree. Youunderstand? You say, “That is your bed.”Nevertheless, you have put in the itsa line. He himself has not found out that it is his bed, yousee? But look, he’s still very happy to have the bed.Now, when we get down into pure, unadulterated evil, we get a denial of the itsa line and wego into aberration, creation of. See, this whole thing inverts, and we get KUCDEI Zero F—that whole scale of means of perverting the itsa line.Now, those means, well, include an inability to ever find anything, an inability to reachanything, and so forth. Well now, medical psychiatry (to amend what I was saying a momentago) is of the inclination that it is better, you see, for nobody to have anything to do withanything, see? See that? Now, look at that as an inversion. That’s an inversion of the fact.Now, the aberration of this line—perversion of this itsa line—has to be very direct in order tobe very aberrative. You have to pervert the line, you see—just outrightly put in somethingfalse, or put nothing there, you see, and so on, or inhibit very directly, and you have to work atit. It has to be worked at and so on. Given the slightest chance, why, the pc will start putting inhis itsa line. But what does he put his itsa line in on?All right, let’s take Freudian analysis: He puts in his itsa line on childhood sexual incidents.They’re not aberrative! Anybody get anyplace? Old Papa Freud did contribute something. Hesaid there was a possibility. Great, let’s applaud him for that.But he was putting the itsa line in in directions that didn’t wind up with anything, and then afterhe got through he put the line in, totally; the practitioner put the line in. See, he said, “Thereason why you are aberrated now is we have finally found out that you had a fetish going.You had a fetishism. And actually, your little brother’s right shoe has aberrated your wholeexistence, and that is why you are always talking about the feet on chairs, you see? And nowwe’ve got this all explained, and you are better.”Now, that’s all very fine, but he didn’t look at the hypnotic character of the statement “You arebetter.” That’s putting in the itsa line.All right. We got some guy walking around in circles out here. (Let’s take a look at thesevarious gradients of putting in the itsa line for somebody; you’ll gradually see what I’m talkingabout and what I’m driving at here.) Got some guy walking around in circles and, man, hedoesn’t know which way to turn. He’s got lumbosis and he’s been aberrated by hearing of apsychiatrist when he was young and he’s got all kinds of things, you see. He’s having a hardtime—having a hard time. And you say something can be done about it.Well, you’ve put in some variety of itsa line, haven’t you? And that’s what you call a hopefactor. And this guy very often responds to this, and he feels much happier about this, don’tyou see? You see that—that the hope factor, then, is to that slight degree putting in the itsa line,see? It’s not really much an itsa line. But you’re saying, “It is not—it is not hopeless!” See?You’re so of putting in a negative line for him a little bit there, and you carry him along.You see, as we look at this problem, we’ll see that there are various degrees of putting in theitsa line for somebody. See, there are various degrees of this and these things vary from thevery, very evil—which is to say, hand a guy pomegranate and say, “That’s a bomb.” See,that’s putting in a false itsa line They vary from that up to, well, making it impossible for himto put it in (That’s a lower grade, making it impossible for the person to put in an itsa line.)Varies up to the little necessary actions necessary to begin the flow of the itsa line."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"See, and these little necessary actions are such as “Start of session.” And the basic intent iswhat makes the difference. That’s the first fundament difference, although this, too, can go toofar.But the basic intent is what makes the most fundamental difference. Do you intend to improvethis person’s itsaing ability, or do you intend to knock it into a cocked ‘at? Which? So it beginsright there with the intention. And that gives you the difference between the cowboys in thewhite hats and the cowboys in the black hats, see? And it’s right there, man, bang!Intention: decrease this person’s ability to itsa—cowboys in the black hats. Intention: by someor any means, to improve this person’s ability itsa—cowboys in the white hats. That’s goodand evil, defined in terms the itsa line. That’s the difference between freedom and slavery,that’s the difference between making freemen and making slaves. You make slaves by theintention to decrease the ability to put in the itsa line. That’s how you make a slave. And thatgives you the whole textbook of how to make slaves right there, complete with gold letters anda chain-pattern cover.And the other way is to improve the person’s ability to itsa. In other words, to identify, to spot,to find out. And there we have that point from which we can separate the Scientologist from themedicos, we can separate the decent civilizations from the lousy ones; we can go right onthrough there.This quarter of the universe, by the way, is suffering from an overdose lousy civilization. See,that’s what it’s suffering from. It apparently has been recently conquered in recent times (in thelast few hundred thousand years but those who were conquered had already been—theirgovernmental action had already been—set up for their own failure, see? They’d been set up beconquered by using, themselves, mental technology which made slaves. They implanted theirown troops. Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, ah-ah-ah-ah-a ah-ah-ah.“We’re going to plant somebody up to be a loyal soldier, to fight bravely, never give up hisbody so long as it is alive, to be true to the empire.”We’re going to plant somebody, are we? Remember, every one of those items we put in, tostick, has to have a negative item! And that doesn’t just cut it down 50 percent, that puts it inthe betrayal line. It cuts it down enormous because some empire that would do this tosomebody gets their support lines giving them the itch, see? “Yeah, we’ll help the general out,”you know? He him into the car so that he goes through the other side and falls out the oppositedoor, you know? It’s an accident, you know? When the planes take off half their motors don’trun, you know? They’re just running up against total sabotage, because they’ve already got aslave empire.And you may be able to force a group by slavery and so forth into semblance of a civilization,but it’s only ever a semblance; there’s never anything to which anybody freely, wholeheartedlycontributes. It has no strength, it has no power because remember, 50 percent of the implant“Don’t be a good soldier.” And then the fact that the implant occurred at all, of course, isenough to knock one’s loyalty in a cocked hat.Let’s take an earlier and probably still extant organization, the Galactic Confederacy: eightytrillion years, smooth as glass. No implanting. Interesting? I don’t know the exact length of theEspinol Confederacy, but it’s probably something on the order of a few hundred thousandyears. Implants—no empire.The figures read themselves. Rome died at the hands of her slaves. That’s for sure. She wasnever conquered by the barbarians. I know it looked very nice in the history books, but thetruth of the matter is, who wanted to fight for Rome? You get through with a war, you comehome, you find out the slave civilization has already taken over the farms. There’s no need foryour production; there’s no need for a freeman; there was no pay to be a freeman. That was thereward and the pat on the back for having fought through the wars, you see?"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"And it started going into a civil-war situation. And half of the Roman Empire was alwaysfighting half of the Roman Empire. I don’t remember the exact name of the battle; it doesn’toccur to me. I read it in Gibbon (and it’s probably wrong in Gibbon) and got cluttered up onit—it’s either Messana or something like that.But the reason the first barbarians got to Rome was because—she didn’t have very largenumbers in her armies, but forty thousand of her first-line troops lay dead at Messana in a civilwar caused by unrest caused by slavery. And they had no first-line troops. That was practicallythe entire call-up of the empire. And historians today trace back to that battle as the reason thebarbarian was able to conquer the thing.Well, you trace back the battle, and you find the battle came because of civil scar. And we findout why the civil war came and it came by slavery.The American Civil War, that destroyed one of the better agricultural areas of America, and soforth, was again a battle about slavery, one way or the other. Every time you have slavery, youhave trouble, see? You don’t even have to be sentimental about it. You don’t have to besentimental. You can be terribly statistical. You don’t have to say it’s good or it’s bad oranything else. You don’t have to beat the drum for it, or be a person who wants to reformthings or something like that. Just look at the statistics. Slavery never pays off. That’s it.That’s that. It’s dangerous. If anything is dangerous, it’s slavery.You don’t suppose America would be having very much trouble right now with its race riotsand 250 thousand Negroes about to converge on Washington, and so forth, if they hadn’tkicked off this slavery. And it’s very funny, but the most involved people in American slaverywere the Bostonians. Used to have what they called the “triangle trade.” They’d send shipsloaded with rum down to Africa, use the rum to buy blacks (as they referred to them), use thewhip and Christianity on them to bring them back over, and they traded in the blacks downaround the West Indies, and so forth, for sugar cane, and they brought the sugar cane up toBoston and they made rum, and they shipped the rum to Africa, and they just had that workedout. And practically the first families of Boston are founded directly on slavery.Kennedy missed that. He wasn’t there at that—family wasn’t in America at that particular time.His family got out from underneath another type of slavery: the landowner, the absenteelandlord, the high rates—this type of economic slavery, and 80 forth. And these things go backto roots. In other words, we have catastrophes in all directions. We have the catastrophe ofBoston, the catastrophe of Kennedy.We’ve got a situation here whereby you trace world trouble, and you trace it straight back toslavery. I’m not trying to beat the drum for anything. Why do you think Russia can’t get itsfeet under itself, and why is everybody having such a hard time with the Russians, and whyare the Russians so silly as to evolve a slave economy such as communism, and so forth?What’s all this fuss?Well, this fuss goes back to the idea in early Russian history that a man belonged to the land,and when you sold the land you sold the man with it.Well, the European civilisation got out from underneath that, two or three centuries before, andRussia has not yet got out from underneath that. She still carrying the burden of her pastchains. And therefore she can’t think straight. She’s like trying to get a pc to think in the middleof a session, you know? Can’t do it. That’s a little more touching picture than they actually arepainting.Actually, what I think is, is the White Russian prince and that sort fellow, you see, he wentback to the between-lives area and he came back and he picked up a body and became acommissar. I don’t think they’ve yet changed their faces very much."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"But the trouble with world affairs today is slavery. The greatest empire earth ever had wentdown in the dust with slavery. The British Empire right now is having a rough time and isstaggering around because of its effort to colonize, and to do this and to do that and dosomething about this, and to free man and not to free man, and somehow or another to holdhim in economic duress—don’t you see?—and not let him free but then to let him free, andYou know?You got all this trouble down here in Africa running around in one way or the other. Well,that’s the sort of trouble you get when you suddenly start taking the lid off something that hashad the lid nailed down on for a very long time, you see? And without anybody around whoreally knows much about why, we get those boys going back into slavery too. First action of anew African ruler is ordinarily to throw the whole opposition in jail because they areinsufficiently enslaved by his regime, you see? This viewpoint. This viewpoint.Now, I’m not discoursing on this just because I have a bee in my bonnet about it, because Ifrankly couldn’t care less, as far as this planet is concerned it’ll never get out of any messunless we get it out of that mess, and I’m using the situation just to show you the liabilities ofslavery. You always get lash-back - always. Because a thetan never gives up! That’s it. Hereally never gives up. He’s lying there. He might look awful quiet, he might look terribly dead,he might look like he doesn’t interfere with anything, you see? But in actual fact, he reallynever gives up!He’s got some trick: You can put him in jail, immobilize him, wrap all up in adhesive tape andelectric cord, and so forth, and he gets even with you: he sits there and thinks how he’s right.He even goes down to that postulate see? He can hold that postulate clear on down through thelowest level of unconsciousness—that he was right. Well, I think that’s very interesting.Because if he ever gets out of it, he’ll go on being right, see? If he ever get of it, he’ll go onbeing right about what he was being right about before he was put in that state.In other words, the effort to dominate, the effort to dominate and power of choice is the roadthat this universe walked toward the hell it became. Fear—the unlovely specter of fear—standsahead of all of those.Let’s trace this out very carefully: To survive. All right, very good. guy wants to survive.Whatever put him in the state of mind that he has to survive? Because this is your biggest pieceof nonsense. A thetan can’t possibly do anything but survive. In fact, it’s probably the troublewith him. That’s certainly the trouble governments and things have with him. That trouble theMarcabians are having with him right now. How to kill a thetan is the biggest problem in thisuniverse. See, it’s just not solvable. They thought they had it all solved and we came along.See, they just never really are going to whip this problem. How do you kill a thetan? Well, it’snot an elegant problem to whip.Now, how can a being—who actually can’t be struck at, who cannot do anything but surviveand cannot die, who can pass through various lapses of memory and that sort of thing—howcan this being get into a state of mind whereby he’s concerned about survival? Well, it takesquite a lot of trickery to do that. Usually it’s on the extension of self into a possession, likemaking a minion. You mock a mock-up up and then you endow it with some life, you see?And then somebody comes along and starts to kick its head off, so you protect it and youidentify yourself with it. Or you construct a civilization and identify with it, and you’re tryingto get the civilization to survive, so that eventually you get worried about your own survival.You see the mistake which has to be made there? That mistake actually has to be made directlybefore a thetan gets worried about his own survival.In other words, he has to extend some type of line onto something that he feels can’t survive,and then identify himself with it to such an extent that he feels his own survival can be affected.And this is your first step into aberration."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"All right. Your next step forward from this is an elementary step: Because one is now worriedabout survival, one resolves the problem of survival by domination. This is not any kind of asolution at all. It’s a lousy solution, but it gets used and is probably—that which is not admiredtends to persist. That very definitely applies in this particular line, because domination isprobably the least admired thing in this universe, and yet, oddly enough, is continuouslysuccessful. But it’s really not successful.So, domination comes in here. And we have thetan A and thetan B. and the way that thetan B iskept from destroying thetan A’s construction or civilization, don’t you see, is by thetan Adominating thetan B. you see? That is the formula by which this is arrived at. So thetan A, toprotect something he wants to have survive, therefore seeks to dominate thetan B. And thenbeing in a frame of mind where he feels he himself cannot survive, then he just obsessivelygoes on and dominates thetans B. C, D, E, F and G. see?But he overlooks the fact that if he dominates thetans B. D, E, F and G. sooner or later, thetansB. D, E, F and G in their turn are going to dominate. Do you see? Because we’ve set up acause-effect line, and the best thing you know about a cause-effect line—we may not knowmuch about overt-motivator sequences; we know all about the cause-effect line from which theovert motivator sequence comes. And the best thing about those things is that communicationcontains cause, distance, effect, with intention and duplication. And because of the duplicationof the intention, then any communication line will reverse. That’s the easiest thing acommunication line does is reverse, because of course it has duplication on both ends. It’s veryeasy for cause to become effect and effect to become cause, because there’s a duplication in thecommunication line. All you have to do is make a slight mistake of which is cause and which iseffect, and you have the waiters, which at one time through the last century served people, inblack tuxedos—you know, the guests all wore black tuxedos, and so forth—you have thewaiters now wearing black tuxedos, you see?And you look at any custom as it comes along in this universe, you are actually studying thecause-distance-effect-duplication aspect of a communication line. It’s going to reverse. Well,there’s lots of ramifications whereby we protest and we do this and we do that. But this fact ofany custom you see on this planet at this time—you could absolutely count on its having beenthe reverse custom at an earlier date.Now, this makes an awfully broad statement, but if you look into it, you’ll see that’s the case.You take the clothes today of women, and the clothes today of men, see? Well, you don’t haveto look back very far to where you see that one flipped, you see? And you look into almost anycustom you can follow it down and you will find out it slipped. It went the other way to.So the formula of communication, and communication itself, then, is most important factor inlooking for aberration. It’s very elementary why; cause, distance, effect with intention,duplication. The duplication fact then, makes the C very easily look like the E, and the E looklike the C. So of course the line can reverse around the other way to. And we get all sortsuperstitions about overt-motivator sequences, and we get all kinds of things. Of course, that’sfactual, but it’s simply based upon the nature of a communication line.We beat somebody’s head in and we beat somebody’s head in and we somebody’s head in andwe beat somebody’s head in. Of course, at cause have the intention to beat somebody’s headin, and at effect we have somebody’s head being beaten in. That’s pretty elementary. And thenone fine we wake up with a headache. Where did the headache come from? Well, it slipped.One slipped. One made a misidentification of the C and the E or line, see? It was quiteaccidental. You’re reading a book by Montaigne or something, and it said, “And thy servant,he is a man too,” see, something this, you know? Guy just, you know, just blah . . .(I don’t even know if Montaigne said that. But you have to add the erudite points when youdon’t have your quotation dictionary handy. Besides I usually find out I can make up betterquotations than they said anyhow; figure out their works were culled. I used to work on thebasis that if you write enough words, you’d say something clever, and that saying things cleveris usually solved in the field of philosophy by writing enough words. See, just by the law of"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"averages you would eventually be clever. Anyway. . . Fifty thousand monkeys writing for fiftythousand years apparently by accident would write all the books of the world, and I think theydid!)Anyway, you see what happens here now? Do you see? There’s a switch on these lines, andyou get what looks like an overt-motivator sequence. So almost any pc you audit at the level ofHomosapiens, and so on, has got so switched so that you can absolutely count on O/Wworking. But as I’ve told you, it’s not a high-level concept. See, it’s limited. It only goes up sobecause it depends upon this error of identification, you see?But you can always get a case result by saying, “What have you done “What have you done?”because you’ve freed up now some vicious communication line. And it’s certain that he made amisidentification from that point up, see, and so therefore we can free some somatics orsomething like that can practically count on the fact that if some guy has got a sore neck, so wejust find out what sore necks he has caused, we will eventually tear a off couple of facsimilesof some kind or another, which will straighten it out he’ll cease to have a sore neck. Because heobviously had given somebody a sore neck, you see, if he has a sore neck. I mean, it’s thatelementary.But what is this really based on? It’s based on the misidentification of a communication linebecause of the duplication factor in communication. You can’t communicate without someduplication. That duplication, of course sneaks up. You can’t communicate at all withoutduplication.Well, all right, if communication is so dangerous, why is any thetan communicating at all?Well, he communicates because he wants to be oriented. And we’re back to why hecommunicates. He wants to be oriented. Of course I don’t—then, of course, he takes his besttool, getting oriented, and proceeds to aberrate it by using it to dominate, to do people in, andto make things that he tries to identify with, see? He messes up his own communication line. Inother words, he misuses his communication line.Now, the communication line is there because he’s lost and feels the need of orientation. Hencehis desire for communication. There’s an insecurity back on along the line which causes him touse this communication line. As I say, we haven’t got the full answer as to why that is. I’m justshowing you what this comes from. And that gives us, directly, the itsa line. So don’t regardthe itsa line as a low-level concept, it’s actually Scientology V. It’s not Scientology 1, but it’sused in Scientology 1, and I’m sure will be used well for a long period of time, will also beused very blindly in many quarters.But let’s appreciate What we’re using. We’re rising the obsession to identify, which lies backof the communication line. But we’re using a principle higher than communication, coupledwith communication, in order to orient and rehabilitate a thetan. You’ve made a full statementof processing at that moment, see, except for this one little fact: Is there anything else earlierthat gave this guy an insecurity? The original one, in the absence of communication, issomewhat hard to understand—particularly at our states of case, see? A little bit hard tounderstand. What the devil was it?This guy, you see, isn’t communicating, he doesn’t feel insecure, he is not protecting anything,he hasn’t got any reaching going on, he had no real reason to reach, and so forth. How didanybody get to him?You can figure out a lot of answers to the thing, and they all wind up with a communicationline mixed up in them. And of course the moment a communication line is mixed up in themyou haven’t got the answer.How did he originally feel the need of orientation and familiarization in order to becomfortable? See, how did he do this? How was this done to anybody, and how did he do it toanybody else? And if so, why? So, there is a riddle still sitting there, see? There is a riddle. But"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"we have the walkway back to the answer to that riddle. And what you’re walking, on the lineof OT, is you’re walking to the answer of that riddle. And the funny part of it is, when you putyour foot on that which lies on the other side of all of the energy and all of the confusion and allof the overts and all the misidentification and everything else—which you’re handling rightnow as cases, and auditors, see—right on the other side of that, just as it took one step to geton the road, it only takes one step at the other end of that roadway to suddenly go OT. OT is agradient process for a long period of time with a sudden fantastic upsurge.You’ll get shadows of that upsurge as you’re processing somebody. You haven’t made it yet,but he all of a sudden will do something peculiar. He’ll do something very OTish—and thenext forty-eight hours shake in his boots because, you know, ha-ha. Blu-uh! Guy starts toreach for the telephone and it leaps to his ear, you know? Scares hell out of him.Next session you’ll spend processing it having happened. But that’s processable too. These arejust the lines up.But the realization at the other end, the solution to that riddle and any of its ramifications,determines more or less the state attained. In other words, processing is the cure of having tobe familiarized with things and having to itsa things, and so forth. The end product ofprocessing is no further need to have to do these things. And as soon as one attains that nofurther need to have to do one of these things, one would find he would suddenly snap back toall of the power that he possibly could want. At which moment he probably turns around, andhe’s so mad at everybody because of that time he spent there being right that he rights thevarious wrongs that he was going to right, and he probably will take a dip at that point and thenhe’ll come back up again. And there will be various curves and toboggans along on this roadthat will probably look very dizzy, but that’s okay. So that’s the way it is.Now, we’re undoing—we’re undoing, then—this obsession to itsa by using it. And becausethe dependency on it is so great, you’ll never get a bank taken apart, as far as I’m concerned,until it has been utilized to its full.Now, self-determinism, pan-determinism, personal beingness, personal power, restored to theindividual, is done on the road of minimal help, maximum recovery of self-determinism—ormaximal recovery of self-ability to itsa. See? That’s up. Now, as the case goes along, itsprogress is measured directly and immediately by the degree that this is returned into the pc’shands. Therefore you could get a fantastic number of engrams run—now let me show you howyou can mess this up, see—you’d get a fantastic number of engrams run and a fantastic numberof GPMs run, and the pc would be foggy and wouldn’t be very much alert, and so on.Oh, you haven’t really harmed him. You’ve slowed down the recovery just this one way, byevery time the pc says “Uh . . . let me see, uh . . . there’s a picture here, and I think it’s uh ““Oh, all right, I’ll date it for you. Is it greater than a hundred trillion years ago? Is it less than ahundred trillion years ago? Was it a hundred trillion years ago? It’s less than. All right, is itgreater than eighty trillion years; Less than eighty trillion? It’s less than,” so forth and so forth.“The, is . . .” so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so.And the pc says, “Oh, all right. Hm-hm. Okay.” See? See the nonsense involved in this thing.And it just goes much more subtly, see, much more subtly: “You know I think I must havebeen one of the Brobdingnagians.”Little tiny head shake as one looks at the meter and sees that it did not read onBrobdingnagians, but did read on Lilliputians, see?And then, “Oh, well, I didn’t mean anything. I was helping you out.”"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"You actually have the identical problem that a mother has, auditor. Some mamas solve it andsome don’t. They help little Roscoe to a point where at twenty-one, little Roscoe can’t shovelsoup into his gullet, see? of course there’s an equal extreme the other way. They don’t helplittle Roscoe to a point where little Roscoe, at the age of twenty-one, shoots them! Puts cyanidein his soup!See, all of this is a happy mean, you see? And it isn’t constant one the next. That’s what thetrouble is, because one pc requires more help another pc, because they’re at different levels ofindependence. And you a pc who has a very high level of independence and a very deep levelof aberration, and of course you’ve got trouble! I mean, the guy can’t walk he keeps putting hisfeet in the stew and in the mud and everything else. And you watch this guy caroming off intodoors, and it practically hurts, you know “Oh, I’ll do it, I’ll do it!” and at that moment, why,spills the tureen over his head, you see?Well, that’s all within the margin of an auditor. That’s where his ability to play comes in, ishow much does it take to improve this guy’s independence and self-determinism? How muchdoes it take to improve his ability to know? How much help does he need in order to know?And you’ll find out that varying quantity, see?Here’s this poor guy off the street, he doesn’t know which end the door is you know? Andhe’s helped enormously because you actually show him where the door is. It makes him a bitbetter. You understand, from there on out he can find the door, he can itsa the door from thereon out. See? So you haven’t taken all of his itsas away from him.All right, well, that’s the extreme case. But let’s handle that extreme wrong. Let’s handle thisjust dead wrong: We tell him he never can know where the door is. See? And let’s build him aspecial set of rails so that when he goes toward the door he runs into it. And every time hewalks around it a particular end, why, he’ll collide with the door, see? Well, at this point, ofcourse, you have exceeded the degree of. In other words, you haven’t helped him at all. Youhave deteriorated his ability.And what you want to do is take what ability you have, that you find there, don’t you see, andgradually uncreate any dependence that is created. And the perfect formula is reduce it. See?Give him all the help he needs to get along and then gradually reduce it. That is always safe.Give him whatever help he needs to get along and then reduce it—which makes something like3N into about four or five different routines, which is quite remarkable. And eventually, why,he isn’t even given a line plot. But that’s getting pretty adventurous, don’t you see, because hecan get himself in more trouble without a line plot. It’s almost a dirty trick to turn somebodyloose into a wildcat GPM before he’s run a few that are line-plotted, you know? You can makea pc fly, but then the pc says, “I don’t think . . . I don’t think . . . uh, I don’t think thissequence follows on through this way. Uh . . . I think it uh . . . cuts off someplace here.Something cuts off.”“Well, follow your line plot! Follow your line plot! The line plot. Give me the next item, thenext item. That’s what I want, next item.”“Yeah, but uh ““Next item ! “Well, even if it was there, the pc sooner or later is going to be right enough to convince youthat it isn’t—because you never let him find out.Now, combining all of this nice sense of judgment is the extra bonus of your own flubs,because you cannot reduce them to zero. Don’t ever try. Don’t ever go beating your brains out.Because you get caught in cross-plays of communication where you didn’t quite understandwhat the pc said when you thought you did, don’t you see? And so you said, then, at that"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"time—the pc is saying, “Let’s see, what was that series we found? It was uh . . . Let’s see, Ithink I found early . . . earlier that such a series we found . . .” and so on.Well, you say, “Well, you’ve already found it, you see? It’s been found for several sessions,and it’s 25.4 trillion years ago,” see? And he’s trying to find this date, you see? He’s trying tore-remember what the date is, and you’re just trying to get the series started, see? So you say,“Well, that was—that—oh, you’re talking about the 25.4-trillion-year-ago series.”(sigh) He says, “Yeah. Yeah, I guess so. Uh . . . I don . . . I—I do—uh . . . get . . . uh the . .. No, you see, uh—that isn’t the point. Um . . . (sigh)”And you finally let him stagger through this, because you’ve, see, flicked his attention andslipped him the mickey with the wrong communication line because you didn’t understand.That wasn’t what he was saying at all. He’s trying to find that lock incident that defended onthe series, and his communication being a little bit blurry, why, he’s not really communicatingwhat he thinks he is communicating to you, so you make a mistake on it. And because the pc’scommunication line is so often fogged up in session, for an auditor, then, to do a perfect job ofhandling the communication line is impossible, because it depends upon the pc’s articulationand communication being perfect.Sometime a pc will say something to you like this: “Well, I suppressed my gains for thissession.” And what do you do? Well, is he giving you an itsa? Is he announcing a catastrophe?Is he getting off a suppression? See? Does he want you to do something? What’s the intentionof his communication? Well, maybe he doesn’t even know, either. And almost anything youanswer to this, you’re going to be wrong! See?So don’t go around in fear of being wrong, and don’t teach people to be afraid that they’regoing to mishandle one of these lines, because you’re teaching them to be afraid of somethingthat’s going to be inevitable—inevitable.The pc all of a sudden looks up and he gets a starey-eyed look in his eyes and he says, “Say, Idon’t think that’s true.” You’re running a Helatrobus implant, you see, and “Say, I don’t—Idon’t think that’s true.”And you say, “Well, what?”He says, “That. You know? I just don’t think it is.”Well, what do you do? Is he talking about the Helatrobus implant? Probability not. He’sskipped into something. What’s happened here? What did he collided with? We don’t know.All right, to ask him for more data than got is a fatal auditing error, so we ask him for moredata than he’s got and we are in trouble. We don’t ask him for the data he does have, we are introuble. Don’t you see?Because these are the troubles of handling an indefinite communication line, and troublesalways originate. The communication line at its source, indefinite, so therefore the handling ofit becomes a situation. So that makes you have to get very slippy. And you have to learnvarious things about the intention line—which we’re not particularly discussing today.“Do you want to tell me about it?” Ha-ha-ha-ha—cut your throat. do you put the pc’s attentionon anything? How do you put his attention on a chair? You say “chair,” don’t you? How doyou put his attention on a house? You say “house,” don’t you? How do you put his attentionon a date? You say “date,” don’t you? How do you put the pc’s attention on the auditor’ say“auditor,” don’t you? “Do you want to tell me about it?” Clang! Out of session, ARC break,house falling down, everything going to pieces, gains all wrapped up, everything betrayed—Christ, what happened? Ha-ha!"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"You in vain try to trace back anything you did. Naturally, you blame yourself for it. Well, you,in actual fact, didn’t do anything except inadvertently direct the pc’s attention in a directionwhere it wasn’t going to give him a sudden attention shift, because of your misunderstandingof the thing the pc was talking about in the first place. Do you see the liabilities of this kind ofthing?So, know how to do it right, and do it right most of the time! See? Thats the only thing you canexpect and hope for.All right. This pc itsa line is going to get better to the degree that it’s permitted to exist. Thisdoesn’t mean to the degree that you let the pc itsa necessarily. It means the degree that you keepthe pc’s attention directed by directions where he can find things to identify in his bank. Andwhen he’s found things in his bank to identify, let him identify them.You say, “All right. Now, I want you to take a look at that incident that has the robots in it.Good. All right. That’s fine. All right.”And he says, “Say, uh ““Yes, I know. They’re robots.”Well, I’d just say that was too corny for words, see?All right, you keep up that sort of thing with a pc very long, and tell him what he is looking atalways—see, it isn’t a 100 percent prop there, either. You sometimes tell a pc what he’slooking at, see? You put attention on the track to some incident that you know is there, and hecan know is there, well, you’re certainly giving him something to itsa, aren’t you. So you’vegiven him something to itsa, and he’ll start itsaing it, has a clam, see? But if you prevent hisitsaing it after you have given it to itsa, you will see a gradual deterioration over a period ofintensives - not one session, it’s a long period - of his ability to identify. You’ll see itdeteriorating.You’re creating a dependence on your metering. You can create a dependence on yourrecognition, a dependence on his confirmation as to whether or not he’s right. He says, “Well,I don’t know if it was the cowboys in white hats or the black hats, and cow . . . You look onthe meter,” he will say. “Look on the meter.”One of the ways an auditor gets this started is invalidating a pc’s data. He invalidates the pc’sdata a little bit, and—you know, tends to somewhat, and sounds doubtful, and the pc soundsthis—and finally the pc will say “Look on the meter.” And the auditor cuts his throat and lookson the meter. See? It’s a case of he should say, “Well, I believe you. l don’t have to prove it,”see?“If you don’t believe me, look at the meter.”Proper response is, “Well, I believe you. Go ahead, tell me what it is.” Don’t look on themeter.Eventually you’ll get a habit started whereby every time the pc wants to communicate anythingto you, he convinces you by showing you that it bangs on the needle. And his itsa line will startdeteriorating. See, this can be done in various ways. That’s confirming his itsa line, whichleaves him with no positiveness. It leaves him with no sensitivity as to what’s right and what’swrong.Well, that’s an ability that you are trying to improve. And if you look on it as an ability thatyou’re trying to improve and as the chief ability which is there to be improved in a case, youreally won’t make many mistakes on it. Your mistakes will be cut to a minimum. But if youlook on a case as something from which significances have to be removed in any way that they"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"can be removed, regardless of the self-determinism of the pc and regardless of his ability andregardless of his knowingness and his recognition and so forth, oddly enough, you will stillmake it, but you’ve multiplied your time factor considerably. Time factor is going way up—tento one, something like that— because you’re deteriorating his ability.Now, just auditing the pc in general, you’ll see you will inevitably get an improvement of theability by the removal of charge. Now, if at the same time you’re creating a dependency, to thedegree that you’re increasing . . . You see? You can increase and decrease, and whereby he’sgetting more track and more charge in his vicinity, his actual potential of improvement is beingcut back by his dependency on the itsa of the auditor, see? It improves anyhow. But the auditoris cutting it back, and he’s just costing himself more auditing time, more auditing time, moreauditing time, more auditing time. More difficulty, more ARC breaks, more upsets.There’s many a way, many a way by which all this can be handled in various ways. See, youhave what you call an ARC-breaky-type pc. Well now, this pc probably has a high degree ofindependence and probably has a high degree of itsa ability already, but possibly is a bitswamped with charge, see?All right. Now we take this pc and we deteriorate his ability to itsa, you see, by creating adependency on the auditor. You know, by telling him everything, by telling him everything.You know, “That read. That didn’t read,” and so on. of course, the funny part of it is—there’sone other point of this I should mention in passing—if you don’t tell a pc when an item isfinally discharged, in the early stages of running GPMs, he’ll leave items charged, and themechanics of the bank will cause him to bounce and ARC break. See? So that again is one ofthese factors whereby you’re putting in the itsa line—itsa discharge.Now, but sooner or later the pc is going to start telling you when it is discharged. Well, that’sdamn well when you better stop telling the pc that it’s clean. Do you understand? You justbetter stop telling him at that point.Ah, but you’ve got an interesting problem here. Maybe you’ve stopped telling him at the pointwhere he still can’t tell. Now you’re going to have hell raised, because you’re going to havehim stuck in incidents. You’re going to have RIs live all over the place, you’re going to havehis postulates live and so forth. I think I’d start working on a campaign on him: “Well, run ituntil you’re very sure it’s flat” is the kind of a campaign I’d start running, is “Get that item untilyou’re very sure it’s flat.”“All right,” he says, “that’s flat.”“Okay, say it again. Good. Fine. You’re right, that’s flat,” see?And he all of a sudden, “See, I can tell you.” You know?“All right, good. Good,” see? “Fine.” And wean him. And gradually don’t check, see? Don’tcheck. Say, “All right, I can depend on you.” Because he can tell you, eventually, when it’sflat.He’ll also get very bored with an item and leave it half-unflat. You can sometimes make acitizen out of him by letting him do so. Trouble is, he’s liable to have bounced and gone intosomething else.Now, there’s various problems involved here. I’m not trying to tell you this is simple. Don’tget so involved in the problems, however, that you miss the basic mechanics of the situation.Basic mechanics of the situation: the pc is the one who is living with this bank, and if he can’ttell what’s in it, and so forth, he can’t live with it. Obvious? I mean, that’s one of these ne plusultra things. You’re unfortunately, or fortunately, not going to be at his side for the next twohundred trillion billion squillion years. See, you’re not going to be there telling him whether itis a GPM . . . you see? Going to have to find this out for himself. So sooner or later, you’regoing to have to kick him off with regard to this bank."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"The time to start is when you start auditing him. You start auditing him, why, start weaninghim. Don’t increase his dependency. Decrease it. Give him all the help he needs! But isn’t thata tricky statement? How much help does he need? Well, you know if he doesn’t have line plotsand a design on the track and the concepts of life, and that sort of thing—if he doesn’t havesomething like that—he’ll never put his foot on the road at all. And we know that if he doesn’thave a line plot for a standard GPM that he’s got to run, and so forth, we know he’ll wraphimself around a telegraph pole, man. He’ll practically finish himself off by giving you wrongitems and upside-down items and missing items, and so forth. And the next thing you know,why, the penalty is much worse than the cure, here. See?Well, where do we go? Well, how much help do we give him? Well, we give him all the helphe needs. How much help does he need? Well, that is something you establish individually ineach pc.You’re going to get ahold of some pc sometime or another—you know, he possibly hasn’tbeen down here long, or he got here by accident, or something of the sort. And this pc cogniteson the Axioms, knocks out the bank, does Change of Space Processing between your auditingroom and the next building for a while, goes around and thanks you very much; you’re leftwith your jaw dropped because you haven’t had an opportunity to get your meter on and tested.Well, don’t feel so betrayed that you didn’t get a chance to audit. You audited. So, there arevarious degrees by which you have to approach this problem, and that’s the difference of pcs.Now, these very, very ARC-breaky pcs sometimes get a reputation for being ARC breaky andthey get very upset this way and so on. It’s actually where their concept of their ownindependence is being invidiously cut up by people putting itsas in for them. And the charge onthe bank is too great, so that they get into this stuff and they’ll dramatize at the drop of a hat.And this is upsetting to them. It’s more upsetting to them to dramatize, but how did theydramatize? They dramatized only because somebody put in the itsa line they were not able to.So, what do you do with such a pc? Well, a pc who’s routinely ARC breaky must obviouslyhave something wrong with the itsa line. Well, he wasn’t the result of auditing. It was probablysomething that occurred before auditing, because we are not in the business of aberratingpeople. Well, it must have occurred in some aberrative area.Well, you can do such a thing as give them an eighteen-button Prepcheck on the itsa line.Simple. Now, an eighteen-button Prepcheck is not thrown out by the itsa line because theeighteen buttons are the select choice, very best, grade A, straight-from-the-ocean itsas. Yourealize that a Prepcheck is almost the perfect series of itsas. Most powerful buttons, so they’re[the] most powerful itsas in existence since the beginning of the universe. “Since yourbeginning of travail, has anything been suppressed?” Wonder how long that would run. Butthat’s an itsa, because he must have itsa’d by suppressing. So you’re getting off the crisscross,see? If he suppressed it, then he can itsa it. If you get the suppression off, then he can itsa.These are almost perfect itsa lines. The Prepcheck actually comes into its own. But veryinteresting about a Prepcheck: You can prepcheck the itsa line, see, on that. That takes the cake,man.Now, you take one of these very ARC-breaky pcs that has a very great reputation for beingARC breaky, and you put the itsa line into some comprehensible thing. Very often, if you justexplain to them what the itsa line is and prepcheck it, you’ll be better off than trying to redefinesomething, because you won’t then be prepchecking the itsa line. But this takes some doing.An auditor has always got to be able to interpret the auditing command and clarify the auditingcommand so that the pc knows what it is. One of the best ways to clarify an auditing commandlike “Recall an ARC break” is explain an ARC break and give it to him, because you use anyother word, you’ll run into some GPM—almost certain to run into GPMs. “ARC break” iscontained in no GPM and therefore is a totally nonbackground word. See? Give him a newword, new symbol."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"All right, so you say “itsa line”: “Well, your—your recognition of things. Your considerationof things. What you think life is all about. Your opinions. Somebody says, ‘What’s a cat?’ andyou say, ‘It’s a four-legged animal.’ I mean, your right to do that.” You know, go on, go on,explain it any way you want. Prepcheck the itsa line. Or get some other designation for it. Butprepcheck it.And you’ll be very fascinated that the pc who is the ARC-breaky pc is not really ARC breakingbecause of auditing and bypassed charge. This pc’s itsa line is cut right here and now as hismost colossal PTP—by something else, nothing to do with auditing.I’ll give you a marvelous example of how somebody’s itsa line is cut right here and now: He’son this planet, isn’t he? If he tries to get off, he hits the between-lives area. His itsa line is cutbecause he can’t itsa anything else in the universe. He can look at the stars, but he can’t tellwhat condition they’re in. See, he’s the prisoner on the island who looks toward the mainlandlongingly, so his itsa line is cut.See, there’s all kinds of ways of cutting the itsa line, don’t you see? No reason to dream themall up for the pc. Put in a Prepcheck on his itsa line. You’ll be astonished. He’ll make somecase progress—sudden case progress, and cease to be ARC breaky.Other ways of attacking this same problem sometimes give us the very, very fascinating andinteresting aspect of somebody who has found that the ARC break is a solution to someproblem. So he solves the problem by ARC breaking. There’s various ramifications, but henormally runs into this when you prepcheck the itsa line. You have a big piece ofunderstanding here. It’s a big, new, whole piece of understanding. It’s a new piece of thejigsaw puzzle which has fitted into place and made citizens out of most of the center pieces andhas shown us that there’s just this little few out here on the edge, of how come a guy had toidentify and familiarize himself in order to feel alive and secure? How come a guy got into anobsessed necessity to itsa? That little piece is about the only piece missing right now, and it’sup here in the corner.

What’s the date?Audience: 6th of February.February what?Audience: 6.6—6th of February. What year?Audience: A.D. 14.Thank you. Thank you. February 6, A.D. 14, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. I’m going totalk to you about a very arduous subject. The subject is the communication cycle, and I thinkyou might like to know something about the communication cycle as used in auditing. It’s anew subject—new to many.If you look over communication, you’ll find out that the magic of communication is about theonly thing that makes auditing work. And if you could sit down to a meter—a one-handelectrode—all by yourself and run some process on yourself, it’d make a citizen out of you.And the reason it’d make a citizen out of you, is you would see a little bit of tone arm action atfirst, or if you tripped across something like an active, loud, large GPM, why, you might getyourself a quarter or a half a tone arm division, or a couple of needle flashes. Now, you canalways get a needle flash. You can always get something of that sort.Now, the amount of tone arm action you would get doing this would make you blink, becauseit’s none. And you could run some hot process on you that had been run by some auditor andwhich gave him good TA—this process that has been run, give you good TA, you see, whenthe auditor was auditing it—then you sit down there with a one-hand electrode while theprocess is still hot and run the commands on yourself, you’re going to get for a moment theresidual of the auditing. That is to say, the auditor will have stirred up enough so that you’ll seea little bit of charge go off, and then your tone arm is going to go dead—and it’s going to staydead.Now, the reason for this has to do with the thetan in this universe. Now, he has begun toconsider himself MEST, and he’s begun to consider himself mass. And the being whoconsiders himself mass, of course, responds to the laws of electronics and the laws of Newton,and is actually incapable of generating very much, you see, or—which is what we’re interestedin—arising very much. There’s not very much going to disappear there in the way of mass.And this is a very discouraging sort of an activity.Now, I have had to explore this particular field of auditing—self-auditing, because mostanybody does it, and so forth—and what was this all about. And I have even gotten ambitiousenough to run an actual GPM, bangity-bangity, bangity-bang, on a one-hand electrode. Thatmakes your hair stand on end. Well, it made my hair stand on end. And my auditor fished meout. It didn’t kill me, I was able to breathe afterwards—that is, if I didn’t move much. But thesame GPM, run with the same items and so forth, would produce upwards to 175 TAdivisions, down. And the GPM, self-audited, produced 2."},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Now, what was this all about? What was this all about? It tells us (now, it isn’t that experiment;other experiments were made in this particular line)— and it tells us that an individual considershimself MESTy, or massy, if you see, and therefore he has to have a second terminal. And asecond terminal is required to discharge the energy.Now, a lot of auditors go further than this, and they go downhill to a point where they thinkthey’re being the second terminal to the degree that they think they pick up the somatics andillnesses of the person they’re auditing. Well, get that.Actually, there is no backflow of any kind hits the auditor. There is no backflow hits theauditor of any kind. But if he is so convinced that he himself is MEST, why, of course, he willturn on somatics and everything else in echo to the pc, because he’s simply doing a matchedterminal with the pc, don’t you see? Actually, nothing hits the auditor. It has to be mocked upor envisioned by him. I think you find that’s quite amusing, because there are whole schools ofhealing, back in the early days of Greece particularly, where they picked up the pain out ofsomebody’s ‘ead, or off somebody’s arm, and they got the somatic very nicely and took itaway and dumped it in the trash bin. Spiritual healing has this in its textbooks, and so forth.Well, that is its genus, is just this two-pole proposition.Now, you don’t have to know anything about electricity or electronics in order to go into thisvery deeply, but it’s obvious to you that for a motor to run or for something to occur, like alight go on, that two poles have to be involved. And energy passing between two terminals, ortwo poles, makes an interchange, and it gives you what you call electric light.Now, of course, that is the burning of energy. In this particular case you don’t have theburning of energy, you have the as-ising of energy where the auditor and the pc is concerned.Now, the ability to hold a position, or the ability to hold two terminals apart, is a definition ofpower. Not how much energy can be thrown by a unit, but the base, the strain that is put on thebase. The ability to hold these two positions. That’s a little bit outside of what we’re talkingabout. But here we have two poles. We have an auditor and a pc, and as long as the auditoraudits and the pc replies, we get an apparent exchange of energy from the pc’s point of view,which doesn’t hit the auditor; but because they thinly of themselves, don’t you see, at this low,subvolitional level, as terminals, why, you get these exchanges of energy going on, you see?And nothing hits the auditor, and it anises as far as the pc is concerned.But you have set up, in essence, a two-pole system, and that will bring about an as-ising ofmass. It isn’t burning the mass, it is as-ising the mass. And that’s why there is nothing hittingthe auditor. Now, that is the essence of the situation, and the magic involved in auditing iscontained in the communication cycle of auditing. You see, now you are handling the smoothinterchange between these two poles. Eventually, the individual will get up to a point where hedoes not consider himself to be matter, and this no longer occurs. When you’ve got half of apc’s actual GPMs run out, you start running into trouble. I’m running into that trouble rightnow.Unless the pc makes up her mind, or recognizes the truth of the situation, I can’t knock anyenergy off. I can ask the question, and the meter is the deadest-looking meter you ever saw inyour life. Yet there’s a red-hot GPM sitting under this sort of thing. See, there’ll be a red-hotitem or a red-hot this or a red-hot that. But I have to ask the pc whether or not that is it. Andwhen the pc looks at it and decides that that is it, or that isn’t it, only then do I get an activemeter.And this is most amazing. This is most amazing. The GPM can be sitting right there ready toread, and unless the pc has looked at it and has thought it over, why, nothing happens on themeter. Yet this same pc, before those—half of the bank was run out, don’t you see; all I had todo was sneeze at the meter and I got rocket reads on anything, and the pc didn’t know anythingabout what was rocket-reading and what wasn’t rocket-reading. You get the advance? Theadvance is upwards toward knowing one is one, see? And you get out of these automatic"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"physical-energy manifestations of the physical universe. And getting out of these things, youthen get to a point where you’ve got intention.Now, what is one of these GPMs, anyway, but a method of limiting the pc’s ability to intend?And that is the whole idea behind implanting or any thing of that nature. The whole idea is thatif he intends positive, he gets negative. If he intends negative, he gets positive. So, therefore,he cannot decide.Now, if you take somebody and every time he says yes you say no, he eventually will get intoan indecisional state of mind. He can no longer intend yes, completely, see? So this is how youcould wear somebody down, break his spirit, or make him a private in the army. Get the idea?Every time he has a thought, you deny it. You see? There’s where you get your original powerof choice. The ideas of power of choice—and all such other ideas. The ideas of self-determinism versus other-determinism. All these other various ideas stem out of this alone. It isthe ability to intend something.Now, somebody cannot write. He intends to write, and he’ll go around talking about writing,but he doesn’t write. Well, what is happening there, he is intending to write, but something isintending that he not write. And that is his mind kicking back at him, which is simply apositive-negative proposition there, of two poles. Do you see this?All right. He intends to talk Arabic, but the mind says that he can’t talk Arabic. See, there’syour positive-negative. He intends not to talk Arabic and finds himself chattering strangephrases, and you get these speakings in foreign tongues that the hysterical religionist very oftenis found to have, and so forth. In other words, you get the positive and the negativeproposition. Well, a person has to be very MESTy indeed before they are subject to theseparticular phenomena. And the more MESTy that they consider themselves, the more enmeshedin matter that they consider themselves, and the more energied up they are, why, the moretrouble they have with this particular action. And, of course, as you go upscale this phenomenadrops away as progress is made in this particular direction.Now, what value is the auditor? Well, the auditor, of course, is at his greatest value at thelowest level of the case, is necessary all the way up through to step six—end of actual GPMs—is necessary all the way. But the auditor at very low levels can produce some of the mostinteresting phenomena. And it was in the Dianetic days that they were able to absolutely breaktheir hearts, because you could say to somebody so-so-so-and-so and so-and-so, and youcould handle engrams, you could handle matters associated with the bank, and the pc wouldlose his or her arthritis, would lose psychosomatic ills of one kind or another, and never findout about it.In other words, the auditor could sit there and as-is bits of the thing, just by the automaticmechanical process of a two-way communication with the pc. But the pc was so snarled up andso sunk in, and considered themselves so much a brick or a piece of rock or a wooden slab,that they would never find out about it. And after the auditor had cured up somebody’slumbosis completely, why, the person would say, “Well, yes, but you haven’t done anythingabout my worries about my wife.” Well, yes, he was incurable, he was bedridden, he had togo around—the most he could look forward to was a wheelchair. And the auditor would fixhim all up and he’s walking around now, and he complains because he hasn’t had his wifestraightened out.In other words, he was actually influenced without his knowledge. Do you understand this,now, Tom a two-pole arrangement? Wherever an individual, wherever an individual, then,thinks of himself as an animal, as matter, as a bit of mud, as algae which has coadulated[coadunated] into the difficulties of manhood, when you get these various things, what do youeventually see? You see a whole scientific world indulging in the philosophy of “man ismatter.” So the spiritual values and natures of man are, of course, lost completely. Onlyauditing can restore these. Nothing else is going to restore them."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"But when you look over the difficulties of auditing, realize that you are handling simply thedifficulties of a communication cycle. And when you, yourself, as the auditor, do not permit asmooth flow between you as a terminal and the pc as a terminal, and the pc as a terminal backto you, you get a no as-ising of matter: So you don’t get tone arm action.Now, part of the trick of course is what has to be as-ised, and how do you go about it? But thatwe call technique. And if you remove technique, if you remove technique from the area—let’snot worry about the particulars, what button has to be pressed or stepped on. We’re not goingto wonder about this—what button. We’re going to wonder only about the communicationcycle. We find, oddly enough, if the auditor is actually capable of making the pc willing to talkto him, he wouldn’t have to hit a button to get tone arm action. Do you see this?Now, the person who is insisting continuously upon a new technique, a new technique, or avery fancy technique, or that sort of thing, is neglecting the basic tool of his auditing, which isthe communication cycle of auditing. He cannot make the pc get tone arm action. Well, he can’tmake the pc get tone arm action, basically, because the communication cycle doesn’t exist. Andwhen the communication cycle does not exist in an auditing session, we get this horriblecompounding of the felony of trying to get a technique, but the technique cannot beadministered to the pc because there’s no communication cycle to administer it.So basic auditing is called basic auditing because it goes prior to the technique. Thecommunication cycle must exist before the technique can exist. And, therefore, any casesupervisor is very, very well advised to merely heal up the various points and portions that aremissing as far as that communication cycle is, and hit it as buttons. And in view of the fact thatthe auditor is trying and the auditor is doing something, to actually neglect whether or not theauditing is good or bad—that’s up to an auditing instructor, isn’t it?—just neglect that. But justlook at the case from the basis of “What parts of this communication cycle are awry?” and“What isn’t here in the form of a response to the auditing question?” And simply heal thosepoints up.Now, if you had a man lying unconscious in the street, you certainly wouldn’t be thinking upwhat technique to run on him. If you wanted to bring him back to life and livingness, what youwould want to do is get h m to talk to you, or breathe, or flutter an eyelid. That would besomething. Oddly enough, the communication cycle all by itself will cause him to flutter thateyelid.You can take an unconscious person who has been in a coma for some time, and by picking uptheir hand and making them touch the pillow, and even touch your arm—you know, picking upthe hand (they have no volition here)—picking up the hand, touching the shoulder, picking upthe hand, touching the pillow (giving them the command at the same time, talking), and soforth, that person will come back to life. This is the greatest magic that anybody ever saw. It’svery startling, but look, you’re just trying to get this man into communication with the auditorand communication with his surroundings. And he’ll come back to battery. And there’s notechnique.So, that should demonstrate to you that the fundamental entrance to the case is not on a level oftechnique, but on a level of the communication cycle. Now, all you have to do is mark out howmany branches of this communication cycle can there be. There can be a communication cyclebetween the pc and the auditor, and the pc and the auditing room. And that’s about it.Now you can get particular, and you can have parts of the auditing room, or you can havespecific portions of the auditor or the auditor’s beingness—you can mark down to that. Andthen you can maybe go afield from this particular zone or area—if the person is already in acommunication cycle with the auditor—you can go afield and start to address his present timeproblems. Now you can address whether or not his wife fixes the tea properly or puts arsenicin the coffee, as he is worried about. Now you can address that sort of thing."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"But this, of course, because it is distant from where you are sitting, requires a technique. Firstyou have to know what he is worried about out there because it is not present and visible foryou to see, or for him to see. So the technique selects out what he is worried about—a littleform of assessment, don’t you see? And now you’re into techniques and processing, havingleft the field of the communication cycle. If the field of the communication cycle with theauditing room and with the auditor is all solid ground, and if all of that is squared away, youcan now worry about technique.Now, the auditor who comes tearing down to you sometime as—when you’re D-of-Pingsomeplace—and the auditor who comes down and says to you, “Ho-ha-hai, I . . . I just can’tget anyplace on Mrs. Hepsibah. Can’t get anyplace on Mrs. Hepsibah,” and you say, “Well,why don’t you run so-and-so and so-and-so,” will inevitably come back (you give him atechnique, you see)—will inevitably come back a half an hour or so later and say, “Thatdoesn’t work either.” And you can keep up this silly cycle for a long, long time. Because ofcourse there is no technique being delivered to the pc because there is no communication cyclepresent.Now, what needs to be repaired is the communication cycle, and when you’ve got acommunication cycle repaired, then you can audit a technique. It’s as elementary as that. Now,there are many parts of this communication cycle that can be addressed, because you have thepc there and you have the auditor there. And, of course, the first part of it that has to beaddressed is the fact that the person is having a session and is in a room and is being faced byan auditor.Now, if you take all those and write down the categories—you write down all the categories,all the different little bits that can be written down that are part of this (it’s best for you as anauditor to imagine them rather than for me to give you a long catalog of them, you see)—andthen figure out how you’re going to get him into communication on each one of these points,realizing that communication is simply a familiarization process based on reach and withdraw.Even when you speak to a pc, even when you speak to a person, you are reaching; when youcease to speak you are withdrawing. When he hears you, he has something withdrawn—and atthat moment he’s a bit withdrawn, don’t you see?—but then he reaches toward you with theanswer. And you’ll see him go into a withdraw while he thinks it all over. See, he gets backand, well, he’s—”Which . . . why did my grandfather have to marry the girl?” See? And hethinks over this, and you’ll see him think this over, and he thinks that cycle through on awithdrawal, don’t you see? And then he will reach back to the auditor.Now, he’s already reached this reason. Now he will reach the auditor with the reason, and hewill say that was it. Now you have made an exchange from the pc to the auditor, and will see itreflect on a meter. Because that exchange, now, is giving an as-ising of energy.In the absence of that communication, you do not get meter action. So the fundamental ofauditing—the fundamental of auditing—is the communication cycle! That’s the fundamental ofauditing! And that is really the great discovery of Dianetics and Scientology. It is such a simplediscovery that—and everybody does it. But you realize that nobody knew anything aboutcommunication when it came along. The number of chaps in communication companies andthat sort of thing, who fall around our neck saying “Really!” you know?You say, “Well, communication, it consists of cause, distance, effect,” you know?“I . . . yeah! By golly, it does, you know!”Well, it’s just this sort of thing. It’s a fundamental that everybody knew was there. They’vebeen watching apples fall off trees for a very long time and Newton had to come along and seean apple fall off a tree, see? And he said, “Hey, apples fall off trees, and when they leave thetree they hit the ground!” See? Everybody says, “Wow!” you know? “Terrific!” you know?And his name has gone singing down through the ages, because he noticed that apples fell offtrees."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"It’s always this sort of a thing. It’s always this sort of a thing which escapes the attention ofpeople. Because MEST is basically very complex stuff. And being very complex (composed asit is out of electrons and molecules and minerals and gee-whizzes of all kinds or another,wavelengths and all this sort of thing), because of its tremendous complexity—so complex thatnobody can understand it, they can only. .. You know? Therefore, people who are veryplowed in, you might say, into matter, and who are themselves thinking as matter, think verycomplexly. And they cannot observe the simplest things with which they are confronted. Andthey observe none of these things.Now, you look over this. I call this to your attention. The ease with which you can handle acommunication cycle depends on your ability to observe what the pc is doing. Now, we haveto add to the simplicity of the communication cycle, the obnosis—the observation of theobvious. If the pc hasn’t been talking to you, and if the pc hasn’t said anything to you for avery long time, it is no time for you to be thinking on the subject of “What do I say to the pc?”You say, “What do I say to the pc?”Please! I invite your attention that your inspection of what you are doing should have endedwith your training, and thereafter is taken up exclusively with the observation of what the pc isdoing or is not doing. And your handling of a communication cycle ought to be so instinctive,and so good, that you are never worried over here about what you do now. “Let’s see, am rdoing it right or am I not doing it right? Let’s see. I wonder how my acknowledgment was thattime. Did I say ‘Okay’ in an artificial frame of voice or should I say it naturally, like ‘O-kay.’No, that wasn’t right.” No. The time for you to get this all fixed up is in training. And in actualauditing, the communication cycle that you watch is the pc’s. That’s the communication cycleyou watch. You know yours is good. So you don’t worry about it anymore.Now, if you know your communication cycle is good, you haven’t any longer got to be upsetabout whether you’re doing it right or not. And you ought to tic well enough trained that whensomebody says “catfish” to you, you look at them and recognize they are no longer saying“catfish” and have finished saying “catfish.” And having finished saying “catfish,” it is time foryou to acknowledge. But you only acknowledge because they have finished thecommunication. And your observation is simply limited to the fact that they have completedtheir communication, and that is your observation. Your observation is the observation of thecommunication cycle of the pc. And you get good enough so that you just lay in mothballs yourworry about your communication cycle when you’re finished training. That’s the time it goesinto mothballs. You understand? You know how to do it now. Your business is thecommunication responses and cycles of the pc. Do you see that?ThisPC: You ask me, “What technique shall we run on this pc?” Technique! What are youdoing with a technique? Let’s look at the pc for a few minutes. “Oh yes, but,” we say, “well,the pc has got to have something to talk about.” Oh, come, come, come! You’ve been inScientology or Dianetics all this time, and you can’t dream up something for him to talk about?It’s as corny as this: “You had any problems lately?” See? Or it’s corny as this: “How are youdoing?” Let’s get this pc to talk so we can see what the score is. Now this is the true—thetrue—touch of genius on a case. This is what makes that auditor who can crack any case, andwhen it’s absent, has an auditor who couldn’t crack an egg if he stepped on it. This is thedifference. This is the difference. It’s whether or not this auditor can observe thecommunication cycle of the pc and repair its various lacksNow, I’m now talking to you—when I talk to you about the auditor’s communication cycle—I’m talking to you about something that’s so simple. It simply consists of asking a question thatthe pc can answer, and then observing that the pc answers it. And when the pc has answered it,observing that the pc has completed the answer to it—that the pc has answered it and hascompleted his answer to it and is through answering it. And then saying “Cheerios”— givinghim the acknowledgment—bang! like that. Say, “All right. You finished that,” and then givinghim something else to do. That’s all. You can ask the same question. Or you can ask anotherquestion. It doesn’t matter. But the communication cycle is simply asking something that the pc"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"can answer. There’s a lot of little trickery involved in this, because that includes clearing theauditing command. See?You don’t say to somebody who’s got a—you got a five-year-old kid. And you say to him,“Have you had any marital troubles lately?” and I don’t think you’re going to get much of ananswer. See, it requires that much good sense: Ask a question that can be answered, and thenask it of the pc so the pc can hear it and knows what he’s being asked, and then the pc answersthe question; and being bright enough to know that the pc is answering that question, not someother question, and then knowing—and this, by the way, is a very interestingly developedinstinct—you can tell when the pc is finished. And if you don’t develop that instinct, you’revery often lost. You’ll say, “Well, did he end, or didn’t he end?” and so on. Well, someauditors try to make it up, making another technique inside a technique, like, “Have youfinished answering that auditing question?” of course this is so much balderdash. You shouldbe able to know. It is a piece of knowingness. See, you just know he’s finished. He looks likehe’s finished, he feels like he’s finished, your telepathy tells you he’s finished, you get theidea? It’s that esoteric.He said, “Well, I . . . I didn’t have a grandfather.” And you now know that he is not going tosay any more. See? It’s part sense. It’s part his vocal intonation. But it’s an instinct that youdevelop. You know he’s finished. So, knowing he’s finished, then you tell him he’s finished.It’s like pointing out the bypassed charge, don’t you see? “You’ve answered it,” you say. “Youanswered it.” Actually, if you said “Okay. Good,” you might as well say “You’ve answered it.You have now found and located the bypassed charge in answer to the question, and there it is,and you have said it.” See? That’s the magic of acknowledgment, don’t you see? But,naturally, you say, “Good,” “Very good,” you know, “All right,” “Okay.”But if you got a long continuing thing, you don’t want to stop him too hard. So the degree ofstop you put on your acknowledgment is also your good sense. Because you can acknowledgea pc so hard—and if your impingement on pcs is way up in the stars—that you finish thesession right there. You just end the session. You waste all that remaining two hours that youhad to go.So he’s talking on a consecutive line of thought and you acknowledge as though you’re notgoing to ask it anymore, ever. And he won’t think of it anymore, ever, either. So frankly,now, when you’ve acknowledged it, you knew he was finished and you said he was finishedby acknowledging it, and then you gave him something else to answer! Now, that—aho-hu-rrrrrr-mmm! Second we got into itsa, we got into trouble, man! Because we dropped out givinghim something else to answer. And an auditor will sit there without giving the pc anything todo. And you’ve got to develop a sensitivity. When did that pc finish answering what youasked? At that point you say “Cheers,” and give him the next question.But when you don’t have that sensitivity, the pc answers it, gets nothing Tom you, you sitthere and look at him; his social machinery goes into response that “We must not be sitting herequietly doing nothing.” Some pcs take up humming, I hear—because the auditor hasn’tacknowledged and given him a new question! The auditor just is not there, that’s all.Now, it’s 811 very well to do that sort of thing in training, and it’s forgivable, but not in anauditing session, really. Now, after all. Pc has finished answering the question, “Cheers!Thank you. Good. All right.” Now you know you’ve acknowledged something. You finishedoff that cycle, so you better ask him, “Do fish swim?” man! “Are there any other problemsyou’ve been worried about?” See, he’s finished that one. “Anything else upset you betweensessions?” See? But be in there, man! Don’t stand there tangle-footed saying “What do I donow? Oh!” Because at this point the pc is going to overrun. He’s going to start making asession out of it, he’s going to go onto auto. And what did I just tell you about self-auditing? Itgives no tone arm action. So the degree that the pc hasn’t any communication cycle with theauditor, he doesn’t get tone arm action. So then the degree that the pc is sitting there all byhimself, self-auditing, gives you no tone arm action. And that’s actually—the absence of tonearm action is the degree of self-audit the pc is indulging in. You understand this cycle?"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"All right, well, that’s all there is to that cycle. That’s all there is to that cycle. Now, forheaven’s sakes, get yours sufficiently well repaired that you don’t have to worry about it aftertraining. And after that, spend your basic auditing doing nothing but repair the communicationinabilities of the pc, and you will be a genius, man! You crack 99 percent of the cases that walkin. A screaming genius! People will look at you, “Wow!” you know? Well, this fellow is awfulworried because his wife’s waffling and ran off with a “waff-waf, and so forth, waf-waf-waf-waf-waf-waf-waf. . .” and you say “Thank you,” and he goes “ Waf-waf-waf. . . “Thankyou.” “. . . waf-waf-waf-waf. . .” “thank you!

Is there something else around here? I could have sworn I heardsomebody speak.”A lot of you take over the case, and the guy is going, “yip-yip-yap-yap-yap.” And he says,“waffle, waffle, waf and so forth and so on, and so on and I really don’t have any and so onand all these lollipops, they keep coming out of the wah-blah-blah . . .”You say, “Thank you.”And he goes, “Wa-wa-wana-nawa-wa . . .”You say, “Thank you.”And “ Wa-wa.

And it’s all very terrible . . .”And you say, “Thank you,” and so forth.“And it’s all very terrible and the wife ran away with the lollipops and, oh, the chauffeur cameout, and . . .”Oh, don’t be an idiot and sit there and let this go on forever. He isn’t talking to anybody. Now,that’s what you’ve got to recognize. Let’s get down to some of these problems here. Let’s getdown. What is this guy doing with his communication cycle? You want to know how to bustcases, that’s how you bust them.What’s he doing? I’ll give you an idea. Let me give you a very, very high-school, way-upstairsanalysis of this situation, show you how far this can go—way up in the clouds. Bang! Pc takestwenty minutes to answer the auditing question. Now, the auditor, see, in this particular case,he knows Scientology. He knows it backwards, forwards and upside down, see? Guy takestwenty minutes to answer the auditing question, and in that answer of the auditing question,doesn’t answer it. Now, the very smart auditor, the very, very, very smart auditor, in repairingthis communication cycle from the pc, would look at that, and he’d have three processes justlike that. Three processes he’d know he’d have to do on this pc. Pang, pang, pang! This, I toldyou is very high school, see? It’s very up. Very upstairs.(1) Pc cannot have an auditing question. It’s pretty obvious, isn’t it? Didn’t answer thequestion, so he couldn’t have gotten it. So your first process would be “What auditing questionwouldn’t you mind being asked?” or “What auditing question should you be asked?” or “Whatquestion could you answer?” This is getting very elementary, isn’t it? “What question wouldn’tyou mind answering?” You say that’s running him at effect. No, it isn’t, because you’re askinghim to have the power of choice over what question. You’d be surprised. You could probablyrun that as a repetitive process for an hour or two, and everything would get much brighter tothis person. Person would say, “Terrific process! Absolutely terrific process. Never heard of"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"such a process before! When did you dream that process up?” I mean, dream a process up, bedamned. You just start processing him on a part of the communication cycle.Now let’s get more esoteric. Let’s get much more esoteric. If he says he hasn’t had anyauditing, we obviously would adjudicate that he can’t have any auditing. But we’d have torepair something of the communication cycle of “What question wouldn’t he mind answering?”before we could ask him a question that he would answer. Quite obvious, isn’t it? So you’dhave to take first things first. And then we would have to find out about this auditing thing, andI think you’d find out, as your second process, it’d be necessary for you to get him to get theconcept of wasting auditing, and others wasting auditing. Well, if he can’t have it, he’s wastingit, because it’s sitting in front of him. Can’t have auditing.Well, if you got him to waste it in concept for a few minutes or a half an hour or a session orsomething like this, “Get the idea of you wasting auditing. Get the idea of someone . . .”—nothave him pick up anything on recall, man, because if you’re auditing a case like that, you’reobviously auditing somebody who doesn’t dare go back on the backtrack. So don’t say “Whatauditing have you had that you wouldn’t mind?” you see, because you’re asking him to go intothe past. Well, obviously, that is like going out into the outer perimeter. The past is not in thesession. That’s going abroad, isn’t it? Memory processes, and that sort of thing, are out of thesession and out of the communication cycle. That’s something you repair after you’ve gotsomebody in session.So your next process would be, as I said, waste auditing. “Get the idea of wasting auditing.What could you do here that would waste auditing?” That’s very good, you see? “What couldan auditor do here that would waste auditing?” Because a person can’t have something, theymust waste ii. If he isn’t getting auditing, he must not be able to have it. I mean, let’s getelementary. Let’s go way back to 1952, get Elementary Have. The ability to do. You could alsoget him to waste communication or anything else, but I’m just dreaming up three processes in arow here. Your first one is what question could he answer, see, wouldn’t he mind answering;your next one is “Get the idea of wasting auditing”; and the third one, “Who would I have to beto audit you?”Now you’ve done a subvert, here. You’ve gone below the session. See, you’ve brought himup to a point where he could hear the fact that you’re going to ask him a very significantquestion. After I did that, I’d maybe work on his memory. Because those three points wouldreally be healed. You’d see that whole case change. You’d see that whole case change. And yetyou’re worried because he keeps talking about his lollipops running out with—away with hiswife, or something of the sort. And you just get fixated on the fact. You say, “This guy can’tbe audited because he talks all the time, all the time, all the time, about lollipops and thechauffeur, and it goes on and on and on and on and on. And, therefore, if we don’t remedy thisbutton about the lollipops, the chau . . .” Why, hell’s bells, he doesn’t even know what he’stalking about.It’s whether or not he can receive an acknowledgment, whether or not he can receive anauditing question, whether or not he can have an auditing session, whether or not he can sit inan auditing room, whether or not he can have an acknowledgment, whether or not, you see, hecan say something to the auditor, whether or not—so forth. You get all the little processes thatgo with this, see? Now, the person took twenty minutes to answer an auditing question anddidn’t answer it for those twenty minutes. Three processes. Based on what? Just yourknowledge of Scientology and what the pc is doing in front of you. Simple, huh?All right, we got a pc who’s sitting there, and he doesn’t say anything. Let’s take another case,let’s just do all this off the cuff. Pc isn’t saying anything.“Yeah.”“All right. Do birds fly?” (You’re running some process, you know?) “Do birds fly? I’ll repeatthe question....”"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"“Oh, hmm. Oh, hmm. (sigh) Yeah.”Well, let’s dream up a process. We obviously can’t have “What question wouldn’t you mindmy asking you?” because he’s sitting there silent, man. Probably not a question of being askeda question, it’s a question of not being able to respond to a question. Let’s take it apart, let’sfind out what the pc is doing, dream up something accordingly, see?So we say, “What could you say to me?” Elementary. Long comm lag, and he finally sayssomething he can say to you. You get this question over somehow to him. What could he sayto you?And he finally says, “I . . . I could say hello.” Good, big win, see? All right, let’s build this upon a gradient. Next thing you know, you’ve got him talking to you. But you see, if you don’thave the auditing cycle going from the pc to the auditor, if you have tremendouscommunication disabilities on the part of the pc, you actually don’t have any auditing cyclegoing that will discharge energy, and so you don’t have tone arm action. That simple? That’sall there is to it, actually. So, as soon as he can talk to the auditor, don’t get so overjoyed aboutthis wonderful change in him that you cease, now, to inspect his communication cycle.Because if you’ve cured that, you will now find another piece of it that’s missing. In otherwords, you can go the whole way. Do you see?After he’s gotten so that he can say something to you, well now, now you might have to figureout what would he answer, don’t you see? And now you might have to figure out if he couldhave an auditor. Now you might even go so far as to find out what constituted getting better. Idon’t think you have to invent a process as complicated as “What would be worse than gettingbetter?” But what the pc isn’t doing is where . . . Well, let me put it this way. There’s a littleformula involved: It’s what the pc isn’t doing that it might be possible for the auditor to get himto do, see? That’s the formula. It isn’t what isn’t the pc doing that we’re going to get him todo—what is the missing ability? Because obviously he’s not OT, so you say, “All right, beOT.” You’re going to have a lose here. I’m afraid that’s going to be a lose. Do you see? So,it’s what can you get the pc to do that the pc can regain the ability in doing? See, that’s theformula on which you’re operating.And, operating on that formula, you can find all sorts of things. You can thresh around in theenvironment of the pc, one way or the other, and if you’re an alert auditor, you’ll see these littledisabilities showing up here and there, and so forth. A stammerer is about the easiest diagnosisanybody ever had anything to do with. But how many stammerers have I seen being audited onprocesses and techniques? Well, it’s absolutely foolish to audit a stammerer on a technique. Heobviously is having difficulty communicating. What are you doing in an auditing session,doing anything but to improve his ability to communicate to the auditor?Now, you might find something silly like this happen if you were auditing somebody whostammered: that he would talk to the auditor eventually with complete clarity—still stammeredto other people. Well, this is quite obvious. This is extremely obvious what you would nowdo. You don’t now instantly extend it to other people, because there are other pieces of thecommunication abilities right there in the session to be straightened up before you go out intothe outer perimeter of the society. And usually where the auditor gets his lose is he repairssomething, gets a big win, and then there’s thirty other things to be repaired, sitting right infront of his face—right in front of him—and he doesn’t. He does some kind of a jump intomemory, or engram running, or something. My God, just because the pc is now perfectlywilling to talk to you is no reason that the pc—who a few minutes ago could not rememberanything —it’s no reason he now can remember something. That’s another ability.Let’s say somebody is trying to improve their memory. Well, you improve somebody’smemory after you’ve got somebody who can receive an auditing question and answer it, andthen receive the acknowledgment resulting therefrom, and who can sit there in an auditingsession and be a pc and be audited. Now you can go about improving memory, but oddly"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"enough, memory improvement starts with being able to remember something in the auditingroom, not something that happened to him eight trillion years ago. It begins just a minute ago.I’ve seen a pc absolutely ruined, become unauditable, by repetitively being asked questionshaving to do with memory that the pc couldn’t answer. So another rule in observing thecommunication cycle, and so forth, is don’t ask the pc to do things the pc can’t do. And ifyou’ve inadvertently asked the pc to do something the pc now can’t do, well, for heaven’ssakes, be enough on the ball, be sharp enough, be really bright on this and recognize thatyou’ve asked the pc something the pc can’t do, and therefore you’ve given a lose, and youbetter not compound the lose. Don’t ask them to do the same thing again that they now can’tdo.This goes very elementary. You talk about flattening processes. Very often you’re asking a pc aprocess, you see? “From where could you view catfish?” see? “From where could you viewcatfish?” “From where could you view catfish?”And the pc finally says, “That’s all the answers there are.”And you know, the process had better be flattened. So you say, “Well, from where could youview catfish?”And he says, “Well, that’s all the answers there are.”And you say, “From where could you view catfish?” And now he has to invent an answer, andyou’re running a create process. Your pc, if he doesn’t ARC break, snarls up right there.I always respect a pc saying “There aren’t any more answers.” I bail out of there in a hurry.And when I ask the pc “From where could you view catfish?’ and we just took off into the bluehere—”From where could you view catfish?” See? That’s the question I want you to answernow. Answer the question”—and the pc says, “I’m sorry, I . . . I never viewed any catfish,” Iknow right away have been guilty of giving the pc an auditing question which the pc couldn’tanswer, and I am guilty of not having cleared the auditing question. I’ve gives the pc a lose.Let’s have a pc who is very deathly afraid of touching mantels—mantel pieces. Just invent anuttiness, see? All right, we’ll say! “All right, walk over there and touch that mantelpiece.” (Wealready knew he was this way, see or we don’t know he’s this way.) We say, “Walk over thereand touch the mantelpiece.”And he says, “Uughh, I . . . I . . . I can’t do that.”Soon as you’ve gotten into that situation, you got yourself a lose. Let find out if the pc coulddo these things. Let’s discuss this process a little bit with the pc. Like, “How’s about . . .” Idon’t care how grammatical or esoteric or patterned you are about this, you see, becausesometimes you have to b very communicative. And you say, “How’s about if I ask you to walkaround here and touch parts of this room? What would you think about that? What if I ask youto do something like that?”And the pc says, “Oh, my God, I couldn’t do that! Ho-ho-ho-ho, no oh-oh! Particularly amantelpi — Oh-oh-oh, no! Don’t ask me to do anything like that.”You say, “All right, I won’t.”See, swift recovery. Now, you haven’t given the pc any lose. In fact you might have given hima little win. This caused him a spooky feeling “You know, I’m really—I don’t really want towalk around here and tour the room.”Ah, he’s interested now. “Well, is there anything around here you wouldn’t be too upset abouttouching? How’s that? How about some question like that’"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"“Oh, I could . . . I wouldn’t be too scared of touching that . . . that spot on the floor.”“What else wouldn’t you mind looking around here and . . . ?”Smooth as glass, you see? See? You cleared it, he said he couldn’t do this intrigued him, nowyou can hit a gradient that he can do and build it back up, and you’ve got it made.Every once in a while you see something like this. But if you’re not observing what thecommunication cycle of the pc is, why, you’re adrift all the time. Pc isn’t answering thequestion. Well, that’s obvious. Maybe there’s a hundred thousand remedies could be dreamedup for this particular activity, all within the perimeter of the auditing room. Pc is this way, pc isthat way, pc... Every time they sit down in the chair they dust the chair off very carefully andtake some Kleenex and wipe the arms of the chair, and then they sit down very gingerly intothe chair. You’ve observed this a couple of times. Well, there’s no point in bringing it sharplyto their attention, but you must realize, it must be borne home to you—with that muchexaggeration, certainly it’d bring it home—that this pc doesn’t want to touch very much aroundan auditing session. I mean, that would be an elementary observation, don’t you see?It might have to do with chairs, it might be a GPM, but you can’t run all of that. Let’s justchalk this up. Let’s chalk this up. Pc gingery on this subject. Obviously, somewhere up theline you’re going to run some objective process on this pc—somewhere up the line. But aheadof that there might be some much more attainable, but much less obvious thing, such as the pcnever looks at the auditor. That might be touchable. “If you looked over here, what would yousee?” Doesn’t really require him to look over there. He only need guess at it. “What might yousee?” You could even soften it up to that, don’t you see?There’s all kinds of things here that depend on auditor observation. Where the pc breaks downin his communication cycle with the auditor and where the pc breaks down in hiscommunication cycle with the environment is your entrance point to the case. Those are theentrance points to the case. If you haven’t got him squared around so that he can respond to theauditor, he of course can’t answer any auditing question, so what’s this technique worry? Whyare you worried about a technique? No technique you ever dreamed up is going to arrive.Well, you have some fortuitous feeling that an automaticity will turn on in the pc and answeryou. Well, that’s how you’re going to get the pc getting well and never finding out about it.They ran into that in Dianetics. They could actually run ‘em through an engram. The engramwas so easy to trigger, and the bank responds to the auditor so beautifully, that practically thewhole session could be carried on without the presence or benefit of a pc. Pc didn’t have toenter into it—and case loses occurred resultingly.But these are the ways you crack cases. And the best way to study it is just walk around it andtake a look at all possible ramifications that could be done about it, get some acquaintance withprocesses from ‘52, ‘53, ‘55, wonder which one of these processes are applicable to what,don’t you see? There’s all kinds of these processes. First Saint Hill, “Who would I have to beto audit you?” see? That’s a nice process, see? But there’s tons of these processes you can . . .Oh, Lord! Well, they’re being cataloged now, lots of them. But they’re honeys. They’rehoneys.Sometimes you find a pc can’t, absolutely cannot run some process because one leg of it iswrong. Let’s say SCS, and yet the pc can’t stand still. And it’s required in the process to standstill, and yet you’re running Start, Change and Stop on the pc.Well, the pc’s disability is the pc can’t stand still. The pc can start, the pc can change and the pccan stop, as long as they don’t have to stop much. So you say, well, we can flatten stop—thiswill be all right. Oh, no, there must be a leg underlying this. See, a pc disability—the pc cannotstand still."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Well, what would you do about something like this? Well, I’ll tell you what not to do about it:neglect it. Don’t keep on running SCS, SCS, SCS, and the pc is going on, and they go on,because what are they doing? They’re running with a prior consideration of the process.Therefore, they never really take on any of the auditing commands.They are running each auditing command, (“When I say ‘Start,’ you start that body” and soforth), “All right, I just—that . . . that’ll give me a chance not to stand still,” see? The pcalways amends it. Always amends the auditing question, always amends the auditing question.Don’t you see? “I’ll stop it, but I’ll stop it quick enough and get off of it so at no point duringthe stop have I stood still.” See? You get this idea? Well, a little discussion with the pc willshow up these various things.Now, you can take a process and you can walk parallel with SCS, and you can repair that pointand run SCS afterwards. Well, how would you go about standing still? Well, the crudest wayto go about it is just say “Stand still. All right.” “Don’t stand still. Thank you.” “Stand still.Thank you.” “Don’t stand still. Thank you.” That’s the crudest thing I know of, see? This isobviously right out of the textbooks and technology of Scientology, you see? “Stand still.Thank you.” “Don’t stand still. Thank you.” “Stand still. Thank you.” “Don’t stand. . .”Automaticity is going to go away; this must be some kind of an automaticity that’s all ready totrigger there. So if we get the person into any familiarity with it—because the person alreadyrealizes they can’t do it. That recognition tells you that it’s within the range of itsa.But if you get somebody walking in on crutches that don’t know they’re walking on crutches,you wouldn’t say “Throw away your crutches. Now walk.” See, too high a gradient. And theydon’t even worry about it. You get somebody walking in and saying, “I got to get rid of thesecrutches, man”—worry, worry, worry, present time problem, see?Well, the thing to do is inspect their communication cycle and their communication cycle withthe auditor, communication cycle with their mind, the communication cycle with theenvironment—see, there’s many of these little communication cycles—let’s inspect thesevarious things. Let’s find out he’s all right before we say “All right. Throw away yourcrutches. Thank you.” You got the idea? See?Normally, what the person is worried about is in actual fact not what the person is buggedwith. You very often will get somebody running off on a total automaticity of what’s wrongwith them, and they’re not even listening to themself talk. Actually, they will run off a totalautomaticity of what’s wrong with them, and they’re not even listening to themselves talk.Sometimes they listen to themselves talk to find out what’s wrong with them. When you getinto that situation, why, it’s elementary to repair the existing livingness of the pc, but only afteryou’ve repaired their auditingness.An auditing session is a highly artificial action. Highly artificial. It’s dreamed up, inventedfrom scratch. Nothing like it has really ever existed before. That’s why a psychoanalyst wouldlay an egg a minute—in a minute— if he cracked a textbook on Scientology and took it back tothe office to run it on one of his patients. Aughhh! And boy, do they lay eggs! Why? Well,they’re running Scientology with a psychoanalytic auditing cycle. And, of course, that’s a wildauditing cycle if you’ve ever inspected it.One psychoanalyst said, “I don’t see how you can stand to listen hour after hour after hour,”and the other one says, “Who listens?” But that’s their appreciation of the auditing cycle, andit’s too bad to produce any great effect, which is probably fortunate—because the theory whichgoes back of it, and so forth, is highly artificial. They don’t produce any impingement, theauditing cycle isn’t there, and so on.But this artificiality of an auditing session approximates—it’s only artificial because itapproximates in such harsh, staggering, visible reality, the exact precise points of contact withexistence. And what it is, is a hopped-up, gunned-up contact with beings in existence, don’t"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"you see? Way up! It’s something like putting [taking] a Model-T Ford and putting a Lycomingaircraft engine in it, see? And bzzzz-zzzz!Well, all of communication always has consisted of cause, distance, effect. Well, you jam it upinto an auditing communication cycle and it’s full of bombs, man. See, bang! Things are goingto happen, because it’s highlighted the exact important points. For instance, you ask somebodyon the street out here, “What’s important about communication?”They say, “Well, being polite.”“Good. What are the parts of communication?”“Oh, there’s uh . . . past participles and there’s uh . . . present participles and uh . . . there’sgrammar and . . .”See, they couldn’t tell you any of this, don’t you see?All right, you gun in there, with cause, distance, effect, you see? Ask a question, get itanswered, acknowledge it, see? Porowww! See? Wrooof! You’re handling raw meat. And yourehabilitate any part of this, and so forth, and then something wakes up. Thetan can’t help butwake up. The ability to communicate is always terribly visible to a reporter, or somebody doingwork in this particular field. They get around Scientologists, it knocks them flat. And thisphotographer that was here today from the Saturday Evening Post, and so forth—who hasgone now, I imagine—this boy’s first remark to me is “They’re all so uninhibited!” after he gotthrough taking pictures of you, you see? “You’re all so uninhibited.”He sees communication happening. He’s very impressed with you, you see? You’re walkingstraighter, and you aren’t all tightened up, and you’re not a bundle of nerves, don’t you see,and all this sort of thing. And he can’t quite express this thing, but he’s already in a state ofshock because he’s been hit, you see, with too much life, livingness, you know—just hit himin the face. And yet, none of you really probably said anything to him. It’s that apparent.Well now, you take this up and gun this up into an auditing cycle, and the auditor is saying,“Do birds fly?” and the pc is supposed to listen to this, and he is supposed to understand thisand he is supposed to sort out the answer to this, and he is supposed to deliver it up now. Andhe’s going to get for that, “Thank you” straight into his skull. And it isn’t the parts of grammar,and it isn’t this, and it isn’t that and it isn’t the other thing, and . . . If he can stand up to this,he’ll start getting the idea that he can communicate. And he goes out of session, and he’ll startcommunicating with the environment. And the only thing really wrong with people is, isthey’ve withdrawn from contact.If you wanted to capsulize the entirety of difficulty with the mind, take somebody who is nolonger looking. The last time he looked, there were three saber-toothed tigers ready to bite him.Now he is no longer looking. of course, he believes that there are three saber-toothed tigersthere. He’ll sometimes put up screens between himself and the tigers. And then, of course, henever dares take down the screens, so he never finds out if the tigers have gone. And he doesthis throughout enough trillenia, he’s got an awful stack of tigers—all of which have left! Buthe doesn’t know it. He can’t be sure they’ve left.And so he’s in a condition of total withdrawal—from his environment, from himself. He’ssafeguarded himself with an automatic bank; he’s safeguarded himself with an automaticbeingness; he’s got a valence standing where he ought to be, and he knows that he camestraight from mud and that he is mud and that he’d better not be anything else, because mud isrelatively unpalatable when eaten by saber-toothed tigers.And a capsulization of all aberration is just a total withdrawal. I don’t care—that’s a psychiatricterm, of course. They have some condition; they say “total withdrawal.” The psychiatrist isstanding there totally withdrawn, telling you about somebody who has gone into a withdrawal,which I always considered very interesting. This is not an apt term. It’s one point where we’re"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"crossing terms. But we’re not talking about the psychiatric withdrawal, we’re just talking aboutthe fact the guy has retreated, that’s all. He no longer dares put out a beam a mile away. Firsthe could put one out a light-year, then he put one out a year, you see, and then he put one out ahundred yards, and—pardon me, a mile. And then he got down to a hundred yards. And eachtime he got enough “being bitten,” don’t you see, that he no longer puts out to distance, hisremedy is always shorten the reach. And the thetan has, as his standard remedy for safety,shorten the reach. And what does he do when he gets into zero reach?He actually can figure out how to invert a withdrawal into an inverted withdrawal, and you getthe cycle of the dynamics coming on down, which is—he comes away from actual reach, don’tyou see, and he comes down to zero actual reach. Well, he’s got to reach somehow, so hefigures some other way to reach, don’t you see? He reads travel books or something, youknow? And he goes into these various cycles. And there’s always a zero of what he is doing,which then has a remedy which is lower than that, and he gets down into not just a totalwithdraw, he gets down to an inversion of the inversion of the inversion of the inversionwithdrawal. of course, the first point this shows up is in an auditing session, and his ability totalk to the auditor—about pertinencies.The sensibility of his communication is also in point here. You’ve asked him, “Do you have acar?” And he has explained to you that General Motors stock has gone down for the last year orso, and drops it at this point. So pertinencies—he didn’t answer the question, did he? So youget him into some condition where he can answer the question, he can speak up, where he canhear what you’re saying, where he can therefore receive the auditor. Because you’ve gotsomebody on total withdrawal, one of your best remedies is to see that he gets reached, don’tyou see? And you reach him in order to get him to reach, don’t you see? And these are theconditions which you’re trying to remedy with an auditing cycle.Now, if you want to be an absolute gee-whizzer to end all gee-whizzers on cracking cases,don’t you ever go around drooling about this fellow sitting there, and he’s saying, “And mywife lollipopped with the chauffeur, and . . . and it’s just all too tough, so on and so forth, andso on and so on.”And you’re trying to say to him, “This is—you know, the session has ended.”And he says, “ . . . and so and so on and came down the chute, and there were eight sides of it,and so forth; they were all hexagonal, you see, and so forth.”And you said, “The . . . the session—the session ended some time ago.”And he says, “ . . . and so on and so on. So I’ve always said to chauffeurs since that particulartime, I’ve said it lollipopped the chauffeur!”Don’t now go to somebody, or try to crack a textbook to find out what technique to run on thiscase. It isn’t a case of technique. He hasn’t got anybody there to talk to. He isn’t talking toanybody. If he is, it’s somebody else. He isn’t talking about a problem he could have, see? Heisn’t even talking about a problem he’s got! He probably isn’t even listening to himselfanymore. He has no familiarity with the environment, he is disoriented as to where he is and soforth. And you want a technique?He’s got a paw. Well, you could say, “Now pick up your hand and put it on the side of thechair and feel the side of the chair.”He might go right on talking for some time without noticing you’re doing this. Then eventuallysay, “Hey, there’s a chair here.” Big win.But if you’re going to deal in pcs at all who have disabilities of any kind whatsoever, you’vegot to have a session before you can have Class IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X. You get the ideanose? You’ve got to have A session before you can have a technique operating. This is the"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"value of the auditing cycle, this is its use, and this is how to become one of the wildest. casecrackers anybody ever had anything to do with. You get to be a screaming genius on thissubject, and something.Oh, you make errors, you’ll get too accusative, you’ll all of a sudden find you overcut—you’ve overestimated the pc’s ability here and there, and so forth, and you have to cut it back.But remember that it always requires adjustment.The only other thing I would teach you, and like to teach you about this, and I really wish Icould, is that after you’ve remedied it, it’s been remedied. And don’t keep on; because this pchad a lot of tone arm action on what question he could receive from the auditor, and so forth,don’t make that a lifetime profession. Because this is just another method of non-observation.Now that he can do this and is doing it, note that he is doing it. See? He feels all right about itand he is doing it. Note that, and now notice—notice, in other words, that he’s changed—andthen notice what else you can put together.So there’s two more things to notice, don’t you see? Is when has that condition beenremedied?—when has that little ability been regained?—so that you can pull foot out of there.And the other thing is observe now, newly and freshly, for something else to do for the pc.The reason I give you those other two is that sometimes it happens so rapidly that you’re justrocked back on your heels. Pc has never talked to anybody before in their life, and you all of asudden have them talking to you pertinently, in a blue streak. Well, let’s not go on remedyingtheir ability to talk to the auditor See, ability regained. So you want to be able to notice that, andthat’s all part of the observation.And the real hot—the real hot auditor, the real guy that gets case wins all over the place, issitting in there observing what is going on in the session, and if things are going all right,doesn’t remedy them, and if things are going all wrong, picks up that point that can beremedied and remedies it, until they are all remedied, and then carries on. Those are the magicways to go about this sort of thing.Well, you take over the technical aspect of some Scientology organization. You’re sitting inthere doing nothing but coaching up cases, doing nothing but coaching up cases. Don’t pay anyattention to the auditing of the cases— consider that’s sincere and it’s being done as best itpossibly can be. Ignore that aspect. Don’t keep picking on the auditors; that’s a training job.But just keeping watching—watching those communication cycles. Note the communicationabilities and so forth, the appearance and that sort of thing, of a pc. Don’t depend on large testshaving been made every fifteen minutes and fourteen pounds of auditor reports to tell youwhether or not the pc’s had a change. Let’s look at this pc. Let’s listen to this pc in session. Isthis pc talking better, answering more pertinently, and so forth? If so, fine! We’re winning,and 80 forth. Let’s not worry about that pc until we get a bog, and there’s a no-changecondition begins to take place with that pc. And the pc looking brighter and got more spark inthe eye than they had: Well, their eye was— remember that this is a gradient—their eye wasabsolutely complete pebble, stone, flat, lightless. And now you can see a trace of color throughthe fog. That’s an improvement. See? Note the improvements. Don’t just be cynical about it thewhole way, you see? Note the improvements, because they sometimes take place rather slowly.And just keep them moving up, and only pay attention to—only pay attention to—thecommunication cycle and the ability of the person to handle the environment in his immediatevicinity, particularly an auditing session. And only pay attention to those things.Never pay any attention to the person’s problems, never pay any attention to their goals insession, never pay attention to any of these other things —because obviously, any auditor theygot would take care of these things if the pc was in session."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"See? Auditors are good at that. What they’re not good at is having somebody there fully insession. Because, of course, that’s the hardest trick. That’s the roughest trick. But there lie thebiggest gains. And it looks so easy, looks so kindergartenish, that you very often neglect it.So you see that somebody is all straightened out, he can talk to an auditor, an auditor can talk tohim, that an auditing cycle can take place, the person can receive an acknowledgment, theperson can have an auditing room, the person can have an auditing session—all of these thingsare possible everything is fine, and so forth: Well, aside from occasionally catching somebodywith a tremendous goof on the subject of—they’re running the service facsimile on the person,and when it got [to] a service facsimile, the auditor in this particular case couldn’t find anyservice facsimile because the person had been raised in a poor family and didn’t have anymaids.Then the thing to do is to get hold of the D of T and say, “That auditor needs some training onservice facsimiles.” Not to go into it. But the only trouble you’re going to run into from thereon, don’t you see, is going to be the application of technique.And that is never the trouble in Scientology, and it is not the trouble, it is not the trouble withyour pc that you’re having any trouble with at all. The techniques work like mad, but all ofthem have the dependency of the pc fully in session. The pc is fully in session, you can runalmost anything on them a they’ll sail, don’t you see? Pc not in session, won’t. The big bog ispeople do not get the pc into session before they start running something. And therefore theyexpect a technique will remedy something that’s sitting right in front of their faces, which is thepc is not at all in session. Do you see?All right. That’s actually how to undercut cases left, right and cent make a wide swath in alldirections. And I think you can do it.Thank you."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"CHAPTER XIITHE SIX BASIC PROCESSESExerpt from the Book: Dianetics 55!Today’s auditor must be conversant with six Basic Processes and must be able to getresults with these processes before he can expect to get results with higher levels of auditing.These six processes form a roadway for more than the auditor. We discover that theycompose a tone-scale. This tone-scale is as follows: at its lowest and highest reaches, whetherby mimicry, words, or mock-up, we have two-way communication. Next above this,occupying a position from about 1.1 to 1.8 on the Chart of Human Evaluation as given in“Science of Survival,” we have Elementary Straightwire. Above this we have, from 1.8 to 2.5,Opening Procedure. Above this, from 2.6 to 3.0, we have Opening Procedure by Duplication.Above this we have Remedy of Havingness, from 3.1 to 3.5, and above this, from 3.6 to 4.0,Spotting Spots in Space.An auditor, in auditing these six basic processes, becomes sufficiently capable inobserving and communicating that he can handle (or, can bring the preclear up to the pointwhere he can handle) the “subjective process” which remedies communication, or the other onewhich is the “One-Shot Clear.”The problem of psychosis never rightly belonged in Dianetics but it has been solvedthere. Opening Procedure of 8-C and the Mimicry techniques as given in the PABs resolvepsychosis. They resolve it rapidly and care for it adequately, and we have no real worry on thatscore. The only reason we would enter the field of psychosis at all would be to find out howfar South our techniques worked.CHART OF PROCESSESWHERE THEY ARE ON THE ARC TONE SCALEExteriorized  4.0 Spotting Spots in Space3.63.5 Remedy of Havingness3.13.0 Op.

Through them we find two-way communication everywhere. It can be said withhonesty that there is no auditing without two-way communication.The process, Two-way Communication itself, could be subdivided into verbal and non-verbal processes. The verbal processes would include questions about the present timeenvironment and the preclear’s life, interests, and so forth, and would get a direct answer toevery question, no matter how long the communication lag was. In other words, a two-waycommunication would be entered upon so as to actually bring the preclear to talk to the auditor.In the case of people who have great difficulties in this line, we have non-verbal techniquessuch as Mimicry, wherein the auditor mimics the preclear and persuades the preclear to mimicthe auditor. Various processes are used, such as passing a ball back and forth between them,nodding, shaking hands, sitting down, standing up, walking across the room and back andsitting down, all of which are effective.Much of this book, “Dianetics 55!” is on the subject of two-way communication, andthe totality of auditing is bringing a preclear into excellent two-way communication, and it isconceived a little difficult by instructors to relay the “process” called Two-way Communication.However, it is actually simplicity itself, for all that is necessary is to get the preclear to actuallyvolunteer communication and answer the communications volunteered to him. There is alwayssomething the preclear will talk about.Mimicry, particularly when used on psychotics, is a precision subject. Mimicry is not anew process, it is almost as old as psycho-therapy, but it is spotty when used without anintimate knowledge of validation. It can be said that that which one validates comes true. Theonly force or strength Life has is that which derives directly from the upper echelon ofUnderstanding. When Life gets down to a point where it is incomprehensible it cannot relayany understanding.Understanding this is essential for an auditor. He must realize that he givespower to everything he validates. We made some thing important out of the engram, and byvalidating engrams, we actually, where they were audited poorly, gave force and power toengrams. Thus it is with the psychotic. To mimic the strange, peculiar, bizarre and unusualthings he does is to give force and strength to those things. It cannot be said with sufficientemphasis that the auditor must never mimic the strange, bizarre and unusual manifestations ofthe psychotic. The only way that the auditor can make mimicry work consistently andcontinually and rapidly, is by validating what the environment considers the agreed-upon, theusual, the routine, the ordinary. Perhaps the psychotic is twisting his hands madly, andoccasionally nodding slightly. The auditor, to mimic him, would not twist his hands, butwould nod slightly, since a nod is the agreed-upon manifestation in the environment, not thetwisting of hands. If the auditor does this, the preclear will begin to nod more and twist hishands less. If the auditor were to begin to mimic the psychotic by twisting hands, he woulddiscover that the psychotic would probably stop twisting his hands, but would do somethingelse more bizarre. And if the auditor mimics this much more bizarre thing, the psychotic willsimply go on to something even wilder or might become entirely motionless, for the one fearthe psychotic has is becoming predictable. The psychotic is under the control of entities,demon-circuits. He does have a grain of sanity present, otherwise he would not be able tofunction at all. Therefore, those things which he does which are sane must be mimicked and soreinforced. If an auditor knows this thoroughly and practices it smartly he will discover thatpsychotics can be brought into two-way communication and moved immediately into OpeningProcedure of 8-C, the proper process for psychotics. 8-C, while not a psychotic process, doeswork on psychotics. However, in working Opening Procedure of 8-C on the psychotic, theauditor must be very careful not to go beyond part “a” for a long, long time."},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"From the process known as “Two-way Communication” we move on to the processknown as “Elementary Straightwire.” Elementary Straightwire has two basic commands. Oneof these commands is used continually, over, and over, and over, and over, until thecommunication lag is entirely flat on it and then the other command is used over, and over, andover until the communication lag is entirely flat, at which time it will be discovered that the firstcommand will now give communication lag. And so it is used over, and over, and over, andthen the second one is used over, and over, and over. In other words, what we do here is touse this process of Elementary Straightwire with just two commands, continually, onecommand at a time, flattening each communication lag encountered. While one is doing this, ofcourse, one maintains two-way communication. He acknowledges the fact that the preclear hasrecalled something and is in general alert to receive from the preclear an originatedcommunication, answer it, and give further orders. The two commands of ElementaryStraightwire are: “Give me something you wouldn’t mind remembering,” “Give me somethingyou wouldn’t mind forgetting.” This can be varied with: “Tell me something you wouldn’tmind remembering,” “Tell me something you wouldn’t mind forgetting.” This ElementaryStraightwire is a standard form. If it is varied it should be varied towards simplicity. A simpleform of straightwire is “Remember something,” over and over, again, and again, and again,and again, and again. Do not use, however, “Forget something,” since this is far too rough forthe preclear. Another even simpler form is to apply “Remember something” to the Dynamics,such as “Remember a man,” “Remember a group.” The only error that can be made inElementary Straightwire is to get too fancy, for one does not believe that an auditor who hasadvanced this far in auditing would make an error in communication. There is an entire gamutwhich we call “The next to the last list in Self-Analysis” published in the original edition of“Self-Analysis” which has many times been known to break a person from a neurotic to a sanestate. This is: “Can you recall a time that is really real to you?” “Can you recall a time when youwere communicating well to someone?” “Can you recall a time when someone wascommunicating well to you?” “Can you recall a time when you felt Affinity for someone?”“Can you recall a time when someone felt Affinity for you?” By keeping this in theUnderstanding or Affinity line a case advances more rapidly than if mis-emotion and otherfactors are addressed.Opening Procedure of 8-C is one of the most effective and powerful processes everdeveloped and should be recognized and used as such. The main error which is made in theOpening Procedure of 8-C is not to do it long enough. It takes about 15 hours of OpeningProcedure of 8-C in order to bring a person into a completely relaxed and Self-Determined stateof mind regarding orders. Opening Procedure of 8-C is a precision process. Step “a” ofOpening Procedure of 8-C is “Do you see that object?” the auditor pointing. When the preclearsignifies that he does, the auditor says, “Walk over to it.” When the preclear has walked over toit, the auditor says, “Touch it.” When the preclear does, the auditor says, “Let go,” anddesignates another object -- a wall, a lamp -- calls it by name or not, and goes through the sameprocedure once more. It is important that the auditor specifically acknowledge each time thepreclear has executed the command given. When the preclear has seen the object, when he haswalked over to it, when he has touched it, when he has let go -- each time the auditor signifiesthat he has perceived and does acknowledge this action on the part of the preclear. This Step“a” is used until the preclear does it easily, smoothly, without the slightest variation orintroduction of any physical communication lag, and has demonstrated completely that he hasno upset feeling about the auditor or objects in the room.When “a” has been run for a length of time necessary to bring the case up tone, Part “b”is run. Part “b” introduces the idea of decision. It is notable that the “One-Shot Clear” must bevery strong on this power of decision. It is also notable that a person in extremely badcondition has no power of decision. The commands of Part “b” are: “Pick a spot in this room,”and when the preclear has: “Walk over to it,” and when the preclear does: “Put your finger onit,” and when the preclear has: “Let go.” Each time, the auditor acknowledges the completion ofthe command by the preclear, signifying “All right,” “O.K.,” or “Fine,” making it very plainthat he has noticed and approves of and is acknowledging the preclear in following eachspecific command. He approves of these one at a time in this fashion. The preclear is run on"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"this until he demonstrates no physical communication lag of any kind in making up his mindwhat to touch, how to touch it, and so forth.Part “c” of Opening Procedure of 8-C introduces further decision. It goes as follows:the auditor says, “Pick a spot in this room,” and when the preclear has, the auditor says “Walkover to it.” When the preclear does, the auditor says, “Make up your mind when you are goingto place your finger on it, and do so.” When the preclear has, the auditor says, “Make up yourmind when you are going to let go, and let go.” The auditor each time acknowledges thecompletion of one of these orders to the preclear.In doing Opening Procedure of 8-C the preclear must not be permitted to execute acommand before it is given, and a two-way communication must be maintained. As I havesaid, Opening Procedure of 8-C is a very powerful process. If all auditors knew how to do thisOpening Procedure of 8-C and could do this very well, we would right there have psycho-therapy licked. But we are not trying to lick psycho-therapy. It has never been a major problemto us. We are trying to bring people a long way further North than psycho-therapy everdreamed of, and Dianetics and Scientology are not psycho-therapies, they are processes whichincrease the abilities of people.Opening Procedure by Duplication has as its goal the separating of time, moment frommoment. This is done by getting a preclear to duplicate the same action over and over againwith two dissimilar objects. In England this process is called “Book and Bottle,” probablybecause these two familiar objects are the most used in doing Opening Procedure byDuplication.The first step in Opening Procedure by Duplication is to familiarize the preclear withbeth objects, as to their reality and his ability to own them. One makes himself handle them,and feel them, and acquaint himself with them, makes him describe them as objects he isexperiencing in present time, not as something related into the past. A little time spent on thiscan be quite beneficial.The auditor then begins what will become to the preclear before he is through with thissome of the most hated phrases anyone could conceive, but which, by the time the preclear isfinished with this, become just like any other phrases. Many people believe that openingProcedure by Duplication induces hypnosis. This is because in running it hypnotism runs off:the preclear, while the hypnotism is running off, may feel quite hypnotized. It is the exactreverse of hypnotism. Hypnotism is an effort to persuade the individual to do nothing, to sitstill, and to accept fully the inflow. Opening Procedure by Duplication contains two-waycommunication, and indeed does not work unless two-way communication is done with it. Themain liability in doing two-way communication on Opening Procedure by Duplication is thatthe auditor, in introducing two-way communication to it, may stray considerably from thepattern laid down. He must not do this. Although he is maintaining two-way communication hemust adhere very sharply to the process. He can make the preclear tell more about them, he canmake the preclear describe various things which are manifesting themselves to the preclear hecan be insistent the preclear really knows he has just picked this up, but he must stay with thissequence of auditing commands, and may not vary from them even vaguely. He can interjectother conversation, but not other auditing commands, into Opening Procedure by Duplication.The auditing commands are: “Do you see that book?” says the auditor, pointing. Whenthe preclear signifies that he has, the auditor says, “Walk over to it.” When the preclear does,the auditor says, “Pick it up.” When the preclear does, the auditor says, “Look at it.” When thepreclear does (usually he was looking at it but now looks at it more closely) the auditor says,“Give me its color.” When the preclear does, the auditor says, “Give me its weight.” When thepreclear does, the auditor says, “Give me its temperature.” When the preclear has, the auditorsays, “Put it back exactly as you found it.” This action sequence having been completed, theauditor points to the bottle. “Do you see that bottle?” When the preclear does, the auditor says,“Walk over to it.” When the preclear does, the auditor says, “Pick it up.” When the preclearhas, the auditor says, “Look at it.” When the preclear does, the auditor says, “Give me its"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"color.” When the preclear has, the auditor says, “Give me its weight.” When the preclear has,the auditor says, “Give me its temperature.” When the preclear has, the auditor says, “Put itback exactly as you found it.” Then the auditor says, pointing out the book, “Do you see thatbook?” and so on, back and forth, using this exact sequence of commands. The auditor caninterject “Describe it more fully.” The auditor can sometimes, but not oftener than once every15 minutes, point to the book, have the preclear go through the full sequence with the book,and then point to the book again, and have the preclear once more go through the full sequencewith the book. This will break down the automatic machinery a preclear is bound to set up tocompensate for this process. We want to keep the preclear doing it, not his machines. Byasking the preclear to describe the object, or describe its temperature more fully in its propersequence in these commands, machines are also broken down and the alertness and theawareness of the preclear is increased.The auditor must not omit letting the preclear give him the preclear’s reaction. Thepreclear will pause, seem to be confused. It is up to the auditor at that moment to say, “Whathappened?” and to find out what happened, and then to continue with the process, havingacknowledged the communication of the preclear. An auditor must never be afraid to let apreclear emanate a communication, and an auditor must never fail to acknowledge thecompletion of an auditing action, no matter how minute.The Remedy of Havingness is an extremely effective process for it remedies the abilityof the preclear to have or not have at will. Sometimes auditors interpret this process as inflow,only. That is because the physical universe is an inflow universe, and it is all too easy for anauditor to assign to auditing and all other actions inflow characteristics only.The modus operandi of the Remedy of Havingness is to have the preclear mock upsomething, pull it in, or mock up something and throw it away. It does not matter what youhave him mock up. The item can have significance or not as the case may be. Preclears who arelow in tone, if this is run on them, have a tendency to make everything they mock verysignificant. It is not the significance, it is the mass that counts. However, to keep the preclearinterested, or to assist his mocking up, an auditor may designate specific things, and does so.It will be found that the acceptance level and expectance level of the preclear verydefinitely monitor what he mocks up, and what he can pull in and what he can throw away. Ascovered in the Professional Auditor’s Bulletins, acceptance level processes can be combinedwith the Remedy of Havingness.The commands of Remedy of Havingness are as follows: “Mock up a (planet, man,brick).” “Make a copy of it.” “Make a copy of it.” “Make a copy of it.” And when the preclearhas from five to 15 copies, “Push them all together.” “Now pull them in on you.” When thepreclear has done this for some time, the last command is varied by saying, “Throw them awayand have them disappear in the distance.” In other words, we have the preclear mock upsomething, and when he has we have him make a copy of it, make another copy, and anothercopy, and another copy, one at a time, push them together and pull them in or throw themaway.We keep up this process for some time until we are very certain that he can actuallythrow things away or pull them in on himself at will. This is the Remedy of Havingness.Remedy of Havingness does not mean stuffing the preclear with energy. It means remedyinghis ability to have or not have energy. Run with particular significances such as money,women, et cetera, one could remedy specific scarcities on the part of the preclear. Butremember that at first they may be so scarce that at first he may have to waste a large quantity ofthem before he can have one.On an awareness of awareness unit exteriorized we run Remedy of Havingness, but alittle differently. We say, “Put up eight anchor points.” We describe to him how we want theseput up. We want them put up in such a way as to form the corners of a cube. In other words,these eight anchor points are not put in a group in front of or behind the preclear, they are to be"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"distributed around him. When the preclear has done this we say, “Pull them into you.” Wekeep this up for a long time. We also have the preclear exteriorized mock up eight anchor pointsand send them away from him. A preclear exteriorized can be very unhappy about his lack ofhavingness and this last process is used to remedy this upset.Remedy of Havingness is an exteriorization technique. If it is run on an individual longenough, say eight or ten hours, he will probably exteriorize at the end of that time. If you kepton running it as an exteriorized process, given in the second part above, he would then have hisvisio clear up, and he would finally get into very excellent condition. This is quite a process.However, remember this process depends upon the preclear following the auditor’s orders.Unless the auditor has guaranteed this by Opening Procedure of 8-C and Opening Procedure byDuplication, the chances of the preclear’s actually following his orders (although pretending todo so) are very slim. We discovered in old-time Dianetics that the breakdown was in thepreclear failing to follow the auditor’s orders. Preclears would pretend to follow an auditor’sorders but actually would not.The process known as Spotting Spots in Space is not to be attempted on somebodywho is having a difficult time, and when it is attempted it should be accompanied with Remedyof Havingness. One makes a person spot spots in space for a short time, then remediesHavingness, makes them spot spots in space, then remedies Havingness, then spot spots inspace. These two processes, Remedying Havingness and Spot Spots in Space actually belongtogether, however the preclear eventually emerges up in a higher band where he can spot spotsin space without remedying Havingness.The auditing commands are: “Spot a spot in the space of this room.” When the preclearhas, the auditor says, “Spot another spot,” etc. When the preclear gets well into the process inthis fashion we say, “Spot a spot in the space of this room.” “Walk over to it,” and when hehas, “Put your finger on it.” When he does, “Let go.”The auditor should ask the preclear when he starts this process if the spot has any mass,color, temperature, or any other characteristics, or “How big is it?” The auditor asks this tomake sure that the preclear is actually spotting a spot, a simple location, not a spot that has amass, temperature, or characteristics. A location is simply a location, it does not have mass, itdoes not have color, it does not have any temperature. When we ask the preclear to spot a spotat first his spots are liable to have mass and temperature. We do not object to this, we simplyask him frequently, once we have discovered that his spots do have this, how his spots aregetting along, and we remember, on such a preclear, that we must remedy havingness.Eventually he will move out to a point where he is simply spotting locations.These are the Six Basic Processes that an auditor must know. They are all of them verypowerful processes, and each and any one of them can accomplish the goals which wereenvisioned in “Dianetics:The Modern Science of Mental Health.” The essence of theseprocesses is to do them as given, to do them “purely,” all the while maintaining a two-waycommunication with the preclear. Auditors get into minor variations on this set of processes,but these processes were evolved first in theory by myself, were developed in practice bymyself, and were then given to many auditors to do, and many auditors were trained in them,and then these processes were refined and inspected until they represent a very broadagreement, and we have found that these commands, as you have them here, are the bestcommands which can be used in processing a preclear. The failure of an auditor to duplicate,his unwillingness to duplicate, his upset about duplication in general will quite often lead himup the blind alley of varying a process compulsively or obsessively. When he does he canexpect to lessen the results. Auditing today, by the experience of a very large number ofauditors, is a very severe discipline on the individual. It is not an art, and it never will be an art.It is a precision science. In the old days, all this talk about art and intuition and instinctivenesscost a lot of preclears the benefit of auditing. Auditing in the long ago was tremendouslycomplicated but it was none the less precise. Now that it is very simple it is still very precise.Amongst these processes an understanding of communication lag and OpeningProcedure of 8-C were chose as the two processes to be taught to a very large area which"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"contained a large number of auditors. This area had been noteworthy, heretofore, for thestrange results “obtained” by auditors and the strange techniques which were used in it. Acouple of auditors were sent into this area to teach everybody communication lag and OpeningProcedure of 8-C. Actually these two auditors were originally from this area. They did so, andseveral lives have been reported saved to date, and a great many cases have been salvaged, andthe entire science is looking up in that particular area simply because the area was taughtnothing but communication lag and the Opening Procedure of 8-C and did nothing thereafterbut this. Out in the outskirts of this area a couple of auditors varied Opening Procedure byDuplication and were reported to be having very good luck with the variation, but these twoauditors were not part of the crew who were taught Opening Procedure of 8-C andcommunication lag, and the results they are obtaining are very junior to the results obtained bytheir own fellows very close by.It could be said that the only real danger in auditing was failure. Auditing is the start,change and stop of aberration, or the creation of ability. Today creation of ability takesprominence to a point where aberration drops out of sight and is forgotten. But the auditor whodoes not obtain results is demonstrating to himself that he cannot control human aberration andhuman ability, and a demonstration of his failure to himself is sufficient to make him slightlyincapable in handling his own difficulties. Thus it is a tremendously important thing that wehave processes which, when used exactly as given, and used with skill, produce uniformlygood results on preclears. An auditor using these on preclears gets better, and better, andbetter, and better even when he doesn’t have any auditing himself -- a thing which was not thestory in 1950. When you can control aberration in others, when you can increase the ability ofothers, you certainly do not worry about your own. An auditor who has consistent failures willeventually drop back to self-auditing, but these processes will cure even that. Self-auditing, ofcourse, is the manifestation of going around running concepts or processes on one’s self. Oneis doing this because he has been made afraid, through his failure on others, of his ability tocontrol his own engrams, facsimiles, thoughts and concepts, and he seeks to control themthrough auditing. It is not necessary for an individual to audit himself in order to control hisown machinery.Before anyone should adventure in the direction of testing the “One-Shot-Clear” ordoing anything about exteriorizing the awareness of awareness unit and so making a Clear, heshould be entirely conversant with these processes. Actually, any of these processes run longenough would probably result in an exteriorization. There are faster ways to achieve anexteriorization than these processes, but these processes are preliminary to them. The preclearwho cannot follow the auditor’s orders will not sit there and do a subjective -- which is to say,an out-of-sight, in his own mind -- process without varying it. The trouble with the preclear isthat he cannot duplicate, he cannot follow the orders of the auditor, and when the auditor tellshim to run a concept or a thought, the preclear probably pays token nod to this and runs entirelysomething else. A very close E-Meter review of a number of preclears who were not advancingunder “subjective processes” disclosed that each and every one of them had never run what theauditor told them to run. They were afraid of obeying the auditor, they were afraid of what theauditor was doing, they were afraid of his skill. Opening Procedure of 8-C remedies this fearand brings the inability and unwillingness of the preclear out into the open where it belongs.In Opening Procedure by Duplication we very often get a preclear “blowing thesession” where the auditor has run an insufficient quantity of Opening Procedure of 8-C. Whena preclear “blows the session” on Opening Procedure by Duplication, the auditor has missed.He has not run enough Opening Procedure of 8-C. How much is enough Opening Procedureof 8-C? Until the person is in very good condition as homo sapiens.Remember that whether the command is physical or mental, the auditor must observecommunication lag. In Opening Procedure of 8-C he simply repeats the process command allthe way through, and then again, and again and again and in such a way flattens any lag thatshows up. He does not repeat the command on which the preclear got the lag. It is easier to dothis way, it is a more orderly process when it is done this way. By very close theory, the actualcommand on which the preclear lagged should be repeated again, but this is not done."},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"These are the six basic processes which we must know before we can constituteourselves auditors. These are the processes which are getting results. These are the processeswhich are making able men and able women.These processes can be varied into specific uses where ability is concerned. One of theuses of these, for instance, would be to raise the ability of a pilot to fly a plane, or a person todrive a car, simply by having him approach, touch, and let go of various parts of the object tobe controlled. The exact procedure as given above of Opening Procedure is run, except that theobject to be controlled is used. Typists have learned to type better, people have learned to drivecars better, and many other abilities have been recovered simply by running 8-C. One couldenvision a pianist who was getting tired, run-down, or upset by his music, coming into fullawareness of it once more simply by running 8-C on his instrument or instruments.If we wanted to increase the ability of a salesman, it would only be necessary to run anyof the above processes in their proper position on the tone scale to increase his ability. Abilitiesincrease, in general, when these are run.When does one run what process? One should have a copy of the Chart of HumanEvaluation from “Science of Survival” and know that chart well in order to understand exactlywhere one starts. In general practice, however, an auditor simply starts with two-waycommunication, and when he is getting answers to his questions and is taking rather freely withhis preclear he goes into Elementary Straightwire, and from Elementary Straightwire he goesinto Opening Procedure of 8-C.There is a variation on two-way communication. If you have a difficulty in getting apreclear started in two-way communication it is a very easy thing to get him talking onproblems, and from problems to run this one, “What problem could you be to yourself?”“What problem could you be to others?” running one and then the other each time until thepreclear understood he could be an infinity of problems. Many people are so thoroughly scarceon problems that they will not let any go until they know that they can create problems forthemselves. When a case is stalling, he is generally finding it very hard to give up a petproblem because he knows he can’t have any more. Of course, all this is basically situated onanswers. He can’t have any answers so he has to have problems, then from problems he finallygets to a point where he can’t even have these.Anyone desiring to be a good auditor should follow this chapter very closely, shouldprovide himself with a copy of “The Creation of Human Ability,” and should also procure“Science of Survival” and study them. The best way to become an auditor is to be trained as anauditor. We have found this so much the case that while we offered an examination to anyonewho wished to take it to the grade of Hubbard Certified Auditor, or Hubbard Dianetic Auditor,we never expected them to pass it -- for they never had, even though it was on the most simpleelements as you see before you. There is no substitute for good training."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICEWASHINGTON, D.C.STAFF AUDITORS’ CONFERENCE OF FEBRUARY 16, 1959REGARDING HCO BULLETIN OF FEBRUARY 16, 1959:HGC PROCESSES FOR THOSE TRAINED IN ENGRAM RUNNINGOR TRAINED IN THESE PROCESSESNearly everyone here has been trained in these exact processes and, if anyone here hasn’tbeen trained in these processes, then everything on this Bulletin applies except EngramRunning. The whole bulletin applies except Engram Running.There will be a staff Theta Clearing Course, and those auditors who are on staff whohave not been trained by an ACC in Engram Running will have an opportunity to get thattraining; and not too many months will go by before they are up to this, too. So this will applyat that time. Maybe it will have shifted slightly by that time, but I don’t think very much.Now what you are looking at here is the aggregate know-how that was gained andassembled on the 21st American ACC.UNDERCUTTING CASES:Now the undercuts of cases became a vital necessity. This whole ACC was devoted to theR factor plus Engram Running. It was discovered that the thing that keeps individuals fromrunning engrams adequately was their R factor, and when their R factor was very poor theycould not run an engram adequately. Now the funny part of it is that an engram can becontacted and run and, if done persistently and well without ARC breaks, can run the followingScale of Confront. Here is the Scale of Confront, just to refresh your minds:DUB-IN: Lowest scale. This scale could possibly invert, and down below that youmight have a black dub-in. Once you had run blackness, you would find adub-in case. But the scale we are mostly interested in, because that is the onewe most commonly see, begins at the bottom with dub-in, runs up, turnsBLACK. Runs through blackness, turnsINVISIBLE. Runs from invisible toELSEWHERE—a desire to be elsewhere. The way they solve things is elsewhereness.Runs up from elsewhereness toABILITY TO CONFRONT. Runs from confront toEXPERIENCE or PARTICIPATE. And only then are you up toBEINGNESS.Now this is the Confront Scale, and it is the scale of disintegrating Reality. It is how aperson handles terminals or a situation. A person handles terminals and situations above all thisby not having to participate, by not having to confront, finding no necessity to do anythingabout it unless he chooses so on his own determination; and if he did so, could do so with nopersonal liability. He could experience or not as the case may be. Now you’ll find a lowerharmonic on this in some philosophic level of somebody saying, “Yap, yap, well, I could, or Icouldn’t, and that’s my choice,” etc, well, he hasn’t got any power of choice. He’s just usingthis as the final escape mechanism—a philosophic escape mechanism.If I said “bottom”—the bottom mechanism—it would be the one most commonlycontacted. But you are apt to get a mechanism which is philosophic, which is simply a figure-figure mechanism about a situation, and the individual feels that if he could just figure it out hewould be all right. In other words, this is a thought-thinkingness figure-figure, and he not-ises"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"by figure-figure. Such a case, not-ising by figure-figure, will turn into a dub-in case as soon asyou start curing his figure-figure; would turn into a black case; would turn into an invisiblecase; would turn into a confront case; would turn into an experience case. Which is quiteinteresting.Now it is true that an engram could be found, started, and, if the auditor were good andheld the individual right on the time period and had the time period well spotted, and had theovert and motivator, no matter how crazy they seemed or sounded, contacted, he couldtheoretically, just by running that engram, run a person through the totality of this RealityScale. See? So there’s another approach here. You get a guy who is figure-figure, find theengram necessary to resolve the case. First he figure-figures about it, and he’ll run it, and run itjust with the auditing commands—the five auditing commands to run an engram—he figure-figures about it, then after a while he dubs-in about it, then after a while it all goes black; andthen after a while it eases into an invisibility—it’s just not there—somatics are, and discomfortand other things are, but it’s not there—and its not-thereness suddenly turns into little flicks—little flicks of confront. And boy, he goes elsewhere. It just starts to turn on and he gets it forthe least little Flick and he goes elsewhere. And then pretty soon he can confront the thing; thenpretty soon he can participate—he can run it in valence, squarely in valence, right in its momentof time, at which time it becomes pretty damn real. And then he goes to being able to put itthere or not put it there, and its importance-unimportance factor flattens out so that it’s neitherimportant nor unimportant. And that engram is licked.Theoretically, this could happen. That is actually the way I run engrams. But you willfind in auditing in the HGC that the public expects of you a different thing than is expected ofyou by students. And that’s why I wanted to talk to you for a few minutes. They expect adifferent thing. They expect you to be interested in their case. And that is quite amusing—because it’s your job to get them interested in their case. But they want you to be interested intheir case. A11 right, any case is interesting, so that’s a pretty easy one. But you can get sointerested in their case that you do a lot of talking to them and burn up an awful lot of auditingtime. So there is some point where your interest becomes an indulgence, and on the happierside of that, where the pc is pleased you’re interested in his case, and that’s enough. Then youget him interested in his case.All right. Now, we have for a long time not used PT problems. I’ll tell you why verybluntly. It was not unusual for an auditor to burn up twelve and a half hours on a PT problem.It was not unusual. He did this with two motives: one just yak, letting the pc go on and on,poor control, not controlling the pc’s comm outflow, letting the pc get into non-essentials. Andthe other side of it: he was trying to run the whole case with the PT problem. Well,wonderful—you can run a whole case with a PT problem—but why? Since it’s slow freight.That’s a very slow way to go about it. So we take a PT problem now and handle the session inthis fashion:We establish the rudiments every time we establish a session. Find the auditor, find thepc, find the auditing room, establish a goal for the session. Do that rapidly. We don’t care whatgoal it is, so long as he has some kind of a goal. And then we ask for a PT problem. And wetake an E-Meter (up to that time we didn’t care whether the pc was handling the cans or not) butwe take an E-Meter, and we have this PT problem appear on the E-Meter, or we don’t run it.Got it? And we run the PT problem that appears on the E-Meter. So we get him to state thisproblem, and we don’t care how he states the problem, because all we want to know is “Did itdrop?” That tells you at once you won’t run a PT problem on a stage-4 needle. Didn’t drop-see,that’s all within the requirements—it didn’t drop, so skip it. It isn’t going to be real to the pcanyhow. You’ll have to do something else with this case. He’s probably got thousands ofproblems; probably all of life is a problem. Probably every time he walks in a room he installsan engram. You know, the furniture’s there—that’s an engram. Get the idea? So why worryabout a problem?But if you got a PT problem that drops, you should remove yourself at that moment fromall temptation. As soon as the problem drops, and as soon as he states that it is a problem to"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"him and is worrying him in present time, you take the cans away from him and put the thingaside. Just lay the E-Meter aside. You’re not interested in an E-Meter from there on. The reasonwhy is because you’ll increase the drop, you’ll increase more drop and more drop as you askhim about it. You’re already running it. And the problem is going to change. You have seenthis phenomenon. You’re not interested in a problem changing. The fact of your laying asidethe E-Meter will rather convince him that you have found it and that’s it. And you only want toknow this: the personnel associated with that problem. You don’t want to know more about theproblem. You just want to know the personnel associated with that problem. His wife, hismother, and his wife’s boy friend, or something of that sort. And that’s the personnelassociated with the problem. You just check that off.Now, I’m going to ask you to take a notebook and a ball-point into the auditing room,because you’ve got two or three things to do here that require a list. I want you to getaccustomed to establishing a list and then flattening it, not trying to run the case all over newagain every time the case changes. That’s one of the ways to waste time. You run one terminal,and of course the case changes, the problems change, everything changes on the case. If youre-assessed it at this time to find a new terminal, you’d for sure find new terminals. Well, thedevil with it. Let’s just flatten what we contact, and when we’re contacting and scouting andusing cans and the E-Meter, just write down what we find. Then put the E-Meter aside and runwhat we’ve found until we get rid of all of that. Now you’re going to do something new—givehim back the E-Meter cans. Got the idea?Pcs don’t much like to hold onto these E-Meter cans forever. Furthermore, they becomerestive, and they want to scratch their heads, and they want to do this, and they want to rasslearound, and most pcs you get are slightly nervous in this direction. Why should you worryabout it? Because the E-Meter is only going to give you a certain amount of the information thatis quite valid. Now, you’re going to write down the personnel connected with this PT problem.You’re going to take SELECTED PERSON OVERT-WITHHOLD on each one of thesepeople. And the commands for this are right here:“Think of something you have done to ( ),” and“Think of something you have withheld from ( ).”And you are going to run one of those commands and the next command, and then thenext command—first command again, then the second command, first command, secondcommand. In that way, you’ll never lay an egg on an unbalanced flow. No flow will unbalanceon you. They’ll always stay there more or less stable. The case won’t suddenly turn blackwhen it’s not supposed to turn black, and so forth. You won’t ever over-run a flow and the pcwill never get upset.Now, let’s look at this again. You have written down “wife”, “his mother”, and “hiswife’s boy friend”. Which one do you run first? You have to ask this question to establish thatterminal: “Which one of these things do you think is the most real to you?” The individual says,“Oh, Mother, of course.” Who cares? That’s what he says. All right, so that’s the first one youtake. Then you take the two remaining ones: “Which one is most real?” That’s the one youknock out. That leaves you one more person. Knock that one out.Now, there is something that is not stated here. I just typed this up rapidly for you—Ididn’t have a backing sheet, so there are typographicals because I couldn’t even see what I wastyping. This has a criterion, and it is an old criterion of all PT problems—it is, they are PTproblems. By definition, a PT problem must exist right now in the physical universe. Bydefinition. So therefore, the personnel involved in a PT problem must exist right now in thephysical universe. He will tell you halfway through the run, that “It was actually my motherwho influenced me this way”—ah skip it. That’s not a PT personnel in that problem. Hismother isn’t really part of, let us say—it was her mother that was part of the PT problem. Inother words, the people have to be actually associated with the problem and existing at this timein this pc’s life influencing that problem, for this to be a PT problem. So therefore, we don’tdive in any direction to pick up any new personnel we don’t care about."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"We get this problem flat. It is only flat if it answers this question: “Now, what do youhave to do about that problem now?” And the pc says, “Nothing.” It’s flat. For our purposes,it’s flat. The only reason we’re running it is we’re trying to get rid of the obsession he has tojump out of the auditing room and go do something about this problem. If he doesn’t have todo anything about it, it’s flat. But if he says, “Oh, it’s flat, because I could go and talk to mywife’s boy friend now, and I could handle him.” No. Start right back over from thebeginning—the first person you wrote down—and run that person again for a short time—nextperson for a short time—next person for a short time—on these exact auditing questions.“Now, what do you have to do about the problem?” He’ll tell you, “Well, I don’t have to doanything about it just now.” That’s enough. You consider that flat. Got it?All right. This will keep you out of all kinds of trouble. And it will keep the pc frombeing all hung up in trying to go elsewhere in an auditing session. So much for that.This is done at the beginning of every session. That first section there—it says,“STARTING A CASE: AND BEGIN EVERY SESSION”. Well, you not only start eachintensive with this, but you start every session with this, and you do the same thing.If it takes you two hours to flatten the PT problem, I will think something is hung up.This is a rapid one. This is not a slow one. If it takes a couple of hours, well, something’sreally haywire here. He didn’t say the problem, or he didn’t do something, or he’s holdingsomething back. But notice we have said, “Think of something you have done to” and “Thinkof something you have withheld from”. This will also get the pc talking to you, because it getsrid of the withhold. Got that? All right. So much for that.Now, DYNAMIC STRAIGHT WIRE you were taught in the 21st American, but thecommands for the general public were not given to you. And they are given to you here on thissheet, this HCO Bulletin. Now, the only thing you are looking for is a represented substitute.In other words, you’re looking for substitutes. You ask him for a substitute for himself, andyou ask him for a substitute on the basis of “Tell me something that would represent yourself.”And he says, “Represent myself? Oh, that’s very, very easy—a tree.” Get your ball-point busyat that point and put down “tree”. Got it? Now, if he even says “toothbrush”, get your ball-point busy. The proper answer, of course, is “Myself”. It’s just as simple as that. But the morea case is daffy on this line, the more attention you’re going to pay to it. So you just run thiswhole assessment right straight on through: Self, sex, family, children, groups, mankind, theanimal kingdom, birds, beasts, fish, vegetables, trees, growing things, matter, energy, space,time, spirits, souls, gods, God. Just one question. Each time you say this you just take one ofthose: “Tell me something that would represent, for instance, souls.” The individual says,“Running water.” Get the ball-point busy. Write it down. When you have got this whole listassessed, take the list you have written and run:“Think of something you have done to (a toothbrush).”“Think of something you have withheld from (a toothbrush).”You’ll be amazed, but they have actually done something to a toothbrush, and they haveactually withheld something from a toothbrush. This is pretty terrific. Quite amazing. But youare only looking for daffiness on this, and a sensible answer you don’t pay much attention to.You say, “Tell me something that would represent trees.” And the fellow says, “Leaves.”Now, there’s a matter of judgment involved here. What if he said, “Shadows”? Well, I don’tknow. That’s a matter of judgment. Try to run it or not try to run it, as the case may be. If itlooks daffy to you, run it. You’re the judge. Got the idea?Now don’t let it look daffy to you when you say, “Tell me something that wouldrepresent spirits,” and he says, “Souls.” When you say “souls”, he says “spirits”. That’s notdaffy.But how about this guy that gives you the perfect representation all the way down the linelike a little wound-up doll? You already, in looking him over, find out he has a sticky needle,he’s registering at 6 on your E-Meter when you first put the cans in his hands, and he gives"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"you all the answers perfectly. That case is giving you an intellectual response which hasnothing to do with any reality under the sun, moon or stars. Something he read in a book and amachine is rattling it off. So you do the assessment again. The second time you go throughyou’re liable to trip him on something. Got the idea? So, if you get a perfect assessment, run itagain. I actually don’t care how many times you run it, but you’re apt to be wasting time,because by two-way comm and definition alone you may not get anywhere with a very badlymachined case. Nevertheless, a couple of times through, he should trip somewhere. Machinecase generally does.The rule governing Dynamic Straight Wire is: That which doesn’t fall out by two-waycomm just on assessment. He says it, and then it looks funny to him, and he laughs, and hethinks this is for the birds, and he says, “Oh, no, that wouldn’t be one-actually, a substitute fora tree would be a leaf, or a small tree,” or something like this. That’s fine. Nothing wrong withletting him correct himself, because you are actually auditing him just by asking him thequestion. People, when they straighten out things in their own categories, very often recoververy, very easily.All right. Let’s take up this next one here. That’s an easy way to run Dynamic StraightWire, isn’t it, huh? I would ask you to do this, however, in view of the fact that you are doinga professional job of auditing for the public mainly, and that is, I’d ask you to memorize thatlist—rather than hold a bulletin in your hand and read it.Now, the next thing we’re going to run into here is PAST AND FUTUREEXPERIENCE. This is a bid for two things: One, the lowest level case there is—becauseexperience, to him, is a dub-in, usually. Or it’s a figure-figure, or it’s something, so itcompares to the Reality Scale. His definition of experience compares with the Reality Scale.His definition of experience is a direct index to the Reality Scale, by the way. What doesexperience mean? He’ll say, “Experience—that’s very easy. To consider.” There you’ve gotyour figure-figure level. “What does experience mean?” Well, “To write about it or makesomething out of it—experience is that thing which you use to manufacture the future.” He’sdub. “Now, what is an experience?” “Well, experience is that which you try not to have.”That’s probably black or invisible. Or, “It’s the thing you forget,” would be blackness.“Experience is something you try to forget”— invisibility level. “Experience is something youhave to cope with.” Obsessive confront. “Experience is—ah—well, experience—that’s prettyhard to define—experience. I guess it’s to go through something.” You’re getting a fairly saneresponse—to go through something. To have an actual adventure, something of this sort.You’re getting a fairly sane reaction to experience.So don’t think that Past and Future Experience is pegging up at the highest level of theReality Scale. It isn’t. This process was found, in the 21st American, to be the undercutprocess. This was the lowest undercut process. And this is a killer, and it is very trying to anauditor. A very trying process, because it offers so many wonderful temptations. And that’swhat’s wrong with this process.Now, you run these two questions, one after the other, with no assessment, no E-Meter,nothing. You just put the E-Meter down after you’ve done the Dynamic Straight Wire thing,because on Dynamic Straight Wire, when you said, “Children,” the needle was going on agradual shift over here, and a little theta bop now and then. You said, “Children,” and it fell adial, or all of a sudden started doing a big theta bop in the middle. When you got off ofchildren, it settled down to the other pattern. That told you that you had something to be run onthe subject of children. That he will also, at the same time, give you a daffy reading, he will tellyou some daffy terminal to represent—so you needed the E-Meter there. But you don’t needthe E-Meter on Past and Future Experience, not even vaguely. You can just put the E-Meteraside and turn it off, and just run these two commands. Just clear them with the pc verybluntly. Say, “We’re going to run something about experience. Now, we’re going to see howyou get along with this little process, and here are the commands of it: What part of your lifewould you be willing to re-experience? And the other command is: What part of the future"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"would you be willing to experience? Now, here’s the first command: What part of your lifewould you be willing to re-experience?”The answer actually called for is a time, isn’t it? And this is a time process. But there arevery few preclears that will find this out for a very long period. They won’t give you anythingbut super-significances and ball-up, and the pc who is real bad off will give you a type ofexperience. You accept all these things. You say, “What part of your life would you be willingto re-experience?” He says, “Well, eating cake.” That’s an answer? That’s an answer. Andthat’s followed with this: “What part of the future would you be willing to experience?” Hesays, “Well, more cake.” That’s an answer. So you just accept any answer that he gives you onthe line. It gradually will boil down to a time answer. And it will gradually go back-track. Thelonger you run it, the more track you’re going to cover, the more future you’re going to cover.And there will be periods when the individual is absolutely sure that he is totally predicting thefuture. He gets into implants, let us say, that tell him what the future is all about. He’s stuck8000 years ago, but he’s telling you about the future. All kinds of odd phenomena show up.But engrams come up and slap you in the teeth, one right after the other.You run this for a while, and the individual says, “OOOh, well, you know I reallywouldn’t be willing—well, I would be willing—I don’t know—I would—oohh, well—I reallydon’t know—dental operation there, I was a young boy—I don’t know if I’d like to re-experience that—I guess I could re-experience sitting in the—no, no, no. I could re-experience—I could re-experience the next day after it.” You say, “That’s fine,” and just markit down with the ball-point: “Dental experience as a child.” That one he can’t confront. Now,you’re never going to run it as an engram, but you’re going to have some tag of it as anengram. See, it may show you something.As you go along and he runs into hot experiences, real, real hot experiences one rightafter the other, it is about time you put the E-Meter back in his paws. Get the idea? You don’thave to start it with the E-Meter, but if he starts running into hot experiences, or if he gets intoan engram and he can’t seem to get out of the thing, the thing to do is not run the engram butgive him an E-Meter and spot it in time for him. Get it spotted in time. If he’s running into themhot and heavy, one right after the other, just leave him with the E-Meter. But if there is onlyone you have to spot in time, and then in a little while he doesn’t seem to be running any more,take the cans away from him again and put the E-Meter aside. But if he starts running into onethat obsessively sticks with him, don’t let him flounder in the thing for an hour. Don’t let himwallow in this one. Because he will just wallow in it, and this is no process-this is not a goodprocess to run an engram with. So you let him out, OK? And the way you let him out is tolocate it in time with an E-Meter. And you go on running the process. Now, as I say, it offersenormous temptations to the auditor—beautiful temptations to run the things contacted. As yousit this out, you actually are going to change the characteristic of the engram you will ultimatelyrun on the case. But you keep listing engrams that he runs into. Keep listing engrams that heruns into, well knowing that he will favor motivators. For every one of those motivators thereis an overt. Now an engram that he consistently and persistently keeps hitting and hitting andhitting, you are going to find in that engram probably the engram you will run, eventually. Butnot until he is in PT, out of the engram, it seems to have dropped out, and so forth, and heseems to be all smooth on this thing, are you going to reach for that one again. You are goingto flatten the process and then go to the engram.Here we go. ENGRAM RUNNING. Of course, that is run all the way through with anE-Meter. Give him the cans and start out on this engram that you more or less found with Pastand Future Experience.Now, this is going to undercut cases, and I don’t care how long you run it. I don’t care ifyou run it for two weeks, because this is a very productive process. But if you are going to runit over that period of time, it isn’t noted here, but some THIRD RAIL had better be brought inhere some place. And he’d better be shifted up finally until havingness. And you put in PASTAND FUTURE EXPERIENCE, right after that line, “COMBINE WITH THIRD RAIL IF"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"RUN MORE THAN 8 HOURS”. If you run it eight hours, this guy’s havingness is going tostart dropping on him, and you are going to run into difficulties. You could get into difficulties.All right.ENGRAM RUNNING. Well, Engram Running, when the case has been prepared thisway, becomes very simple. A case will start running like a little typewriter, if you have got thisPast and Future Experience pretty flat.Once you have picked an engram, make sure you get its motivator not only its overt. Ifyou have got an overt, get the motivator. If you have got the motivator, get the overt. And onlywhen you have got that have you got an incident. Now, an engram that is having one side ofthe overt or motivator run will get sticky. You have got to find the other side, and you have gotto get both of these things in date. Normally, this will start showing up on Past and FutureExperience. Well, we are going to run this engram with an E-Meter, we are going to considerthat we have an incident when we have got both a motivator and an overt that fit together. Andif the thing is just awful sticky, and dubby, and shockingly poor, and a lot of other things, youjust started running it too fast, that is all.We have got several things you can do at this state of the case, and so forth. Probably thebest of them is go back to running Past and Future Experience. You didn’t flatten it.Now, here is this Engram Running. If you notice here, it says you run all the commandsthat run an engram twice. Run them all twice. That’s because “Find something unimportant inthat incident” is going to stir up stuff that newly has to be confronted.Once you have chosen an engram and you have begun to run it, you have had it. That’sit. That’s the engram you are going to run. So it has to be chosen with considerable care. Listento me now: If you re-assess the case after you have started an engram, you will get almost anyother incident that is hot to drop more than the engram you started, because most of the chargeis already dissipated. So if you keep re-assessing a case, thinking another engram would bebetter to run for the case, you are of course always going to find another engram. You willnever find the one you started to run again dropping with as much velocity. You see? That’ssomething you have to keep in mind. If you are going to run an engram, that’s the engram youare going to run. It’s got to have its overt or motivator; suppose you are running the overt sideof it, you have got to have the motivator side of it. So you really haven’t got an incident untilyou have got both of these things located. And once you have started to run that, you have hadit. Because it will discharge its charge and won’t register on a meter any more the way someother incident will.You can get a case just stirred all up and run all backwards and upside down, and that’sthe biggest mistake an auditor can make. I have given you the reason for the mistake-becausenow almost anything will drop better than the one you partially flattened.If in doubt, run the engram you were running. If you are not getting rapid recovery, goback to the first engram you ran and considered flat and run it again. Sometimes, it will onlytake you fifteen minutes to run all five commands. You do it very fast. But very oftensomething happened that it re-charged in some fashion. Very peculiar.If you leave about a third of an engram missing and unflat, the whole engram has atendency to charge up again. It is kind of funny. But you have got to flatten the engram youcontacted.Now the rule of the Last Largest Object is the only one I want you to pay any attention toin questioning the pc. Pc apparently is getting out of it. Change your auditing command. Youare running, “What part of that incident can you confront?” He says, “Well, I don’t know, it’spretty unreal to me, I don’t know whether this happened or not.” What was the last largestobject? If he said anything that was offbeat and showed an unwillingness to run any more of"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"the engram, you want to find out at once what was the last largest object that you contacted inthere. And he says, “A house.” You are going to shift your auditing command now to: “Whatpart of that house can you confront?” And you are going to run that simply until he is back inthe incident, and then you are going to go off on to “What part of that incident can youconfront?” Doesn’t require any vast bridge. You just tell him you are going to shift.In that way, using that rule, you can actually pick up an engram where he was running asAbraham Lincoln, and in the engram he was shot in Ford’s Theatre—you know—and the dateis obviously correct. Dropped and everything. And then he runs John Wilkes Booth—no, hewasn’t Lincoln, he was John Wilkes Booth. And so help me God, you may find that he wasthe Secret Service Agent who had a couple of drinks that night and wasn’t watching. You don’tcare whether he runs it dub or not. Don’t give up because he’s running it wrong, because it’llcome out right.There was a joke on us in the 21st American. We had our paws on Bowie. He was JimBowie. And of course everybody doubted this, because it is a famous historical figure. Andthey tried to do everything under the sun to shake him out of this engram, and they finally wentback to running it, and it was the one that flattened out. The trouble was, he had dub on it,which made Bowie die the wrong kind of a death under wrong circumstances. But as he ran it,the more he ran it, the more he ran it, the more right the circumstances got. And it finally allcame out in the wash. He did run the death of Jim Bowie.Historical figures, however, are usually the yo-yo point used. The guy went out of hisown body at the death; there was some current historical figure; he said, “That is the identitynecessary to resolve this incident. That identity could handle it. So I will just be Catherine theGreat.” And he goes and runs Catherine the Great. The only mistake is to let him escape out ofthe time period. Maybe he did yo-yo right into the palace, maybe he did go right through herskull. But the right engram will shake out, because the Reality Scale is run by running anengram.Theoretically, you could clear a person just by running one engram well enough. Sonever get off onto quantitative engrams. An engram is merely something for him to get used toconfronting, and creating, and mocking up, and so forth. It’s just a playing field you are using.The significance, the amount of change he gets in his life, none of these things have anything todo with it at all. It is just how well he can handle a mental image picture, and you have chosen ahoney for him to handle. That is about all it amounts to. And when he finds out he can handlethis thing from A to Izzard and beginning to end, and he can do it well, then the next engram toresolve the case will run quite rapidly. And you will run on down and finally run his basic,earliest shift of identity, which is the rock. And formerly he said, “There is a beautiful, clearsphere—that’s the rock. And that’s all the rock.” Oh, heck. When you get several engrams runand get the rock as one of the engrams, you find out this beautiful, clear sphere was somethinghe customarily clamped around thetans as a trap, and they sometimes clamped it around him,and there were raiding parties, and there was all kinds of personnel and there is drama and thereis strain, and there is scenery and everything else. When you contacted the rock first and ranthe rock first, he was insufficiently able to contact things. The date when he was mocking upthis thing, he was so capable of mocking up that later on this poor, little, weak ole thetan, yearsand years and centuries and so forth afterwards going back to mock up this rock—uh-uh— it’stoo beefy. That’s too much engram for him to confront first off.So you choose the engrams—it doesn’t much matter what you choose. You will find thatevery sexual incident you contact is a bounce from a death. A little rule for you. So don’t let mecatch anybody in the HGC running prenatals, birth, conception, because that is a bounce.Those are all tied in with the death, and the death is the engram which is necessary to resolvethe case. So you keep running Past and Future Experience until you get them down to that—OK? Leave the second dynamic incidents severely alone.Now it can be that he died, and he died is followed by a conception sequence, and hegoes back to the old body to see if it is still decently buried—you know—and then he can’t find"},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"the person that he thought he was going to be, get the next body from, and he gets allconfused. And mess-ups of this character can occur. But keep him on the incident. Is this partof the text? When you finish a death and go through the exteriorization sequence, right at theend of it there is a conception or a prenatal or a birth. They quite ordinarily bounce into it, andyou don’t want it. You want nothing to do with it. So you stop him when you have got all ofthe exteriorization run.There is a lot to know about engrams. You have been taught all this, but I am justshowing you what you can do to win in the HGC with Engram Running. This would be agood, clean job then.Every time you run an engram, now is the time to use some Not-Is Straight Wire, with itsordinary commands which you know. They are:“Recall something that you implied was unimportant.” “Recall something somebody elsethought was important.”Don’t ever let a pc run it in reverse, because it discharges havingness in about fivecommands. That is real rough the other way, too.All right. Now there we have a rundown that will get engrams run, that will get ordinary,run-of-the-mill cases squared around, and that will get a lot done. But what about people whowere not through the American 21st? And during that period of time up until they start in with aTheta Clearing Course, to run actual engrams on pcs, how about these people? Well, you haveSelected Person Overts, with the “withhold” command added, and you will have a new bulletinout on these things, and so forth. We want that auditing to be relatively muzzled. It will winand everything will go along just dandy. But if you have got some case (and this is more forD.O.P.s than anything else)—if you have got some case that was awfully hard to start, verylow random profile, you’d better turn it over to a graduate of the 21st American. And if youhave got some case that, after he ran along for a while and was getting up to a point where he’djust run engrams beautifully, and the whole track’s opening up, everything is going along justdandy, and it is certain that the engram necessary to resolve the case is just waiting, give him anauditor that can run it.In other words, you can run an HGC this way: You can get some auditors that set pcs upto run engrams. You got the idea? And then you can have some auditors that run engrams. Thisis not any real violation of the Auditor’s Code, because that will still give him the bestprocesses and the best treatment for the pc that can be given.Now there is no reason why, particularly after a staff Theta Clearing Course, thateverybody can’t run a regimen of this sort. But running it in the HGC, with all the profilesbeing submitted to me and all the Case Analysis Reports—the Case Analysis Reports now aremore vital than profiles, because R changed on a case does not necessarily change the profile atall. You should know about that. You can change the R of the case without changing theprofile. The person answered the same questions, only he answered them with Reality. This isquite remarkable. We need a brand new test. That test is in development right at this moment. Itis a confront test, and that test will be coming up, but there is no reason to rush it, particularly.Let’s just do it by Case Analysis.I will get out a Bulletin that will take care of auditors who were not trained to runengrams, what they will run. But you already have data and material on this, and it is just asbefore, what you have been running.Now, to start a case out with NOT-IS STRAIGHT WIRE is adventurous. That’s anadventurous thing to do. That’s a rough thing to do. We learned a great many things in the 21stAmerican ACC. Learned a great many things, and that was one of them. Selected PersonsOvert-Withhold is very, very superior in undercutting cases to Selected Persons Overts. Theonly main change we have got is that we run Selected Person Overt-Withhold commands, just"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"as it is given here in PT problem. That is a wonderful thing to do with a case, as long as theterminal is real to the pc. And there is no real reason that running a Scientologist, who knowswhat the command is, why ARC Break Straight Wire cannot be run on a person by an auditorwho has not been through an Engram Running Course. That’s a beautiful process.I want to tell you something else. Can I tell you something here? A lot of research wasdone in the 21st American ACC, and students didn’t see me as much as they thought theyshould, I suppose, but I was around. And I never saw so many flips and changes and vagariesin my life as I saw in that particular unit. The reports which I got were very—very helpful tome—very, very helpful to Scientology at large. There was a great deal done in that course. Ispent about three weeks of the course—did very rapid research just in catching up with some ofthese undercuts. Because, let me assure you, the R factor in most of the cases you approach isso low that it poses a problem of running greater than we had ever imagined. Therefore, theseare the processes that we are handing out.Now, these are a Not-Is type of process. Dynamic Straight Wire runs a straightidentification, but the rest of these things are Not-Is types of processes. To cure somebodyfrom not-ising. When a person can confront something, he no longer has to not-is it.But there was a funny command came up along the line, that I don’t fully understand yet,but it takes care of a theta body. Now this is part of the research that was never given to the21st American. And this is a peculiar darned thing. You can write it down on the back of thisBulletin, if you want to.It is:“Recall a time when you thought something bad was unimportant.”And that is just about the wildest thing you ever saw. Now that runs all by itself but canbe combined with:“Recall a time somebody else thought something bad was important.”And you will run all the newspapers off the case. The second command there is really notessential, but you just run this first command repetitively, and if it seems to run down orsomething bad happens, flip over to the other command. But you will as-is a theta body.This is the doggondest thing you ever saw. It is a perfectly wild pitch. I was just addingup all possible combinations and working in all possible directions, and this one fell out of thehamper, and it doesn’t integrate too well with the rest of your data. But this is the goofy one.Now, something else came up in the 21st American that I should tell you in the HGC,and that is: After nine years, we have found out WHY. We had nine years of HOW, and nowin the ninth year we find out why. Why people are aberrated. Why they are sick. Why they actthe way they do. Why individuation takes place. And that is all wrapped up with WITHHOLD.I had withhold earlier, but didn’t shake it all out of the hamper, because I didn’t have the overtsto go with it. We find out that an individual gets sick by having the overt impulse to makesomebody else sick and then withholds it, because it is less social to give people illnesses. Sohe gets them himself. This is Freudian transference, it is a whole number of things. So whenyou run these overts, run the withhold with it and the case will start finding out why.The theta body thing, and the masses and ridges, why, they run out when you ask aperson to recall a time when he thought something bad was unimportant, or recall—well, that isthe best command—recall a time when he thought something bad was unimportant. When yourun this, you evidently run the center pin of the withhold. But you will get his tolerance. Andthis is the first straight ethical process, evidently, we have. It raises a person’s ethics. It as-isesa theta body. It takes demon bodies and things like that off cases. I tested it two or three times"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"here, just monkeying around with this thing, and it is one of the wilder ones. This is a wildpitch, that particular process.So you could say that when a field doesn’t immediately disintegrate, when you can’t getan individual easily in the engram, when the field stays persistently black or something likethat, you have got another string to your bow, and I don’t care if you use it. But if you do useit, know this: It runs as an automaticity on such a demon case. He runs br-r-r-r-t—the last twothousand years he has been not-ising and saying it was unimportant that something was bad.And he will start coming up with, “Well, I should do something—no, I shouldn’t dosomething—well, what is this? I should do something about it. I shouldn’t do something aboutit. I have been very neglectful, but that really isn’t bad. Not really. Somebody dying from thebullet wound I gave ‘em—that really isn’t bad. But—” And he is stuck right with theconsideration on all of his overts—consequences of overts. They all must be unimportant. Andit reduces his ethical level. But I have now seen two demon bodies disintegrate just with thatone command just disintegrate—and this is the first time we ever had something that woulddisintegrate the astral body. So we find out at once that the astral body was an aberration. Itisn’t a necessary thing to make a thetan stick in the head at all.All right. Now I wanted to give you this rundown, because today you were having a littlebit of a rough time doing a transition from student to pro auditor, and I wanted to talk to you,even though it burned up some of your valuable time and mine. And ask you to sic sempertransit, huh?Now are there any questions? Yes, Jean.Q. I have two questions. In running of the engram, do you ignore what they wererunning in the ACC, or do you just go back and run them? My preclear has had severalengrams started.A. Now, if we look over this carefully, we see in running an incident: Find the engramnecessary to resolve the case. Once you have chosen it and have begun to run it, be sure youhave the motivator and the overt and then do not, do not, do not, do not, depart from thatincident to run another that “drops better” or comes up. Now look here. The engrams that wererun on them in the course are no longer going to fall. And an engram is not going to show onan E-Meter. And if there were several engrams run on somebody in the course, and the firstone wasn’t flattened, then whoever audited them ought to be hit in the head with a sledge-hammer. There’s only one or two cases that got by with this, that I have checked up on so far,and it is about the most serious blunder that could be made. Now, what you do in a case that’shad an engram already started is get a lie reaction check—that’s all you want—of some sort oranother, concerning this particular thing. You can put him on the E-Meter and ask him if it wasrun, and so forth, and ask him which one was the first one run. You could possibly get anocclusion, but usually the pc will tell you. There’s no particular reason to doubt the pc. Get thefirst one, and get that one flat, and then you have no choice but to pick up the next one andflatten that one.This applies without regard to how many auditors were on the case. This also, you willfind out, will sometimes apply to somebody who had an engram audited in 1950. The onlytrouble with a 1950 engram is that it is probably an operation in the current lifetime, or aprenatal in the current lifetime, and it was the wrong engram necessary to resolve the case, andyou won’t get very far running the thing. And we have no data at this time, whether it’s best topick that one up and run it or not. But I would say for sure that an engram that should havebeen run to resolve the case, such as a past death, if that was ever entered in all of those years,including 1950—it may no longer drop on the E-Meter, because some of its charge is gone.That is the engram necessary to resolve the case.Yes, got another one?"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"Q. Yes. The Dynamic Straight Wire—do you keep running this until you have picked upall the daffy terminals, then go through it several times and get the daffy ones each time?A. If you get a daffy one, if you get several daffy ones, you take those you got on thefirst run and run them. Don’t bother to go through again, because it will have straightened out.Enough will have straightened out to admit progress of the case. But if you don’t get any daffyones through once, then run it again. Any other questions? Dale.Dale: I just had a comment on that. One 1950 engram, in which the auditor blew sessionbecause it was whole track, was the engram necessary to resolve the case and finally showedup. The guy had been black since 1950.A. Good. Picked it up and flattened it. Well, that’s a good job. That tells you that a blackcase, then, doesn’t necessarily require five or six weeks of preparation before you run anengram. You pick up an engram as early as you can on a case and charge through. But itdoesn’t get you around starting a case. You have always got to start a case or start a session.Yes?Q. On this re-experience process, do I run it until I get 3-D pictures, and track?A. Yes. Oh, 3-D pictures and back in PT. Back in PT. I’ll give you an example of one ofthese. Here’s the pc. He is sitting in a terror charge, in a total black freeze, at 1500 AD. Onesecond later, everything went to hell. One second before, everything had gone to hell. And he’ssitting in this split second, at a rest point. Got it? Well, now, what do you think happens whenyou start asking him about future and past, alternately? He’ll move right off that rest point,won’t he? So this is an explosive, doggoned process. Now, I say you run it until he gets toPT. Some time or other you might find it impossible to get him to PT on the process. You justmight. But the experience that has been had with it so far is that it does eventually move him toPT. Now is the time to take him back, at the auditor’s discretion, and have him run that incidentin which he was stuck.By the way, “What part of PT are you willing to experience?” has on several casesexposed the engram necessary to resolve the case. It is the engram he’s sitting in, and it is theone necessary to resolve the case. Yes?Q. If you leave a process very unflat one afternoon, and come back in the morning andstart questioning the guy, and you pick up first of all present time problems. Now supposingthat process is the basic of his present time problem of the morning. Are he and you theterminals, the preclear and auditor the two terminals?A. Yes.Q. Do you run it that way?A. Oh, well, if he got a lot of ARC breaks, it would be a good thing to run it this way.That would clean up all the ARC breaks, wouldn’t it?Now I am going to give you that again on ARC breaks. This is the hottest one to runARC breaks on. Just pick up the auditor and pick up the pc, as the two people involved in thepresent time problem. I am glad you brought that up, Joe.This idea of throwing him back into session after you have ended a session the day beforeis another point of judgment. Just how do you smoothly get him into it? Usually he has piledup something on top of the engram. There is a process here, which is not really a very goodprocess, but which kicks them out, and it was not given in this ACC. That is Problems ofComparable Magnitude to that Engram, or that Incident. It will actually de-intensify an engram.You should have that as a little panacea."},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"That is an interesting one to wind up an intensive on. About noon of the last day you allof a sudden realize, “Boy, this man isn’t going to make it.” And you could run a problem ofcomparable magnitude to that engram and get it keyed out. However, you are better than that,and you will have had it flat by the last day of the last intensive he has, that’s for sure. Anyother questions? Don?Q. Is “recall something” preferred over “recall a time”? I have heard “Recall a time youdid something to somebody,” and also “Recall something you did to somebody,” which isslightly different.A. “Recall a time” is always a superior process, unless the individual is consistently notrecalling a time, at which time he is not obeying the auditing command. So you should say,“Recall something you have done to” to somebody who can’t spot something on a time track.Q. What’s the difference there?A. You are running really two processes with “Recall a time you did something,” and youare running only one process, “Recall something you have done.”Q. Can he continue to do that without recalling a time?A. Yeah. Definitely. Anything else?“Recall a time,” all by itself—you just sit down and say to a pc, “Recall a time. Thankyou. Recall a time. Thank you.” Some interesting things would happen to a case. Time, yousee, is the single aberration. Joe?Q. In running an engram, when you are tagging the engram for the first time, is itpossible to peg, say, a 2-ton motivator and a one-pound overt, and that’s the incident?A. Yes. Because until they get some of the overt flat, the motivator will come off. Theright one to run there, by the way, is the overt. You get that overt damn real, and all of asudden you’ll find the 20-tons have departed down to about 1 0-tons on the motivator. Nowthey’ll run on comparable lines. Yes.Q. Couldn’t you have, say, a 20-ton motivator, as he was saying, and twenty one-tonoverts tied to the same motivator, rather than one large overt?A. You could. You could. Nevertheless, you’ll find somebody getting all loused up onthis, and best remedy is just to play what overt you find against what motivator you find as theincident. And just keep playing them one against the other, back and forth, back and forth, andeventually the thing will come out right.There are many remedies, and one is Selected Persons Overt-Withhold Straight Wire onthe personnel of the incident. You could take any incident as a PT and run any PT process onthe incident. That’s a little rule. I don’t advise you doing it, however, but you can do it. It’svery interesting: “Find something unimportant about that executioner,” is just about the sameas, “Find something unimportant about this room.” If you want to get a reality soaring on a pc,just run “Find something unimportant about this room.” And he’ll start this not-is machinerygoing, you know, and he’ll run it out to some degree, and all of a sudden the room willbrighten up. Very interesting.“Think of something you did to an executioner” would be it, rather than, “Think ofsomething you did to that executioner.” And he will come up with the overt, and he will findout he was the executioner in the same castle for about three lifetimes before he suddenly cameback there and got executed. That usually is the way these things compare."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"Any other questions? There is a burning question that you should ask, is: “Are wesupposed to run these things muzzled?” Now, let me just say this, to do this for me: Let’s cutdown the unnecessary yak. And if the pc seems to be ARC breaking at all, you voluntarilymuzzle your auditing. You got it? Because what he’s got is an engram of being talked to orbeing interrogated in some fashion, and everything that he doesn’t consider exactly necessaryto the auditing session he resents. So if you find a pc is ARC breaking, you muzzle yoursession. Any other questions before we break this up?Thank you very much for your time, I appreciate very much your coming in. I know youhad a hard day getting on to a new routine, and you have got auxiliary duties. Several people inthe HGC have been split off of administration, and there are other things going on. Latch on to‘em, get wheeling, but let’s start making theta clears in this HGC and just make nothing elsebut theta clears. I have given you a pattern here that was thoroughly tested out in the 21stAmerican ACC, and you can make theta clears—there’s no great difficulty to it. Thank youvery much. L.

They all work.When the lowest seems flat one can go to one above. Probably there is an E-Metertellingness that denotes flatness. I’m working on this and will have the gen soon.The earliest experiments of this were on “Recall a Mystery” as a method of raising IQ andthe pc was spouting poetry he’d “forgotten”.There are many possible versions of these simplicities as one can run them on terminalsand significances. Also, remember that these things (Recall Processes) take the pc out of PTand put him back in. You stop one with the PC back in PT. The Comm bridge to be used onthis process is: “When you next get an answer close to present time we will end this process ifit is all right with you.” Then don’t go on for an hour or two, catch it with 8 or 10 commandsby seeing the pc is doing a short cycle at the time and has started back up.“Recall Exhaustion” is a simple, very effective version of a work process.“Recall Creating” is a good way, apparently, to mop up Step 6 flubs.Therefore you can use these processes in the HGC or you can, when it is okayed, usethem in training. These are individual processes and not co-audit. As a note on co-audit, theprocess, the only basic affinity process, “What would you like to confront,” could cut your co-audit attendance losses.

Once each over andover. End process only with pc in present time on cycle.“Recall communicating to someone”“Recall a time you felt affinity for someone”“Recall something that is really real to you”Now people do have time tracks, the time span of the individual from beingness topresent time on which lies the sequence of events of his total existence. And when the preclearis in session and is being run on a recall type process, he, with his attention, goes up and downthis time track. He may recall things only from this life or he may recall things from his wholepast track; but however that may be, his attention cycles from early on the track to present timeor from present time to early on the track to present time. This is known as the cycle aspect ofrecall type processes. In ending such a process, it is of utmost importance that the auditor end itwith the preclear in present time on the cycle. The auditor wants to watch ending the processwhen the preclear has not made a smooth cycle into present time, but has made a big jump fromway back in the past to present time. In such a case, the preclear has really bounced out of thepast incident into present time, and it is only an apparency that the preclear is in present time.So when ending such a process, the auditor must exert caution to be certain the preclear isin present time. Being left with one’s attention back on the track is not a comfortable sensationand sometimes can be quite painful, despite any justification offered by an auditor who himselfhas no reality on the time track, and I hope there are no such auditors.With Cause ARC Straight Wire, the auditor must forget his fastidiousness about endingthe process precisely so on the last command, “Recall something that is really real to you.” Heends the process, no matter on what command of Cause ARC Straight Wire, when thepreclear’s attention has come into or close to present time, close to present time being the lastday or two.In ending such a process the communication bridge used is as follows: “The next timeyou come close to present time I am going to end this process.” He continues to give thecommands using the question, “When was that?”, after each answer the preclear gives andbefore the acknowledgement. When the preclear gives an answer close to present time, he says,“That was the last command of that process; end of process.” Bang. With processes that cycle,there can be no communication bridges like, “If it’s alright with you in a few more commands Iam going to end this process.” It could take fifty more commands until the preclear is close topresent time; and by that time, the preclear has entirely forgotten that there ever was anyintention on the auditor’s part to end the process as it seems to him that the auditor must havechanged his mind and decided to run the process longer than a few commands.An auditor should not get upset with a preclear when the auditor, in an effort to get thepreclear to give an answer right in present time, starts the preclear back down the time track"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"again. Remember it is the auditor who calls the shot, and if he misses, then he had better learnto gage it a bit better. A good auditor allows himself time in which to properly end a process.Now two further cyclic processes which can be seen under Step Two of OT-3A are:1. “What would it be all right for you to make forgotten?”2. “What would you permit to have happen again?”These are called Cause Elementary Straight Wire and are two separate processes whichare not to be run alternately.The first process puts the preclear at cause over forgetting, and the second processrehabilitates the preclear’s ability to duplicate. These are both terrific processes in turning onrecall in the preclear. All processes under Step Two are unlimited, with the “make forgotten”one only slightly less unlimited as it has a bit of a tendency to run down havingness.Havingness, however, should be checked upon in each session and run as needed.The auditor should not consider Step Two of OT-3A lightly. These processes are, inreality, very potent and will certainly do more for CCH-step cases than anything we have hadbefore. An example of this is how preclears broke through from psychosis to neurosis to sanitywith the simplified version of ARC Straight Wire as given in the original Self Analysis. So usethese processes and win faster.Note: On second thoughts for purposes of differentiation, the first process, “What wouldit be all right for you to make forgotten?”, should be termed Cause Elementary Straight Wire;and the second process, “What would you permit to have happen again?”, shall be calledDuplication Straight Wire. These two processes were first used in early Advanced ClinicalCourses in Phoenix and were called at that time “Elementary Straightwire”. The commands of“Elementary Straightwire” as given in Dianetics 1955 were: “Give me something you wouldn’tmind remembering” and “Give me something you wouldn’t mind forgetting”. As the ability torecall depends upon the mechanisms of forgetting and remembering (the ability to duplicate)you can easily understand the importance of these in Step Two of OT-3A.  L.

Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":340,"pageContent":"PROCESSING SECTIONExerpted from the Book: Self AnalysisHere begin the lists of questions by which the individual can explore his past andimprove his reactions toward life. Dianetically speaking, this self-processing section could becalled “straight wire”. It is not “auto processing”. The reader is actually being processed by theauthor.In the full use of Dianetics these questions could be considered as preparatory to co-auditing. The auditor is assisted by these lists in that they open a case for the running ofengramsand secondaries and raise the pre-clear on a tone scale. These question sections, so faras is known at this time, will not run out engrams and secondaries as such but will desensitizethem to a marked extent with a consequent improvement in the mental and physical being of theindividual.An auditor, as the practitioner in Dianetics is called since he both listens and computes,can use these questions during a session with a pre-clear. Further, two people can work withthese sections—one of them asking the questions of another who answers—or both of themreading the questions and both of them attempting to get a recall on such an incident as that onecalled for.These lists are used repetitively; that is to say the individual goes over them again andagain. There is no finite period to the work. The reason the recall of these questions isimportant is that they reveal and discharge locks which have formed above the basic engrams(moments of physical pain and unconsciousness) and secondaries (moments of acute loss asdeath of a loved one). The discharging of these locks renders engrams and secondariesrelatively ineffective. A full dianetic clearing of the individual’s engrams and secondaries givesthe highest possible attainable results, but these questions provide self-processing whichprepares the case for such an action and are in themselves highly beneficial.In the process of using these questions the pre-clear may discover many manifestationsin himself. He may experience considerable emotional release. He may become angry at the recollection of some of thethings which have happened to him and he may even feel like crying over some of the losses hehas sustained and indeed may very well cry. However, the intent of these questions is not tofocus the self-processor’s attention upon the bad things which have happened to him but uponthe good things which have taken place in his life. A concentration upon these happiercircumstances tends to discharge the unhappy circumstances and render them far less forceful.These questions are based upon the dianetic discoveries, axioms and postulates whichhave done so much toward amplifying the understanding of people, concerning the nature ofexistence and their roles in it. Life can be considered to have as its fundamental purposeSurvival in the material universe. When one closely examines Survival he discovers that theconcept embraces all the activities of an individual, a group, a state, life itself or the materialuniverse.The material universe is composed of matter, energy, space and time. Life can then beconsidered to be engaged upon the conquest of matter, energy, space and time, induding otherlife forms, organisms and persons. If an organism or a group has been successful in handlingother organisms, groups and the material universe, its survival potential is very great. If theorganism has been unsuccessful, its survival potential is lower. Its moments of success, as itsmoments of pain, are highly charged. It is possible, by certain processes, to remove the chargefrom painful incidents. One of the ways of doing this is to lay the stress and concentration ofthe organism upon the tirnes it has been successful in surviving."},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"With the invention of language man brought upon himself an unexpected source ofaberration. While language itself is very far from the whole reason an organism is lesssuccessful than it might be, our current social order lays undue stress upon language. Wordsare only symbols which represent actions. A child learns these actions very early and learns thesymbols which represent the actions. Later on he begins to mistake the action for the symboland begins to believe the words themselves have force and power which they do not. If youbelieve that words have force and power, hold your hand in front of your mouth and say a fewwords. You will see how negligible is the force of utterance, no matter what words you use.Underlying this mistaken emphasis on the force of words lie actual physical actions of whichthe words are the symbols. The main point then is that words are not powerful but actions are.For example, when an individual has been told to hold still he obeys simply because he hasexperienced earlier in his life the action of being made to hold still by physical force.For many reasons it is important for the organism to increase its mobility. Thediscovery of all the times the organism has been told to hold still and has obeyed has sometherapeutic value but the discovery of actual incidents when the organism has been physicallyforced to remain motionless is much more important in restoring the mobility of the organism.These lists, then, tend to devaluate the importance of language. This is only one of theirmany functions but an important one; therefore, the reading of these lists should direct theindividual to moments action took place, not when somebody said it took place. Just as hearsayevidence is not admissible in a court of law, so are words and phrases given to the individualby others inadmissible in self-processing. For instance, when one is asked for a time whensomebody went away one should not try to recall the time when somebody said somebodywent away or the statement that somebody was going away, but the actual physical departure,regardless of what was said.You will find that words are communicated through the physical universe to otherorganisms. Sounds, for instance, originate within the organism, are translated into soundwaves and reach the other person as sound waves. The written word is made into symbols ofink which are then seen, the other physical fact, of light, byanother organism. Whereastheremayvery well be such things as ESP, it is not aberrative.There are many perceptions, which is to say channels, through which one can contactthe physical universe. You are aware of the physical universe because of sight, sound, mouthand other message systems. Therefore, each time you are asked to recall an incident of a certainkind you will be asked, after you have recalled it, to pay attention to a certain sense channelwhich was present during the time when you experienced the incident. The circular disc isprovided for this purpose. You will notice the disc has two sides.The perceptions or sense messages listed on one side are different from those on theother side. As you read the questions one after the other you should read them through a s]otprovided in the disc. Going to the next question you should rotate the slot oncecounterclockwise for each new question. This will give you a new perception. For instance thequestion may pertain to a time somebody went away from you. You will recall a time when thisoccurred, selecting the moment of actual physical departure. Undoubtedly you will get someperception of the scene and you may even get a very full perception of the scene. Many peoplesee, feel, hear and otherwise perceive memories when they recall them. Some people are toooccluded. These lists wipe away occlusion. As you recall the person walking away from youthen, you are not supposed to recall merely the concept that somebody had walked away, butthe moment when they actually did and get as many perceptions as possible of them doing so.The disc which overlies this question will have uppermost at random one particular perception.That perception may be sound—thus you should attempt to recover whatever sounds werepresent when this individual walked away as the particular emphasis of perception. If you areunable to recover the sounds as such, hearing them again, at least recover the concept °S whatthey rnay have been."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"If you will examine this disc, you will find that it lists six perceptions with which youhave contacted the physical universe. Actually there are many more of these than six.When the word “emotion” is uppermost above a question ffler you have recalled theincident suggested by the question, you then try to recall in particular and feel again, ifpossible, the emotion you felt at the time. When the next question is addressed the disc isrotated one turn counterclockwise. You will find that “loudness” is now uppermost. Youshould get an incident in recall suggested by the question and having perceived the incident youshould then give your attention in particular to the loudness of the various sounds in theincident.Going to the next question, you should rotate the disc once more counterclockwise.You will find that “body position” is now uppermost. You should read the question and recallsome incident it suggests, perceive it as well as you possibly can and then give particularattention to the position your own body was in at the time the incident occurred. Going to thenext question and rotating the disc once more you will find that “sound” is now uppermost.You should recall the incident the question calls for and then give particular attention to thesounds in that incident. Going to the next question and rotating the disc once more, you will&d that “weight” is uppermost. In the incident you recall you should then give attention to theheaviness of things, including the pull of gravity on yourself and the weight of anything youmay actually be supporting in the incident such as your clothes, a ball or any other thing whichyou are actually holding at the time the incident occurred.Rotating the disc once more to the next question on the list, you will find that “personalmotion” falls uppermost. When you have answered the question then you should give attentionto the motion which you yourself were undertaking at the time the incident occurred.Every time you go to a new page you should turn the disc upside down. You will findhere a new set of perceptics. These, of course, are applied in such a way that when you go overthe list a second time you will probably not have the same perception, as these things fall atrandom. Thus while you might have answered a question the first time about somebodycoming towards you with attention to sound called for by the disc, the next time you reach thisquestion, on going over the list again, you may find “emotion” uppermost. You should thencontact any and all emotion on the second time, whereas you contacted the sound the first time.You will find on the reverse side of the disc the perceptions of sight, srnell, touch, color, toneand external motion. Sight is what you actually saw at the time. A person whose perceptionsare in good condition will see again what he has seen before when the incident actuallyoccurred. Thus sight calls for what was seen while the incident called for was taking place.Smell requests the individual to recall any and all odors which were present during the scene heis recalling. Touch requests the recall of anything the individual was actually touching at thetime with the sensation of touch, including pressure. One is always in contact with the materialworld in terms of touch, even if only the touch of his feet on the ground or the feel of hisclothes upon him. The perception of color, when uppermost, should cause the individual to tryto perceive again the color which was contained in the scene called forWhen tone is requested the individual should attempt to contact the quality of the soundpresent when the scene occurred. When external motion is uppermost the individual, inrecalling the incident called for by the question, should attempt to perceive in the incidentrecalled the movement contained in the incident, the motion of other people or objects or ofenergy.As one goes over these questions then with the disc, he is exploring his own life andduring that exploration is attempting to call into view with the highest possible level of realitythose things he has perceived. The immediate result is a heightening of perception of hispresent-time world. Another result is a strengthening of his memory. Yet another result is therearrangement and reevaluation of things which have happened to him. Another and moremechanical and fundamental result is the deintensification of unpleasant experiences—like"},{"pageNumber":343,"pageContent":"bringing them into the light. For a while one may feel it is better to forget unpleasant things.Forgotten, they have more force and destructive quality than when examined.The individual will find himself, as he repeatedly uses a list, getting earlier and earlierincidents. It is not impossible for him to remember straight back to the earliest beginnings ofhis life, much less his infancy.Again, and it cannot be emphasized too strongly, these questions are requesting actualphysical actions, not statements about physical actions. It is perfectly legitimate to recall sceneswhich have been seen in the movies or read about in books, but when one recalls such scenesone should have full awareness, in the case of the movies, of the screen and the seat and wherethe incident is taking place and when. In the case of books one should get not the scene theauthor would like the reader to see but the actual scene of reading and the recall should berecaptured in terms of print and sitting in a chair, not in terms of imagining.There is a great deal of technology out of sight back of these questions. All that isimportant is that this operation, continued persistently, going over one list and then another andrecalling the things required, considerably improves the individual’s thinking and actingabilities and his physical well being and considerably enhances his relationship with his presentenvironment.You will find the very last list is named the “End of Session List.” This means that afteryou have worked a list, or worked as long as you desire to, during any one period of self-processing, you should turn to the “End of Session List” and answer the questions as a routineoperation.You will also find a list entitled “When Uncomfortable”, which is placed next to the lastin the book. If you find during a session of self-processing that you grow considerablyuncomfortable or unhappy, you should then turn to the “When Uncomfortable” list. Using itshould restore your good spirit swiftly.If you find it is extremely difficult to recall any one question in these lists, simply passover it and go to the next question. If you find you are having difficulty in answering any ofthese lists you will do better if some friend reads them to you.If undergoing self-processing makes you extremely unhappy it is probable that yourcase should be given the attention of a dianetic auditor until such time as you are capable ofhandling this matter for yourself.You can go over a list many times before going on to the next list or you can continueon through all of the lists consecutively without repeating any. You will probably find thatgoing over each list many times before going on to the next will work better than going throughthe book consecutively. You will notice that after you have been over the same memory severaltimes, even though it be an unpleasant one, that it will cease to have any effect upon you. Thismeans its intensity is decreasing and that the energy which it contained and which was affectingyour present time life is dissipating. If you can remember several incidents of the same kind, doso; and if they are troublesome to you, simply go over the things you remembered once more,one after the other, and then again. This, dianetically speaking, is called repetitive straight wire.It de-intensifies unpleasant memories. However, this list is aimed toward the recall of pleasantincidents. Pleasant incidents do not de-intensify as unpleasant ones do but, underneath the levelof attention, deintensify unpleasant incidents when the pleasant incident is recalled.All you really need to work these lists is to know that actions, not words, are requiredand that the disc should be used to give you the particular kind of recall you should have on therecollection called for. If you lose the disc you will note that the bottom of the page has a list ofthe perceptions for your reference. When using the bottom-of-the-page list you should merelytake the recalls,.the perceptions, consecutively one after the other and use them the same wayyou used them with the disc."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Don’t simply answer questions “Yes” or “No”. Select an actual moment in your lifecalled for by the question. Try to re-sense that moment with the perceptic called for on the disc.If going over the questions makes you unhappy, simply continue with the list you areworking, over and over. The unhappiness should “wear out” after unhappy incidents arerecalled many times. The feeling will turn to one of relief.Some people are frightened at the idea of persevering with these questions. Certainlyyou’ve got more nerve than that. The worst they could do is kill you.Don’t be surprised if you feel sleepy after using some of these questions. Thesleepiness is only a symptom of relaxing. The very least the book can do for you is replaceyour sedatives!If, while answering these questions, you begin to yawn, that is good. Yawning is arelease of former periods of unconsciousness. You may yawn so much the tears come out ofyour eyes. That is progress.Should you feel very groggy while answering these questions, that is only “boil-off “,the manifestation of former periods of unconsciousness boiling off. Simply persist in recallingthe incident or others like it and the feeling wiU pass away, leaving you more alert than before.If you interrupt this “boil-off” and stop your session, you may feel cross or irritable. Thisgrogginess occasionally amounts to nearly complete unconsciousness, but it always goesaway. That unconsciousness was what was keeping you from being high on the tone scale.Occasionally vague or even sharp pains may turn on and off as you are answeringquestions. Don’t try to find out where they came from. They will go away if you persist withthese questions. Simply ignore them. They are the ghosts of what they used to callpsychosomatic ills, former injuries restirnulated.An individual is suppressed by these deposits of past pain and unconsciousness. SelfAnalysis makes such past moments pass away and de-intensify at least partially, without yourhaving tofind out what was in them.A full description of these manifestations and their causes occurs in SCIENCE OFSURVIVAL, the popular text on Dianetics, which you will find on the book list in the back ofthis book.Use Lists Many Times.

It may be thathe cannot immediately recall certain periods. These periods are said to be occluded. Workingwith these lists in general, such occluded periods will gradually disappear when one’s life is inrecall to the betterment of his mental and physical well being and his perception of his present-time environment- In Dianetics it is considered that everyone has a “time track”. Everythingwhich an individual has perceived throughout his life is recorded on this “time track” from thebeginning to the end. It is dangerous to have occlusions since the data in the occluded areabecomes compulsive and causes less than optimum conduct. This list is intended to straightenout the track in general.

While each ofthe questions listed pertains to a specific sense channel such as light or sound, the disc couldstill be used, for what is required are specific moments when you were using various sensesand any specific moment includes many other sense messages than the one which is called for.Therefore, use the disc as in any other questions and after you have recalled a specific incidentcalled for in the question then try recalling it with specific attention to that sense whichhappened to be uppermost on the disc at that time.Time SenseAnyone has a sense of time. This sense is apt to become aberrated. The existence ofclocks at every hand seems to tell us that we need mechanical assistance in knowing what timeit is. The first person that had an aberrated or dearranged time sense made the first clockdesirable—but only for him. Clocks and calendars are artificial symbols representing timewhich is an actual commodity and which can be sensed directly by the individual. This sectionand almost every other section in these lists rehabilitates the sense of time. Time in mostpeople’s minds is confused with space. The words which describe time are also the wordswhich describe space, which shows that man has an indifferent attention for his time sense.The organism measures time in many ways, but mostly in terms of motion and growth ordecay. Change is the most striking symbol of time passage, but there is a direct sense of timewhich everyone has although it may be occluded by a society which, using clocks andcalendars, seems to invalidate the fact that it exists no confusion of any kind about time.Can you recall a time when:1.

Personal Motion"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"SightThere are several portions of the sense channel called sight. Light waves, coming fromthe sun, moon, stars, or artificial sources, reflect from objects and the light waves enter theeyes and are recorded as present time action or as memory for future reference. Light sourcesare also recorded. This is the sense perception called sight. It has subdivisions. First of thesemight be considered to be motion, wherein sight depends upon a time span to record acontinuously changing picture. While one may see motion in present time, various aberrationsof sight may cause him to recall only still pictures. Nevertheless, all the motions are stillrecorded and can be recalled as moving pictures. In this way all other senses have a dependenceupon time in order to bring in the message of motion, since motion is also recorded by the otherperceptions. More particularly, part of sight is color perception. There are people who are colorblind in present time; that is to say, they can see color but are unable to perceive differences ofshading. There are people who may see color in present time but in trying to recall what theyhave seen, recall only in black and white. This would be recall color blind- ness. The color isfully deleted. It is an aberration easily re- medied when one recalls things he has seen in coloras black and white or as still pictures.Another part of sight is depth perception. Depth perception is observed in two ways.One is by seeing the difference in size of objects and so having a conception of the fact that oneis further back than another or that the object itself is at a distance and the other is a“stereoscopic” effect occasioned by the fact is again remediable. An individual who could notperceive motion in present time and who additionally could not perceive color or depth wouldbe a very bad risk as a driver; almost as bad is that individual who cannot recall what he hasseen; depth perception in present time and yet, in recall, see pictures flat and without depthperception. This lack of depth perception is again remediable. An individual who could notperceive motion in present time and who additionally could not perceive color or depth wouldbe a very bad risk as a driver; almost as bad is that individual who cannot recall what he hasseen; or if he can recall it, cannot do so with depth perception, full color and motion. This partof this list is devoted to giving you a better insight into sight. All these perceptics are exercisedover and over by these lists in general.

It is particularly trying onchildren, and undoubtedly was on you when you were a child, to be surrounded with objectswhich are so large. When one is actually getting a good recall on a childhood incident he isquite often startled to see how big things appeared to him and how large were those giants, theadults, with which he was surrounded. The feeling of being small in the vicinity of largeobjects sometimes produces the feeling of inadequacy. It is even said that people who aresmaller than the average feel less secure in their environment. This evidently stems from thefact that their grown up size has not reached the average and thus the feeling of smallness andinadequacy during childhood is in constant restimulation. It is not because the person, thoughsmaller, is really inadequate. In such a way people who are taller than the average becomeaware of the fact, mostly because people smaller than themselves find ways and means ofnullifying them because of their size. The perception of relative size is therefore an importantperception to rehabilitate and a person who is larger than others on the average would do wellto change the reading disc with which he is working these questions so that the word“loudness” on the disc is marked out and “relative size” is substituted.Can you recall a time when:1.

An objectmoves rapidly or slowly, and sets into vibration the air in its vicinity which pulses. When thesepulses strike the eardrum they set into motion the individual’s sound recording mechanism andthe sound is registered. Sound is absent in a vacuum and is actually merely a force wave.Sound in too great a volume or too discordant can be physically painful, just as light in toogreat a quantity can hurt the eyes. However, the amount of nervousness occasioned by sound,as by light, is mainly an aberration and it is not warranted, since the sound itself is notordinarily damaging, and there are few incidents in anyone’s life when a sound has had enoughphysical force to be physically damaging. Apprehension and anxiety about the physicaluniverse and other persons can, however, cause the individual to be nervous about sound, as itis one of the most reliable warning mechanisms; but starting at every sound in a civilizedenvironment, being afraid of voices of others, or even traffic noises is foolish, since men rarelylive a tooth-and-claw existence which warrants such attention. As sound becomes intermingledwith past pain, the individual mis- takes the moment and time he is hearing the sound, and somay associate it, as he may with other perceptics, with past pain. These lists permit anindividual to rehabilitate his skill in telling the difference between one time and another or onesituation . another.Sound has several parts. The first is pitch. This is the number of vibrations per unit oftime of any object from which sound, coming. The second is quality or tone which is simplythe difference between a jagged or ragged sound wave and smooth sound wave as in a musicalnote. The third is volume which merely means the force of the sound wave, its loudness orquietness.Rhythm is actually a part of the time sense, but is also ability to tell the spaces betweensound waves which are pulse regularly, as in the beating of a drum.Many people have what is called extended hearing, which is say they have too high analertness to sounds. This accompanies quite ordinarily, a general fear of the environment or thepeople in it. There is also deafness by which the individual simply shuts out sounds. Somedeafness is, of course, occasioned by entirely mechanical trouble with the recordingmechanism, but most deafness, particularly when partial, is psychosomatic or caused by mentalaberration. The individual may or may not be able, at first, to recall what he has heard andwhich has be recorded in the past, when he remembers it. In other words, it does not get asound when he remembers that he heard a sound. This is an occlusion of sound recordings.Recalling a sound in hearing it again is called “sonic” in Dianetics and is a desirablecircumstance which can be returned to the individual.It is interesting to note that there is also a depth perception in sound. A person havingtwo ears gets a “stereoscopic” effect on sources of sound so that he can tell how far they arefrom him and where they are located in relationship to him."},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Can you recall a time when you heard:1.

Probably the sense of touch is the oldest sense in theterms of the central nervous system. It has four subdivisions.The first of these is pressure; the second is friction; the third is heat or cold; and the lastis oiliness. Just as an individual can be hard of hearing or have bad eyesight so can his sense oftouch be dulled or even almost absent. This condition is known as anaesthesia. Just as in anyother perceptic, the sense of touch can be pleasurable, unpleasant or painful. When anindividual has been considerably harmed, as in accidents, illness or injury, he tends to cutcommunication with the physical universe and other organisms, just as he cuts communicationby getting bad eyesight, becoming hard of hearing, etc.Not only can the sense of touch be dulled in some people, but it can be too sensitive inothers who have this sense channel aberrated until it seeks to contact danger more avidly thandanger exists. One of the manifestations of the aberrated sense of touch is too high a sensitivityto sexual contact rendering it painful or anxious, or a dulling of this contact sc that sensationcan be nearly absent.A sense of touch is very important. It is partially responsible for pleasure, as in sex andis to a large measure responsible for the sensation we know as physical pain. The sense oftouch extends from the central nervous system to the skin surface and as such is intimatelyconnected and most basically in contact with the physical universe. Sight and sound and theolfactory systems contact things usually at a distance, whereas touch is alert only to the closestproximity of actual contact.Touch is partially responsible for the pleasure taken in food and crosses, to this extent,the sense of taste. As a demonstration of how poorly the sense of touch serves many people,try laying your hand in a friendly fashion on the shoulder of someone. All too many people willdodge or shrink away from the contact. An aberrated sense of touch is partially responsible fora dislike of food as well as impotency and antipathy for the sexual act.The rehabilitation of the sense of touch goes a long way toward rehabilitating one’sconfidence in one’s environment and considerably enhances survival by making it possible forthe individual to obtain pleasure, where before there might only have been distaste."},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"Can you recall an incident when you felt/touched:1.

The principal ones are happiness, boredom, antagonism,anger, covert hostility, fear, grief, and apathy. Other emotions are usually simply greater orlesser magnitude than the ones listed. Terror, for instance, is a volume of fear. Sadness is asmall volume of grief. Dejection is a small part of apathy. Love is an intensity of happinessaddressed in a certain direction. These emotions form a gradient scale which make up inDianetics the Emotion section of the tone scale. Happiness is the highest emotion and apathy isthe lowest. A person can be chronically emotional along any level of this tone scale. Anindividual tends to move up or down this scale through these various listed emotions in theorder of the first sentence.Emotion monitors or regulates the endocrine system. The perceptions and the centralnervous system call for certain emotional secretions to catalyse the body to meet the varioussituations in the environment. Emotion is one of the easiest things to aberrate. There areindividuals who feel they must be perpetually sad, even when their circumstances should makethem happy. There are individuals who believe they have to be happy regardless of theirenvironment and who yet are very miserable. Most people are not emotional—they are misemotional, in that they do not react to the situations in their environment with the emotionwhich would be most rational to display The social order has confused irrationality withemotionalism. Actually a person who is fully rational would be most able to respond to thestimulus of his environment. Being rational does not mean being cold and calculating. Anindividual who is rationally happy can be counted upon to make the best calculations. Withoutfree emotion, an individual cannot appreciate as he should the pleasant things in hisenvironment. Lack of appreciation for art or music comes about when the individual cannot befreely emotional. The person who feels he must be coldblooded in order to be rational is whatis called in Dianetics a “control case”, and on examination will be found to be very far from asrational as he might be. People who cannot experience emotion because of their aberrations areordinarily sick people. Well people can experience emotion.Derangements in the endocrine system, such as the thyroid, the pancreas and otherglands, come about because of aberrations concerning emotion. It has been conclusively testedand proven in Dianetics that function controls structure. To a man or a woman who is aberratedsexually, injections of hormones are of little or no avail in moving the mental aberrations whichmake injections ineffective. Removing emotional aberration rehabilitates the endocrine systemso that the injections are usually not even necessary. When a person’s emotional reactionbecomes frozen, he can expect various physical difficulties such as ulcers, hypo-thyroidconditions, diabetes, and other ills which are more or less directly traceable to the endocrinesystem.Inhibited or excessive mis-emotionalism is one of the most destructive things which canoccur in the human organism. A person who is so aberrated is unable to experience happinessand so enjoy life. His physical body will not thrive."},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"Can you recall an incident when:1.

Theability to perceive motion in present time and the ability to recall things which have moved andperceive that they are moving are two different things.

It is only after he discovershis inabilities in handling organisms, matter, energy, space and time, and when these thingshave been sharply painful to him, that he begins to decline physically, become less competentmentally, and to fail in life. These questions are aimed toward the rehabilitation of his ability tohandle organisms and the physical universe.It was a pre-dianetic error that an individual was healthy so long as he was adjusted tohis environment. Nothing could be less workable than this “adaptive” postulate and had anyonecared to compare it with actuality he would have discovered that the success of man dependsupon his ability to master and change his environment. Man succeeds because he adjusts hisenvironment to him, not by adjusting himself to the environment. The “adjusted” postulate isindeed a viciously dangerous one, since it seeks to indoctrinate the individual into the belief thathe must be a slave to his environment. The philosophy is dangerous because the people soindoctrinated can be enslaved in that last of all graveyards, a welfare state. However, thispostulate is very handy in case one wishes to subjugate or nullify human beings for his ownends. The effort in the direction of adjusting men to their environment by giving them “socialtraining”, by punishing them if they are bad, and by otherwise attempting to subdue and breakthem, has filled the society’s prisons and insane asylums to the bursting point. Had anyonecared to look at the real universe he would have found this to be true: No living organism canbe broken by force into an adjusted state and still remain able and amiable. Any horse trainer,for instance, knows that the horse must not be pushed or broken into submission if one wishesto retain his abilities, but, as they used to say in the army, mules were far more expensive thanmen, and perhaps it was not in the interest of pre-dianetic thought to preserve men in a happystate. However, one should not be too harsh on these previous schools of thought since theyhad no knowledge of the natural laws of thought and in the absence of these, criminals can onlybe punished and not cured and the insane can only be driven down into the last dregs oftractability. The nearer to death, according to those schools of thought, the better, as witnesselectric shock “therapy” and brain surgery—those efforts on the part of the mental medical mento as closely approximate euthanasia as possible without crossing the border into the legal factof death. These past schools have now been taken under the wing of Dianetics, whichembraces all fields of thought, and are being re-educated. It is found that they quickly desert thepunishment- drive “therapies” as soon as they completely understand that they are notnecessary, now that the natural laws of thought and behaviour are known. One cannot,however, wholly repress a shudder at the fate of the hundreds of thousands of human guineapigs whose lives and persons were ruined by the euthanistic methods employed in the darkages of unreason.Your health depends almost entirely upon your confidence in your ability to handle thephysical universe about you and to change and adjust your environment so that you can survivein it. It is actually an illusion that you cannot ably handle your environment, an illusionimplanted by aberrated people in the past, during moments when you were unconscious andcould not defend yourself or when you were small and were directed and misdirected and givenpain and sorrow and upset, and had no way to effect your right to handle yourself in yourenvironment."},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"On Lake Tanganyika the natives have a very interesting way of catching fish. There onthe Equator the sun shines straight down through the clear water. The natives take blocks ofwood and string them along a long rope. They stretch this rope between two canoes and withthese abreast begin to paddle toward the shoal water. By the time they have reached the shoals,schools of fish are piled and crowded into the rocks and onto the beach. The blocks of woodon the rope made shadows which went all the way down to the bottom of the lake and the fish,seeing the approach of these shadows and the apparent solid bars which they formed in thewater, swam fearfully away from them and so were caught.A man can be driven and harassed and worked upon by aberrated people about himuntil he too conceives shadows to be reality. Should he simply reach out toward them, hewould discover how thin and penetratable they are. His usual course, however, is to retreatfrom them and at last find himself in the shadows of bad health, broken dreams and an utterdisownment of himself and the physical universe.A considerable mechanical background of the action and peculiarities of the energy ofthought make it possible for these lists to bring about the improved state of being that they do,when properly used; but over and above these mechanical aspects, the simple recognition thatthere have been times in one’s life when he did control the physical universe as needful, whenhe was in harmony with organisms about him, validate the reality of his ability.Caught up by the illusion of words, stressed into obedience when he was a child byphysical means, man is subject to his greatest shadow and illusion—language. The words,forcefully spoken, “Come here !” have no actual physical ability to draw the individual to thespeaker. Yet he may approach, although he may be afraid to do so. He is impelled in hisapproach because he has been made to “come here” by physical force so many times in theearly period of his life, while the words “come here” were being spoken, that he is trainedmuch like a dog to obey a signal. The physical force which made him approach is lost to viewand in its place stands the shadow “come here”; thus, to that degree he loses his self-determinism on the subject of “come here”. As life goes on, he makes the great error ofsupposing that any and all words have force and importance. With words, those about himplant their shadow cages. They restrict him from doing this; they compel him to do that andalmost hour-by-hour and day-by-day he is directed by streams of words which in the ordinarysociety are not meant to help him but only to restrain him because of the fear of others. ThisNiagara of language is effective only because it substitutes for periods when he was physicallyimpelled against his wishes to accept things he did not want, to care for things for which heactually had no use or liking, to go where he did not wish to go, and to do what he did notwant to do. Language is quite acceptable when understood as a symbol for the act and thing,but the word “ash tray” is no substitute for an ash tray. If you do not believe this, try to putyour ashes on the air waves which have just carried the words “ash tray”. Called a “saucer” oran “elephant”, the object intended for ashes serves just as well.By the trick of language, then, and a magical wholly un- substantial trick it is, men seekto order the lives of men for their own advantage, and men caged about by the shadowsobserve and believe to their own detriment.All languages derive from observation of matter, energy, space and time and otherorganisms in the environment. There is no word which is not derived and which does not havethe connotation of the physical universe and other organisms.Thus, when you answer these questions by recalling incidents which they evoke, bevery sure that you do not evoke language incidents but action incidents. You do not want thetime when you were told to do something—you want the time when you performed the action.You do not have to connect the language to the action in any way, but you will find as youanswer questions on any of these lists that the value of language begins to depreciateconsiderably and that language strangely enough will become much more useful to you."},{"pageNumber":384,"pageContent":"Can you recall a time when:1.You moved an object.2.An object moved you.3.You threw an organism up into the air.4.

Howwould a deaf mute teach a child to remember? It would be necessary for him to keep forcingobjects or actions on the child when the child left them alone or omitted them. Although parentsare not deaf mutes, children do not understand languages at very early ages, and as aconsequence learn to “remember” by having their attention first called toward actions andobjects, spaces and time. It violates the self-determinism of the individual, and therefore hisability to handle himself, to have things forced upon him without his agreement. This could besaid to account, in part, for some of the “poor memories” about which people brag orcomplain.Because one learns language at the level of the physical universe and action within it, hecould be said to do with his thoughts what he has been compelled to do with the matter,energy, space and time in his environment. Thus, if these have been forced upon him and hedid not want them, after a while he will begin to reject the thoughts concerning these objects,but if these objects, spaces, times and actions are forced upon him consistently enough he willat length go into an apathy about them. He will not want them very much but he thinks he hasto accept them. Later on, in school, his whole livelihood seems to depend on whether or not hecan remember the “knowledge” which is forced upon him.The physical universe level of remembering then, is retaining matter, energy, space andtime. To improve the memory, it is only necessary to rehabilitate the individual’ s choice ofacceptance of the material universe.In answering these questions, particular attention should be paid to the happierincidents.

People can easilybecome confused between these two things so that they forget what they think they shouldremember and remember what they think they should forget. The basic and underlyingconfusion between forget and remember has to do, evidently, with what has been done to theindividual on a physical level and what has been forced on him or taken away from him interms of matter, energy, space and time.The word forget rests for its definition on the action of leaving something alone. Howwould a deaf mute teach a child to forget something? He would, of course, have to hide it orconsistently take it away from a child until the child went into apathy about it and would havenothing further to do with it. If he did this enough, so that the child would abandon the object,a child could be said to have forgotten the object, since the child, or any person, will do withhis thoughts what he has done with the matter, energy, space, time and organisms around him,thoughts being an approximation in symbological form of the physical universe. If a child hasbeen forcefully made to leave alone or abandon objects, energy, spaces and times, later onwhen he hears the word forget, this means he must abandon a certain thought and if he is inapathy concerning the forced loss of objects or having them taken away from him in childhood,he will proceed to forget them very thoroughly.It could be said that an individual will occlude as many thoughts as he has had to leavealone or those objects in life. Pain itself is a loss being uniformly accompanied by the loss ofcells of the body. Thus the loss of objects, or organisms, by the individual can be misconstruedas being painful. Memories then can be called painful which actually contain no physical pain.But the individual must have had physical pain in order to understand that the loss means pain.Punishment often accompanies, in child training, the times when the child is supposedto leave something alone. Thus, having to leave something alone is equivalent to being painful.Thus to remember something one is supposed to forget could be erroneously judged to bepainful and indeed it is not.There is a whole philosophy in existence that the best thing to do with unpleasantthoughts is to forget them. This is based securely upon an apathy occasioned by early training.A child when asking for an object will usually at first be cheerful and when he does not procureit will become angry; if he still does not procure it he may cry; and at last goes into apathyconcerning it and says that he does not want it. This is one of the derivations of the dianetictone scale and can be observed by anyone.These questions, then, are an effort to overcome the times when one has had to leavethings alone, when one has had to lose things, and when the loss has been enforced. Thus,when answering these questions, it would be very well to try to find several incidents for each,particularly a very early incident."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"Can you recall an incident when:1.

The incentive toward Survival is theacquisition of pleasure. The thrust away from death is the threat of pain. High ideals and ethicsenhance the potentialities of the individual and the group in surviving. The ultimate in Survivalis immortality.The factors which make up life can become contradictory in that one item can, in itself,assist survival and inhibit survival. A knife for instance is prosurvival in the hand, but contrasurvival when pointed at the breast by somebody else. As a person advances in life, hebecomes confused as to the survival value of certain persons, various objects, energy, spaceand time. The individual desires survival for himself, for his family, for his children, for hisgroup, for life in general, and the physical universe. Confusing one thing with another andbeholding an item which was once survival become nonsurvival, beholding nonsurvival entitiestaking on survival qualities, the ability of the individual to evaluate his environment in terms ofwhether it assists or inhibits survival deteriorates.An individual, a family, a group best survives, of course, when prosurvival entities arein proximity and available and when contrasurvival entities are absent. The struggle of lifecould be said to be the procurement of prosurvival factors and the annihilation, destruction,banishment of contrasurvival factors.Emotion is directly regulated by prosurvival and contra survival factors in life. When anindividual procures and has in his proximity a strong survival entity such as another person oranimal or object, he is happy. As this prosurvival entity departs from him, his emotionalreaction deteriorates in direct ratio to his belief in his ability to recover it. As it threatens todepart he becomes antagonistic and fights to keep it near him. If its departure seems certain, hewill become angry and lest it become prosurvival for another life form and he is assured he haslost it, he will even destroy it. When he realizes what his own state may be or the state of hisfamily, children or group with his prosurvival entity departed he experiences fear that its losswill be permanent. When he recognizes what he believes to be a nearly irretrievable absence ofthis prosurvival entity he experiences grief. When it is considered to be lost permanently heexperiences apathy and in apathy he may even go to the point of saying he did not want it.Actually, from antagonism on down the tone scale of emotion all the way to grief, he is stillfighting to get it back and only in apathy abandons it and negates against it.In the case of a person, animal, object, energy, space or time which threatens thesurvival of an individual, his family, his children, or his group, the best survival can beaccomplished when such an entity has been banished or destroyed or is as distant as possiblefrom the individual, his family, his children, or his group. In the case of the mad dog, thegreatest danger exists when he is nearest and the greatest safety exists when he is most distantor absent. With contrasurvival objects, then, we have the tone scale in reverse. When thecontrasurvival object is present and cannot be put away, the individual experiences apathy.When the individual believes himself to be threatened or when he feels his family, his childrenor his group are threatened by a contrasurvival object to a point where he cannot easily repel it,grief is experienced, for grief contains some hope of victory through enlisting the sympathy ofone’s allies. When a contrasurvival entity is threatening to approach, fear is experienced,providing one feels that direct attack is not possible. If the contrasurvival object is near, but theindividual, his family, his children or his group feel that it can be conquered, even though it isalready too close, anger results. If a contra survival entity might possibly approach, antagonismis demonstrated. Above this level contrasurvival objects may be more and more distant or easilyhandled up to the point where the individual can even be cheerful about them, at which timethey are either absent or can be handled with ease. Individuals get into a fixed emotional stateabout their environment when contrasurvival objects remain too statically in their environment"},{"pageNumber":394,"pageContent":"or when prosurvival objects are too difficult to obtain and cannot be procured or brought nearor seem inclined to leave. Mixed with these emotional states is the confusion occasioned by adulled ability to differentiate between the pro and contrasurvival of an entity.A parent is contrasurvival in that he punishes, is much too big, and cannot becontributed to, which lessens the survival potentialities of a child. On the other hand, the sameparent furnishing food, clothing and shelter, and also, but not least, being an entity which lovesand can be loved, is a prosurvival entity. The parent entirely absent, then, is not a satisfactorysurvival state. The parent present is not a satisfactory survival state. Hence an indecision resultsand the individual demonstrates anxiety toward the parent. But this anxiety exists because ofmany hidden situations extending back to the beginning of an individuals life.

He reaches for something and is turned away from it, not simply by words,but by being himself removed from the object or having the object removed from him. He iskept out of spaces he wishes to enter by being pulled back. He is given one thing when hewants another. His self-determinism is continually interrupted thus in his efforts to explore,obtain or get rid of matter, energy, space or time. From these early interruptions the childbuilds up a long chain of experiences of interruption, not simply by speech but by barriers andobstacles in the physical universe. If he has not been thoroughly interrupted when a child, hecan analytically assess later interruptions, but if he has been handled and denied so as tointerrupt him when he is young, his power of decision is inhibited, to say nothing of his powerof speech and thought.Recalling special incidents as requested in this list brings them into the light and takesthe power from these chains of interruptions.Can you recall a time when:1.An object resisted you and you overcame it.2.You couldn’t move and then succeeded in getting away.3.

Inother words, “You do exact what I say or I am no ally of yours”. This is outright domination.Additionally, it seeks by anger and outright criticism, accusations, and other mechanisms topound another individual into submission by making him less. The second method might becalled domination by nullification. This is covert and quit often the person upon whom it isexerted remains unsuspecting beyond the fact that he knows he is very unhappy. This is thecoward’s method of domination. The person using it feels that he is less than the individualupon whom he is using it and has no the honesty or fortitude to admit the fact to himself. Hethe begins, much as termites gnaw away a foundation, as in California, to pull the otherindividual “down to size”, using small carping criticisms. The one who is seeking to dominatestrike heavily at the point of pride and capability of his target and yell if at any moment thetarget challenges the nullifier, the person using the mechanism claims he is doing so solely outof assistance and friendship, or disavows completely that it has been done. Of the twomethods, the latter is far more damaging. A person using this method seeks to reduce anotherindividual down to a point where he can be completely controlled and will not stop until he hasreduced the target into a confused apathy. The lowest common denominator of nullificationcould be called “invalidation”. The nullifier seeks to invalidate not only the person but the skillsand knowledge of his target. The possessions of the target are said to be not quite as importantas they might be. The experiences of the person being nullified a minimized. The target’slooks, strength, physical capabilities and potentialities are also invalidated. All this may be doneso covertly that it appears to be “in the best interest of” the target. The nullifier seeks to“improve” the person being invalidated.The first question of this list should be, of course, how many people have you knownwho have sought consistently under the mask of seeking to aid you to tear you apart as aperson, and reduce your future, your hopes, your goals, and the very energy of your life."},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"Can you recall a time when:1.

The first number indicates the level taughton. Those that begin with TR 00 - ( drill No . ) are Level Zero Drills . The double zero is todifferentiate the drills from TR 0-4. Unbullbaited drills end in odd numbers; and bullbaited endin even numbers.Most drills are done within the basic formats as laid out. Any that don’t will be fullycovered in the specific drills themselves.Simply start with the first actions and work through the drills in the order given as it’sthe same order as the ARC ST. Wire Expanded Grade BTB 4 Jan 72 RA. Each drill is doneuntil you know you can do it flawlessly, even while being bullbaited.If a student has trouble on a drill, locate whether the student has a misunderstood or hasa skipped gradient and handle either or both with standard Study Tech. This can lead back tooutnesses on basics such as TRs, codes or scales. Whatever it is, find out why and handle.NOTE: If coach upset occurs because of restimulation, fruit words should be inserted in theplace of the process Key Words, for bullbaited drills only.FORMAT FOR UNBULLBAITED DRILLSNAME: Auditing on a doll unbullbaited.COMMANDS: As for each separate process.PURPOSE: To train the student to be able to coordinate and apply the commands andprocedures of each separate auditing action with the actual doingness of auditing.POSITION: Student seated at a table with E-Meter, worksheets and auditing forms as needed.In the chair opposite the student is a doll occupying the position of the PC. (During drill thecoach is seated or standing beside the Auditor. He does not take the position of the doll.)TRAINING STRESS: This drill is coached. The student sets up the E-Meter and worksheetsexactly as in a session - as follows:1. Set up E-Meter as for E-Meter drills."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"2. Set up shield to prevent TA and admin being seen by PC (doll).3. Have extra pens under the E-Meter.4. Have C/S face down between the bottom of the E-Meter and the table.5. Have W/S and Lists readily available in sequence required for the session.Auditor starts the session and runs a standard session with the particular auditing actionbeing taken up on the doll, keeping full session admin and using all standard procedures of theauditing action. Coach watches drill and points out any outnesses noted giving a”that’s it”and are-start. Outnesses should be handled one at a time until none exist..The drill is done on a steeper and steeper gradient until the student can very quickly dothe action correctly.The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with good TRs 0-4,correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion; ie. flawlessly!FORMAT TO BE USED FOR BULLBAITED DRILLSNAME: Auditing _____________ Bullbaited.COMMANDS: As for each separate auditing action.PURPOSE: To train the student to be able to coordinate and apply the commands andprocedures of each separate auditing action in a drill similar to a real auditing session andthereby become flawless in applying it.POSITION: Student seated at a table with E-Meter and Auditor forms, as needed. In the chairopposite the Auditor is a doll as PC. Coach sits beside doll and is the bullbaiter and givesanswers as PC, not about his own case.TRAINING STRESS: The drill is the same as for auditing on a doll except that the “PC”coachbullbaits the student Auditor using “fruit”answers during the session in an attempt to throw thestudent off session. On any list, the coach squeezes the cans to simulate reads. He still uses“fruit”answers (six apples, blue pears) when asked to speak, but as the student Auditor readsoff the list items (eg. L3RF) he squeezes the cans for reads.When bullbaiting an auditing action the coach should THROW IN VARIOUS SIGNSOF PC OUT OF SESSIONNESS. (Per HCOB on Good Indicators and BTB on BadIndicators.) The student Auditor must:1. Obnose the out of sessionness.2. Align this to the process run.3. Handle.An example is, on a Listing and Nulling procedure an out of sessionness is observed,the Auditor queries and follows through with an L4BRA at once. (An L4BRA is a repair list.)The PC bullbaiter can throw in situations, originate troubles or gains, be tricky, etc. Buthe must never lose sight of HCOB 24 May 1968 “Coaching”, especially the second paragraph -“Coach with reality”.Once the coach throws out a situation, etc. he must allow the student Auditor to carry itout, and handle the situation before the coach calls a new situation."},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"Stress is on training the student Auditor to have his TRs 0 - 4 in on the bullbaiter.The coach (bullbaiter) does the “start”, flunking or “That’s it”. Flunks are given for anyimproper commands, procedure, comm lags, break in TRs or improper session admin.Each drill is to be done thoroughly, building up the speed of Auditor commands andactions. (“It’s the number of auditing commands per unit of auditing time which makes gains ina session.” LRH)When the student Auditor has done these steps to his satisfaction, he gets a starratecheckout. The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with excellent TRs 0 -4, correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion. These are the drills thattrain the student Auditor to handle all the elements in a session, so be exact and be real.NOTE: Clearing of commands is per BTB 2 May 72R and other Bulletins and PLs on thesubject (ie. clearing each word of command backwards).TR 00-1 “REMEMBER SOMETHING” UNBULLBAITED.TR 00-2 “REMEMBER SOMETHING” BULLBAITED.Ref.

This data is contained in the book andmust be thoroughly studied with particular attention to the “Processing Section.”THESE PROCESSES PREPARE THE PC’S CASE FOR AUDITING ON DIANETICS. Inrunning these lists the Auditor directs the PC to moments action took place, not whensomebody said it took place or merely the concept that it did happen. YOU GET THEACTUAL PHYSICAL OCCURRENCE. Each time you ask the PC to recall an incident of acertain kind you then ask, after he recalls it, to pay attention to a certain sense channel whichwas present during the time he experienced it. The circular disc is provided for the purpose ofdirecting which sense to pay particular attention to. You place the disc over the question you aregoing to ask and the sense perception at the top is asked for. When you go to the next listquestion you move the disc over it and rotate it one sense counter-clock- wise so that you havea new sense to ask for.When you go to a new page of questions in the book you turn over the disc so that youhave a new set of senses to ask for. If you don’t have a disc use the same senses as listed onthe bottom of each page and tick them off one after the other as you go along.The Auditor should make sure that the PC speaks aloud the things he is recalling.

Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"R2-31: BEINGNESS PROCESSINGExerpted from the Book: Creation of Human AbilityThe cardinal rule where mental or physical compulsions are concerned follows:WHATEVER THE THETAN IS DOING OBSESSIVELY OR COMPULSIVELY, HAVEHIM DO IT ON A SELF-DETERMINED BASIS.This applies to machines, habits, twitches, etc.There is a gradient scale of exteriorization which could be described as follows: first,the thetan without contact With a universe then a thetan in full contact with a universe then athetan in contact with part of a universe, who considers the remainder of the universe barred tohim then a thetan in a universe without any contact with any part of the universe then a thetanunknowingly in contact with a large part of a universe. The first condition would be a trueStatic, the last condition is called colloquially in Scientology, ‘buttered all over the universe. Asit is with a universe such as the physical universe, so it is with physical bodies. The thetan whohas already gone through the cycle on the universe itself may be in contact with a physical bodyin the same order. At first he would be without association with a physical body then withoccasional contact with bodies then with a fixed contact on one body, but exteriorized theninteriorized into a body, but easy to exteriorize then in contact with and interiorized into a body,but withdrawn from the various parts of the body and then obsessively ‘buttered all through thebody’ then obsessively and unknowingly drawn down to some small portion of the body, andso forth. This is the gradient scale which includes inversion and then inversion of theinversion. The auditor will discover preclears are very variable in the matter of exteriorization.Some preclears, even when they have a dark field, exteriorize rather easily. Others, after a greatdeal of work, are still found to be difficult to exteriorize. The matter of exteriorization is thematter of which level of inversion the preclear is in. One of the more difficult levels to work isso inverted that he thinks that a thetan is running him. In other words, here is a thetanfunctioning in a body and actually running it through various covert communication lines, whoyet believes he is a body to such an extent that he considers himself, or any life around him tobe some other being. When discussing the matter of a thetan, this preclear is likely to tell theauditor, ‘I’m over there’. This is about the only signal the auditor gets from such a case whichtells him that the preclear is being a body, and considers that he is being run by another thetan.Very often an auditor will ‘exteriorize’ such a person, he thinks, only to have the preclear say,‘I’m over there’. A thetan who knows he is a thetan is always ‘here’ and never ‘there’.The diagnostic manifestation, however, which the auditor first encounters in any casewhere he is having difficulty with exteriorization is contained in Beingness. Those on lowerlevels of inversion are having a great deal of difficulty being anything. Such people are belowthe level of being a body, therefore it would be far up-scale for this person to be able to be abody with certainty. A person who cannot exteriorize easily must be brought up to the levelwhere he can be a body before he can then be exteriorized from the body. In other words, anauditor exteriorizing anyone has to follow such a scale as Beingness Processing.Oddly enough, Beingness Processing is an excellent exteriorization tool, and I say‘Oddly enough’ because, in one sense, Beingness Processing is an Alter-is-ness process.When a case is extremely inverted it is necessary to get the case up to a level where it canidentify itself with something. Beingness is essentially an identification of self with an object.The commands used in Beingness Processing should begin with the environment andthe vicinity of the preclear. One has the preclear look around the auditing room and select anobject, let us say a chair. The auditor does this by saying ‘Look around the room and discoversome object which you don’t mind being present’. Remember always, that when an auditorasks a question, that question has to be answered by the preclear. It is the auditor’s bad luck ifhe asks a question which introduces an enormously long communication lag in the preclear."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"The preclear must still answer the question. At this question, then, ‘Discover something youdon’t mind being present’, it is necessary that the preclear actually locate something, even if adust mote. The auditor then asks the preclear to ‘Locate something else you don’t mind beingpresent’. And when all communication lag is gone from this level of process, the auditor thenpicks out an object which the preclear was comfortable about and says: ‘Now see this (chair)here’, ‘All right, what else wouldn’t you mind this (chair) being?’ And then, as the preclearanswers this, and using this same object, the auditor continues to ask the same question until allcommunication lag is gone from the question: ‘What else wouldn’t you mind this (chair)being?’The auditor then selects other objects in the area and uses the same question on them:‘What wouldn’t you mind this (couch) being?’, ‘What else wouldn’t you mind this (couch)being?’ When the preclear is perfectly willing to have anything in the room be a large numberof things, including the walls, the ceiling, and the floor the auditor asks: ‘Now what wouldn’tyou mind your body being?’ And whatever the preclear answers, ‘And now what else wouldn’tyou mind your body being?’ Finally, when the preclear is able to do all the foregoing inBeingness Processing, the auditor commands him: ‘Now let’s find something you wouldn’tmind being’, and, as this is the question for which the auditor has been working, he uses thisquestion for a very long period of time, asking over and over, ‘What else wouldn’t you mindbeing?’It will be discovered in working Beingness Processing that the entire mechanism ofwinning Valences occurs. Here, for instance, is a thetan who is caught in a theta trap. After awhile he will consider that the trap itself is surviving, which is to say that the motions of thetrap have themselves set the thetan into motion so that he now thinks of himself totally as atrap. (This is how anybody gets to be anything -- by getting set into motion by the vibrations inhis vicinity.)At first the thetan is willing to be the trap, but after a while, if asked to be the trap andthen asked to be the thetan (and this is not a process), the most terrible apathy will be found tointervene between the two steps. The thetan, while fairly comfortable being the trap, onbeginning to recover some of his own identity, will be found to be at a point on the tone scaleso low as to contain an unbearable and agonizing apathy.Beingness Processing recovers the various valences which the thetan is trying to avoid.As a practical example in life, we find a housewife who is incapable of keeping house.Although intelligent and able in most things, we find she cannot sweep, make beds, or evenshop for the house. We discover that her mother was an excellent housekeeper, an excellentcook, and could shop very well. If this is the case, then we would also discover that the oneperson in this world our preclear does not want to be is her mother. In other words, by beingunable to be her mother, she is also unable to be all those things which her mother could do orbe. In other words, the matter of valences is also a matter of packages of abilities, and where anindividual is unable to be something which has certain definite abilities, he also cannot achievethose abilities, and this, in itself, is the heart of disability.In running Beingness Processing it will be discovered that the imagination of thepreclear revives to a marked extent. This is a process which requires a skilled auditor, a patientauditor, and one who is willing to level every communication lag he encounters by repeatingthe same question over and over, each time waiting to receive a definite answer. It is not aprocess which one starts and leaves uncompleted."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"P.A.B. No. 56PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR’S BULLETINFrom L. RON HUBBARDVia Hubbard Communications Office163 Holland Park Avenue, London W.11_____________________________________________________________________8 July 1955AXIOM 51 AND COMMUNICATION PROCESSINGLet me give you a small review on communication. Axiom 51 says that MEST cannotchange MEST, and we find that postulates and live communication do change MEST. MESTcannot change MEST, therefore a pair of forceps cannot basically change a tooth condition.This is sweeping and I want you to realize how sweeping it actually is. A medical doctor wouldnot be able to alter completely a broken leg. You may say, “That’s silly, of course he could. Hecould come in and snap the bone back into place and the fellow would feel a lot better.” No,I’m sorry, a medical doctor cannot over a period of time change a broken leg. Do you knowwhat will happen? Let’s look at it from the standpoint of life, now, and we find out that theindividual got attention for his broken leg, didn’t he? It will emerge as rheumatism some day.In the next life it will emerge as two broken legs! We’re going to get a repetition of this becauseas soon as you attempt to change MEST with MEST in one fashion or another you are going toget persistence, and that is all. Persistence of what?In view of the fact that all conditions are postulated conditions, and that the considerationbehind them that they are bad or good is simply again a consideration, if we say persist itdoesn’t mean that it is either bad or good, it simply means that condition. What condition is it?The condition we are trying to change. And whenever we try to change MEST with MEST weget a persistence of that condition. It will crop up one way or another, and you will see thistime after time.Dealing as we are in a very high echelon of live communication, when we try to alter acondition with MEST we get this persistence. Restimulation is the condition persisting in theauditor, as an auditor who goes around altering energy masses gets restimulated. The auditorcomes along and says, “Now all I have to do is change this energy mass one way or the other,”and he may succeed in doing so as far as he can see for the moment. So he goes offrestimulated. That is the condition persisting. It’s going to persist, one way or the other. Theonly motto back of MEST is “PERSIST.”But we have this licked. Hence Axiom 51. Postulates and live communication actuallycan bring about a permanent change and can actually stop a persistence.Now, this process, “What wouldn’t you mind____communicating with?”“What wouldn’t mind you communicating with?” is actually not a low echelonprocess. A low-echelon preclear, one with no mock-ups and very little reality, one who is notwell off, will not be touched by this process. He cannot assimilate the process. Why? Because,to run this process, you have to have the cooperation of the preclear’s ability to as-is. You haveto have the ability of the preclear to have a cognition and the ability of the preclear to as-is apiece of energy, that is, to make a perfect duplicate of it.Where, then, does that leave this process to be totally functional? It leaves it upstairs,because when you run it downstairs, the individual begins to “chew energy.” Just “chewing theenergy around” doesn’t make it persist, but, with all this chewing, he isn’t as-ising anything."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"All he is doing is moving mass “A” to position “B.” Anybody who is doing this gets nocognition out of it at all. He is waiting for that piece of energy to tell him something, and thistells you a great deal about the preclear who couldn’t run an engram. He was waiting for theMEST to say something.The preclear who could run engrams could still play a game well enough to make theMEST say over and over again what the MEST had imprinted on it. That is exactly why anengram could run and why we had success in running engrams, and when an engramdisappeared that is exactly what happened. It was up there all right, it was up there in lights,but it wasn’t saying anything. It was a bunch of sound waves imprinted on a bunch ofmolecules of one kind or another, and the preclear had to sort of pretend it was saying thesethings over and over. In other words, he made it talk. Now today an individual gets an engramin front of his face and you just tell him to make it talk. Make it say, if you please, exactly whatis in the engram, or make it say anything—it doesn’t matter which.As we look over this running of an engram, let us say that we are getting an individual torun birth. What we are doing is to get an energy mass called birth to articulate to an individual,and it would run very handsomely indeed if we had the preclear saying Okay. This is actually aterrifically effective way to run an engram. If we wanted to start today running engrams, wecould, full out, and achieve tremendously superior successes because we could certainly runany kind of an engram in the bank. We could dream it up, and the preclear could dream it up,could do anything he wanted to, just to make these energy masses talk.Of course very strange phenomena happen on an occluded case when you have himdream up the fact that he has the concept of an engram in front of him. You just look at him andyou say, “Now let’s make believe that you have birth in restimulation in front of you.” (Thiswould be a roughie, and a weird way to go about it.) “And now let’s pick up the engram at thepoint where the doctor is saying, ‘If you will just take this pint of strychnine, mamma, the childwill be born much earlier.’ “ You have him to make this concept say this, and have him sayOkay to that.The strange part of it is that you don’t have to pay any attention to whether birth showsup or not. I counted the number of births on an individual one time and it was severalthousand, believe me, and they all go back to Fac Ones and things like that. So we just havehim get the idea that he has birth in front of him and have it articulate. Quite often this totallyoccluded case will have a complete birth show up and begin to run off. But, he was totallyoccluded, wasn’t he? He couldn’t run an engram.We could just buckle right down at that point and actually run that engram with Okaysfrom the preclear, just as it showed up, or we could go on running a synthetic engram. In eithercase facsimiles would go out of restimulation in the individual. As long as we havecommunication those energy masses will disintegrate and you will stop the persistence of thecondition.So let’s look at the optimum way that I know of at this moment—the best way I knowof—to separate universes, on which I have had considerable success and to date have had nofailures as long as the preclear could at least articulate anything. As long as you can make himdo anything at all you can make him do this. You have seen the process already.“Give me some things you could say to your mother.” If you wanted to makethis very perfect, if he is unable to play a game you don’t have to (very often the preclear isunable to play a game), you would say, “Now get the idea mamma is out there sayingOkay to all of this.” “Now give me something else you could say to yourmother.” Then you say, “Get the idea mamma is out there and have her say‘Okay.’ “ “Now give me some things that mamma could say to you.”Now you will get a positive blow-apart in a fairly rapid order of the interiorization of theuniverse. We know very well that people interiorize into a body, into other bodies, into MEST"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"objects, into planets. So, if you were to run this one all the way backward you would takesomebody who is obviously seen to be interiorized into earth, and what would you have himdo?You would say, “All right now, give me something earth could say to you.”If he is really interiorized into earth he’ll think up something. Then you have him say Okay.The next thing you know he will get the ball of earth ‘way out there somewhere. Maybe it’s thefirst picture he has ever had! You will say, “That’s fine. Now give me some morethings that earth could say to you.” “Now give me some things you could sayto earth,” and very ordinarily he will come right on up the tone scale. You will never seesuch perfect behavior of a tone scale as when you use a MEST object.Then we would pick out (if we really were bent on exteriorizing Mr. Doakes and Mr.Doakes was interiorized into the interiorizations) another universe when we knew that we hadthe first one blown, and we would know that because his physiological condition would verydefinitely alter. We would go on to the next likely universe.We find this fellow who has been a linotype operator for eight thousand seven hundredand sixty-two months, or something of the sort. We don’t have to be specific. We pick alinotype machine, and we say if he got into earth he certainly got there via some sort ofapparatus he was controlling, so we say, “All right, what could a linotype machinesay to you?” He would think it over for a moment. A very literal-minded fellow wouldprobably say, “It could say ‘clank.’ ““Okay, have it say clank.”“You know, I don’t get any sonic on this,” he’d say. (I’ve had this happen.)“Well, just get the idea of its saying clank.”“Well, it’s going clank, all right.”(“Oh no you don’t,” says the auditor, aside and to himself.) “Have it SAY clank.”“Have it SAY clank? A linotype machine can’t . . . well, I guess it could. On thinking itover I guess a linotype machine could.... All right, I’ll have it say clank.”“All right. Now have it say something else.” He does, and we blow him out of theuniverse of the linotype machine.Now let’s pick the wife he hates worst, or something like that. What could she say? etc.Admittedly this is not a short process, but it keeps going faster and faster. Next we would pullhim out of papa and mamma, and maybe grandma and grandpa, and so on. We are doing oneof these schoolbook, by the table, separations. Then we say, “Now give me somethingyour body could say to you.”“My body say something to me?”And away we would go, and we would blow him out of his head.It will work with almost that mechanical ease. The question is, how many hours ofauditing would it take to bring somebody who is totally interiorized into a planet out throughthese various stages and finally out of his head? As far as I’m concerned it is the minimumnumber of hours he could be audited for maximum result.We could do a tremendous number of things for him. We could do a momentary patch-upon a lot of things, we could do this and we could do that, but if we were going straight towardthe goal of making this individual into the highest level of condition that we could make him"},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"into, we would follow a process just about like this. It would be slow, and it would bearduous, but we would get better, and better, and better. He would finally get to a point wherehe could feel these things blow off and blow out on him.I went so far one time as to try to exteriorize a fellow from his engram bank. I think Iexteriorized a lot of thetans from that bank, but I never got the fellow out of it entirely because Ididn’t have the time. His track finally stretched out in all directions and he could view it clearly,and then he was terribly interested and wanted to run and have to do with each individualengram—and there were about seventy-six trillion years worth of them. Then there was thewhole GE line. So I abandoned that attempt. He felt wonderful, though, and went aroundtelling everybody he was cleared. Compared to his earlier state he sure was. He was clearedeasily from eight or nine heavy engrams in about eight or nine hours’ auditing.The articulation of the actual communication would be something you would do on anindividual who is having the vaguest difficulty playing a game, who couldn’t as-is birth at aglance. And this is the conclusion I have reached rather arduously over these past weeks onthis. I give you data when I have it.Axiom 51 is right. It says you can’t change MEST with MEST, but postulates and livecommunication can change it. But realization on the part of a preclear with no cognition is notpossible. So if he can’t realize, that means he can’t as-is, so if he can’t as-is, there he is. But Ihave seen preclears pass right on up the line from cognition zero to almost instantaneouscognition. In the Air Force they have ceiling zero. We have cognition zero, but it’s the samething—total fog.It is immensely safe for an auditor to change by communication.

RON HUBBARDVia Hubbard Communications Office163 Holland Park Avenue, London W.11_____________________________________________________________________10 June 1955REALITY LEVEL OF PRECLEARFind the reality of the preclear. This is the watchword of processing. Althoughcommunication, as completely outlined in Dianetics, 1955! is a universal solvent, rememberthat there are also two other comers to the triangle, and that one of these corners is Reality. ThatR corner of the triangle is very important to you as an auditor because you, having very greatcertainties on this and on that, are very prone to forget that your Realities are greater than thoseof your preclear.The reality level of the preclear is dependent on how much he is “not-ising” hisenvironment. If he is not-ising it, he must believe that it is dangerous, and must believe that hehimself does not have the power to make anything in it disappear or vanish for himself.Therefore, his reality level is as great as he is strong, and it is as poor as he is weak. Do youknow that you are processing preclears who do not believe that thought has anything to do withaction? You are processing preclears who believe that thinking a thought will influence nothing.You are processing preclears who believe that thinkingness is one thing and actingness is anentirely different thing, and that no amount of thinkingness is going to influence any amount ofactingness. This is apathy, indeed, and along with that goes an unreality which would appallyou.Yes, these preclears can get mock-ups. They can get concepts. They can be veryobedient. They can even be run with SOP 8-C and somehow or another muddle through it, butthe joker here is that the auditor is actually monitoring the body of the preclear, and of course abody can respond to orders, and will respond probably faster to the auditor’s orders than to thethetan the auditor is processing. Thus a preclear can be put through any number of contortionsand convolutions in processing without getting anywhere at all. The auditor is simply doing it.Find the reality level of your preclear. Unless you find the reality level of the preclear youare not going to reach the preclear, because the preclear is as alive as things are real.Now, if this is so important, then let us see how far south we would have to go to reachsome preclears. Mechanical two-way communication might very well be much too tough for75% of the preclears you will process. Just ordinary conversation is actually over their heads.People that we are trying to reach do not know the auditor is acknowledging them when hesays “Okay.”Let us look at this acknowledgment of the preclear, and let us discover that the auditor, inorder to acknowledge the preclear, must also make the preclear aware that he is beingacknowledged. Thus, when an auditor says “Okay,” or “All right,” or “That’s fine,” the otherpart of the statement is to make the preclear aware that an acknowledgment has been delivered.Thus, a “Did you hear me?” is quite often beneficial. When the preclear finally admits that hedid hear the “Okay,” and when the auditor makes sure that he time after time hears the “Okay,”you will notice that the communication, on the acknowledgment level, starts to work with thepreclear. But it won’t work as long as the preclear is oblivious of the “Okays” the auditor isgiving. Of course, you must give the preclear an “Okay” for every action or completed thought"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"he performs. You must acknowledge what he has said or done, but you must also be very surethat he receives that acknowledgment. It is not out of order to face him squarely and hold upone finger and say, “Wait a minute, did you hear me say ‘Okay’?”Now there are two processes which are at once the most basic of processes and which arevery low on the Reality Scale as well as high on it. A person processed on these processesshould not believe that the auditor believes his reality level is low. Quite the contrary. Such aprocess as this one happens to be very good anywhere on the tone scale. And this process is,“Think a thought,” “Receive a thought.”You are in essence processing thinkingness. I wonder how long and how often you haveprocessed preclears who could not clearly or differentiatively understand that they werethinking a thought? The auditing command is simply, “Think a thought.” The preclear isgiven this command time and time again, and he vocalizes the thought back to the auditor, andthe auditor acknowledges the fact that he has received that thought, aloud. And the preclear isrun until the preclear knows, absolutely, that he himself, not some machine, not some energymass, not his toe, or his hat, is thinking the thought. The preclear will start out thinkingthoughts which are actually handed to him from some mysterious source. When thecommunication lag on this is entirely flat, and when the preclear knows that he himself isthinking the thought, the auditor can then run the other side of the process.“Receive a thought” is run with the following auditing command: “Tell me a thoughtyou would be willing to receive.” This is then run until it, as a process, is entirely flat:when it is no longer producing any result or comm lag.Part of the “Think a thought” process is to have the preclear place the thought in variouslocations after he has thought it. Have his shoe think a thought, have his hat think a thought,have a lamp think the thought, have a rug think the thought. This gets the preclear into thepractice of placing the thought somewhere. Thus, thoughts are less likely to appear suddenlyand magically out of his machinery.Very curious phenomena result from “Think a thought” and “Receive a thought.” It willbe found sometimes that it is easier for the preclear to think a thought for another universe thanfor himself to think a thought. Let us take for example a preclear who is entirely interiorizedinto the universe of his mother. It would, therefore, evidently be much easier for him to havehis mother think a thought than for the preclear himself to think a thought. As a matter of fact itmight be an enormous struggle, resulting in rebellion, for the preclear himself to think athought, but it would be very easy for the preclear to have his mother think a thought. The wayto go about this would be to take an E-Meter, or simply estimate, by finding out who thepreclear most resembles, the probable universe into which the preclear is interiorized. Havingestablished this (and you would only do this if the preclear were rebellious about thinking athought himself) you would then have this likely universe think a thought, with the auditingcommand (having established that he is interiorized into his mother’s or his father’s universe):“Have your mother (father) think a thought.” This would then be carried out until thepreclear was absolutely sure that he was making his mother or his father think a thought. Thiswould betoken an initial division of the universe.Slicing up universes with communication processes is a very easy thing to do. All onehas to do is use the process: “What could you say to your father?” and have the preclearsay it, and get an Okay from his father. And when this was flat, “What could your fathersay to you?”, and when the preclear has vocalized this, the auditor would say, “Now giveyour father an ‘Okay’ to this.” However, this workable process which splits universes(in old-time parlance “valences”) is yet much too high for a preclear who is very low on reality,and would take a very long time to do. It would be a process into which you would eventuallymove the preclear who had been thinking a thought for his mother, but remember that thinkinga thought for his mother would be only a start into communication processing, and would be anelementary process, run until the preclear is entirely certain that he is thinking a thought that his"},{"pageNumber":441,"pageContent":"mother would think or that he can make his mother think a thought—the latter being the mostdesirable condition.You should be aware of the fact that you are processing thinkingness. You are notprocessing spaces, you are not processing masses at this day and state of development ofDianetics and Scientology. You are processing thinkingness. A man is as well as he thinks.The more masses and spaces, phrases and engrams you process, the less you are validating thefact that you are actually processing a thinkingness: a thinkingness that we call a thetan. Toprocess this directly is, of course, the most indicated process there could be, and sure enough,we are producing good results with it. But the remarkable thing about the process is that itworks on people who heretofore have had very, very poor reality.Now there is a process which is a little bit lower than this “Think a thought” process, andthis is the process of finding something real in the room. Recently I have had some veryexcellent results with “Find something in this room that is comfortably real.” Thisis a variation on the initial auditing command as given in the early SOPs. It is apparently better.A preclear who is not-ising everything in sight will find things real, he says, but actually he isnot comfortable about it, and if you ask him to find something that is comfortably real, it maytake him a long time to discover anything that he would tolerate to continue existence, and onceyou have begun this process of toleration you would be able to do a great deal for his case.“Find something comfortably real” is not necessarily a low-toned process. It will work invarying degrees on anyone. It is not recommended for any particular case level. If a preclearutterly bogs on “Think a thought” (which isn’t likely), then you should have him “Findsomething in this room that is comfortably real to you.”I am reminded of an auditor recently processing a very bad arthritic, who processed himas an exteriorized case for some little time without any apparent gain in the case before itoccurred to this auditor that something must be wrong. Actually, a great amount of time wasinvested. The auditor asked Nibs, my boy who was then instructing the ACC course in theUnited States, and who is at this writing in England, teaching the BScn course there, whatcould possibly be wrong with this hung-fire preclear. Nibs looked him over and discoveredthat the auditor had never yet gotten the preclear into any kind of a situation which was evenvaguely real to the preclear. The auditor in one chair and the preclear in the other chair was nota real situation to this preclear, and yet the auditor was running him as an exteriorized case. Ofcourse he was exteriorized, but with such a low level of reality that very little benefit of coursewas resulting from the processing.Processing is as beneficial as it is real and factual to the preclear, and if you cannot raisethe preclear’s reality level by the use of Affinity and Communication, then you are letting thewhole triangle hang fire. This triangle of ARC may have suddenly gotten very important on theC corner, but it is still foremost in the tool-kit of the auditor.Now you will want to know why you should use “Think a thought” when what isobviously wrong with the preclear you have in mind is a withered leg. Let me assure you that ifyou process directly this withered leg, you are processing something and somebody whoprobably has a very low level of reality. He wouldn’t have a withered leg if he had a high levelof reality. Where you have anybody who is neurologically, physically, or psychosomaticallyill, unless it be from an acute infection or an accident, you have somebody who has been tryingto not-is his body. When an individual is not-ising his body, making his legs wither, or hisstomach get ulcers, or his head get migraine headaches, or his teeth fall out, you havesomebody who is trying to not-is the environment. He is already going in the direction ofsuccumb. The one thing that would make him very happy would be the entire disappearance ofthe physical universe. Well, with modern processing you can make this happen, too, andmaybe this is something you should have happen for him in order to demonstrate that it couldhappen. Of course, if you did this you would have to go through a modern BScn course atleast, for this is a very tricky procedure. In view of the fact that unreality is the action ofrealizing things are there and then saying they aren’t there (not-ising them; see Creation of"},{"pageNumber":442,"pageContent":"Human Ability and the Axioms of Scientology) you are dealing with a protest against realitywhich results in unreality. A person will let things be as real as he is willing to let them exist.When an individual isn’t willing to let a leg or a tree, or this universe exist, then things are notreal to him. One of the best ways you could get him to raise his level of reality would be to givehim some reality on thinkingness. It isn’t actingness, it isn’t getting tired, it isn’t being unableto work, it isn’t the second dynamic that impedes your preclear—it is his thinkingness. All youhave to do is to get him to change his mind. If you could get anyone to change his mind enoughhe could then command anything that was bothering him. But a preclear who is not-ising thingsis trying to use force and pressure of one kind or another against physical objects and spaces inorder to push them out of existence. This will never win, let me assure you. Energy will neverdestroy energy, I don’t care how many atomic bombs the peanut whistly brigade builds, theywill never destroy any space or energy with them. Your preclear who finds things unreal hasstopped trying to do anything with thought and is trying to do something with force. He nolonger conceives that thought can generate or handle or give existence or life to space andenergy.Now you take this to heart, and take a good, hard look at some of these preclears youhave been processing on very fancy and frilly processes, and you take a think back over all ofthese preclears who, after you processed them, didn’t think anything had happened. When thepreclear didn’t think anything had happened, nothing happened. What was in error? You wereprocessing him above his level of reality. If you could get him to think a thought and know hethought it, and receive a thought and know he had received it, even though he put it there toreceive it, which is what he does, you would then be directly addressing the very thing that isdoing unreality and reality. An individual who has a compulsive outflow is simply unwilling toreceive a thought. An individual who is silent simply can’t think of anything. Thus, if anindividual had control of his thoughts he would have control of the universe. We can prove thisnow in a process.And don’t think you are going to finish this process, either side of it, in a half-hour orforty-five minutes. Some of these glib preclears you process will “fall in” on this process andbegin to comm-lag an hour or two after you start processing them on it. The main errors whichhave been made with this process so far have been failing to run it long enough to have thepreclear really know and really understand that he, himself, has thought the thought and thathe, himself, has received the thought, or is willing to receive the thought.“Find the reality level of the preclear” is one of those bywords that you can’t use toooften or look at enough."},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICESaint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, SussexHCO BULLETIN OF 17 MARCH 1960Fran HldrsSTANDARDIZED SESSIONSThere are many reasons why sessions should be standardized and held in pattern. First ofthese is confidence. The auditor, going over practised ground, feels more confident and,startled by some sudden action or new development, does not lose session control by seemingincapable to the pc. The preclear, accustomed to repetitive session pattern, feels a security whenall his sessions are predictable as to pattern of address. And if he changes auditors he is stillable to feel confident that he is getting real auditing.A second reason is duplication: Just as old repeater technique done by the auditor to thepc will run out a phrase or charged word, so do session patterns, well followed, tend to run outearlier sessions. Duplication does not make all things seem alike. Duplication of a session addscommunication to the session and speeds up the willingness of the pc to communicate to theauditor.The basic freeing action of auditing depends upon the separation of thought from form,matter, energy, space and time and other life.We see in “science” as currently practised a nearly total identification by the “scientist” ofmass with thought. “Man from mud” is a natural conclusion by anyone who has all his thoughtbound up in mass.The reason a clear’s needle is so free (and you’ve seen, certainly, how an E-Meter needlegets sticky, then freer and freer) is that his thought is separated from a matter, energy, space,time consequence.The “deadin-’is-’ead” case is totally associating all thought with mass. Thus he readspeculiarly on the meter. As he is audited he frees his thinkingness so that he can think withoutmass connotations.What auditing is doing is making the preclear think key thoughts until they can be thoughtwithout creating or disturbing matter, energy, space and time.As most pcs associate themselves with thought, only when they can think a thoughtwithout ploughing anew into mass can they exteriorize. Difficult exteriorization orexteriorization with bad consequences is all caused by a person’s considerations of thoughtbeing matter, self being matter, etc, etc.The basic overt act is making somebody else want mest. This recoils so that self wantsmest. Thus we have the “necessity for havingness”. Running havingness restores the pc atcause over matter, permits him to be separate from matter to some degree.Thinking, then, is separated from mest by repetitive thinking on the exact points that pin aparticular person to mest.If a person is aberrated, say, on the subject of women, the shortest cut to de-aberration(barring havingness difficulties—see below) would be the repeated command “Think of awoman.” At last he would no longer have pictures or masses just because he thought thatthought and you would then find he could think about women as opposed to reacting aboutwomen."},{"pageNumber":444,"pageContent":"This naturally leads to an obvious basic process, “Think about matter” “Think aboutenergy” “Think about space” “Think about time” “Think about a thetan.” In theory each onecould be run flat in turn and then all run again.In actual practice this is pretty steep for most cases and would not be real to many. Amore complex approach containing more significance is more real to the pc.The pc’s mind is trapped into forms of mest and life, rather than merely mest and life.Thus, what falls on the E-Meter needle shows what form of mest and life his attention is fixedupon.Havingness is a complicated subject when viewed in a pc’s mind. Familiarity, which is tosay, predictability, is strongly connected with his ability to have or own. When he receivesshocks or surprises, his ability to predict is invalidated and he can’t have.The reason a thetan “dies” is his loss of the familiar by the introduction of theunpredictable. Rapidity of change of state, unpredicted, would be a definition of surprise, alsoof death and forgetfulness.The more change he is subjected to, that he did not predict, the less he can have.Thus when he is given a “rough session”, the pc’s havingness goes down. Not predictingthe shifts and changes of the auditor, the pc ceases to be able to have the session or itsappurtenances—the auditor, the room, etc. The smoother the auditing the better the pc’shavingness stays up.The model session is designed to avoid unpredictable changes. Thus it is designed toretain havingness by retaining pattern, which is to say, retaining predictability by l;he pc.Auditing, done smoothly, duplicatively session by session as to session pattern, runsitself out, even if the pc has a constantly changing bank.A pc began to use pictures when he changed lives and sometimes, therefore, language,but only after he had already adopted language for thought. So an ultimate step in processingcould concern itself with separating the pc from the significance of words. Some such processas “Think of a word,” followed by “Think of a meaning,” would in theory, if it could be run(but has not been tested and would violate havingness), discharge the pc of his dependence onlanguage for thought and would find him less fixated on having pictures (which of coursebridge the language barrier).Appearing in a form composed of matter, running on energy, existing in space andkeeping pace with others in time is a favour pcs do one another (or an overt act depending onhow cynical you may feel when you consider it).The games condition of havingness is have for self, can’t have for others. Appearing in aform violates this games condition. Also, giving another words violates it. Thus actors andwriters tend to go downhill by violating their own games condition if they are in one. A gamescondition evolves from separateness. Running some form of separateness can then result inexteriorization not from willingness to lose the mass of the body but by curing the gamescondition. Separateness is of course handled on lower cases by running out obsessiveconnectedness. But separateness itself can be run.Any auditing is a solution: Solutions are ordinarily an alter-is of problems. Thus gettingpeople to confront problems or even solutions can resolve not only case but auditing whereauditing itself has now and then, in absence of smooth analysis and session handling, become aproblem to the preclear."},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"A fine process for this is “Tell me a problem that auditing would be a solution to,” and forthat matter, this also applies to any psychosomatic illness. A person with a bad leg wouldexperience relief if audited on “Tell me a problem a bad leg would be a solution to,” as arepetitive process. Similarly, it might work if one asked “Tell me a solution to a bad leg youcould confront,” or “What problem about a leg could you confront?” which last is very good asa process.The separation of thinkingness from a problem, from particular forms, and from Life andMest are the primary targets of auditing. And just as the repetitive auditing command runs outnot only the connection with a mass but itself, so does a repetitive session design eventuallyfree the pc from not only his aberrations but auditing itself.A person gets as able as he regains confidence—and he gets as free as his auditing is aconstant not itself a wild variable.

Above that is ‘protection’. Above that is ‘ownership’. I haverecently discovered that the DEI cycle and the above low scale join to make the scale read:CURIOSITYDESIREENFORCEMENTINHIBITIONOWNERSHIPPROTECTIONHIDDENand I have discovered that the road upward through this scale is communication.Knowingness condenses. Trying to know becomes the first level of communication.This ‘looking to know’ condenses into ‘emoting to know’, which condenses into ‘effort toknow’, which in turn becomes ‘thinking to know’, which then condenses into ‘symbols toknow’ which, and this is the astonishing thing, becomes ‘eating to know’, which becomes‘sexual activity to know’, which then turns into oblivion of knowing or ‘mystery’.An energy particle is a condensed knowingness. Trying to discover or move one is anaction with the goal of knowingness.Gravity, grim thought, becomes in the mind, and is, the effort to know, to pull inknowingness. Other-determinism is only other knowingness.The aspects of know are the common denominators of any scale in Scientology. Whenknowingness is done by communication, we get emotion and effort particles changing position.This struggle to know is not just me and thee working on Scientology and gone mad inthe process, it is life and all its manifestations including space, energy, matter and time. Each isonly a barrier to knowingness. A barrier is a barrier only in that it impedes knowingness.Barriers do not exist for complete knowingness.And what is there to know? Only that knowingness can vary. One has to invent thingsto know for there is only knowingness, and knowingness has no data since a datum is aninvented, not a true, knowingness. The motto of any particle below knowingness is ‘Onlyenergy can tell you’.We handle R2-60 HIDDEN KNOWINGNESS in this wise: ‘Spot some hiddencommunications’, ‘And now spot some more hidden communications’, and so forth. We mayhave to direct the preclear closely with, ‘Point to the spot’, ‘How far away does it seem?’, ‘Areyou spotting a hidden communication there?’ and such questions, meanwhile keeping goodARC. He could be asked to spot specific kinds of hidden communications as with thiscommand: ‘Spot some hidden disease communications’, ‘Some hidden poisonouscommunications’, or ‘Spot some hidden, but uninteresting communications’. But use thequestion to flatten all communication lags before you change it.If he goes into the past, let him. He’ll come back to the present. He’ll find his chronicsomatic and do many interesting things, including, perhaps, the data in the text of R2-60 here."},{"pageNumber":452,"pageContent":"It is curious that the above ‘Spot some hidden communications’ does not seem torequire a remedy of havingness. But it will turn on many heavy ridges and somatics. Havingthoroughly worked ‘hidden communications’ you can now use this command: ‘Spot someprotected communications’, and when that is null, ‘Spot some owned communications’, andafter that has no communication lag, ‘Spot some inhibited (stopped) communications’. Then:‘Spot some enforced communications’, and then, ‘Spot some desired communications’.Now when all that is done, proceed as follows: ‘Spot some hidden knowingness’,‘Are you spotting it in the physical universe? If so all right, point to it’, ‘How far away does itseem?’, ‘Spot some more hidden knowingness’, and so on until after an hour or two (or six)this command is comm-lag-flat.Now start upscale as follows, making the preclear point and give the distance to thespot (even when trillions of miles away): ‘Spot some protected knowingness’. And after manytimes of that, then: ‘Spot some protected knowingness’, many times. Then: ‘Spot some ownedknowingness’, many times. Then: ‘Spot some inhibited knowingness’. Then: ‘Spot someenforced knowingness’. Then: ‘Spot some desired knowingness’. Then: ‘Spot someknowingness that people could be curious about’.In R2-60 HIDDEN KNOWINGNESS, we can use the Know - Mystery scale:‘Spot some mysteries’‘Spot some hidden sex’‘Spot some hidden eating’ ‘Spot some hidden symbols’‘Spot some hidden thinking’ ‘Spot some hidden efforts’‘Spot some hidden emotions’‘Spot some hidden looking’ ‘Spot some hidden knowing’Then: ‘Spot some protected mysteries’, ‘Spot some protected sex’, and so on.You can, using the principles of hidden knowing and communication, combine anyother part of Scientology with them, and discover an excellent process.

Eachlower step is an explanation to justify having failed with the upper level.One seeks to not know something and fails. One then seeks to inhibit it and fails.Therefore one seeks to enforce it and fails. Thus one explains by desiring it and fails. And notreally being able to have it, shows thereafter an obsessive interest in it."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"The above inversion is of course all reactive.Reactive selling (of interest to us in a salesman campaign) would be accomplished thusly(and this is the basic scale of selling):The salesman refuses to let the customer forget the product;The salesman then inhibits all efforts by the customer to refuse the product;The salesman enforces the product on the customer;The salesman now finds the customer desires the product;And the customer will remain interested.There is an interplay here whereby the salesman reverses the scale:Source of Sales FailureSalesmanCustomerInterestUnknowDesireInhibitEnforceEnforceInhibitDesireUnknowInterestSalesmen, bringing about an inverted scale, can go downscale themselves as they do it.They seek to interest and meet forgetfulness. They want to sell and meet opposition. They highpressure the customer and get pressured back. And about the time the customer wants theproduct the salesman is reactively inhibiting the sale.

Highest is Pan Determinism.Mid-range is Self-Determinism. Low range is Other-Determinism.The fundamental difficulty is that something has so thoroughly overwhelmed the pc thathe is it. This is Other-Determinism become the person. Mild locks use this route to furtheroverwhelm him. A person doesn’t really find anything in this lifetime that would haveoverwhelmed him enough to aberrate him. It took great doing. Things like prenatals andoperations and shocks just use the existing overwhelm channel.The picture of aberration is this. The person causes an effect, time and time again.Usually this is not aberrative. But one day he causes an unintended effect. He didn’t mean to. Itwas wrong. This is the true overt act—an unintended bad effect. It is not deserved by therecipient. It is a wrong, unintended, undeserved effect. The person now tends to limit hiseffects or withhold his effects. Having been wrong once, he now becomes cautious. Next thinghe knows he has assisted himself to be overwhelmed. He now has an inflow channel overwhich other things, all locks, can now overwhelm him.Eventually he becomes an “other-determinism”. This, of course, can get nothing done,doesn’t outflow, etc., etc., which adds up to all the faults we find in an aberrated person. Forexample, if the pc has been overwhelmed by money, he, in money matters, is now money. Ifyou took some money and threw it on the bed it wouldn’t do a thing. It wouldn’t stack itself upor add up accounts. Money doesn’t do anything. Therefore, the pc, as an other-determinism,does nothing really about money—and this we find annoying in him. It is his aberration.Clearly all one need do as an auditor is to reverse this flow and put the pc at cause overthe button, money, to have the other-determinism (and the overwhelmingness) fade away.Using Problems of Comparable Magnitude or Overt-Withhold Straight Wire or simplereaching, the effect is turned to cause and the pc comes out of it.Assessment is only discovering what has overwhelmed the pc.Auditing is the reversing of other-determined flows by gradient scales, putting the pc atcause again.THE BASIC ERRORThe question was asked me, and a fine question it was, “Why does a thetan make hispostulate fail to stick in the first place? Why would he say, ‘I can get my postulates all messedup and so cause an overt act’?”"},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"Obviously all aberration is third dynamic. The entrance into self-determinism requires thata thetan conceive the idea of other beings. Also he must then conceive that there are zones ofprivacy from which he must not communicate.This error leads to obsessive or fixed channels on which one can be overwhelmed, sincehe “may not” take the position of cause on this channel.Avoidance of the places he must not communicate from leads into all manner ofdifficulties, since this is inhibited communication. A person, therefore, becomes as aberrated ashe cannot communicate, as aberrated as he is overwhelmed by Other-Determinisms, asaberrated as he himself dare not assume cause points.A NEW PROCESSThis leads to a new process, for use “in individual sessions”. The final phrasing is notestablished at this time.“From where could you communicate?” or“Find a place from which you could communicate,” or“Recall a place from which you have communicated.”My first tests show this to be very strong but workable. I have not established the depththis reaches nor the complete effectiveness up scale. But it does reverse Other-Determinismheavily.(This, of course, does not supplant Selected Person Overt-Withhold Straight Wire asfundamental and is not for use in HAS Co-auditing, where Selected Persons Overt-WithholdStraight Wire is the tested allowed process.)This new process may open a faster route to theta clear, even though that route is alreadyvery fast.Note: Apparently this process, LOCATIONAL COMMUNICATION, relieves the facepressures and terror stomachs (after turning them on) which have proved reluctant. Terrorstomachs we have a specific for. Face pressures, we do not have totally taped.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH:m .rdCopyright © 1959by L.

Rather, we emphasize that we are getting their feet on the ladder and as theyprogress up through levels they will achieve all they ever hoped for and more.Jumping to higher levels leaves the lower level disabilities untouched and while trying toaudit somebody at, say, Level III, we will find ourselves struggling with things that shouldhave been handled at Level 0.Further, this target is the one that beginning pcs make the most gains on in myexperience. I recall one near miracle on a girl who couldn’t bring herself to talk to her parentsand all I did was get her to tell me what she’d say to them if she could talk to them.Recalling is too steep for a starting pc. They can’t recall well really until about Level IVwhen they can be cleaned up on their ARC Breaks with Life.Here we have the whole design of Level 0:“Recover the pc’s ability to talk to others freely.”If you realize that a pc can’t be in session unless he is willing to talk to his auditor, youwill also realize that he can’t be in life until he is able to communicate freely with others.Thus any process that does not forward this end is not for Level 0, no matter how franticthe case may be to become clear yesterday.The more hysterical a pc is about getting advanced processes or a case gain, the lessstrenuous the process administered must be. The psychiatrist erred on this one point and itwiped him out as a social benefactor. The more desperate the case, the more desperate were hismeasures. He was just echoing his patients. It is very important for an auditor to realize thisone datum for it is the second guiding rule of Level 0. It is a very senior datum. One must notbecome desperate and use desperate measures just because the pc is desperate or the family orsociety is desperate about the pc. The worse off the pc, the lighter the approach to that pc mustbe.Psychotics (real, gibbering ones) are below auditing treatment in sessions. The measureused for them should be just rest and isolation from their former environments. And the firstprocess used should be just getting the person to realize you are safe and safe to talk to."},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"So, although a few cases are psychotic, this still holds good. The auditor must get the pcto realize he is safe—won’t punish, scold, reprimand or betray confidences—and that theauditor will listen.It doesn’t give the auditor a withhold to not speak of another’s withholds. One can onlywithhold what one oneself has done. What the pc did or said isn’t even subject for a session onthe auditor for withholding it had no aberrative value.Even when we’re Class IV, we still start all our pcs at the pc’s level, which is, for abeginning pc, Level 0.So what we are trying to do with our pcs at Level 0 is the following:1. Recover the pc’s ability to talk to others freely;2. Teach the pc by example the auditor is safe to talk to and won’t scold, reprimand,punish or betray, and3. Refuse to engage in desperate measures just because the pc is desperate; andtherefore get a real, lasting gain for the pc.ROUTINESA routine is a standard process, designed for the best steady gain of the pc at that level.The remedy is different. It is an auditing process which is designed to handle a non-routinesituation. The only real remedy at Level 0 is patching up having failed to hear or understand thepc. The rest is all done by routine. The Case Remedies are at Level II and while we all realizethat every Level 0 case needs a lot of Level II remedies, we also know that no remedy willwork well until the pc is able to talk to others. When you run into trouble at Level 0, there areonly 3 reasons possible:1. The pc was not run in a direction or on a process to improve his or her ability tocommunicate to others;2. The auditor failed to understand the pc’s statements, either words or meanings; or3. The auditor engaged in desperate measures, changed processes, or scolded or didsomething to lower the pc’s feeling of security in the session.That’s all. As you go on up through the levels, you will find many other ways a pc canget upset. But at Level 0, the pc is not close enough to reality on his own case to even betouched by these at first. The pc is a long way off when he first starts getting audited. He canonly approach his own case by degrees. So a pc, no matter how wildly he or she dramatizes atLevel 0, is really only capable of a reality of the smallest kind about self. And such a pc mustbe able to talk before anything else can happen. Pcs can be ruined by someone who doesn’tgrasp that simple fact. Psychiatrists, failing to grasp it, murdered several million people—soit’s no light matter. It’s an important one.A pc at Level 0 usually can’t even conceive of an overt (a harmful act) done by himself.When they can, they go religiously guilty and seek to atone or some such thing. Become amonk. Or commit suicide.The reason 33 1/3 percent of all psycho-analytic patients are said to have committedsuicide in their first three months of treatment is not that they “came too late” but that a lot ofwild data was thrown at them to get at their “source of guilt” and they went head on into thereactive bank, sought to demonstrate their “guilt” by making others guilty and killingthemselves."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"You don’t want anything out of the pc but an increased ability to talk relaxedly to otherswithout fear, embarrassment, suspicion or guilt. So all processes at Level 0 are arrangedaccordingly.WORDINGSTo give all possible wordings of routines that will accomplish the above is completelybeyond need.Once you have the idea of it straight, you can invent them by the dozens.One doesn’t even have to think of a particular pc. All Level 0 processes are good onlywhen they apply to all pcs.ROUTINE 0-0 (Zero-Zero)The starting routine is the most basic of all auditing routines. It is simply “What are youwilling to talk to me about?” Pc answers. “What would you like to tell me about that?”At Level II, the first question alone becomes a remedy. Here the two questions make aroutine—and a very effective one it is!ROUTINE 0-AThis is how the auditor puts together Routine 0-A:1. Make a list of people or things one can’t generally talk to easily! That includesparents, policemen, govemments and God. But it’s a far longer list. The auditormust do this. It must never be published as a “canned” list.2. Using any one of the listed items: “If you could talk to____(listed item) what wouldyou say?”All right, that’s all there is to finding the commands for Routine 0-A.One doesn’t get the pc to do the list. The list isn’t done in session. The auditor does ithimself on his own time. And each auditor must do his own list for his pcs and add to it fromtime to time as he thinks of new ones.The pc isn’t necessarily given any choice of items. The auditor picks one he thinks mayfit. That’s easy to do after one session. The pc keeps complaining about parents. OK. Run 0-Aon parents.And flatten it!By flatten is meant to use that one subject until the pc is darned sure he or she could nowtalk to the item chosen. If the pc still wants to abuse the item, it isn’t flat. If the pc still wants todo something about the item, it is not flat. When the pc is cheerful about the item or no longerfascinated with it, it’s flat.Remember, there’s no need to find out what the pc can’t talk to. In fact, most casesyou’re better off just to take an item of your own for 0-A and use it. May seem strange, butyou’ll have a smoother time of it with the pc. Further you’ll not restimulate (churn up) the pc’sbank so hard.ROUTINE 0-B"},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"The second routine consists of things to talk about.One puts the routine together this way:1. The auditor makes a list (not from the pc but himself) of everything he can think ofthat is banned for any reason from conversation or is not generally consideredacceptable for social communication. This includes non-social subjects like sexualexperiences, W.C. details, embarrassing experiences, thefts one has done, etc.Things nobody would calmly discuss in mixed company.2. An item from the list is included in the auditing command, “What would you bewilling to tell me about _____?” Add the item you choose.3. When they have “run down” (as in clocks) ask them, “Who else could you saythose things to?”4. Rechoose a subject on the list.5. Repeat 3.6. Continue to repeat 4. and 5.Above all, don’t be critical of the pc. And very calmly hear and seek to understand whatthe pc said. (You never, by the way, seek to find out why the pc reacted or responded in someway. A real blunder at Level 0 is “Why did you feel that way?” Or “Why do you think youcan’t say that?” You’re not after the causes of things at Level 0. You will find out why at LevelVI!) At Level 0, just keep them talking while you listen. And you use only the subject chosento keep them talking.ROUTINE 0-CRoutine 0-C is, of course, old R-1-C renamed. It is done without a meter and it has anysubject under the sun included in its command. It is elsewhere covered.In all the above routines it is vital not to alter the commands given above.-------------There are many more possible routines. But to be a Level Zero Routine it must have as itsgoal only freeing up the ability of the pc to talk freely to others.This is not a level to be regarded with a brush-off. It takes a lot of skill to restore a pc’sability to communicate freely.When an auditor has that skill he will succeed at all higher levels.When a pc has that skill regained, his world will look to him to be a far, far better place.So it is very important to get over this first hurdle. And very important not to dodge it andtry to climb the hill anyway. It will become an awfully steep hill.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH :jw.cdenCopyright © 1964by L.

It is therefore rewrittenas follows:The auditor makes a list of things people generally can’t talk to easily. That includesparents, policemen, governments and God. But it’s a far longer list. The auditor must compilethis list himself or herself out of session. It may be added to by the auditor from time to time. Itmust never be published as a “canned list”. Scientology Instructors and Scientology Personnelshould not be listed on it as it leads to upset in sessions.STEP 1. The auditor chooses one of the subjects off the list and uses it in Steps 2 and 3below until the pc is comfortable about it. Subjects from the list can be chosen in sequence or atrandom. A chosen subject is not left until the pc is comfortable about it. By this is meant, the pcwould not feel disturbed talking to the subject chosen.The auditor does not ask the pc which subject or if it is all right to choose that subject asthe pc at the moment of selection is not likely to feel comfortable about any of the listed subjectsand so will just reject. No, the auditor just chooses one and starts on it.STEP 2. The auditor asks, “If you could talk to______(chosen subject), what would youtalk about?” Pc answers one or more things at greater or shorter length.STEP 3. When the pc seems satisfied the question has been answered, the auditor thensays, “All right, if you were talking to______(chosen subject in 1 ) about that what would yousay, exactly?”The pc is expected to speak as though talking to the subject chosen in l.STEP 4. The auditor notes whether pc is comfortable about the subject chosen in Step 1,yet without asking pc. This is done by noting the voice tone or text of what the pc would say.If it is shy, diffident, or if it is belligerent or annoyed, the same subject is retained for a new gowith Steps 2 and 3. If the pc seems bright and cheerful, a new subject is chosen from the listfor a working over with Steps 2 and 3. If the subject in 1 is retained, the auditor again doesSteps 2 and 3 above over and over until the pc is cheerful. A subject chosen in 1 is not left untilthe pc really can respond cheerfully. When this is accomplished, a new subject is chosen asStep 1 and the process is continued with Steps 2 and 3 using the new subject.The whole of Routine 0-A is flat when the pc feels far more comfortable about talking tospecific items and isn’t shying off from items on the list. It is flat, therefore, when an ability isregained on specific items on the list and the list items aren’t producing big new changes in thepc’s communication ability."},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"LISTEN STYLE CO-AUDITIt is expected that by the time an auditor is permitted to do the Zero Routines, IndividualListen Style will have been entered upon.Until the class seems able to run individual sessions, old “R-1-C” can be used by theauditing supervisor on a group basis using Listen Style Co-audit until the group has the idea ofsessions.Routines work best on Individual Listen Style. The pc is always wondering, in ListenStyle Co-audit, if the auditing supervisor is listening to him personally. The auditor is not thereceipt point of the pc’s comm in many instances.Old R-1-C is the best training mechanism to get auditors to run sessions. In this processthe auditing supervisor just chooses something for all the pcs to talk to the auditors about, like adynamic or a common social problem.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH:jw.rdCopyright © 1964by L.

The first number indicates the level taughton. Those that begin with TR00 - are level Zero drills. Unbullbaited drills end with oddnumbers; and bullbaited drills end in even numbers.Simply start with the first actions and work through the drills applying themunbullbaited and bullbaited, until you are thoroughly familiar with each separate auditing actionand can apply it flawlessly, even with distractions.If a student has trouble on a drill, cut back the gradient. On a bullbaited drill this couldmean returning the student to the drill on a doll or even to TR 0-4.IMPORTANT. ALSO CHECK THAT THE STUDENT HIMSELF HAS NOMISUNDERSTOOD WORDS ON THE BULLETIN OR DRILL, AS THIS WILL CAUSEHIM TO ALTER-IS AND HAVE DIFFICULTY. GET HIM WORD CLEARED.NOTE: If coach upset occurs because of restimulation, fruit words should be inserted in theplace of the process key words, for bullbaited drills only.FORMAT FOR UNBULLBAITED DRILLSNAME: Auditing on a Doll Unbullbaited.COMMANDS: As for each separate process.PURPOSE: To train the student to be able to co-ordinate and apply the commands andprocedures of each separate auditing action with the actual doingness of auditing.POSITION: Student seated at a table with E-Meter, worksheets and auditing forms as needed.In the chair opposite the student is a doll occupying the position of the PC. (During the drill thecoach is seated or standing beside the Auditor. He does not take the position of the doll.)TRAINING STRESS: This drill is coached. The student sets up the E-Meter and worksheetsexactly as in a session - as follows :1. Set up E-Meter as for E-Meter drills."},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"2. Set up shield (to prevent TA and admin from being seen by PC (doll).3. Have extra pens under the E-Meter.4. Have C/S face down between the bottom of the E-Meter and the table.5. Have W/S and lists readily available in sequence required for the session.Auditor starts the session and runs a standard session with the particular auditing actionbeing taken up on the doll, keeping full session admin and using all standard procedures of theauditing action, coaching on a gradient handling one outness at a time.The drill is done on a steeper and steeper gradient until the student can very quickly dothe action correctly and flawlessly.The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with good TRs 0-4,correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion; ie flublessly!FORMAT TO BE USED FOR BULLBAITED DRILLSNAME: Auditing ______________ bullbaited.COMMANDS: As for each separate auditing action.PURPOSE: To train the student to be able to co-ordinate and apply the commands andprocedures of each separate auditing action in a drill similar to a real auditing session andthereby become flawless in applying it.POSITION: Student seated at a table with E-Meter and Auditor forms as needed. In the chairopposite the Auditor is the coach (bullbaiter), as PC.TRAINING STRESS: The drill is the same as for auditing on a doll except that the “PC” coachbullbaits the student Auditor using “fruit” answers during the session in an attempt to throw thestudent off session. On any lists the coach squeezes the cans to simulate reads. He still uses“fruit” answers (six apples, blue pears) when asked to speak, but as the student Auditor readsoff the list items (ex. L3RD) he squeezes the cans for reads.When bullbaiting an auditing action the coach should THROW IN VARIOUS SIGNSOF PC OUT OF SESSIONNESS. (Per HCOB on Good Indicators and BTB on BadIndicators. The student Auditor must:1. Obnose the out of sessionness.2. Align this to the process and to his level of training.3. Handle.The PC bullbaiter can throw in situations, originate troubles or gains, be tricky, etc. Buthe must never lose sight of HCOB 24 May 1968, “Coaching”, especially the second paragraph,“Coach with reality”.Once the coach throws out a situation, etc. he must allow the student Auditor to carry itout and handle the situation before the coach calls a new situation.Stress is on training the student Auditor to have his TRs 0-4 IN on the bullbaiter.The coach (bullbaiter) does the”Start”, flunking or “That’s it”. flunks are given for anyimproper commands, procedure, comm lags, break in TRs or improper session admin."},{"pageNumber":470,"pageContent":"Each drill is to be done thoroughly building up the speed of Auditor commands andactions. (“It’s the number of auditing commands per unit of auditing time which makes gains ina session,” LRH)The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with excellent TRs 0-4,correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion.These are the drills that train the student Auditor to handle all the elements in a session,so be exact and be real.REF: BTB 5 Jan 72 Rev. 18 June 74, O-IV Expanded Grade Processes - Triples Part B Grade 0 ProcessesGRADE 0 EXPANDED PROCESSESTR 00 - 27 R2-31 UNBULLBAITEDTR 00 - 28 R2-31 BULLBAITEDREF: Creation of Human Ability p. 74.(Use basic drill format.)STEPS:1.

A copy of this checklist is placed in the folder of a pcbeing run on Expanded Grades and the processes checked off with the date each is run to EP.On any of these processes where the pc answers only yes or that he did it find out whatit was by asking”What was it?” This keeps in the itsa line from the pc to auditor.This bulletin does not replace Source data.R2-31 BEINGNESS PROCESSINGRef: CREATION OF HUMAN ABILITY“Look around the room and discover some object which you don’t mind being present.”“Locate something else you don’t mind being present.”TO NO COMM LAG OR TO EP_________“Now see this (room object) here?”“All right, what else wouldn’t you mind this (room object) being?”TO NO COMM LAG OR TO EP_________“Now what wouldn’t you mind your body being?”“And now what else wouldn’t you mind your body being?”TO NO COMM LAG OR TO EP_________“Now let’s find something you wouldn’t mind being.”“What else wouldn’t you mind being?”TO EP_________This process is not Quaded as it would change the process but it is included in this BTB as it ispart of Expanded Grade 0.AXIOM 51 COMM PROCESSINGRef: PAB 56, 8 July 1955."},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"Run on list of charged terminals culled from worksheets.F-1 “What wouldn’t _____ mind you communicating with?”TO EP_________F-2 “What wouldn’t you mind_____communicating with?”TO EP_________F-3 “What wouldn’t others mind_____communicating with?” TO EP_________F-0 “If you were a_____what wouldn’t you mind yourself communicating with?”TO EP_________PAB 54 COMM PROCESSRef: PAB 54, 10 Jun 55.“Think a thought”TO EP_________Part of the”Think a thought” process is to have the preclear place the thought in variouslocations after he has thought it.
