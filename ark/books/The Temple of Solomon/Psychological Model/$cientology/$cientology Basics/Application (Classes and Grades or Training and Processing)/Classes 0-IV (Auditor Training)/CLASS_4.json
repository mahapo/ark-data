Within5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. “Quickie grades”entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this PolicyLetter are HIGH CRIMES resulting in Comm Evs on ADMINISTRATORS and EXECUTIVES. It is not“entirely a tech matter” as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a 2 year slump. IT IS THE BUSINESS OFEVERY STAFF MEMBER to enforce it.ALL LEVELSKEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKINGHCO Sec or Communicator Hat Checkon all personnel and new personnelas taken on.We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology.The only thing now is getting the technology applied.If you can’t get the technology applied then you can’t deliver what’s promised. It’s assimple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what’s promised.The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is “no results”. Troublespots occur only where there are “no results”. Attacks from governments or monopolies occuronly where there are “no results” or “bad results”.Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if thetechnology is applied.So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P,the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied.Getting the correct technology applied consists of:One: Having the correct technology.Two: Knowing the technology.Three: Knowing it is correct.Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Five: Applying the technology.Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied.Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology.Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications.Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology.Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application.One above has been done.Two has been achieved by many.Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper mannerand observing that it works that way.Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world.Five is consistently accomplished daily.Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently.Seven is done by a few but is a weak point.Eight is not worked on hard enough.Nine is impeded by the “reasonable” attitude of the not quite bright.Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity.Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area.The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Threeabove can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too-bright havea bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shutoff from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselvesagainst anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks toknock out the good and perpetuate the bad.Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight,Nine and Ten.In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide openfor research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of Century hasthoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only ahandful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long run value and none were major or basic; andwhen I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I repented andeventually had to “eat crow”.On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions andwritings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction ofall our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and howinsane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology”. By actual record the percentages areabout twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroygood technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had better steel"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attackedas “unpopular” “egotistical” and “undemocratic”. It very well may be. But it is also a survivalpoint And I don’t see that popular measures, self- abnegation and democracy have doneanything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorse degradednovels, self- abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses,and democracy has given us inflation and income tax.Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had nosupported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that in itsformative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume,will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done.There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which willbe valuable-only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications.The contributions that were worth while in this period of forming the technology werehelp in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, ofadvices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are,appreciated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discoverycontribution was not however part of the broad picture.We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank.We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact-the group left to its own devices would nothave evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called “new ideas” wouldhave wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workablemental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve-psychiatry,psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infinitum.So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense,and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlesslyfollowed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish.So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I havenot failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’s not goodenough for just myself and a few others to work at this.Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight. Nine and Ten has been relaxed the wholeorganizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.l., Wichita, the early organizations andgroups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, whenthey were all messed up you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. But ahead of that theyceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons.The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks havedifferent responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bankprinciples. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual andseldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid cravingfor agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement hasbeen what has made Earth a Hell-and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it wouldcertainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the greatgovernments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on theplanet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasantthings on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by theGroup Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by “public opinion” media.Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves.Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group offreed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that isdestructive."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bankdominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it,(b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and(d) encourage incorrect application.It’s the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the Bank thatsays we must fail.So just don’t play that tune. Do Seven. Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out ofyour road all the future thorns.Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pcspin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C.Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak on Threeabove and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the CaseSupervisor “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly at each of One toSix above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door tothe introduction of “new technology” and to failure.What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s all thathappened. This is what he should have done: Grabbed the Auditor’s report and looked it over,When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the restmissed: that. Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but thatnear session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while itstill gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B’s own manufacture, which nearlyspun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A wasfound to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The CaseSupervisor was found to be “too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases”.All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven,Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That process X didn’twork.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s your auditor’sreport for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stoppedProcess X. What did you do?” Then the Pc wouldn’t have come close to a spin and all four ofthese would have retained certainty.In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct processrecommended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one had (a)increased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable.Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process crackedthe case. Yet they were reported as not having worked!Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every timeinstruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the auditor,is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten areeven more important in a course than in supervision of cases.Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “because hegets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisions asession are reported. “Of course his model session is poor but it’s just knack he has” is alsoincluded in the recommendation. A careful review is undertake because nobody at levels O toIV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read anE-Meter dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered thathe “overcompensated” nervously swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed togo to place the needle at “set”. So everyone was about to throw away standard processes andmodel session because this one student “got such remarkable TA”. They only read the reportsand listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were makingslightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hidden under a lot of departuresand errors.I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot ofoff-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The academy students were in a stateof electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought under control andthe student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck.Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wifedied of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough instructor at that moment couldhave salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to dowhatever they pleased.Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes aboutfrom non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but someearlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood.When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can becounted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came fromorgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology under instruction inScientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And theorgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened outeasily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. hence, adebacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So properinstruction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must bemerciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student,dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be thecause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology gothome to him.With what we know now, there is no student we enrol who cannot be properly trained.As an instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards insideout personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeve rolled up can crack theback of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole classonly. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don’t wait untilnext week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him. If you can’t graduate them with theirgood sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll havenightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three inthem and they’ll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing.When somebody enrols, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of theuniverse- never permit an “open-minded” approach. If they’re going to quit let then quit fast. Ifthey enroled, they’re aboard, and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the same terms as the restof us- win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. Thefinest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pambybunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It’s a tough universe. The socialveneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive-and even they have a hard time. We’llsurvive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly hebecomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scaredto enforce, we don’t make students into good Scientologists and that let’s everybody down.When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in he eye into afixed, dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. Theproper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist Now we’re going to makeyou into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you dead that incapable.”Fitting that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the crosswe have to bear.But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and timewe will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow. Fast. And as wegrow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less.So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s ourpossible failure to retain and practise our technology.An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of“unworkability”. They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or notdone.If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all therest.We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to do forlack of something better.The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and yourown destiny for the next endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now withand in Scientology.This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we maynever again have another chance.Remember, this is a our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of thepast. Don’t muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine andTen.Do them and we’ll win.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1965, 1970by L.

The statement is a falsehood.These checksheets were not approved by myself, all the material of the Academy and SHcourses IS in use.Such actions as this gave us “Quickie Grades”, ARC Broke the field and downgraded theAcademy and SH Courses.A condition of TREASON or cancellation of certificates or dismissal and a fullinvestigation of the background of any person found guilty, will be activated in the case ofanyone committing the following HIGH CRIMES.1. Abbreviating an official Course in Dianetics and Scientology so as to lose the fulltheory, processes and effectiveness of the subjects.2.

Shortening time of application of auditing for financial or laborsavingconsiderations.10. Acting in any way calculated to lose the technology of Dianetics and Scientology touse or impede its use or shorten its materials or its application.REASON: The effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs wasconsidered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades. The pressureexerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered byjust not delivering.The correct way to speed up a student’s progress is by using 2 way comm and applyingthe study materials to students.The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going onto the next and repairing them when they do not.The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirelyanswered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materialsand actions.Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to anyrecovery.The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs. When theproduct vanishes, so does the org. The orgs must survive for the sake of this planet.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1970by L.

It means altering Scientology, off-beatpractices. It is a bad thing. I have found a way to explain why.Scientology is a workable system. This does not mean it is the best possible system or aperfect system. Remember and use that definition. Scientology is a workable system.In fifty thousand years of history on this planet alone, Man never evolved a workablesystem. It is doubtful if, in foreseeable history, he will ever evolve another.Man is caught in a huge and complex labyrinth. To get out of it requires that he follow theclosely taped path of Scientology.Scientology will take him out of the labyrinth. But only if he follows the exact markingsin the tunnels.It has taken me a third of a century in this lifetime to tape this route out.It has been proven that efforts by Man to find different routes came to nothing. It is also aclear fact that the route called Scientology does lead out of the labyrinth Therefore it is aworkable system, a route that can be travelled.What would you think of a guide who, because his party said it was dark and the roadrough and who said another tunnel looked better, abandoned the route he knew would lead outand led his party to a lost nowhere in the dark. You’d think he was a pretty wishy-washyguide.What would you think of a supervisor who let a student depart from procedure thesupervisor knew worked. You’d think he was a pretty wishy-washy supervisor.What would happen in a labyrinth if the guide let some girl stop in a pretty canyon andleft her there forever to contemplate the rocks? You’d think he was a pretty heartless guide.You’d expect him to say at least, “Miss, those rocks may be pretty, but the road out doesn’t gothat way.”All right, how about an auditor who abandons the procedure which will make his precleareventually clear just because the preclear had a cognition?People have following the route mixed up with “the right to have their own ideas.”Anyone is certainly entitled to have opinions and ideas and cognitions—so long as these do notbar the route out for self and others.Scientology is a workable system. It white tapes the road out of the labyrinth If therewere no white tapes marking the right tunnels, Man would just go on wandering around andaround the way he has for eons, darting off on wrong roads, going in circles, ending up in thesticky dark, alone."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Scientology, exactly and correctly followed, takes the person up and out of the mess.So when you see somebody having a ball getting everyone to take peyote because itrestimulates prenatals, know he is pulling people off the route. Realize he is squirreling. Heisn’t following the route.Scientology is a new thing- it is a road out. There has not been one. Not all thesalesmanship in the world can make a bad route a proper route. And an awful lot of bad routesare being sold. Their end product is further slavery, more darkness, more misery.Scientology is the only workable system Man has It has already taken people towardhigher I.Q., better lives and all that. No other system has. So realize that it has no competitor.Scientology is a workable system. It has the route taped. The search is done. Now theroute only needs to be walked.So put the feet of students and preclears on that route. Don’t let them off of it no matterhow fascinating the side roads seem to them. And move them on up and out.Squirreling is today destructive of a workable system.Don’t let your party down. By whatever means, keep them on the route. And they’ll befree. If you don’t, they won’t.L.

It produces a stable gain. Thisis true of every level on up.We have just had a PreOT whose case at every level “was going to be solved by the nextlevel”. People kept saying he “needed the next level” to solve his case. Bull. He got all the wayto OT II before I caught wind of it. He “had to have OT III” to solve his case according to theQual Sec.That case probably never made ARC Straight Wire! One or more earlier levels or ruds or7 cases are out. That’s the trouble with that case.If you now let him go on to OT III he’d cop it.The tech you are handling is capable of giving spectacular gains at every level.

The auditing skill of any student remains only as good as he can do his TRs.2. Flubs in TRs are the basis of all confusion in subsequent efforts to audit.3.

Almost all confusions on Meter, Model Sessions and Scientology or Dianetic processesstem directly from inability to do the TRs.5. A student who has not mastered his TRs will not master anything further.6. Scientology or Dianetic processes will not function in the presence of bad TRs. Thepreclear is already being overwhelmed by process velocity and cannot bear up to TR flubswithout ARC breaks.Academies were tough on TRs up to 1958 and have since tended to soften. CommCourses are not a tea party.These TRs given here should be put in use at once in all auditor training, in Academy andHGC and in the future should never be relaxed.Public courses on TRs are NOT “softened” because they are for the Public.

The coach repeats any line he feels was not trulyacknowledged.POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other at a comfortable distance apart.TRAINING STRESS: Teach student to acknowledge exactly what was said so preclear knowsit was heard. Ask student from time to time what was said. Curb over and underacknowledgement. Let student do anything at first to get acknowledgement across, then evenhim out. Teach him that an acknowledgement is a stop, not beginning of a new cycle ofcommunication or an encouragement to the preclear to go on.To teach further that one can fail to get an acknowledgement across or can fail to stop a pc withan acknowledgement or can take a pc’s head off with an acknowledgement.PATTER: The coach says “Start”, reads a line and says “Flunk” every time the coach feelsthere has been an improper acknowledgement. The coach repeats the same line each time thecoach says “Flunk”. “That’s it” may be used to terminate for discussion or terminate thesession. “Start” must be used to begin a new coaching after a “That’s it”.HISTORY: Developed by L.

Toteach that one never asks a second question until he has received an answer to the one asked.COMMANDS: “Do fish swim?” or “Do birds fly?”"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"POSITION: Student and coach seated a comfortable distance apart.TRAINING STRESS: One question and student acknowledgement of its answer in one unitof time which is then finished. To keep student from straying into variations of command.Even though the same question is asked, it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyonebefore.The student must learn to give a command and receive an answer and to acknowledge it in oneunit of time.The student is flunked if he or she fails to get an answer to the question asked, if he or she failsto repeat the exact questions, if he or she Q and As with excursions taken by the coach.PATTER: The coach uses “Start” and “That’s it”, as in earlier TRs. The coach is not boundafter starting to answer the student’s question but may comm lag or give a commenting typeanswer to throw the student off. Often the coach should answer.Somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student in to a Q and A or upset the student.Example:Student: “Do fish swim?” Coach: “Yes.” Student: “Good . “ Student: “Do fish swim?” Coach:“Aren’t you hungry?” Student: “Yes.” Coach: “Flunk.”When the question is not answered, the student must say, gently, “I’ll repeat the auditingquestion,” and do so until he gets an answer. Anything except commands, acknowledgementand, as needed, the repeat statement, is flunked. Unnecessary use of the repeat statement isflunked. A poor command is flunked. A poor acknowledgement is flunked. A Q and A isflunked (as in example). Student misemotion or confusion is flunked. Student failure to utterthe next command without a long comm lag is flunked. A choppy or prematureacknowledgement is flunked. Lack of an acknowledgement (or with a distinct comm lag) isflunked. Any words from the coach except an answer to the question, “Start”, “Flunk”,“Good” or “That’s it”, should have no influence on the student except to get him to give arepeat statement and the command again. By repeat statement is meant, “I’ll repeat the auditingcommand.”“Start”, “Flunk”, “Good” and “That’s it” may not be used to fluster or trap the student. Anyother statement under the sun may be. The coach may try to leave his chair in this TR. If hesucceeds it is a flunk. The coach should not use introverted statements such as “I just had acognition.” “Coach divertive” statements should all concern the student, and should bedesigned to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of whatthe student is doing. The student’s job is to keep a session going in spite of anything, usingonly command, the repeat statement or the acknowledgement. The student may use his or herhands to prevent a “Blow” (leaving) of the coach. If the student does anything else than theabove, it is a flunk and the coach must say so.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to overcome variationsand sudden changes in sessions. Revised 1961 by L. Ron Hubbard. The old TR has a commbridge as part of its training but this is now part of and is taught in Model Session and is nolonger needed at this level. Auditors have been frail in getting their questions answered. ThisTR was redesigned to improve that frailty.NUMBER: TR 4 REVISED 1961NAME: Preclear Originations.PURPOSE: To teach the student not to be tongue-tied or startled or thrown off session byoriginations of preclear and to maintain ARC with preclear throughout an origination."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"COMMANDS: The student runs “Do fish swim?” or “Do birds fly?” on coach. Coachanswers but now and then makes startling comments from a prepared list given by Supervisor.Student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach.POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other at a comfortable distance apart.TRAINING STRESS: The student is taught to hear origination and do three things. 1.Understand it; 2. Acknowledge it; and 3. Return preclear to session. If the coach feelsabruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he corrects the student intobetter handling.PATTER: All originations concern the coach, his ideas, reactions or difficulties, none concernthe auditor. Otherwise the patter is the same as in earlier TRs. The student’s patter is governedby: 1 . Clarifying and understanding the origin. 2. Acknowledging the origin. 3. Giving therepeat statement “I’ll repeat the auditing command,” and then giving it. Anything else is aflunk.The auditor must be taught to prevent ARC breaks and differentiate between a vital problem thatconcerns the pc and a mere effort to blow session. (TR 3 Revised.) Flunks are given if thestudent does more than 1. Understand; 2. Acknowledge; 3. Return pc to session.Coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on TR 3. Student’s failure to differentiatebetween these (by trying to handle them) and coach’s remarks about self as “pc” is a flunk.Student’s failure to persist is always a flunk in any TR but here more so. Coach should notalways read from list to originate, and not always look at student when about to comment. ByOriginate is meant a statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case. ByComment is meant a statement or remark aimed only at student or room. Originations arehandled, Comments are disregarded by the student.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to teach auditors to stayin session when preclear dives out. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditormore about handling origins and preventing ARC breaks.As TR 5 is also part of the CCHs it can be disregarded in the Comm Course TRs despite itsappearance on earlier lists for students and staff auditors.TRAINING NOTEIt is better to go through these TRs several times getting tougher each time than to hang on oneTR forever or to be so tough at start student goes into a decline.L.

Misapplication of this definition can result in underrunand overrun processes or actions and the pc snarled up with BPC.TYPES OF EPsIn Power Processing the auditor waits for a specific EP and does not indicate an F/Nuntil he has gotten the specific EP for the process. To miss on this in Power is disastrous, thusPower auditors are drilled and drilled on the handling of Power EPs.In Dianetics, the EP of a chain is erasure, accompanied by an F/N, cognition and goodindicators. You wouldn’t necessarily expect rave indicators on a pc in the middle of an assist,under emotional or physical stress until the full assist was completed though. What you wouldexpect is the chain blown with an F/N. Those two things themselves are good indicators. Thecognition could simply be “the chain blew”.In Scientology, End Phenomena vary with what you’re auditing. An ARC Broken pc onan L-1C will peel off charge and come uptone gradually as each reading line is handled.Sometimes it comes in a spectacular huge cog and VVGIs and dial F/N, but that’s usually aftercharge has been taken off on a gradient. What’s expected is an F/N as that charge beinghandled moves off.In Ruds it’s the same idea. When you’ve got your F/N and that charge has moved off,indicate it. Don’t push the pc on and on for some “EP”. You’ve got it.Now a major grade process will run to F/N, Cog, VGIs and release. You’ll have anability regained. But that’s a grade process on a set up flying pc.F/N ABUSEMistakenly applying the Power EP rule to Ruds will have the pc messed up by overrun. Itinvalidates the pc’s wins and keys the charge back in. The pc will start thinking he hasn’tblown the charge and can’t do anything about it.In 1970 I had to write the HCO B “F/Ns and End Phenomena” to cure auditors ofchopping pc EPs on major actions by indicating F/Ns too soon. This is one type of F/N abusewhich has largely been handled.That bulletin and Power EP handling have been in some instances misapplied in thedirection of overrun. “The pc isn’t getting EP on these chains as there’s no cognition, just ‘it"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"erased’,” is one example. Obviously the C/S didn’t understand the definition of cognition orwhat an EP is. Another example is the pc spots what it is and F/Ns and the auditor carries on,expecting an “EP”.OTs and EPsAn OT is particularly subject to F/N abuse as he can blow things quite rapidly. If theauditor misses the F/N due to too high a sensitivity setting or doesn’t call it as he’s waiting foran “EP”, overrun occurs. It invalidates an OT’s ability to as-is and causes severe upsets.This error can also stem from auditor speed. The auditor, used to auditing lower level pcsor never trained to audit OTs, can’t keep up with the OT and misses his F/Ns or reads.Thus overruns occur and charged areas are bypassed.This could account for those cases who were flying then fell on their heads with the sameproblems that blew back again.REMEDYThe remedy of this problem begins with thoroughly clearing all terms connected withEPs. This is basically Word Clearing Method 6, Key Words.The next action is to get my HCO Bs on the subject of EPs and also related meteringHCO Bs fully understood and starrated. This would be followed by clay demos of various EPsof processes and actions showing the mechanics of the bank and what happens with the pc andmeter.TRs and meter drills on spotting F/Ns would follow, including any needed obnosis drillsand correction of meter position so that the auditor could see the pc, meter and his admin at aglance.Then, the auditor would be gradiently drilled on handling the pc, meter and admin atincreasing rates of speed including recognizing and indicating EPs when they occurred. Whenthe auditor could do all of this smoothly at the high rate of speed of an OT blowing things byinspection without fumbling, the last action would be bullbaited drills like TRs 103 and 104, ona gradient to a level of competence whereby the auditor could handle anything that came up atspeed and do so smoothly.Then you’d really have an OT auditor. And that’s what you’ll have to do to make them.SUMMARYOverrun and underrun alike mess up cases.Both stem from an auditor inability to recognize and handle different types of EPs andinexpertness in handling the tools of auditing at speed.Don’t overrun pcs and have to repair them.Let the pc have his wins.LRH:ams.rd L.

The coach’s needle is dirty. The student’s out comm cycle has cut his comm insome way, but PRIOR to that the coach failed to flunk the part of the comm cyclethat went out. Correct flunking by coaches equals students with no dirty needles.2. If a coach’s TA starts climbing on a drill and the needle gets sticky, it means that thestudent’s comm cycle has dispersed him and pushed him out of PT. The coach iseither (1) not flunking at all (2) flunking the incorrect thing.3. The correct flunking by the coach of an out comm cycle, which has dispersed himand pushed his TA up, will always result in a TA blowdown. If there is noblowdown, the coach has flunked the wrong thing.4. Needle not responding well and sensitively on assessment drills, although theneedle clean. Coach has failed to flunk TR 1 (or TR0) for lack of impingement andreach.5. Coach reaching forward and leaning on the table, means TR 1 is out with thestudent.6. Student asking coach for considerations to get TA down, but TA climbing on theconsiderations—the coach is cleaning a clean, instead of flunking the out commcycle, which occurred earlier and pushed his TA up.7. Student getting coach’s considerations off to clean the needle, but needle remainingdirty—student is cutting the coach’s comm while getting the considerations off andthe coach is not picking this up.8. Students shouting or talking very loudly on assessment drills to try and get theMeter to read by overwhelm. The reason for this is invariably—”but I’m assessingthe bank!” They haven’t realized that banks don’t read, only thetans impinged uponby the bank—therefore the TR1 must be addressed to the thetan. The meterresponds proportionately to the amount of ARC in the Session.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH:emp.rdCopyright © 1965by L.

He isn’t well. Analysts had people talk for five yearsand they seldom got well.So how is it supposed to happen today that a pc, let talk enough, will get well.It won’t.The auditor does not know the very basics of auditing skills. That’s all. These are theTRs.An auditor who can’t do his TRs can’t audit. Period.Instead he says he is “letting the pc Itsa”.If by this he means he is letting the pc drive all over the road and in both ditches, then thisisn’t auditing.In auditing an auditor guides. He gives the pc something to answer. When the pc answersthe pc has said “IT IS A ......” and that’s Itsa.If the pc answers and the auditor acknowledges too soon the pc tends to go into ananxiety—he has been chopped. So he talks more than he wanted.If the pc answers and the auditor does not acknowledge, then the pc talks on and on,hoping for an acknowledgement that doesn’t come, “runs dry”, tries again, etc.So premature or late-or-never acks result in the same thing—the pc running on and onand on.And they call it “letting the pc Itsa”. Bah! If a pc talks too much in session he either isgetting cut off too fast by the auditor or hasn’t got an auditor at all. It isn’t “Itsa”. It’s lousy"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"TRs. (The one single exception is the pc who had years in analysis but even he begins to getbetter with proper TRs used on him.)The proper cure is to drill the auditor until the auditor realizes:1. The auditor asks the questions.2. The pc says what is the answer, “It’s a .......”3. The auditor acks when the pc has said it to the pc’s satisfaction and4. The auditor acks when the pc has finished saying “It’s a .......”And that’s Itsa.Scientology auditing is a precision skill, not a gag blop goo slup guck blah.1. The auditor wants to know ........2. The pc says it is ........1.2.1.2.1.2. etc.TECH SAVVYNow an auditor who doesn’t know his technology about the mind and his processes ofcourse never knows what to ask. So he or she simply sits like a lump of sacking hoping the pcwill say something that makes the pc feel better.A sure sign that an auditor doesn’t know an engram from a cow about processes is seeinga pc “Itsa” on and on and on.In Scientology we do know what the mind is, what a being is, what goes wrong in themind and how to correct it.We aren’t psychoanalysts or psychiatrists or Harley Street witch doctors. We do knowThe data about beings and life is there in Scientology to be learned.It isn’t “our idea” of how things are, or “our opinion of” ....Scientology is a precision subject. It has axioms. Like geometry. Two equilateraltriangles aren’t similar because Euclid said so. They’re similar because they are. If you don’tbelieve it, look at them.There isn’t a single datum in Scientology that can’t be proven as precisely as teacups areteacups and not saucepans.Now if we get a person fresh out of the study of “the mystical metaphysics of Cuffbah”he’s going to have trouble. His pcs are going to “Itsa” their heads off and never get well orbetter or anything. Because that person doesn’t know Scientology but thinks it’s all impreciseopinion.The news about Scientology is that it put the study of the mind into the precise exactsciences. If one doesn’t know that, one’s pcs “Itsa” by the hour for one doesn’t know what heis handling that he is calling “a pc”.By my definition, an auditor is a real auditor when his or her pcs DON’T overtalk orundertalk but answer the auditing question and happily now and then originate."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"So how to tell an auditor, how to determine if you have trained one at last, is DO HISPCS ANSWER UP OR DO THEY TALK ON AND ON.If I had an auditor in an HGC whose pcs yapped and yapped and ran dry and yappedwhile the auditor just sat there like a Chinese pilot frozen on the controls, I would do thefollowing to that “auditor”:1.

Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICESaint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, SussexHCO BULLETIN OF 6 NOVEMBER AD14RemimeoFranchiseSthil StudentsSTYLES OF AUDITINGNote 1: Most old-time auditors, particularly Saint Hill Graduates, havebeen trained at one time or another in these auditing styles. Here theyare given names and assigned to Levels so that they can be taught moreeasily and so that general auditing can be improved.(Note 2: These have not been written before because I had notdetermined the results vital to each Level.)There is a Style of auditing for each class. By Style is meant a method or custom ofperforming actions.A Style is not really determined by the process being run so much. A Style is how theauditor addresses his task.Different processes carry different style requirements perhaps, but that is not the point.Clay Table Healing at Level III can be run with Level I style and still have some gains. But anauditor trained up to the style required at Level III would do a better job not only of CT Healingbut of any repetitive process.Style is how the auditor audits. The real expert can do them all, but only after he can doeach one. Style is a mark of Class. It is not individual. In our meaning, it is a distinct way tohandle the tools of auditing.LEVEL ZEROLISTEN STYLEAt Level 0 the Style is Listen Style Auditing. Here the auditor is expected to listen to thepc. The only skill necessary is listening to another. As soon as it is ascertained that the auditoris listening (not just confronting or ignoring) the auditor can be checked out. The length of timean auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be a factor. What the pc does isnot a factor considered in judging this style. Pcs, however, talk to an auditor who is reallylistening.Here we have the highest point that old-time mental therapies reached (when they didreach it), such as psychoanalysis, when they helped anyone. Mostly they were well below this,evaluating, invalidating, interrupting. These three things are what the instructor in this styleshould try to put across to the HAS student.Listen Style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this:Listen to the pc without evaluating, invalidating or interrupting.Adding on higher skills like “Is the pc talking interestingly?” or even “Is the pc talking?”is no part of this style. When this auditor gets in trouble and the pc won’t talk or isn’tinterested, a higher classed auditor is called in, a new question given by the supervisor, etc.It really isn’t “Itsa” to be very technical. Itsa is the action of the pc saying, “It’s a this” or“It’s a that.” Getting the pc to Itsa is quite beyond Listen Style auditors where the pc won’t. It’sthe supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to Itsa."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The ability to listen, learned well, stays with the auditor up through the grades. Onedoesn’t cease to use it even at Level VI. But one has to learn it somewhere and that’s at LevelZero. So Listen Style Auditing is just listening. It thereafter adds into the other styles.LEVEL ONEMUZZLED AUDITINGThis could also be called rote style auditing.Muzzled Auditing has been with us many years. It is the stark total of TRs 0 to 4 and notanything else added.It is called so because auditors too often added in comments, Qed and Aed, deviated,discussed and otherwise messed up a session. Muzzle meant a “muzzle was put on them”,figuratively speaking, so they would only state the auditing command and ack.Repetitive Command Auditing, using TRs 0 to 4, at Level One is done completelymuzzled.This could be called Muzzled Repetitive Auditing Style but will be called “Muzzled Style”for the sake of brevity.It has been a matter of long experience that pcs who didn’t make gains with the partiallytrained auditor permitted to two-way comm, did make gains the instant the auditor wasmuzzled: to wit, not permitted to do a thing but run the process, permitted to say nothing butthe commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgmentwithout any other question or comment.At Level One we don’t expect the auditor to do anything but state the command (or ask thequestion) with no variation, acknowledge the pc’s answer and handle the pc origins byunderstanding and acknowledging what the pc said.Those processes used at Level One actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst tomisguided efforts to “Two-Way Comm”.Listen Style combines with Muzzled Style easily. But watch out that Level One sessionsdon’t disintegrate to Level Zero.Crisp, clean repetitive commands, muzzled, given and answered often, are the road out—not pc wanderings.A pc at this Level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him, exactly what the auditorwill do. The pc is even put through a few “do birds fly?” cycles until the pc gets the idea. Thenthe processing works.An auditor trying to do Muzzled Repetitive Auditing on a pc who, through past “therapyexperience”, is rambling on and on is a sad sight. It means that control is out (or that the pcnever got above Level Zero).It’s the number of commands given and answered in a unit of auditing time that gets gains.To that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have a release in short order, usingthe processes of this Level.To follow limp Listen Style with crisp, controlled Muzzled Style may be a shock. But theyare each the lowest of the two families of auditing styles—Totally Permissive and TotallyControlled. And they are so different each is easy to learn with no confusion. It’s been the lackof difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about. Well, these two are"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"different enough—Listen Style and Muzzled Style—to set anybody straight.LEVEL TWOGUIDING STYLE AUDITINGAn old-time auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names: (a) Two-Way Comm and (b) Formal Auditing.We condense these two old styles under one new name: Guiding Style Auditing.One first guides the pc by “two-way comm” into some subject that has to be handled orinto revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitivecommands.Guiding Style Auditing becomes feasible only when a student can do Listen Style andMuzzled Style Auditing well.Formerly the student who couldn’t confront or duplicate a command took refuge insloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or “Two-Way Comm”.The first thing to know about Guiding Style is that one lets the pc talk and Itsa withoutchop, but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitivecommands.We presuppose the auditor at this Level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy theviewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc. We also presuppose at thisLevel that the auditor, being able to occupy a viewpoint, is therefore more self-determined, thetwo things being related. (One can only be self-determined when one can observe the actualsituation before one: otherwise a being is delusion-determined or other-determined.)Thus in Guiding Style Auditing, the auditor is there to find out what’s what from the pcand then apply the needful remedy.Most of the processes in the Book of Remedies are included in this Level (II). To usethose, one has to observe the pc, discover what the pc is doing, and remedy the pc’s caseaccordingly.The result for the pc is a far-reaching re-orientation in Life.Thus the essentials of Guiding Style Auditing consist of Two-Way Comm that steers thepc into revealing a difficulty followed by a repetitive process to handle what has been revealed.One does expert TRs but one may discuss things with the pc, let the pc talk and in generalone audits the pc before one, establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisprepetitive auditing, but all the while alert to changes in the pc.One runs at this Level against Tone Arm Action, paying little or no heed to the needleexcept as a centering device for TA position. One even establishes what’s to be done by theaction of the Tone Arm. (The process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fellwhen he was running what’s being run, now belongs at this Level (II) and will be re-numberedaccordingly.)At II one expects to handle a lot of chronic PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks with Life (but notsession ARC Breaks, that being a needle action, session ARC Breaks being sorted out by ahigher classed auditor if they occur).To get such things done (PTPs, overts and other remedies) in the session the auditor must"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"have a pc “willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties”. That presupposes we have anauditor at this Level who can ask questions, not repetitive, that guide the pc into talking aboutthe difficulty that needs to be handled.Great command of TR 4 is the primary difference in TRs from Level I. One understands,when one doesn’t, by asking more questions, and by really acknowledging only when one hasreally understood it.Guided comm is the clue to control at this Level. One should easily guide the pc’s commin and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time. As soon as an auditorgets the idea of finite result or, that is to say, a specific and definite result expected, all this iseasy. Pc has a PTP. Example: Auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimulate thePTP so pc is not bothered about it (and isn’t being driven to do something about it) as the finiteresult.The auditor at II is trained to audit the pc before him, get the pc into comm, guide the pctoward data needful to choose a process and then to run the process necessary to resolve thatthing found, usually by repetitive command and always by TA.The Book of Remedies is the key to this Level and this auditing style.One listens but only to what one has guided the pc into. One runs repetitive commandswith good TR 4. And one may search around for quite a while before one is satisfied he has theanswer from the pc needful to resolve a certain aspect of the pc’s case.O/W can be run at Level I. But at Level II one may guide the pc into divulging what thepc considers a real overt act and, having that, then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasn’tan overt and so eventually blow it.Half-acknowledgment is also taught at Level II—the ways of keeping a pc talking bygiving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone TR 2.Big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going offthe subject.LEVEL IIIABRIDGED STYLE AUDITINGBy Abridged is meant “abbreviated”, shorn of extras. Any not actually needful auditingcommand is deleted.For instance, at Level I the auditor always says, when the pc wanders off the subject, “Iwill repeat the auditing command” and does so. In Abridged Style the auditor omits this when itisn’t necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it.In this style we have shifted from pure rote to a sensible use or omission as needful. Westill use repetitive commands expertly, but we don’t use rote that is unnecessary to thesituation.Two-Way Comm comes into its own at Level III. But with heavy use of repetitivecommands.At this Level we have as the primary process, Clay Table Healing. In this an auditor mustmake sure the commands are followed exactly. No auditing command is ever let go of until thatactual command is answered by the pc.But at the same time, one doesn’t necessarily give every auditing command the processhas in its rundown."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"In Clay Table Healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time. This isdone more often by observation than command. Yet it is done.We suppose at III that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe.Thus we see the pc is satisfied and don’t mention it. Thus we see when the pc is not certain andso we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question.On the other hand, one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and getsthem executed.Prepchecking and needle usage is taught at Level III as well as Clay Table Healing.Auditing by List is also taught. In Abridged Style Auditing one may find the pc (being cleanedup on a list question) giving half a dozen answers in a rush. One doesn’t stop the pc fromdoing so, one half acknowledges, and lets the pc go on. One is in actual fact handling a biggerauditing comm cycle, that is all. The question elicits more than one answer which is really onlyone answer. And when that answer is given, it is acknowledged.One sees when a needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate allthe pc’s relief. And one sees it isn’t clean by the continued puzzle on the pc’s face.There are tricks involved here. One asks a question of the pc with the key word in it andnotes that the needle doesn’t tremble, and so concludes the question about the word is flat. Andso doesn’t check it again. Example: “Has anything else been suppressed?” One eye on pc, oneon needle, needle didn’t quiver. Pc looks noncommittal. Auditor says, “All right, on____” andgoes on to next question, eliminating a pc’s possible protest read that can be mistaken foranother “suppress”.In Abridged Style Auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it impedescase advance. But that doesn’t mean one wanders about. One is even more crisp and thoroughwith Abridged Style Auditing than in rote.One is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected result.By “Abridged” is meant getting the exact job done—the shortest way between twopoints—with no waste questions.By now the student should know that he runs a process to achieve an exact result and hegets the process run in a way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time.The student is taught to guide rapidly, to have no time for wide excursions.The processes at this Level are all rat-a-tat-tat processes—CT Healing, Prepchecking,Auditing by List.Again it’s the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time thatmakes for speed of result.LEVEL IVDIRECT STYLE AUDITINGBy direct we mean straight, concentrated, intense, applied in a direct manner.We do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide. We mean it isdirect.By direct, we don’t mean frank or choppy. On the contrary, we put the pc’s attention onhis bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct."},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"It could also mean that we are not auditing by vias. We are auditing straight at the thingsthat need to be reached to make somebody clear.Other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed.At Level IV we have Clay Table Clearing and we have Assessment type processes.These two types of process are both astonishingly direct. They are aimed directly at theReactive Mind. They are done in a direct manner.In CT Clearing we have almost total work and Itsa from pcs. From one end of a sessionto another, we may have only a few auditing commands. For a pc on CT Clearing does almostall the work if he is in session at all.Thus we have another implication in the word “direct”. The pc is talking directly to theauditor about what he is making and why in CT Clearing. The auditor hardly ever talks at all.In assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pc’s bank and wants no pc in front of itthinking, speculating, maundering or Itsaing. Thus this assessment is a very direct action.All this requires easy, smooth, steel-hand-in-a-velvet-glove control of the pc. It lookseasy and relaxed as a style, it is straight as a Toledo blade.The trick is to be direct in what’s wanted and not deviate. The auditor settles what’s to bedone, gives the command and then the pc may work for a long time, the auditor alert, attentive,completely relaxed.In assessment the auditor often pays no attention to the pc at all, as in ARC Breaks orassessing lists. Indeed, a pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of a list.And in CT Clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at a stretch.The tests are: Can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without ARC Breakingthe pc? Can the auditor order the pc to do something and then, the pc working on it, can theauditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour, understanding everything and interrupt alertlyonly when he doesn’t understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him? Again without ARCBreaking the pc.You could confuse this Direct Style with Listen Style if you merely glanced at a sessionof CT Clearing. But what a difference. In Listen Style the pc is blundering on and on and on.In Direct Style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to Itsa, let us say, with no claywork and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay, you’d see theauditor, quick as a foil, look at the pc, very interestedly and say, “Let’s see that in Clay.” Orthe pc doesn’t really give an ability he wants to improve and you’d hear a quiet persuasiveauditor voice, “Are you quite certain you want to improve that? Sounds like a goal to me. Justsomething, some ability you know, you’d like to improve.”You could call this style One-Way Auditing. When the pc is given his orders, after thatit’s all from the pc to the auditor, and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruction.When the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc. Only when the assessmentaction hits a snag like a PTP is there any other auditing style used.This is a very extreme auditing style. It is straightforward—direct.But when needful, as in any Level, the styles learned below it are often also employed,but never in the actual actions of getting CT Clearing and Assessment done.(Note: Level V would be the same style as VI below.)"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"LEVEL VIALL STYLESo far, we have dealt with simple actions.Now we have an auditor handling a meter and a pc who Itsa’s and Cognites and getsPTPs and ARC Breaks and Line Charges and Cognites and who finds Items and lists and whomust be handled, handled, handled all the way.As auditing TA for a 2l/2 hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions (compared to 10 or15 for the lowest level), the pace of the session is greater. It is this pace that makes perfectability at each lower level vital when they combine into All Style. For each is now faster.So, we learn All Style by learning each of the lower styles well, and then observe andapply the style needed every time it is needed, shifting styles as often as once every minute!The best way to learn All Style is to become expert at each lower style so that one doesthe style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs.It is less rough than it looks. But it is also very demanding.Use the wrong style on a situation and you’ve had it. ARC Break! No progress!Example: Right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty. The auditor can’tcontinue—or shouldn’t. The auditor, in Direct Style, looks up to see a-puzzled frown. Theauditor has to shift to Guiding Style to find out what ails the pc (who probably doesn’t reallyknow), then to Listen Style while the pc cognites on a chronic PTP that just emerged andbothered the pc, then to Direct Style to finish the Assessment that was in progress.The only way an auditor can get confused by All Style is by not being good at one of thelower level styles.Careful inspection will show where the student using All Style is slipping. One then getsthe student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it a bit.So All Style, when poorly done, is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one ormore of the lower level styles. And as all these can be independently taught, the whole can beco-ordinated. All Style is hard to do only when one hasn’t mastered one of the lower levelstyles.SUMMARYThese are the important Styles of Auditing. There have been others but they are onlyvariations of those given in this HCO Bulletin. Tone 40 Style is the most notable one missing.It remains as a practice style at Level One to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to gethis command obeyed.

If they do not do so they will have case trouble.The Levels are designed for all cases from psycho to OT. It now does not matter whatcondition a case is in. You just start at the lowest process of the lowest level on all cases begun.Flatten that. Go to the next process of the level. Flatten that. When all processes of that levelare flat the pc is examined and given a GRADE CERTIFICATE for the level completed andmay go to the next level. And the first process of that level is flattened and so on.Even The Book of Case Remedies is handled at its own place in its own level and is notused below or above that place.Our technical reach is now so effective that you need no analysis of the case. You just runthe levels.You do not estimate a pc’s level. You ask for his Grade Certificate and if he hasn’t one,just start at the lowest level, skip any level already run and do on up.You’ll not only catch all cases. You will get maximum TA on each pc in that fashion.One must not skip around within the level or amongst levels."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Screwy application such as giving the first command of an alternate command processand then “getting the TA out of the second command”, or any departure from good old standardauditing must be jumped all over hard.Rewording a process given in the levels can be catastrophic. It’s worded that way for areason. Clear the command well with the pc but never vary the given wording.These actions with the new levels will be found magical.Directors of Processing must not tolerate any slightest goof, any Q and A, any variationof any kind whatever and must be very severe with anyone who messes these processes up.They are violently strong processes from bottom to top and they must be handled with exactduplication and skill.In Academies this injunction is particularly urgent. Standard student auditing can workwonders with these processes unless an Instructor advises or permits alter-is.The processes developed are too powerful to admit of goofs and departures and unusualsolutions. If anyone reports “it didn’t work” you had better get in there fast as that auditorreally goofed and didn’t run the process the way it was given in the HCO B.The most banal, routine, grind auditing will produce results splendidly. The flighty,undisciplined, Q and Aed, alter-ised fooling about will rapidly ditch the pc.I am putting strong tools in your hands. Don’t play about with them. They might explodeon you. Give them the respect they deserve and every case will come up bright and progressrapidly.Something new is here. Just follow the new map even dully and the pc will arrive. Louseit up and it will get awful.--------------All auditors at a higher meter class run all lower level processes with a meter providingonly that they can get the pc to hold the cans.For a meter classed auditor there are no unmetered processes except ones like 8C andeven then the pc is checked on a meter.It does not matter how low on the levels an auditor begins to use a meter as a student.Just don’t ask him to do much with it until the training level calls for meter training.--------------Ds of T and Ds of P and Examiners must be very careful of false reports in case foldersregarding what was run. They should regard an illegible report as a no report. They must alsobe alert for false attestations concerning grade requests for a pc and for training check sheetcompletion. It is a false attestation to declare an incomplete grade or check sheet complete ordone when it is not.--------------New ethics policies are levelled primarily at making auditing and training honest andflawless.I can give you all the processes. It is however necessary that they be honestly run andhonestly reported.Only in that way can you make releases and clears."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The renumbering of levels and grades will be released in Auditor 8. They make it easier toaudit and train.The materials for each level will shortly be released in HCO Bs.From Academies and courses I want auditors who are trained not to alter-is technicalmaterials.In HGCs I want auditing exactly by the book.It’s easier to do training and processing that way.And you will get all the results you could ever use—but only if it’s by the book, unalteredin application.It will be the easiest auditing you ever did.

The first number indicates the leveltaught on. Those that begin with TR 400- are level four drills- Unbullbaited drills end with oddnumbers and bullbaitad drills end in even numbers.The drills are done within the basic format of the unbullbaited and bullbaited drills, as inthe front of this drillsheet.Simply start with the first actions and work through the pack applying the unbullbaitedand bullbaited drills until you are thoroughly farniliaar with each separate audit B action andcan apply it flawlessly, even with distractionsZIf a student has trouble on a drill cut back the gradient and locate whether the student hasa misunderstood or has a skipped gradient. Handle either or both with standard study tech.This can lead back to outnesses on basics such as TRs, codes or scaler. Whatever it is find outwhy and handle. Standard classroom word clearing tech must be thoroughly used. Alwayscoach on a gradient, and build them up to get tough.Note: If coach upset occurs because of restimulation, fruit words should be inserted in theplace of the process Key Words, for bullbuited drills.FORMAT FOR UNBULLBAITED DRILLS:NAME: Auditing on a doll unbullbaited.COMMANDS: As for each separate process.PURPOSE: To train the student to be able to coordinate and apply the commands andprocedures of each separate auditing action with the actual doingmess of auditing.TRAINING STRESS: This drill is coached.

On any list the coach squeezes the cans to simulate reads. He still uses fruitanswers, (six apples, blue pears) when asked to speak, but as the student auditor reads off thelist item (Ex: L3RD he squeezes the cans for reads.When bullbaiting an auditing action the coach should throw in various signs of pc out ofsessionness.

One of the reasons he hasused to fight was to make something happen or to keep something from happening. Thus it isof interest in the case to undo these stuck points in the preclear. There are many ways thesecould be undone, but there is apparently only one way that is actually effective. This is donewith the following commands. ‘Tell me some things you wouldn’t want to have happen again’,‘Tell me some things you would like to have happen again’. The preclear will get, inaccordance with these commands, various recalls, incidents, facsimiles, or environmentalsituations, or future fears or hopes, and may be steered more directly into these. I firstdiscovered this process by running concepts, but in the running of concepts it has a verylimited workability. By pointing out live or imaginary situations great workability is achieved.The auditor must be very careful to do this process long enough so as not to leave the preclearhung up in an incident.This is the basic key of time."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICESaint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, SussexHCO BULLETIN OF 21 JANUARY AD10Fran HldrsHCO SecsAssn SecsHCO and HASI StaffsJUSTIFICATIONWhen a person has committed an overt act and then withholds it, he or she usuallyemploys the social mechanism of justification.We have all heard people attempt to justify their actions and all of us have knowninstinctively that justification was tantamount to a confession of guilt. But not until now havewe understood the exact mechanism behind justification.Short of Scientology Auditing there was no means by which a person could relievehimself of consciousness of having done an overt act except to try to lessen the overt.Some churches used a mechanism of confession. This was a limited effort to relieve aperson of the pressure of his overt acts. Later the mechanism of confession was employed as akind of blackmail by which increased contribution could be obtained from the personconfessing. Factually this is a limited mechanism to such an extent that it can be extremelydangerous. Religious confession does not carry with it any real stress of responsibility for theindividual but on the contrary seeks to lay responsibility at the door of the Divinity—a sort ofblasphemy in itself. I have no axe to grind here with religion. Religion as religion is fairlynatural. But psychotherapy must be in itself a completed fact or, as we all know, it can becomea dangerous fact. That’s why we flatten engrams and processes. Confession to be non-dangerous and effective must be accompanied by a full acceptance of responsibility. All overtacts are the product of irresponsibility on one or more of the dynamics.Withholds are a sort of overt act in themselves but have a different source. Oddly enoughwe have just proven conclusively that man is basically good—a fact which flies in the teeth ofold religious beliefs that man is basically evil. Man is good to such an extent that when herealizes he is being very dangerous and in error he seeks to minimize his power and if thatdoesn’t work and he still finds himself committing overt acts he then seeks to dispose ofhimself either by leaving or by getting caught and executed. Without this computation Policewould be powerless to detect crime—the criminal always assists himself to be caught. WhyPolice punish the caught criminal is the mystery. The caught criminal wants to be rendered lessharmful to the society and wants rehabilitation. Well, if this is true then why does he notunburden himself? The fact is this: unburdening is considered by him to be an overt act. Peoplewithhold overt acts because they conceive that telling them would be another overt act. It is asthough Thetans are trying to absorb and hold out of sight all the evil of the world. This iswrong-headed, by withholding overt acts these are kept afloat in the universe and arethemselves as withholds entirely the cause of continued evil. Man is basically good but hecould not attain expression of this until now. Nobody but the individual could die for his ownsins—to arrange things otherwise was to keep man in chains.In view of these mechanisms, when the burden became too great man was driven toanother mechanism—the effort to lessen the size and pressure of the overt. He or she couldonly do this by attempting to reduce the size and repute of the terminal. Hence, not-isness.Hence when a man or a woman has done an overt act there usually follows an effort to reducethe goodness or importance of the target of the overt. Hence the husband who betrays his wifemust then state that the wife was no good in some way. Thus the wife who betrayed herhusband had to reduce the husband to reduce the overt. This works on all dynamics. In thislight most criticism is justification of having done an overt."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"This does not say that all things are right and that no criticism anywhere is ever merited.Man is not happy. He is faced with total destruction unless we toughen up our postulates. Andthe overt act mechanism is simply a sordid game condition man has slipped into withoutknowing where he was going. So there are rightnesses and wrongnesses in conduct andsociety and life at large, but random, carping 1.1 criticism when not borne out in fact is only aneffort to reduce the size of the target of the overt so that one can live (he hopes) with the overt.Of course to criticise unjustly and lower repute is itself an overt act and so this mechanism isnot in fact workable.Here we have the source of the dwindling spiral. One commits overt acts unwittingly. Heseeks to justify them by finding fault or displacing blame. This leads him into further overtsagainst the same terminals which leads to a degradation of himself and sometimes thoseterminals.Scientologists have been completely right in objecting to the idea of punishment.Punishment is just another worsening of the overt sequence and degrades the punisher. Butpeople who are guilty of overts demand punishment. They use it to help restrain themselvesfrom (they hope) further violation of the dynamics. It is the victim who demands punishmentand it is a wrong-headed society that awards it. People get right down and beg to be executed.And when you don’t oblige, the woman scorned is sweet-tempered by comparison. I ought toknow—I have more people try to elect me an executioner than you would care to imagine. Andmany a preclear who sits down in your pc chair for a session is there just to be executed andwhen you insist on making such a pc better, why you’ve had it, for they start on this desire forexecution as a new overt chain and seek to justify it by telling people you’re a bad auditor.When you hear scathing and brutal criticism of someone which sounds just a bit strained,know that you have your eye on overts against that criticised person and next chance you getpull the overts and remove just that much evil from the world.And remember, by and by, that if you make your pc write these overts and withholdsdown and sign them and send them off to me he’ll be less reluctant to hold on to the shreds ofthem—it makes for a further blow of overts and less blow of pc. And always run responsibilityon a pc when he unloads a lot of overts or just one.We have our hands here on the mechanism that makes this a crazy universe so let’s go forbroke on it and play it all the way out.L.

And that this something must be sodeadly and so pervasive as to destroy all his ambitions and his chances long before their time.Such a thing would have to be some natural law unguessed at by himself.And there is such a law, apparently, that answers these conditions of being deadly,unknown and embracing all activities.The law would seem to be:A THIRD PARTY MUST BE PRESENT AND UNKNOWN IN EVERYQUARREL FOR A CONFLICT TO EXIST.orFOR A QUARREL TO OCCUR, AN UNKNOWN THIRD PARTY MUST BEACTIVE IN PRODUCING IT BETWEEN TWO POTENTIAL OPPONENTS.orWHILE IT IS COMMONLY BELIEVED TO TAKE TWO TO MAKE A FIGHT, ATHIRD PARTY MUST EXIST AND MUST DEVELOP IT FOR ACTUALCONFLICT TO OCCUR.It is very easy to see that two in conflict are fighting. They are very visible. What isharder to see or suspect is that a third party existed and actively promoted the quarrel.The usually unsuspected and “reasonable” third party, the bystander who denies any partof it is the one that brought the conflict into existence in the first place.The hidden third party, seeming at times to be a supporter of only one side, is to be foundas the instigator.This is a useful law on many dynamics.It is the cause of war."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"One sees two fellows shouting bad names at each other, sees them come to blows. Noone else is around. So they, of course, “caused the fight”. But there was a third party.Tracing these down, one comes upon incredible data. That is the trouble. The incredibleis too easily rejected. One way to hide things is to make them incredible.Clerk A and Messenger B have been arguing. They blaze into direct conflict. Each blamesthe other. NEITHER ONE IS CORRECT AND SO THE QUARREL DOES NOT RESOLVESINCE ITS TRUE CAUSE IS NOT ESTABLISHED.One looks into such a case THOROUGHLY. He finds the incredible. The wife of ClerkA has been sleeping with Messenger B and complaining alike to both about the other.Farmer J and Rancher K have been tearing each other to pieces for years in continualconflict. There are obvious, logical reasons for the fight. Yet it continues and does not resolve.A close search finds Banker L who, due to their losses in the fighting, is able to loan each sidemoney, while keeping the quarrel going, and who will get their lands completely if both lose.It goes larger. The revolutionary forces and the Russian government were in conflict in1917. The reasons are so many the attention easily sticks on them. But only when Germany’sofficial state papers were captured in World War II was it revealed that Germany had promotedthe revolt and financed LENIN to spark it off, even sending him into Russia in a blacked outtrain!One looks over “personal” quarrels, group conflicts, national battles and one finds, if hesearches, the third party, unsuspected by both combatants or if suspected at all, brushed off as“fantastic”. Yet careful documentation finally affirms it.------------This datum is fabulously useful.In marital quarrels the correct approach of anyone counseling, is to get both parties tocarefully search out the third party. They may come to many reasons at first. These reasons arenot beings. One is looking for a third party, an actual being. When both find the third party andestablish proof, that will be the end of the quarrel.Sometimes two parties, quarreling, suddenly decide to elect a being to blame. This stopsthe quarrel. Sometimes it is not the right being and more quarrels thereafter occur.Two nations at each other’s throats should each seek conference with the other to sift outand locate the actual third party. They will always find one if they look, and they can find theright one. As it will be found to exist in fact.-------------There are probably many technical approaches one could develop and outline in thismatter.There are many odd phenomena connected with it. An accurately spotted third party isusually not fought at all by either party but only shunned.Marital conflicts are common. Marriages can be saved by both parties really sorting outwho caused the conflicts. There may have been, in the whole history of the marriage, several,but only one at a time.Quarrels between an individual and an organization are nearly always caused by anindividual third party or a third group. The organization and the individual should get together"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"and isolate the third party by displaying to each other all the data they each have been fed.Rioters and governments alike could be brought back to agreement could one getrepresentatives of both to give each other what they have been told by whom.SUCH CONFERENCES HAVE TENDED TO DEAL ONLY INRECRIMINATIONS OR CONDITIONS OR ABUSES. THEY MUST DEAL INBEINGS ONLY IN ORDER TO SUCCEED.This theory might be thought to assert also that there are no bad conditions that causeconflict. There are. But these are usually REMEDIAL BY CONFERENCE UNLESS ATHIRD PARTY IS PROMOTING CONFLICT.In history we have a very foul opinion of the past because it is related by recriminationsof two opponents and has not spotted the third party.“Underlying causes” of war should read “hidden promoters”.There are no conflicts which cannot be resolved unless the true promoters of them remainhidden.------------This is the natural law the ancients and moderns alike did not know.And not knowing it, being led off into “reasons”, whole civilizations have died.It is worth knowing.It is worth working with in any situation where one is trying to bring peace.L.

In this lifetime what overt have you committed?2. How have you justified it?2. is run flat until the overt given in 1. is knocked out. Then a new overt is found and 2.is done thoroughly and repetitively on it.This is not a new form of process but these are very new commands.Note it is not an alternate command. Note that a cycle of action is completed with question2. or 1. before you leave off processing this particular overt. Only when you have all thejustifications and cognitions possible on 1. do you ask for a new overt from the pc.This cracks the general irresponsibility the auditor is met with in trying to get O/W tobenefit the irresponsible case.“In this lifetime” is added because the pc who can’t face his overts not only justifies thembut goes way back into his past lives to find overts instead of getting off the simple this lifetimeones.This is not the same process as plain “What have you done?” in which any action done bythe pc is accepted as the answer.However in simple general O/W you will find the pc is not answering the auditingquestion but is answering “What have I done that caused my trouble?” The pc is running “Whataction that I have done explains what has happened to me? “Therefore running justifications off is a further south process than any earlier version ofO/W and is very effective in raising the Cause Level of the pc.LRH:nb.rdL.

In Level III one can also direct attention to the various dynamics by firstassessing them and then using or preparing a list for the dynamic found.RESPONSIBILITYThere is no reason to expect any great pc responsibility for his or her own overts belowLevel IV and the auditor seeking to make the pc feel or take responsibility for overts is justpushing the pc down. The pc will resent being made feel guilty. Indeed the auditor may onlyachieve that, not case gain. And the pc will ARC break.At Level IV one begins on this subject of responsibility but again it is indirectly the target.There is no need now to run Responsibility in doing O/Ws.The realization that one has really done something is a return of responsibility and thisgain is best obtained only by indirect approach as in the above processes."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKSThe commonest cause of failure in running overt acts is “cleaning cleans” whether or notone is using a meter. The pc who really has more to tell doesn’t ARC Break when the Auditorcontinues to ask for one but may snarl and eventually give it up.On the other hand leaving an overt touched on the case and calling it clean will cause afuture ARC Break with the auditor.“Have you told all?” prevents cleaning a clean. On the unmetered pc one can see the pcbrighten up. On the meter you get a nice fall if it’s true that all is told.“Have I not found out about something?” prevents leaving an overt undisclosed. On theunmetered pc the reaction is a sly flinch. On a metered pc it gives a read.A pc’s protest against a question will also be visible in an unmetered pc in a reeling sortof exasperation which eventually becomes a howl of pure bafflement at why the auditor won’taccept the answer that that’s all. On a meter protest of a question falls on being asked for: “Isthis question being protested?”There is no real excuse for ARC Breaking a pc by1. Demanding more than is there or2. Leaving an overt undisclosed that will later make the pc upset with the auditor.FORBIDDEN WORDSDo not use the following words in auditing commands. While they can be used indiscussion or nomenclature, for various good reasons they should be avoided now in anauditing command:Responsibility(ies)Justification(s)Withhold(s)Failed(ures)Difficulty(ies)Desire(s)HereThereCompulsion(s) (ively)Obsession(s) (ively)No unusual restraint should be given these words. Just don’t frame a command thatincludes them. Use something else.WHY OVERTS WORKOverts give the highest gain in raising cause level because they are the biggest reason whya person restrains himself and withholds self from action.Man is basically good. But the reactive mind tends to force him into evil actions. Theseevil actions are instinctively regretted and the individual tries to refrain from doing anything atall. The “best” remedy, the individual thinks, is to withhold. “If I commit evil actions, then mybest guarantee for not committing is to do nothing whatever.” Thus we have the “lazy”, inactiveperson."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"Others who try to make an individual guilty for committing evil actions only increase thistendency to laziness.Punishment is supposed to bring about inaction. And it does. In some unexpected ways.However, there is also an inversion (a turn about) where the individual sinks belowrecognition of any action. The individual in such a state cannot conceive of any action andtherefore cannot withhold action. And thus we have the criminal who can’t act really but canonly re-act and is without any self direction. This is why punishment does not cure criminalitybut in actual fact creates it; the individual is driven below withholding or any recognition of anyaction. A thief’s hands stole the jewel, the thief was merely an innocent spectator to the actionof his own hands. Criminals are very sick people physically.So there is a level below withholding that an auditor should be alert to in some pcs, forthese “have no withholds” and “have done nothing”. All of which, seen through their eyes istrue. They are merely saying “I cannot restrain myself” and “I have not willed myself to dowhat I have done.”The road out for such a case is the same as that for any other case. It is just longer. Theprocesses for levels above hold also for such cases. But don’t be anxious to see a suddenreturn of responsibility, for the first owned “done” that this person knows he or she has donemay be “ate breakfast”. Don’t disdain such answers in Level II particularly. Rather, in suchpeople, seek such answers.There is another type of case in all this, just one more to end the list. This is the case whonever runs O/W but “seeks the explanation of what I did that made it all happen to me”.This person easily goes into past lives for answers. Their reaction to a question aboutwhat they’ve done is to try to find out what they did that earned all those motivators. That, ofcourse, isn’t running the process and the auditor should be alert for it and stop it when it ishappening.This type of case goes into its extreme on guilt. It dreams up overts to explain why. Aftermost big murders the police routinely have a dozen or two people come around and confess.You see, if they had done the murder, this would explain why they feel guilty. As a terrorstomach is pretty awful grim to live with, one is apt to seek any explanation for it if it will onlyexplain it.On such cases the same approach as given works, but one should be very careful not tolet the pc get off overts the pc didn’t commit.Such a pc (recognizable by the ease they dive into the extreme past) when being auditedoff a meter gets more and more frantic and wilder and wilder in overts reported. They shouldget calmer under processing, of course, but the false overts make them frantic and hectic in asession. On a meter one simply checks for “Have you told me anything beyond what really hasoccurred?” Or “Have you told me any untruths?”The observation and meter guides given in this section are used during a session whenthey apply but not systematically such as after every pc answer. These observations and meterguides are used always at the end of every session on the pcs to whom they apply.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH: nb. cdenCopyright © 1964by L. Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"CERTAINTY PROCESSINGExerpted from Book: Scientology 8-8008The anatomy of maybe consists of uncertainties and is resolved by the processing ofcertainties. It is not resolved by the processing of uncertainties.An uncertainty is held in suspense solely because the preclear is holding on so hard tocertainties. The basic thing he is holding on to is “I have a solution,” “I have no solution.” Oneof these is positive, the other is negative. A complete positive and a complete negative are alikea certainty. The basic certainty is “There is something,” “There is nothing.” A person can becertain there is something, he can be certain there is nothing.“There is something,” “There is nothing” resolves chronic somatics in this order. Onegets the preclear to have the center of the somatic say “There is something here,” “There isnothing here.” Then he gets the center of the somatic to say “There is nothing there,” “There issomething there.” Then the auditor has the preclear toward the somatic say “There is somethingthere,” “There is nothing there.” And then he gets the preclear to say about himself “There issomething here.” “There is nothing here.” This is a very fast resolution of chronic somatics;quite ordinarily three or four minutes of this will resolve an acute state and fifteen or twentyminutes of it will resolve a chronic state.This matter of certainties goes further. It has been determined by my investigations thatthe reason behind what is happening is the desire of a cause to bring about an effect. Somethingis better than nothing, anything is better than nothing. Any circuit, any effect, any anything, isbetter than nothing. If you will match terminals in brackets “There is nothing,” you will findthat a lot of your preclears become very ill. This should be turned around into “There issomething.”The way one does Matched Terminals is to have the preclear facing the preclear or hisfather facing his father; in other words, two of each of anything, one facing the other. Thesetwo things will discharge one into the other, thus running off the difficulty. By bracket wemean, of course, running this with the preclear putting them up as himself to himself as thoughthey were put up by somebody else, the somebody else facing the somebody else, and thematched terminal again put up by others facing others.The clue to all this is positive and negative in terms of certainties. The positive plus thenegative in conflict make an uncertainty. A great number of combinations of things can be run.Here’s a list of the combinations: --The button behind sex is “I can begin life anew,” “I cannot begin life anew,” “I canmake life persist,” “I cannot make life persist,” “I can stop life,” “I cannot stop life, can changelife,” “I cannot change life,” “I can start life”, “I cannot start life.”A very effective process,“Something wrong .., ““Nothing wrong ... “ with “you, me, they, my mind, communications, various allies.”A very basic resolution of the lack of space of an individual is to locate those people andthose objects which you’ve been using as anchor points such as father, mother and so forth andputting them into matched terminal brackets with this: -- “There is father,” “There is no father,”“There is grandfather,” “There is no grandfather.” In the compulsive line this can be changed to“There must be no father,” “There must be a father.” One takes all the allies of an individualand runs them in this fashion."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The basic law underneath this is that a person becomes the effect of anything uponwhich he has had to depend. This would tell you immediately that the sixth dynamic, the MESTuniverse, is the largest dependency of the individual. This can be run out, but then any dynamiccan be run out in this fashion. “There is myself,” “There is no self,” and so on up thedynamics. “(Any dynamic) is preventing me from communicating,” “(Any dynamic) is notpreventing me from communicating” is intensely effective. Any such technique can be variedby applying the sub-zero scale as found earlier in this book.One runs any certainty out because he knows that for this certainly there is an oppositenegative certainty and that between these lies a maybe, and that the maybe is suspense in time.The basic operation of the reactive mind is to solve problems. It is based on uncertainties aboutobservation. Thus one runs out certainties of observation. The most general shotgun techniquewould have to do with “There is sex,” “There is no sex,” “There is force,” “There is no force.”This could be run, of course, in terms of matched terminal brackets or even as concepts, butone must not neglect to run the overt act phenomenon which is to say getting somebody elsegetting the concept.The processing out of certainties would then embrace “I have a solution,” “There is nosolution.” These two opposite ends would take care of any individual who was hung on thetrack with some solution, for that solution had its opposite. People who have studied medicinebegin by being certain that medicine works and end by being certain that medicine doesn’twork. They begin by studying psychology on a supposition that it is the solution, and finish upthat it is not the solution. This also happens to superficial students of Dianetics andScientology, thus one should also run “Dianetics is a solution,” “Dianetics is not the solution,”This would also get one off the maybe on the subject.We are essentially processing communications systems. The entire process of auditingis concentrated upon withdrawing communications from the preclear as predicated on the basisof the body and the preclear cannot handle communications. Thus “The preclear can handlecommunication,” “The preclear cannot handle communications” is a shotgun technique whichresolves maybes about his communications.An intensely interesting aspect of Certainty Processing is that it shows up intimatelywhere the preclear is aberrated. Here is the overall basic technique. One runs “There is...,”“There is not...” the following: Communication, talk, letters, love, agreement, sex, pain,work, bodies, minds, curiosity, control, enforcement, compulsion, inhibition, food, money,people. ability, beauty, ugliness, presents and both the top and bottom of the Chart ofAttitudes, positive and negative in each one.Basic in all this is the urge of the preclear to produce an effect, so one can run “I canproduce an effect upon mama,” “I cannot produce an effect upon mama,” and so forth for allallies and one will resolve the fixations of attention on the part of the preclear. Thus fixations ofattention are resolved by Certainty Processing, processing out the production of effect.One can occasionally, if he so desires, process the direct center of the maybe, which isto say doubt itself, in terms of Matched Terminals. This, however, is risky for it throws thepreclear into a general state of doubt.The key to any such processing is the recovery of viewpoints. “I can have grandfather’sviewpoint,” “I cannot have grandfather’s viewpoint,” and so on, particularly with sexualpartners, will prove intensely interesting on a case. “There are viewpoints,” “There are noviewpoints,” “I have a viewpoint,” “I don’t have a viewpoint,” “Blank has a viewpoint,”“Blank has no viewpoint,” resolves problems.One should also realize that when one is processing facsimiles, he is processing at onceenergy, sensation and aesthetics. The facsimile is a picture. The preclear is being affected bypictures mainly, and so “There are no pictures,” “There are pictures,” forwards the case towardhandling pictures; which is to say facsimiles."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"A person tends to ally himself with somebody whom he considers capable of producinggreater effects than himself, so “I, she, he, it can create greater effects,” “I, she, he, it cancreate no effect,” is quite effective.When one is processing, he is trying to withdraw communications. Reach andWithdraw are the two fundamentals in the action of theta. Must Reach and Cannot Reach, MustWithdraw and Cannot Withdraw are compulsions which, when run in combination, producethe manifestation of insanity in a preclear.“I can reach,” “I can’t reach,” “I can withdraw,” “I can’t withdraw,” open up into thefact that remembering and forgetting are dependent upon the ability to reach and withdraw. Youwill find that a preclear will respond to “You must” or “You can,” “You must not,” “Youcannot,” “There is,” “There is not,” forgetting and remembering.The only reason a person is hanging on to a body or facsimile is because he has lost hisbelief in his ability to create. The rehabilitation of this ability to create is resolved -- forinstance, in a person who has had an ambition to write with “I can write,” “I cannot write” --and so forth. The loss of this creative ability made the person hang on to what he had. The factthat a preclear has forgotten how to or no longer can himself generate force makes him hold onto stores of force. These are very often mistaken by the auditor for facsimiles. The precleardoesn’t care for the facsimile, he simply cares for the force contained in the facsimile becausehe knows he doesn’t have any force any more.It should be kept in mind that reaching and withdrawing are intensely productive ofreaction in a preclear. But that preclear who does not respond to reaching and withdrawing andcertainty thereon, is hung up in a very special condition: he is trying to prevent something fromhappening, he is trying to maintain control. If he prevents something from happening, he alsoprevents auditing from happening. He has lost allies, he has had accidents, and he is hung up atall those points on the track where he feels he should have prevented something fromhappening. This is resolved by running “I must prevent it from happening,” “I cannot prevent itfrom happening.” “I must retain control,” “I must lose all control.”Blackness is the desire to be an effect and the inability to be cause.“I can create grandfather (or ally),” “I cannot create grandfather (or ally),” solvesscarcity of allies. “I want to be aware,” “I want no awareness,” is a technique which is basic inattitudes. Run this as others, in matched terminal brackets or in Expanded GITA.Certainty there is a past, certainty there is no past; certainty there is a future, certaintythere is no future; certainty it means something else, certainty it does not mean anything else;certainty there is space, certainty there is no space; certainty there is energy. certainty there is noenergy; certainty there are objects, certainty there are no objects."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"DIFFERENTIATION, ASSOCIATION AND IDENTIFICATIONA special condition of start, change and stop manifests itself in the very woof and warpof the MEST universe and can be plotted on the tone-scale.Differentiation is at the top of the tone-scale and is a condition of the highest level ofsanity and individuality. Association or similarity is a condition which exists from the upper tothe very low range of the scale. And identification is at the bottom of the scale.The condition of the preclear can be established readily by his ability to associate. Hecan, however, associate much too well. Association is the essence of logic. Logic is thegradient scale of relating facts one to another. As logic reaches the lower part of the scale, thisrelationship becomes finer and finer until at last identification is reached and thought could beexpressed in terms of A = A = A = A.An excellent rendition of this -- although one not related workably to experience andwhich did not have with it a truly workable therapy -- is to be found in general semantics in thebook Science and Sanity by Alfred Korzybski. Insanity is the inability to associate ordifferentiate properly. Experience itself becomes ungovernable at the lowest depth of identity.The more fixed the identity of the person may be, the less the experience of which he iscapable. Fame has at its end a completely fixed identification which is timeless, but whichunfortunately is matter and which equally unfortunately, is inaction.The widest possible differentiation exists at the moment of creation. At this moment,one is committed to a cycle of action which, as it continues, is less and less governable byhimself and is more and more governed by his environment. As his degree of havingnessincreases, he is increasingly governed by what he has had and what he has, and this determineswhat he will have which, of course, is less freedom, less individuality and more havingness.Association expresses itself in the preclear in terms of the way he thinks. When hereaches a low level of association, he supposes himself to be thinking connectedly, but isactually thinking in a completely disassociated fashion, for he identifies facts with other factswhich should not be identified. The actions of a man about to die or in extreme fear are notsane. Identification brings as its manifestation a solidity to all things including thought. Theauditor who processes a preclear very low on the tone-scale who is neurotic or psychotic willreadily discover that thoughts are objects to this preclear and that time itself is a matter ofenormous concern to the preclear in many cases. Thoughts and incidents and symbols areobjects. This is commonly seen in the society in the matter of over-concern about words. Aperson who has sunk low enough on the tone-scale so that words have become objects andmust be handled as such, and exist without any real relationship to ideas, will stop a flow ofideas by an outrage of his word sense which, if he is low on the tone-scale, is easily outraged.Differentiation, association and identification belong, rightly, on the tone-scale, and canbe processed as part of the scale above. But they are a close gauge of thought itself and ofideas. An adequate tone-scale can be drawn for any individual using only the above threewords.The auditor will very often find an individual who is intensely logical and quite brilliantwho is yet very difficult to process. This person has agreed with the MEST universe to such adegree that his association has assumed the proportions of near-solidity; the facsimiles andridges of this individual have become much too solid and are consequently quite difficult toprocess. This condition of solidity may refer only to the body of the preclear which itself is old,and it may be found that the thetan -- the preclear himself -- is quite vital and capable of widedifferentiation, but that this differentiation is being grossly limited by the ridges and facsimileswhich surround the body. Such bodies have a heavy appearance. It requires an enormouslypowerful thetan to handle them in spite of the solidity of the ridges surrounding the body."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Mathematics could be said to be the abstract art of symbolizing associations.Mathematics pretends to deal in equalities but equalities themselves do not exist in the MESTuniverse, and can exist only conceptually in any universe. Mathematics are a general method ofbringing to the fore associations which might not be perceived readily without their use. Thehuman mind is a servo-mechanism to all mathematics. Mathematics can abstractly form by theirmechanics coincidences and differences outside the field of experience in any universe and areenormously useful. They can best be used when considered to be a shorthand of experienceand in the light that they can symbolize what is beyond actuality. The essence of mathematicslies in differentiation, association, identification, which is to say, equalities must not be viewedas fixed in the real universe. Absolutes are unobtainable in experience but may be symbolizedby mathematics.LogicLogic is a gradient scale of association of facts of greater or lesser similarity made toresolve some problem of the past, present or future, but mainly to resolve and predict thefuture. Logic is the combination of factors into an answer. The mission of the analytical mindwhen it thinks, is to observe and predict by the observation of results. Easily the best way to dothis is to be the objects one is observing: thus, one can know their condition completely.However, if one is not sufficiently up the scale to be these objects it is necessary to assumewhat they are. This assumption of what they are, the postulating of a symbol to represent theobjects and the combination of these symbols when evaluated against past experience or“known law,” bring about logic. The genesis of logic may be said to be an interchange of two viewpoints, via otherdimension points by which one of the viewpoints holds the attention (one of the most valuablecommodities in the universe) of the other viewpoint by being “logical” about why thatviewpoint should continue to look. The basis of logic is “it is bad over there” or “there is ahidden influence which you cannot estimate but which we will try to estimate,” “therefore, youshould continue to look towards me.” At its best, logic is rationalism, for all logic is basedupon the somewhat idiotic circumstance that a being that is immortal is trying to survive.Survival is a condition susceptible to non-survival. If one is “surviving,” one is at the samemoment admitting that one can cease to survive, otherwise one would never strive to survive.An immortal being striving to survive presents immediately a paradox. An immortal being mustbe persuaded that he can not survive or that he is not or might become not, before he would payany attention to logic. By logic, he can then estimate the future. Probably the only reason hewould want to estimate the MEST universe, aside from amusement, is to keep alive in it, or tomaintain something in a state of life in it.Logic and survival are intimate, but it must be remembered that if one is worried abouthis own survival and is striving for his own survival, he is striving for the survival of animmortal being. Bodies are transient, but bodies are an illusion. One could bring himself up thetone-scale to a point where he could create an imperishable body with ease.It is interesting that those people who are the most logical are those people who inprocessing have to know before they are. When they are sent somewhere, they want to knowwhat is there before they get there. There would be no point in going there if they knew, and ifeveryone knew what was there before they went there. Yet they will attempt to predict what isgoing to happen there and what is there by knowing. This knowingness is in terms of data andshould not be confused with knowingness in terms of actual beingness. Logic is the use of data to produce knowingness; as such it is very junior to knowingsomething by being it.If you were to double-terminal an individual who is customarily very logical, his bodyfacing his body in terms of mock-up and each of the terminals being very logical, a surprisingviolence of interchange would take place. This is because logic is mainly aberration. The workwhich lies before you is a discussion of beingness and is the track of agreement which became"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"evidently the MEST universe. Therefore this work appears to be logical but it appears also to bethe central thread of logic.Apparently, these conclusions were reached by logic; they were not, they were reachedby observation and by induction. That when tested they proved themselves in terms of behaviordemonstrates not that they are logical, but that they are, at least to a large extent, a discussion ofbeingness. Scientific logic and mathematical logic have the frailty of trying to find out what isthere before one goes there. One cannot ever be, if he has to know a datum about the beingnessfirst. If one is afraid to be, one will become, of course, logical. This is no effort to be abusiveupon the subject of logic or mathematics, it is only necessary at this point to indicate a certaindifference between what lies before you and a logical arrangement of assumption. Patterns of EnergyEnergy forms into many patterns. The geometry of this formation would make anintensely interesting study. The patterns, however, are formed by postulates and have no otherexistence.The patterns of energy are viewed by the thetan in terms of pressors, tractors,explosions, implosions, pressor ridges, tractor ridges, pressor-tractor ridges, and balls andsheets.The pressor is a beam which can be put out by a thetan which acts as a stick and withwhich one can thrust oneself away or thrust things away. The pressor beam can be lengthenedand, in lengthening, pushes away. A tractor beam is put out by a thetan in order to pull things toward him. The tractorbeam is an energy flow which the thetan shortens. If one placed a flashlight beam upon a walland then, by manipulating the beam, brought the wall closer to him by it, he would have theaction of a tractor beam. Tractor beams are used to extract perceptions from a body by a thetan.Pressor beams are used to direct action. Tractors and pressors commonly exist together, withthe tractor as a loop outside the pressor. The two together stabilize one another.An explosion is an outflow of energy usually violent but not necessarily so, from amore or less common source point.An implosion could be likened to the collapse of a field of energy such as a spheretoward a common center point, making an inflow. It can happen with the same violence as anexplosion, but does not necessarily do so.A pressor ridge would be that ridge formed by two or more pressor beams operatingagainst each other in conflict.A tractor ridge would be that ridge formed by two tractor beams in conflict operatingagainst each other.A pressor-tractor ridge would be a combination of pressor-tractor flows in sufficientcollisions as to form a solidification of energy.A ridge is a solid body of energy caused by various flows and dispersals which has aduration longer than the duration of flow. Any piece of matter could be considered to be a ridgein its last stage. Ridges, however, exist in suspension around a person and are the foundationupon which facsimiles are built.Two explosions operating against each other may form a ridge.Two implosions operating away from each other may form a ridge. An explosion and"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"an implosion operating together -- or many explosions and implosions operating together --may form a ridge.These manifestations of energy are used in handling energy, either in processing or inaction. Black and WhiteBlack and white are the two extreme manifestations of perception on the part of thepreclear.The thetan perceives best his own energy, but when he perceives energy he desires toperceive it in white or in color. Color is a breakdown of whiteness. Seeing whiteness or color,the thetan is able to discern and differentiate between objects, actions and spatial dimensions.Energy can also manifest itself as blackness. A space containing black energy would beblack, but a black space may be a space existing only without energy in it. This point ofidentification is quite aberrative, and drills to permit the thetan to handle blackness aremandatory in processing. If one remembers one’s fear of blackness when a child, and that evilis represented as blackness, one will see the necessity for doing this. Blackness is theunknown, for it may contain energy or it may be empty or may be black energy.Black energy flows are common on the tone-scale of wavelengths. There is, forinstance, what is known as the black band of sound.Some thetans will not perceive anything at all because they conceive themselves to besurrounded by blackness and are not sure whether the blackness has substance or is simplyempty, and they have a timidity to discover which. Such a case is resolved by making the casedrill with blackness until blackness can be turned on and off and located in time and space.Although this is briefly mentioned, it is a point of the largest importance.Black and white running and black and white aesthetic running were old processeswhich are not necessarily vital today to processing. However, white energy runs easily, andwhere the preclear has a black spot of energy somewhere on an organ or somewhere in theenvironment of the body, the auditor asks him to turn it white in order to let it flow away. Itmay not flow away if it is black, either because it does not belong to the preclear (in which casehe would see it as black) or because it is simply a spot of space with which he is not familiar.By turning it white he is able to handle it for he now knows it to be filled with his own energy.One can run own determinism, other determinism, as concepts. In this case the preclearruns the one as long as he gets an area white and then runs the other to continue its whiteness.In such a way all the energy in the area is drained away.The most common manifestation of a ridge is to have one side of a ridge white and theother side black. This is because the preclear conceives one side of it to have on it his ownenergy and the other side to have on it energy belonging to another. By running the concept thatit is his own and then running the concept that it is another’s, one runs both sides of a ridge, ifhe is running ridges.Although live energy is generally conceived to be white, it can also be black. In runninga preclear with an E-meter, it will be discovered as long as a flow is white and as long as a flowis running, that the needle will gradually rise. When a point of blackness appears in the field,the needle will halt and either will not rise again or will flick as the preclear gets a somatic. Thisflick is characteristic of the somatic. The stuck needle is characteristic of a black field. Theauditor can sit watching a needle and be able to tell the preclear whenever the preclear has had ablack area appear in the field. It is notable that somatics only occur in the presence of a blackpatch. This means that the unknown characteristic of the blackness is something the preclearhas been holding away from him so as not to have it or that black wave energy is that energy"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"used to impress pain. The latter case is the more probable although a great deal of work must bedone upon this to establish beyond doubt the manifestation of blackness.A preclear who cannot see color in his facsimiles, cannot see it because he is unable touse energy with which to perceive. He will see things in terms of blackness or whiteness. He may be able to get black and white or he may be able to get only blackness. In thelatter case he finds blackness in some way profitable and desirable; and running the concept ofhavingness, will have and have had blackness, and using drills in handling blackness --moving it from space to space in the environment and moving it into yesterday and tomorrow --will bring about control of blackness on the part of the preclear. PerceptionThe entire subject of perception is the subject of energy. As the preclear goes down thetone-scale, he is less capable of differentiation and is thus less and less capable of handlingenergy and is more and more subject to energy, until at last he will not emanate or handleenergy. Even in the higher ranges of this descent his perception begins to diminish.The rehabilitation of perception is essentially the rehabilitation of force. Force isrehabilitated by rehabilitating the control of energy. This is done by ARC processing and inmany other ways. The chief way in which this is done is by establishing the preclear’s ability,by creative processing, to handle blackness.An entire science called perceptics can easily be constructed and is mentioned in theoriginal thesis (1948).The rehabilitation of sight in the blind, hearing in the deaf, the ability to speak,anaesthesia of the body or body areas or the genital organs, depends upon the rehabilitation ofthe preclear’s ability to handle energy. Creative processing, with particular attention to handlingblackness, is essential in this process. ForceIn the axioms, force is defined as random effort. Effort is defined as directed force.Force is essentially measured effort. It is quite common for individuals to be soprotesting at what the MEST universe is doing that they abandon any and all force and, if askedto reassume force or use it, suppose that one is asking them to condone and assumepunishment and destruction since these in the MEST universe are done with heavy quantities offorce. There is, however, a gradient scale of force, for any energy manifestation may be calledforce. Even matter contains force.For the purposes of processing, in order to avoid upsetting the preclear, who usuallyhas very bad connotations with the word force, the auditor stresses instead the “handling ofenergy.”The use of energy would encompass any activity having to do with energy or matter. ResponsibilityThe responsibility level of the preclear depends upon his willingness or unwillingnessto handle energy. That preclear who is protesting against energy in any direction is abandoningresponsibility in greater or lesser degree."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"One obtains randomity (see Axioms) by abandoning responsibility in some sphere. Hewill then find himself in conflict in that sphere.The gradient scale of responsibility is as follows: at 40.0 responsibility manifests itselfas will and can be so pervasive that there is no randomity. This would be full responsibility.At 4.0 responsibility would manifest itself in terms of action where roughly half one’senvironment or space had been selected for randomity and for which one would take noresponsibility. At 20.0 responsibility would be 50 per cent of the total energy existing.At 4.0 we find homo sapiens in his narrow environment disagreeing by using theemotion of enthusiasm with an existing state of affairs and directing energy toward the rightingof that state of affairs. Even so, responsibility is low at this level.At 2.0 blame enters the tone-scale as a major factor. This is the level of the tone-scalewhere fault is envisioned for the first time. Above this level there is sufficient breadth ofunderstanding to see that interdependencies and randomities can exist without fault and blame.At 2.0, with the emotion of antagonism, an individual is assigning blame for lack ofresponsibility rather than trying to enforce responsibility.At 1.5 blaming is almost the sole activity of the individual, and, while taking no realresponsibility himself, yet he blames all on his environment and does so with violence.At 1.1 one pretends to take some responsibility in order to demonstrate that others are atfault but one has no real responsibility.At 0.9 or around the level of fear, one does not think in terms of responsibility but iswilling to accept all blame in an effort to escape all punishment.At 0.75, grief, the individual blames himself, and accepts the fault for what hasoccurred.At 0.375, apathy, there is no question of either blame or responsibility. At this level onehas become MEST.On the tone-scale in Science of Survival one will find what might be expected to happento materiel and communication and persons in the vicinity of those below 2.0 on the tone-scale.This stems normally from responsibility, or rather, its lack.The keynote of responsibility is the willingness to handle energy. The rehabilitation ofthe thetan in the handling of energy brings about a rise in responsibility. If a person is low onthe tone-scale and still exhibits responsibility, then his energy activity initially must beenormous for any segment of responsibility to exist low on the scale.The processing of responsibility is one of the most vital processes. If one processesresponsibility itself, he can expect sooner or later a theta clear. He would process it bybrackets. There is a condition known as the “glee of insanity.” This is essentially a specializedcase of irresponsibility. A thetan who cannot be killed and yet can be punished, has only oneanswer to those punishing him, and that is to demonstrate to them that he is no longer capableof force or action and is no longer responsible. He therefore states that he is insane, and actsinsane and demonstrates that he cannot possibly harm them as he lacks any further rationality.This is the root and basis of insanity. Insanity is the only escape possible besides death.Death has the value of convincing others that one can no longer be punished or feel. Aslong as one has a body, which can die, there is a limit to the amount he can be hurt. When thereis no body, and there is no limit to the amount he can be hurt, his only answer is this plea of"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"complete irresponsibility which is the “glee of insanity.” This is found as an actual energymanifestation in the vicinity of sanitoria and can be felt as an emanation from the insane.If the preclear is unable to conceive of “being happy about being insane” (which heusually cannot), get him to get the feeling of anticipation for a vacation. This is irresponsibilityin one sense and in actuality, when deepened, becomes the “glee of insanity.”Happiness is the overcoming of not insurmountable obstacles toward the known goal ofhavingness. Stepping away from this track, feeling that one’s work is too hard, these areforsakings of responsibility. A common method employed by low-toned people to reduce thepower and ability of an individual and so place him under control is to convince him that he istired and overworked. If they can so convince him, they can then get him to take a vacation. Anexamination of an individual who has been subjected to this will show that he was happiestwhen he was working and that before he “needed a vacation” many people worked on him toconvince him that he should not work so hard, and thus turned what was actually play to himinto work. Society almost demands that a man consider whatever he is doing as work anddemands that he consider work as an unhappy thing. In looking around the society at thosewho gain easily, one finds only people who take a great deal of joy in working and who neverthink in terms of a vacation.To run the bracket on responsibility, one would run the desire on the part of the preclearto be responsible, his desire not to be responsible, times when he has been forced to beresponsible, times when he has been forced not to be responsible, times when he has beenrestrained from being responsible, times when he has been restrained from being not-responsible, times when he has been sympathized with because of his responsibilities and thenall this as a bracket, the preclear doing it to others and others doing it to others. This run roundand round as brackets produces marked results.The joy of responsibility and the joy of irresponsibility should also be run in terms ofbrackets.This becomes most effective when run in terms of responsibilities of having, theirresponsibilities of having, the responsibilities and irresponsibilities of having had, and of willhave.Before this has been run very long on some individuals, the glee of insanity willmanifest itself and it must be very thoroughly run out. It is often a hectic, uncontrolledlaughter. This should not be confused with line-charge laughter to which it is a cousin; apreclear who starts laughing over the serious things of his past is breaking locks, and can bemade to laugh in this fashion for many hours if the chain reaction is started. The laughter whichaccompanies the “glee of insanity” has no mirth in it whatever.Peculiar to this is what might be called the attitude of MEST. MEST is not responsiblefor anything. That preclear who has as his goal complete irresponsibility has also as his goalbeing complete MEST.MEST has no space of its own, it causes no action except when acted upon, and itowns nothing but is itself owned. Slaves are made by giving them freedom from responsibility.The thetan high on the scale can make space or own space, has wide choices of action,and can create, change or destroy anything he wishes.The Chart of AttitudesIn order to do rising-scale processing (as covered later), the auditor should know very"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"well his Chart of Attitudes and the reasons underlying each column.SurvivesRight Fully responsibleOwns AllDeadWrong No responsibilityOwns nothingEveryoneAlwaysMotion sourceTruthNobodyNever Stopped HallucinationFaithI knowCauseI amDistrustI know notFull effectI am notWinStart DifferenceBeingLoseStopIdentificationHad This chart on the upper line in each of the above represents from 27.0 to 40.0. Thelower line under each one represents 0.0.Each one of these is a gradient scale with many intermediate points. In rising-scalerunning, one seeks the attitude of the preclear nearest to the lowest end of this scale and askshim to do a rising-scale to see how high he can change his postulate toward the upper end ofthe scale.The last line is, of course, a repeat without the intermediate position of the earlierinterdependencies of experience. SurvivalOne of the first principles in the MEST universe, and that principle which, whendiscovered. resolved the problems of the mind, is the lowest common denominator of allMEST universe existence; the goal of life in the MEST universe is survival and only survival.Survival equates behavior in homo sapiens or in any life form. It also covers the widefield of ethics. The principle of survival was never intended to embrace theta itself for this has,of course, immortality and does not even necessarily move in MEST time.Survival is nothing if not dependent upon havingness, action and beingness. It is mostordinarily viewed as the attempt in a life form to persist in a state of existence as long aspossible. Right -- WrongRightness is conceived to be survival. Any action which assists survival along themaximal number of dynamics is considered to be a right action. Any action which is destructivealong the maximal number of dynamics is considered to be wrong. Theoretically, how right canone be? Immortal! How wrong can one be? Dead!After a certain point on the tone-scale is reached by the preclear, he will tendinstinctively to seek out and do right actions, but ordinarily homo sapiens is thoroughlyengrossed in being wrong. Social politeness, with its violation of the Code of Honor, is quitenon-survival. It might also be said, How wrong can one be? Human!The accident prone and no-responsibility case in general is so intent on being wrongthat he is incapable of conceiving right.All jurisprudence is built upon the principle that sanity is the ability to differentiate rightfrom wrong. Jurisprudence does not, however, give a definition of either rightness orwrongness. Thus, for the first time with this principle, rules of evidence and other matters inlaw can be established with some accuracy."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Absolute rightness, like absolute wrongness, is unobtainable. Rightness andwrongness are alike relative states. Responsibility (See text above.) OwnershipIn view of the fact that time can be conceived to be havingness and in view of the factthat time itself is one of the most puzzling concepts which homo sapiens has ever sought tomaster, the whole question of ownership is subject to grave error, particularly on the part ofhomo sapiens.Discussions in the above text demonstrate that individuality depends upon high-tonelevel and freedom, whereas identity, as such, would be at a complete level of reduction, acondition analogous to MEST.It has long been recognized that “a rich man may as well try to get into Heaven as acamel through the eye of a needle.” The auditor will suddenly discover this truth when he triesto process many rich and successful men. These have carried ownership to such an extent thatthey are themselves thoroughly encased in energy which is solidifying into MEST itself.Instead of having things, they themselves are had by things. Their freedom in motion isenormously reduced, although they have tricked themselves into believing that possession willincrease that freedom.The auditor will find his preclear upset nowhere on the tone-scale as he will on thesubject of ownership. A childhood, for instance, is intensely upset by the subject of ownershipsince the child is given to understand that he owns certain things and is then commanded inevery action he takes with those items. A child cannot have possession, free and clear, ofanything in the average family. He is given shoes and is told to take care of them and ispunished if he does not take care of them although he apparently owns them. He is given toysand is harassed whenever he abuses them. He finally becomes convinced that he owns nothingand yet he is in a state of anxiety about owning things. Therefore he will try to possess manythings and will completely overestimate or underestimate the value of what he has. The auditingof childhood ownership is a fruitful field for the auditor.That preclear who is upset on the subject of time, even faintly, is, and has been,enormously upset on the subject of ownership, since havingness and its manifestations arethemselves the MEST universe trick of giving us an illusion of time. Everyone -- Nobody (See material above on Identity versus Individuality.)It may be confusing to the preclear that being everybody can be conceived at both endsof the tone-scale. The difference is that at the bottom end of the scale, the preclear is making themistake of considering the “somebodies” around him as MEST. He can be their MESTidentities. At the top of the scale, while still retaining his own identity, he can be anyone’sidentity but this is on a theta level and is disassociated from MEST. That preclear who goesaround believing he is other people is usually at the bottom end of the tone scale and hasconfused his own body with the bodies he sees because he does not have a proper view of hisown body and so can easily mistake it for the bodies of others.When an individual is low on the tone-scale, he easily does a life continuum for othersbecause he himself is so encased in MEST and so poorly recognizes his own identity that hecan conceive himself to be anyone without knowing what he has done."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The question of valences and life continuums is difficult to resolve in direct ratio that thepreclear conceives himself to be MEST.MEST, lacking the ability to create space and to produce directive action is, of course,nobody. When a man is convinced he is a nobody he has been convinced at the same time thathe is MEST. Always -- NeverWe have already seen that objects give us the illusion of time. The ability to createobjects is interchangeable with the ability to have an actual forever.There would be an illusory forever which would be dependent upon the duration of anobject and its apparent solidity. One might also say that the MEST universe seeks to own oneby pretending that immortality is something difficult to buy and is only purchased by achievingan identity or being an object. The ultimate in this is, of course, being a part of the MESTuniverse. One might say jocularly that every planet in the MEST universe was once one ormore people. A considerable reaction can be got from a preclear by making him conceive afeeling of devotion toward the “older” gods who were here and who built this universe andwho have left it to him. Deeply religious feelings are very often based upon this idea. Someastonishing reactions can occur in a preclear when running this concept.The real way to be assured of a great deal of time is to be able, of course, to create time,and this would be to a thetan the true concept of always. Time is created, at least in thisuniverse, by creating energy and objects, and by being able to make the universe agree withoneself, not by having the universe continually making one agree with it. Motion Source -- StoppedThe ability to cause motion is dependent, whether the individual realizes it or not, uponthe ability to conceive space. Creation of space is the first requisite for the creation of motion.When one can no longer create space and cannot conceive any space to be his own, hecan be considered to be stopped.That individual who is tremendously concerned with being stopped is losing his abilityto create space. When he is no longer able to create space, he is himself MEST. Somebody once said that it was a poor man who was not king in some corner. Onemight add to this that one is not only poor but he does not exist when he cannot create a corner.One could obtain a very amusing viewpoint of this by watching the conduct of a dog who,theta-motivated like every life form, is bravest in his own front yard; and even a mastiffproceeds with some caution when in the front yard of a Pekinese. This is a case of ownershipof space and, in some slight degree, the ability to create a space to own.One processes this by moving mock-ups into an auto created space. Truth -- HallucinationThe highest one can attain to truth is to attain to his own illusions. The lowest one candescend from truth is a complete acceptance of MEST universe reality, for this below a certainlevel becomes scrambled and brings on the condition known as hallucination. Hallucination isnot self-generated; it comes about only when a person is an effect to such an extent that he isalmost dead."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"What is commonly believed to be truth is agreement upon natural law. This would bethe truth of the MEST universe which would be the lowest common denominator of agreementupon any one subject. Where the MEST universe is concerned, acceptance of such truths isdangerous.In Scientology one is studying the lowest common denominators of agreement whichbring about an acceptance of the MEST universe and prohibit the creation of one’s ownuniverse, which latter ability alone makes possible perception of the MEST universe which isitself an agreed-upon illusion.Truth in Scientology is the study of the lowest common denominator of agreement, plusthe establishment of the true ability of the thetan. The true ability of the thetan is a truth muchhigher than the truth of the MEST universe itself and, if it has ever before been known, thedifficulties of communicating it have been such as to inhibit its promulgation. It can be seen there is truth above what passes for “truth” in the MEST universe.Scientific truths gained from deductive observations of behavior of the MEST universe arethemselves manifestations of agreements on the part of beings -- thetans -- who are capable ofmuch wider creation and agreement than that represented in the MEST universe.We have answered in Scientology a good portion of “what is truth?” Faith -- DistrustThere is no more over-rated quality in existence than faith.The subject who, under the hands of a hypnotist operator, conceives an enormousagreement with the hypnotist, is experiencing faith as it is commonly understood. In this statethe subject can perceive anything which the hypnotist may direct.In order to understand faith, one must be able to differentiate between faith-in and faith.The difference between these two conditions is a direction of flow which earlier we found to bereality itself. Faith-in is an inflow of agreement and the placing of one’s beingness anddoingness under the control of another, and is, in other words, the sacrifice of one’s universe.This is the basic mechanism wherein, all along the whole track, thetans have been recruited insome cause or mystery, and have surrendered to this their own identity and ability. A little ofthis goes a very long distance. It is in essence the basic trick of hypnotism and by it one canconvert and reduce the abilities of a subject for any purpose.Faith-in is an inflow and brings about the acceptance of reality other than one’s own.Faith itself would be without flow where one was in a full state of beingness and, with thiscondition, one could occasion faith itself to occur within his own universe, or could occasionpeople to have faith in him. The auditor will find one of the more aberrative phases of the preclear in his failure toobtain from others faith in himself, and his acquiescence to their demands on any dynamic thathe have faith in them.Because it is entirely true that a being lacking in faith is low in tone, the fact can betraded upon with great ease.Distrust is not the lowest end of the scale, but begins to set in as a neurotic or psychoticcondition at about 1.5. Actually faith interchanges with distrust in gradient levels all the waydown the tone-scale and they alternate one with the other as one goes deeper and deeper into theMEST universe. The lowest level of this scale is not distrust but complete faith-in, which is thecondition held by MEST which is supine to any sculptor."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"This column might also be called the column of belief -- disbelief or the column ofreality -- unreality. The auditor can expect the preclear as he rises up the tone-scale to passthrough the various shades of distrust and the various shades of faith. This is often quiteupsetting to the preclear for he cannot conceive himself to be rising in tone.It is very noteworthy that a preclear, when low in tone at the beginning, will passinevitably through various strata of revulsion for the MEST universe and then for his ownuniverse. The revulsion he can conceive for the MEST universe objects and for being in theMEST universe can become unthinkably distressing to him. When this condition has occurred,the auditor can be reassured by the fact that the preclear is rising in scale but has hit upon one ofthe levels of this column, and that a higher level and a more comfortable one immediatelysucceeds as processing is continued. This is simply a problem of reversing directions of flow.If the auditor is running flows he will find that an inflow is shortly succeeded by an out-flowand this out-flow is shortly succeeded by another in-flow. These are in essence agreements anddisagreements alternating one after the other and each one is slightly higher on the tone-scalethan the last. I Know -- I Know NotEpistemology has long been the senior study of philosophy; Scientology is itself thescience of knowing how to know.The study of knowledge is in essence, in the MEST universe, a study of data. Data inthe MEST universe are usually recorded in facsimiles. Thus one can go in two directionstoward knowledge. The first is knowing what one is, and the second is knowing what hashappened to one in the MEST universe and searching for identity in the MEST universe.There is no more tragic track than the sordid ransacking of facsimiles to discoverTRUTH for all one discovers is what is true for the MEST universe. This wandering andendless trail is bleak with the bones of lost beingness. Earlier explorers have, almost withoutexception, destroyed themselves in this search for TRUTH in the MEST universe, for all theydiscovered was further and further agreement and more and more facsimiles and all theyachieved as individuals were the traps and snake-pits of implants on the whole track.To stand at last near the heights of discovered beingness has withered the sadness ofstanding on other men’s bitter and, until now, probably unrewarded search. It was necessary toransack the facsimiles, which are themselves one’s sole inheritance for travail in the MESTuniverse, to discover the common denominators of facsimiles and to discover that they wereonly facsimiles, how they were created and how experience was impressed upon theindividual. One might well have the feeling of having narrowly escaped a terrible tragedy whenhe views the thinness on which he stood to view this brink of oblivion, for it was obviouslynever intended that anyone should recover from participation or even spectatorship in or of thegame called MEST universe. Dante’s inscription above the portals of Hell might very well bewritten best on the gates of entrance into this universe.The common denominator of all difficulty an individual has in the MEST universe maybe summed up under the heading “facsimiles.” Originally, in his own universe, he used themechanism of energy creation to make objects. In the MEST universe this ability reduces to theuse of energy solely for the recording of data about the MEST universe so that one can agreewith that data. And in this process lies death, not only as a body periodically but as a thetan.What has commonly been mistaken for knowledge has been the MEST universe trackof seeking agreement with the MEST universe by discovering all possible data about what oneshould do in order to agree with the MEST universe. The more data one achieved, the morefacsimiles he had; the more facsimiles he had, the more MEST he was. It was necessary to winthrough this trap in order to recognize, isolate and evaluate the common denominators offacsimiles, and to discover that self-created energy has been utilized to enforce agreement upononeself so as to enslave one’s beingness and lead it to its final destruction."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"No adventure in the MEST universe can exceed the adventure of making orderlyanatomy from the chaos of commingled matter, energy and space which comprise the planets,galaxies and island universes of this Black Beyond which awaited to devour the universe self-constructed of any thetan or group of thetans. The slaying of a roaring beast of fire held in it, inolden times, less action and danger.These lines are not written from any self-congratulatory motive, for fame is a rock. Butby these lines the auditor may be impressed by the actuality of what he handles, and so that hecan appreciate his own gallantry in fronting an adversary of such insentient brutality.The road to knowledge led through the anatomy of the space and energy masses calledthe MEST universe. The data did not lie in the MEST universe. The ransacking of facsimilesfor data about one’s identity, about one’s “past history” in the MEST universe, should betolerated by the auditor only insofar as it gives him materials for creative processing. He shouldnever directly begin the direct processing of facsimiles, whether engrams or secondaries, saveonly in the case of an assist. He needs only to know so much of a preclear’s beingness on thewhole track to know what to mock up for the preclear’s running.The difficulty the preclear is having is not so much the content of various facsimilesbut, on this high echelon of Scientology on which we are now operating, the fact that he hasfacsimiles. The path of better techniques is the path toward permitting the preclear to step awayfrom all his facsimiles.The track to knowledge, then, has two directions. It is possible at this time to take thebetter path. The essence of true knowledge is the essence of existing so that one can createbeingnesses and data to know. All other data are junior to this.A control operation of some magnitude was once perpetrated in the late 18th century. Itwas stated with great authority that anything worth knowing would always be beyond thebounds of human experience. This sought, knowingly or unknowingly, further to block thesearch for beingness. It should never be considered by anyone or under any circumstances thatanything which can affect him could be beyond his ability to know the full nature of what he isexperiencing. If any lesson is contained in Scientology, it is the lesson that the gates to allknowingness are open.One should have the knowledge of the composition of the MEST universe as a foxmight have use for the knowledge of a trap. It is cruelty to make a theta clear without at thesame time educating him so as to permit him to avoid those pitfalls which brought him wherehe is found -- in a MEST body on a planet named Earth (Solar System, Galaxy 13, MESTUniverse).Top-scale knowing would be top-scale ability to create beingness. The identity assignedto one by others and the data contained in facsimiles are knowingness not worth having. Cause -- Full EffectAbove the level of all else on the Chart of Attitudes is Cause. Causation is the highestattainment which can be envisaged by the thetan, but this is not necessarily the highest possibleattainment, and much higher levels may be envisionable by the thetan when he has attained highon the level of causation.To be Full Cause, one would have to be able to cause space and many othermanifestations. Everyone, to a greater or lesser degree, attempts to be cause until he is at lastthe full effect. The fullest effect in this universe is to be MEST itself.One of the principles of causation is outlined in the cycle of action, but it is notnecessarily true that one can only cause a cycle of this pattern or that one must cause cycles at"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"all, for it is excellent processing to mock-up with reverse cycles going from death back tocreation with objects which one has mocked up.It is one of the “facts” of objects that space and energy must have been caused beforethe object could exist in the MEST universe. Thus any object has prior cause. For this reasonwhen anyone in the MEST universe begins to study in order to resolve some of the riddles ofthe MEST universe, he falls into the trap of supposing all cause to be prior and time itself toexist. This would make one the later effect of everything he caused. In other words, if he madea postulate, he would then immediately afterwards become the effect of that postulate. Causesmotivated by “future” desire, enforcement and inhibition of havingness, do not lie in the pastbut only in the condition of havingness in this universe which states that any object must havehad a “prior” cause.The preclear has become aberrated by the process of making an effect out of him andtaking from him the ability to be cause by convincing him that it is better to be an effect.Freud had one of the major aberrations in view when he declared his libido theory in1894 and decided therein that sex was the only aberration. It is certainly a major one in homosapiens, for in sex one desires to be the cause of little or nothing and desires to be the effect ofpleasurable sensation.Anything in the MEST universe which one desires, he desires because it will have apleasant effect on him. Thus he is searching for sensation caused exterior to himself which willmake on him an effect. How much of an effect can he become? MEST! The snare ofpleasurable sensation leads one to accept energy other than one’s own. Desire for this energy orobjects then puts one in the condition of being an effect. When one is surrounded by as manypowerful possible energy sources as one finds in the MEST universe, he cannot but become alow level cause.When a preclear is at a level on the tone-scale where he is concerned with bad and good(above 8.0 both these are seen broadly enough to understand that they are viewpoints) he isvery concerned if he thinks that he is or could be bad cause and is desirous of being what heconsiders good cause. He judges these things by moral codes and so bends his conduct as tomake bad cause antipathetic to himself and others. Thus he gives away responsibility for badcause and in that very action becomes the effect of bad cause. When he has found himself to bewhat he considers bad cause, he ceases to “trust” himself and begins to blame himself and thenothers.All angels have two faces. They are commonly represented in mythology as having ablack and white face. To be complete cause, theoretically, a person would have to be willing tobe bad cause and good cause. Only in this wise, in the MEST universe, could he escape theliability of becoming the effect of bad cause.The criminal who has elected himself bad cause through having found it impossible totrust himself (and a criminal career always begins at the moment when the criminal-to-be loseshis self-respect; a career of prostitution cannot begin until self-respect is lost; and self-respect isonly lost when one considers himself to be bad cause) can only escape becoming an effect byfighting all good cause. The reformation or reclamation of the criminal does not depend uponpunishment, which only seeks to make him more MEST than he is, nor yet upon good cause,which he must fight, but upon the reestablishment of the criminal’s self-respect; for only afterthis is he capable of being good cause.An entire process evolves around “what would you cause on (each one of thedynamics)?” An assessment of the preclear with a meter should seek to establish where thepreclear feels he would be bad cause, for it is on this point that he will be found to have lost hisself-respect and where it will be discovered why he cannot trust himself. Self-trust, self-respectand the ability to be cause are conditions in the same order of magnitude and can beinterchangeably approached."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"I Am -- I Am NotOn the Chart of Attitudes which accompanies the Handbook for Preclears, it will befound at 22.0 “I am myself.” The only true identity is “myself.” It is not a name, it is not adesignation. Orders, titles, ranks, praise and enduring fame alike do not bring about thecondition “I am” or an actual identity; they bring about instead an identification, with all theliabilities of identification. The finality of identification is 0.0 or lower on the tone-scale.The concept of infinite mind is not new, but it has always been assigned to anotherbeingness than self. The preclear will be found to be intensely aberrated who has swornallegiance to some infinite beingness and has then agreed that all space belonged to thatbeingness, and that the rights of creation and energy belonged to that beingness and did notbelong to self. This is a handy and, to the very badly aberrated, acceptable method of denyingany responsibility for anything. It is also the shortest route toward I AM NOT. Infinite mind isindividualistic. All mankind does not depend upon or share a portion of the infinite mind. Onthe contrary, the highest individualism attainable is the individualism of the infinite mind. Itwas beyond the power and grasp of the intellect applying itself to the field of philosophy, toconceive a multiplicity of infinite minds, and these commentators had agreed sufficiently withthe MEST universe to conceive that the only space was the MEST universe space and theycould not understand that this was an illusion, and that the existence of space does not dependupon existing space. Just as there can be an “infinity” of ideas, so can there be an “infinity” of“infinities” of space. Two beings theoretically, each with an infinite mind, and each capable ofthe production of an infinity of space, could yet co-produce sufficient space to communicatewith each other. This may be difficult to conceive until one has attained a level of the tone-scalesufficient for an expansive viewing of his potentialities, at which moment it becomes simplicityitself.There is a psychosis which has as its manifestation the illusion that one is God and theruler of the universe. This psychosis comes about from the effort of an individual who is wellbelow complete agreement with the MEST universe, to shift into the valence of what he hasalready accepted to be the creator of the universe. Instead of being himself, he has becomeunable even to be a MEST body in a sane condition, has conceived God to be MEST, and hasthen shifted into the valence of God. God, in this case, will be found to be conceived to be aMEST object. As an aside to this, below the level of complete agreement that the MESTuniverse is the only reality, begins the state which could be described by the statement, “Iagree, I am still agreeing, and yet you are still punishing me.” The unfortunate fact about theMEST universe is that it is MEST and is designed to punish and cares nothing about agreementwith it beyond the point that one agrees with it, and has no spirit of fair play wherebypunishment ceases when one has acknowledged the winner. Recognition of this brings oninsanity in an effort to further back away from responsibility and further escape frompunishment. In the MEST universe, this escape from punishment is, of course, impossible.Thus there is a level below 0.0 for any immortal being.One of the first confusions on the part of the preclear which the auditor will encounter isthe fact that the preclear considers himself to be in the state of I AM when he has a body and aname. This is high-tone compared to the sub-zero state in which the thetan quite often findshimself, but it is very far from optimum. Here the preclear is confusing identity with his ownsense of beingness. His sense of beingness does not depend upon and, indeed, is confused bya MEST identity such as a name assigned to him and a body with which he can be recognized.To a large degree the society of Earth requires, as part of its structure, names and themeans to identify. The state finds itself very satisfied whenever it increases its ability to readilyidentify its citizenry, and will resort to almost any pretext to collect the fingerprints and dossierof one and all.Identity is such a liability and is so thoroughly MEST that individuality is really notpossible in the presence of sharply defined identity. Reaching down into the sub-zero tone-scale, the thetan finds it expedient not only to mask his beingness, but to hide his identity withgreat thoroughness even from himself. This passion for non-identity is the spasm of clinging to"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"the last shreds of individuality which would otherwise be lost. Thetans from some of the corpsoperating in space have thoroughly agreed to be amongst themselves completely black, thebetter to hide in the blackness of space. This blackness is found in the occluded case in manyinstances.The commonest plea on the part of the preclear is “Who am I?” He feels that if he couldonly answer this, he would be happy. He then ransacks his facsimiles for all of his pastidentities on his many spirals and as these amount to hundreds of millions, he finds nosurcease. He succeeds only in damaging himself with the many injuries contained in facsimilesthrough which he is searching. He is identifying to the point where he is searching not for thestate of I AM but for WHAT HAVE I BEEN LABELLED? The attainment of the state of I AMdepends upon one’s ability to again be able to create space, energy and objects in and for hisown universe, by himself or in co-operation with other thetans, and the rehabilitation of themany additional abilities of the thetan for the creation of energy is but one of a very largenumber. Thus the state of I AM is reached through creative processing and postulate processingrather than the processing of MEST universe facsimiles or endless searching with an E-meter todiscover what one has been.There are gods above all other gods. Anything which has wide acceptance and has beensuccessful, wherever suns shine and planets swing, is based upon some fundamental truth.There is no argument here against the existence of a Supreme Being or any devaluationintended. It is that amongst gods, there are many false gods elected to power and position forthe benefit and use of those who would control and make into the basest slaves the mostsublime beings. As an ancient Greek said, when one has examined the descriptions of Godwritten by men, he finds in that Being at best a thirst for self-aggrandizement and adulationwhich would be disgusting in any man. Man has sought to make his God a god of mudbecause the Early Greek and even more distant peoples, made idols in the form of men bywhich they thought to entrap the beingness of some local divinity who troubled them; moremodern man has fallen into the error of making God into the body of a homo sapiens andposting him somewhere on high with a craving for vengeance and a pettiness in punishmentmatched only by the degradation of homo sapiens himself.There are gods above all other gods, and gods beyond the gods of universes, but itwere better, far better, to be a raving madman in his cell than to be a thing with the ego, cruelty,and jealous lust that base religions have set up to make men grovel down. Win -- LoseIt is noteworthy that as the preclear ascends the tone-scale, his desire to win increases.Those low on the tone-scale, even when they think they are trying to win, will almostuniformly set up their problems and solutions so that they will lose.Homo sapiens has little converse with true competence. There is an astonishing level ofwinningness above 4.0 where competence becomes a joy like poetry.Regret of competence ensues when one has employed competence to injure anotherbeing drastically. The duellist begins with joy in competence of sword-handling and beforelong, because of the counter-emotion he receives from his practice of the art, conceives disgustfor competence. In a later life, he will carry this into everything he does, so fearing that he willemploy competence to injure that he dares not practice competence in the smallest things; andby failing to practice competence, so introduces losingness, to the injury of himself and others.A man who instinctively recoils from competence and perfection, at the wheel of a car, willsometimes cause an accident rather than avoid one if competence of a high order is required inthe avoidance.To win one must wish to win; when one no longer desires to win, one no longerdesires to live. (Note -- The remaining three columns of the chart of attitudes are covered"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"broadly in the earlier text.) The Emotional Scale and Sub-Zero Tone-ScaleThe emotional scale has been covered often and exhaustively elsewhere. As has beendiscussed in this text, it is dependent upon that characteristic of energy known as affinity whichitself is established by flows, dispersals and ridges.Below zero on the tone-scale is applicable only to a thetan.It has been quite commonly observed that there are two positions for any individual onthe tone-scale. This occurs because there is a position for the composite of the thetan plus hisMEST body operating in a state of unknowingness that he is not a MEST body, and behavingaccording to social patterns, which give him some semblance of sanity. The other position onthe tone-scale is the position of the thetan himself, and it is necessary for us to demonstrate anegative scale in order to find the thetan at all.For the thetan you will find the scale as follows: 40.0 Serenity of beingness 8.0 Exhilaration 4.0 Enthusiasm 3.0 Conservatism 2.5 Boredom 2.0 Antagonism 1.8 Pain 1.5 Anger 1.2 No-sympathy 1.0 Fear 0.9 Sympathy 0.8 Propitiation 0.5 Grief 0.375 Making amends 0.05 Apathy 0.0 Being a body -0.2 Being other bodies -1.0 Punishing other bodies -1.3 Responsibility as blame -1.5 Controlling bodies -2.2 Protecting bodies -3.0 Owning bodies -3.5 Approval from bodies -4.0 Needing bodies -8.0 Hiding This sub-zero tone-scale shows that the thetan is several bands below knowingness as abody, and so he will be found in the majority of cases. In our homo sapiens he will bediscovered to be below zero on the tone-scale. The zero-to-four plus tone-scale was formulatedon, and referred to, bodies and the activity of thetans with bodies. In order, then, to discoverthe state of mind of the thetan, one must examine the sub-zero scale. He has some trainedpatterns as a body which make it possible for him to know and to be. As himself, he has lost allbeingness, all pride, all memories and all self-determined ability, but yet has an automaticresponse-mechanism in himself which continues furnishing his energy.EACH ONE OF THE ABOVE POINTS ON THE SCALE IS RUN AS POSITIVE"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"AND NEGATIVE. Example: The beautiful sadness of needing bodies. The beautiful sadnessof NOT needing bodies. The beauty of being responsible for bodies, the beauty of NOT beingresponsible for bodies. Each one is run as itself and then as the reverse with the addition ofNOT.The sub-zero to 40.0 scale is the range of the thetan. A thetan is lower than body death,since it survives body death. It is in a state of knowingness below 0.375 only when it isidentifying itself as a body and IS, to its own thinking, the body. The BODY-PLUS-THETANscale is from 0.0 to 4.0, and the position on this scale is established by the social environmentand education of the composite being and is a stimulus-response scale. The preclear is initiallyabove this 0.375 on the BODY-PLUS-THETAN range. Then, on auditing, he commonlydrops from the FALSE TONE of the BODY-PLUS-THETAN scale and into the true tone of thethetan.This is actually the only self-determined tone present -- the actual tone of the thetan.From this sub-zero he quickly rises up scale through the entire range as a thetan and generallysettles at 20.0 and in command of the body and situations. The course of auditing then takes thepreclear, quite automatically, down from the FALSE TONE of the BODY-PLUS-THETANscale to the actual tone of the thetan. Then the tone of the thetan rises back up the scale level bylevel.It is not uncommon to find the preclear (who IS the thetan) quite raving mad under thefalse “veneer” of social and educational stimulus-response training and to discover that thepreclear, while behaving quite normally in the BODY-PLUS-THETAN state, becomesirrational in the course of auditing. BUT DESPITE THIS, the preclear is actually being farmore sane and rational than ever before and the moment he discovers himself as himself, asTHE source of energy and personality and beingness of a body, he becomes physically andmentally better. Thus the auditor must not be dismayed at the course of tone, but should simplypersevere until he has the thetan up into rational range. A raving mad thetan is far more sanethan a normal human being. But then, as you audit, observe it for yourself. The DichotomiesWhile the auditor can do much solely by reducing facsimiles, he soon will find that hispreclears are not always able to erase facsimiles easily. He will find occasionally that he oftenhas a difficult time when a particularly heavy facsimile is in restimulation and, do what he will,the auditor may find his preclear’s tone remains unchanged and that the preclear’s attitudes havenot evolved to a better high.We now come to “The Governor” mentioned in a lecture in the autumn of 1951. Thespeed of a preclear is the speed of his production of energy.The most important step in establishing a preclear’s self-determinism, the main goal ofthe auditor, is the rehabilitation of the preclear’s ability to produce energy.A being is, apparently, an energy production source. How does he produce live energywithout mechanical means, cellular activity, or food?The basic principle of energy production by a being has been copied in electronics. It isvery simple. A difference of potential of two areas can establish an energy flow of themselves.Carbon batteries, electric generators, and other producers of electrical flows act on the principlethat a difference of energy potential in two or more areas can cause an electrical impulse to flowbetween or amongst them.The preclear is static and kinetic, meaning he is no-motion and motion. These,interplaying, produce electrical flow."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"A preclear as a static can hold two or more energy flows of different wavelengths inproximity and between them obtain a flow.A preclear can hold a difference of flow between two waves and a static so long (andarduously) that the effect of a discharging condenser can be obtained. This can “explode” afacsimile.The preclear flows electrical currents of command at the body. These hit pre-establishedridges (areas of dense waves) and cause the body to perceive or act. The preclear takesperception from the body with tractor beams. He holds the body still or braces himself againstit by wrapping a tractor (pulling) beam around it while he places a pressor (pushing) beam athis back to command himself into action. (You can almost break a preclear’s spine by askinghim to contract his own tractor around his body and yet withhold the pressor against his spine.)All an auditor really needs to know about this is the elementary method of using adifference of potential. That creates energy.The only thing wrong with a preclear with an aged MEST body is that he has too manyfacsimiles of his tractors and pressors handling his own MEST body and the rickety state of thebody feeds back “slowness” so that he thinks his energy is low -- and until worked with somemethod such as this, facsimiles do not reduce.Any difference of potential played one against the other creates energy. Aesthetic wavesagainst a static produce energy. Aesthetic waves against analytical waves produce energy.Analytical waves against emotional waves produce energy. Emotional waves against effortwaves produce energy. Effort against matter produces energy. The last is the method used on Earth in generating electrical current for power. Theothers are equally valid and produce even higher flows. This is a gradient scale of beingness,from the zero-infinity of theta to the solidity of matter.The differences of potential most useful are easy to run.This is, actually, alternating current running. There can be DC running or chain fissionrunning but these are very experimental at this writing.AC is created by the static holding first one, then the other, of a dichotomy of twodifferences of potential. A flow is run in one direction with one of the pair, then in the otherdirection with the other. The dichotomies are:1.Survive 12. FaithSuccumbDistrust2. Affinity 13. ImagineNo affinityTruth3.

How are these used?One asks the preclear to flow agreement, then disagreement. He flows a feeling, athought (NEVER the phrase!) of “agreement” out or in, in the direction he chooses relative tohimself. He lets this flow until it turns smoky grey or white, then black. Then he changes thedirection of flow and gets the thought or feeling of “disagreement”. He runs this until it turnsgrey or white, then black. When this has turned black or dark, he again runs “agreement” in itsdirection until he gets grey or white, then again black. Now he reverses the flow and flows thethought “disagreement” until he gets grey or white, then blackness. And so on and on.It will be noted that at first it may take some little time for a flow to run from blackthrough white to black. As the preclear continues to run, after minutes or many hours, hebegins to run faster, then faster and faster, until at last he can keep a flow blazing andcrackling.A method of aberrating beings was to give them white and black energy sources in theirvicinity. These show up on a very low tone occluded case as blazing white and shining white.That is an electronic incident, not his own energy flow. These run blazing white in onedirection for minutes or hours before they go black. They then run the other way, blazingwhite, almost as long.WHEN BLACK PREDOMINATES IN SUCH INCIDENT WHAT HE “HAS TO DO”TO GET THE INCIDENT ALL WHITE.As the preclear runs, he finds the speed of the change of flow changes, more and morerapidly until it runs like a vibration. This vibration, theoretically, can increase to a strongcurrent which becomes so great it is well to ground your preclear by using an E-meter or lettinghim hold a wire in each hand which is connected to a bare water pipe or radiator. Otherwise,his MEST body may be damaged by the flow."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Run a dichotomy only against its mate. Run in alternating directions until the flow turnsblack.Don’t run a black “flow.” It doesn’t flow or run out. Methods a RunningThere are many methods of running facsimiles and of handling ridges and flows. Thesehave been covered in other publications; all of them have validity and can advance cases.In the present publication there are only two processes which are stressed and theseprocesses are superior to others published prior to December 1st, 1952. A great many testshave established the fact that two processes, both of them simple, produce far better resultsthan any of the others.The title “Scientology 8-8008” means the attainment of infinity by the reduction of theMEST universe’s apparent infinity to zero and the increase of the zero of one’s own universe toan infinity of one’s own universe. This road is attained by postulate processing and creativeprocessing.To run any incident or use any process it is necessary for the auditor to have a verysound idea of what he is doing, and to this end it is recommended that he know and be able touse the following: Processing The Code The Theta Entity The Entities Running Engrams Running Secondaries Running Locks Concepts and Feelings Running Ridges (Circuits) Running Live Flow Freeing the Thetan by Concept and Feeling Freeing the Thetan by Present and Future Randomity Freeing by Dichotomies Freeing by Tone Scale Freeing the Thetan by Orientation Freeing the Thetan by Positioning and Exhaustion of Flows Postulate ProcessingActually energy is produced by the thetan simply by postulating that it will be inexistence. What he says will be so, becomes so for him; if he becomes extremely powerful, itbecomes so for others. This condition has been misused by most thetans who, often in thepast, have been afraid of making postulates that will come true. They believe that if they say athing will happen, it will then happen -- to such an extent that they now revulse against statinganything will happen.Another aberrative condition with regard to postulates is that for the sake of randomity,the thetan at some time or another has set up the postulate that every time he makes a postulate areverse postulate will occur which he will not know about, in such a way that he can “playchess with himself” without spoiling the game by knowing what his left hand is doing whenhis right makes the move."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"It is not true that postulates have to be located all through the facsimiles and worn outby repetition. It is just as easy to make new postulates; but first one must recover from thedepths to which his postulates have taken him. The most dangerous postulates are thosepostulates where one decided to agree with something which would become aberrative.You can see by examining any facsimile in the preclear related to an accident that themost aberrative things in that facsimile are what the preclear himself decided.Postulates are accompanied by evaluations and conclusions. It is often possible to“loosen” a postulate by discovering to the preclear why he made it, or what data he was usingat the time.As a preclear becomes very aberrated and believes himself to be more and more MEST,his postulates become as unwieldy to use as actual objects, and he finds them as difficult tochange as objects.When doing creative processing and moving objects and energy in created space andtime, the preclear is doing this by making postulates. It comes as a shock to some preclears thatthey are handling time by shifting space. One handles time by simply saying that he had a thingand now he does not have it, or that he will have or will view a thing in the future. One doesnot shift time by shifting space, nor does one continue to look at something he has put into thepast. He says it is in the past and so it becomes in the past.When the thetan is unable to handle postulates about time, the auditor should ask himabout some MEST universe incident such as breakfast, and then enquire how he rememberedthat he had breakfast, and if he will have something to eat on the morrow, and then how heknows he will have something to eat on the morrow. He does not look at his breakfast to findout if he had breakfast, he knows that he ate breakfast; and he does not go into tomorrow tofind out if he will probably eat on the morrow, he knows -- or, at least, believes it possible --that he will eat on the morrow. Moving time, as in any other postulate, is knowingness notviewingness. An object goes into the past in the same space as it was in, in the present; and inthe future may be in the same space as it was in in the past. The space does not change thecondition of havingness changes, and one estimates this by some degree of knowingness.The entire subject of postulates is the subject of certainty and self-belief. That preclearwho has a low self-belief finds it difficult first, to make a postulate which he will believe andsecond, to undo one he has made. Creative processing and postulate processing alike remedythis.Rising-scale processing is another way of doing postulate processing. One takes anypoint or column of the Chart of Attitudes as given in this text, which the preclear can reach, andasks the preclear then to shift his postulate upwards toward a higher level.In order to do this the auditor says, “Now, on the subject of rightness and wrongness,how wrong do you think you generally are?” The preclear tells him. The auditor says, “Howhigh can you shift this attitude toward believing yourself right?” The preclear shifts the attitudeas high as he can. The auditor takes this as the next level from which he will work upward untilhe attains as nearly as possible a postulate which will “hold” to the effect that the preclearbelieves himself right. Rising-scale processing should not be confused with the processing offlows. One can process all these columns in terms of flows. Rising-scale processing is simplya method of shifting postulates upward toward optimum from where the preclear believes he ison the chart. Rising-scale processing is essentially a process directed toward increasing beliefin self by using all the “buttons” on the Chart of Attitudes.The preclear is generally found to be quite uncertain about his postulates. He does notknow whether or not what he says will take effect or, if he says it and if it takes effect, if it willnot rebound upon him. He becomes afraid to make postulates for fear he will make somepostulate destructive to himself or others and may even discover himself making postulates to"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"convince himself he should be ill.One has to tell oneself what to be before one is. Recovery of this ability is the essenceof processing a thetan. Postulate processing is a very vital process to apply to the thetan: when he isexteriorized, he can change his postulates rapidly. If he finds himself thinking slowly anddoing other things which are not optimum when he is outside, One can better his situation andcondition by asking him to change postulates. Creative ProcessingStandard Operating Procedure for theta clearing is the backbone of processing inScientology. It is easily followed but the auditor should have an excellent command of all typesof processing in order to use it more successfully.SOP is most easily done and most successfully by an auditor who is a theta clear.Auditors who are not theta clear seldom understand it, and a low-toned uncleared auditor whocannot himself leave his body very often acts to pin a preclear inside his body. It is noteworthythat many auditors have been unable to obtain successes with theta clearing before theythemselves have been cleared, but immediately after the auditor was cleared, he was successfulwith each successive case without exception. The fear of some thetans from various causes ofleaving the body causes the auditor -- who is the thetan -- to make other thetans stay in bodies,and it is actually quite dangerous to be audited by auditors who are not theta clears. The processis not dangerous; uncleared auditors are. Standard Operating Procedure, Issue 3 This process is done in steps. The auditor with EVERY preclear makes no otherjudgment than to begin with Step I and, failing to accomplish that immediately, to go to Step II;if he fails to accomplish this immediately, he goes to Step III; and so on. When he is able toaccomplish a step he labels the case as that step number, i.e., a III. He then begins workingwith that step. After a few hours’ work, he again starts at the top with the preclear with Step Iand progresses on through. Eventually the preclear becomes a Step I. STEP I -- POSITIVE EXTERIORIZING: Ask the preclear to be a foot back of hishead. If he does, make him go back further, then up, then down, practising placement in spaceand time. Then one asks him to see if there are any items in the body he would like to repairand proceeds to let the preclear repair them according to the preclear’s own ideas as to how heshould do it. Then educate the preclear by making him create and destroy his own illusions intofinally getting a certainty of illusion and from this a certainty of perceiving the real universewith all perceptions. (Note. The most real universe is, of course, one’s own illusory universeand should be completely rehabilitated before one attempts to perceive or handle or worry aboutthe MEST universe. Rehabilitated, sonic, visio, etc. of the MEST universe are very clear andvery certain. Clear perception in early stages is not a test of being outside. The only test iswhether the preclear KNOWS he is outside.) Failing the first line of this step, go to Step II.STEP II -- BY ORIENTATION: Ask the preclear, still inside, to locate the inside of hisforehead. Ask him to put a pressor beam against it and push himself out the back of his head.Supplement this by asking him to reach out through the back of his head and grab the wall witha pulling beam and pull himself out. Ask him to steady himself outside and then, by means ofbeams, to raise and lower himself while outside and to move to various parts of the room whilestill outside. Use creative processing. By orientation as a thetan, placing himself as a thetan intime and space, he becomes sure of his whereabouts. Have him find and cast off old lineswhich have their terminals fixed to him. Have him find those lines wherever they are and attachthem to radiators and water taps as the energy will drain out of him. (The II ordinarily has"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"enough lines to cause him to snap back in the head when he releases beams.) Failing this, go toStep III. STEP III -- SPACE PROCESSING: In that the MEST universe has forced upon thethetan its spatial dimensions and directions, the thetan is likely to become a point which is beingsubjected to all the counter-efforts and counter-emotions of his environment, for his entireconcept of space is being determined by the MEST universe. Have the thetan, still inside, findhis feet in the opposite direction from where the MEST body is located by the MEST universe.Have him turn the feet around. Have him create differences in his body and reverse variouslimbs and positions according to his viewpoint, each one in disagreement with the MESTuniverse, particularly as appertaining to gravity and other influences. This sets up an ability todisagree with the MEST universe in terms of space. Have him locate his eyes in the back of hishead, on the soles of his feet and in other places. Have him assume other bodies, each timechanging them slightly, and putting them away. Then have him gather himself into his normalMEST universe spatial areas and go to Step I. STEP IV -- RIDGE RUNNING: Ask the preclear to give himself a command to walk.Let him locate the white flow line which results inside his head. When this line goes dark, havehim locate the tiny ridge inside the skull that stopped it. Have him run the flow from this barrier(these barriers, are tiny ridges and each has a thought with it such as “Can’t walk” or “Toobored to walk”) back toward the spot where he told himself to walk. It will run white for amoment, then go black. Have him give himself the command to walk again and “watch” thisflow line. It may run through two or three tiny barriers and then stop. Again have him run the“objection” to walking. Have him watch this “objection” flow until it goes black. Then havehim give himself the command to walk again and so on and so on. He will wind up at someoutside point. Now have him give himself the command “Listen” and have him run this and itsback flows on “black and white” until he is exterior on the subject of listen. Then use thecommand “Talk” similarly. Then the command “Nod,” then the command “Move,” etc. Give“Look” last for it may “blind” his perception of black and white. He may each time get out to adistance in another quarter. If he can do all this, start with Step I again. Failing this step, failingto “see” black and white energy manifestations, go to Step V.STEP V -- BLACK AND WHITE CONTROL PROCESSING: Give the preclear acomplete E-meter assessment, using the principles of what he would create or destroy or wouldnot create and would not destroy. Use this data to make mock-ups. Then have the preclearcreate and perceive black spots and then white spots, black crosses and white crosses, andmove these here and there through the room or through his own space. Turn them on and off,interchange them, put them in yesterday, put them in tomorrow, make them get larger, makethem get smaller; each time doing as much as the preclear can do. Each time one asks him toperceive one of his own created illusions in terms of black and white spots or crosses, oneattempts to coax him into successful control of it. Audit very persuasively and lightly. Thispreclear ordinarily is frightened of blackness because it either can contain dangerous things orcontains nothing, and he cannot differentiate which. Thus he cannot control blackness and, inbeing unable to control blackness, flounders in it. He also has a more basic computation: thatblackness is the only safe thing in which to hide and, therefore, blackness is a thing to have.Further, blackness “takes” things for him. This preclear may be afraid of the police, maybelieve himself to have a hideous body, thetawise, and has many other reasons why he cannotexteriorize. Drills on creating and perceiving black and white should be continued until he canhandle each easily. The trouble with this preclear and preclears lower than this is that they haveagreed too heavily with the MEST universe and must be very cautious in confronting it, sincein that direction they conceive to lie a much more complete defeat even than that from whichthey are now suffering.

General ProcessingAnything which rehabilitates the self-determinism of a preclear, whether education,change of environment, running facsimiles, theta clearing or the creation of one’s ownuniverse, is valid processing. Any one of these will raise the tone of the preclear markedly. Atthe end of 80,000 hours of investigation of beingness in the MEST universe, I have concludedthat those processes which make it possible for the preclear to disagree with the MEST universealso make it possible for him to handle the MEST universe, or to create his own or be part of agroup which creates a universe, as the case may be.Scientology 8-8008 is remarkable for its ability to better the beingness and actionpotentials of the individual. It is, sadly enough, the only technique which I have seen produceexcellent and fast results in the hands of trained auditors. Mainly the reason is that homosapiens has and will continue to use, any technique delivered into his hands for the control andenslavement of others, for homo sapiens is frightened. Even when an auditor was competentwith earlier techniques, it would often occur that his preclear would return into his pastenvironment and would relapse.This occurred because others had a vested interest in the preclear’s continuation in astate of aberration; and others would lose no moment in starting again to crush this precleardown the tone-scale to a point where they conceived he was more easily controlled. Mest is themost easily controlled item in the MEST universe, and the closer a human being could bepressed toward MEST, the easier, it was thought, to control him.That his value and ethical sense deteriorated in direct ratio to the degree he wasdepressed down the tone-scale, was overlooked by the homo sapiens who had a passion forslavery.The primary benefit of Scientology 8-8008 is that it works so swiftly even whenindifferently used that the persons in the environment of the preclear are over-reached rapidlyby the preclear and find themselves subject to his control when they act to continue hisaberration.Further the auditor is seldom aware of the height his preclear attains until the preclearhas attained it. Processing has always worked in the hands of a competent auditor; and it werebetter for any technique, no matter how dangerous, to be known to Man if it could benefit atleast a few, for homo sapiens has no psycho-therapy. In Dianetics he had his first thoroughlyvalidated psychotherapy and Dianetics worked and still works uniformly in the hands of thoseskilled in its application.In Scientology in general, and in theta clearing in particular, the upper limits of homosapiens as such have been transcended and it would not be good semantics to call a theta clear ahomo sapiens or even, exactly speaking, a person, for he is a thetan with a body he uses forpurposes of action and communication, and his viewpoint is quite altered. His general health ismore or less directly under his control, but there is no goal for the body as a final goal inScientology, for the body is a tool. The genetic entity which built the human body reallywanted to be served."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The complexities and ridges which he developed speak of a craving for energy and self-service which could only be the basest aberration, and, true enough, the genetic entity isaberrated almost beyond belief, as any thetan discovers when he seeks to clear the geneticentity.The body is quite alive and self-motivated without the thetan, as the thetan soondiscovers; but it is so used to taking orders from successive lines of thetans which themselvessome day would probably become part of this complex system of ridges, that its “mentalactivities” are quite stupid. The thetan who has lived in this association and has believedhimself to be the body is early quite appalled at the character of the genetic entity who iscowardly, a thing of stimulus-response, without further will or goals than to grow a body, andobsessed entirely with the idea of growing one.The thetan can repair the body quite easily if he so chooses, but quite often sees it as apointless activity; for one’s personality is not even faintly dependent upon the body but is onlydebased by association with one. When one has learned to control a body from a distance, he isusually content to let it get along as best it can, for the reduction of all counter-efforts of thegenetic entity would be a reduction of the entire body. The genetic entity has his whole trackand has had his own travails. In other parts of space, not too incredibly, “dolls” are used bythetans -- things which can be animated easily by theta energy and which are disposable andwhich do not have the uncomfortable circumstance of being themselves any more alive than anyother MEST.The MEST universe itself has a considerable cravingness in it. It is composed of energywhich was emanated in order to have, and the energy still contains as its basic characteristicHave and Not Have, and is itself, when contacted, found to possess a craving which does notmake the MEST alive but which speaks of that which made the MEST. This cravingness is anessential part of all matter. Certain metals contain the desire to be had much more than others,and certain other metals contain the craving not to be had. This is one way of looking atpositive and negative reactions.The body’s being composed of such energy makes it feel as though it is holding on tothe thetan. Nothing is really holding on to the thetan since he has no substance which can beheld. Even the genetic entity does not hold on to the thetan, but probably considers him somesort of far off commanding god -- if he thinks of the thetan at all.Space has its own demanding quality and insists on its dimensions being accepted byanything in the universe, for it was erected and is erected on a command basis in the MESTuniverse.Processing must resolve this havingness on the part of matter, and the commandingnesson the part of space. To confront these directly is, for most preclears, an impossibility, for itonly drives them further into an apathy of agreement with MEST. The preclear has longcontested with the MEST universe and has continually sought to create his own universe onlyto find the MEST universe declaring itself stronger each time and compressing the illusion tonothing.The war cry of the MEST universe is: “Must have gotten it somewhere,” and “It musthave gone somewhere.” It will not tolerate the vaguest possibility that one created himself orcould destroy anything himself. The whole sub-zero scale is a manifestation of one’s efforts tocombat this demandingness on the part of the MEST universe. Hiding, protecting, owning, areall mechanisms to answer the question, “Where did you get it?” “What did you do with it?” TheMEST universe, in this light, is essentially a police universe, for it operates upon force andintolerance and demands with pain that its laws be accepted. In that its laws are based solelyupon agreement, it is only necessary to discover how one can disagree with them to abolishwhat has been called “natural law” for oneself. Upon the abolishment of this agreementdepends the health, progress and advancement of the thetan."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"This universe is a major expanding trap of finite dimensions and rather idioticsimplicity. If one were to leave the MEST universe, one would solely create space of his ownand maintain enough knowledge of what could happen with regard to the MEST universe todefeat its encroachment and its salesmen. No universe, however cunningly constructed, isentirely proof against this expanding trap. The MEST universe is a game which has gone ontoo long and of which even the players are tired. Earth could be considered to be at this time anegress terminal.It is noteworthy that one must not accept or know any of these conditions to have theseprocesses work. They act very swiftly and uniformly on any homo sapiens and upon otherbeings. A considerable number of the principles which have been discovered in Scientologyexist above the MEST universe. The MEST universe itself might be considered to be the“inevitable average” of illusion once it starts in a certain direction. We have in natural law asapplied to the MEST universe the sum of agreement upon illusion. Tracing the principles ofScientology as they apply specifically to the MEST universe, is the tracing of the agreementswhich brought about the MEST universe. The axioms of 1951 are, in the main, a tracing of thisagreement.The inevitability and “diabolical accuracy” of these predictions of human behaviordepend upon their being held in common by Man, which they are. They extend as well to otherbeings below the level of player in this universe and have applied to many sets of players,while much of the data which has been recovered in this investigation seems, to the narrowscope of homo sapiens, quite wild, the wildness depends on the absence of investigation in thepast and can be compared only to the stupidity which remained ignorant of them; for thesematters were an unseen and insidious causation underlying the grief of Earth, at best a pawn ina minor game in a minor galaxy. The Anatomy of SpaceBefore energy can exist in this universe, space must exist. His inability to create spaceis one of the most aberrative characteristics of the thetan whom we find in a MEST body. Hehas become reduced to a point even in his own concept, and perhaps even less than a point forhe has no space of his own but must depend upon bodies and other conditions to believe that hehas space.It is of the utmost importance for the auditor to understand space. Space can beconsidered to be a viewpoint of dimensions. It does not matter how many dimensions there areor what conditions are set up for these dimensions: the resulting condition is known as “space.”There are only three dimensions in space in the MEST universe. Throughout all of its galaxiesit has only length, breadth and depth. Space warps and other things of equal interest can existin one’s own universe, but they do not exist as such, evidently, in the MEST universe.The assignation of dimension is the essence of space, but even before dimension can beassigned, one must have viewpoint. If one is assigning dimension from his viewpoint, he iscause; if dimension is being assigned to his viewpoint, he is effect. He is cause or effect to thedegree that he can assign dimension and call it space.The preclear has a viewpoint and is the center of that viewpoint. Splitting his attentionoften finds him occupying several viewpoints. He is capable of assuming many. Where he isaware of being aware is, however, his central viewpoint; and, although this may becommunicated with or interlocked to some other viewpoint which he could call his own -- evenon some other planet or here on earth -- he is yet as himself the center of assignation ofdimension where he is and as he is.In many preclears this becomes so blurred that he does not know whether he is in or outof the body. Here even the center of viewpoint has been overridden by MEST assignation ofdimension."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"An essential in agreement with any illusion is the acceptance of the dimensions itassigns or that one may assign to it, Space is no more complicated than this, but when apreclear has been overridden by enforced assignation of dimension to an enormous degree, hisown viewpoint may be found to be scattered or dispersed. It is this condition which finds thepreclear unable to tell whether he is in or out of his body; when this condition exists he is in thestate of being incapable of confronting the MEST universe, even to the point of asserting theownership of a center of viewpoint.The solution of this problem is simple, in principle, although it may require many hoursof auditing. Where the preclear has a certainty of center of viewpoint he exteriorizesimmediately and can become a theta clear in a very few hours; when he has been compressedby counter-efforts and emotions into an acceptance of MEST dimension to the point where hecannot even be certain of a center of viewpoint, it is necessary to recover this center ofviewpoint in order to recover a point from which space can be assigned and, even moreimportantly to the auditor, where the preclear can be exteriorized easily and in a knowingcondition.One of the first “tricks” in auditing is to get the preclear to look from the center of hishead at his environment and the room. He very often sees it clearly and as it is and does, bythis, adjust his vision to see through his ridges. Even an occluded case can sometimes do this,and can then be exteriorized rapidly. The next “trick” is to find some segment of theenvironment which the preclear can see and ask him what is in the areas where he can seenothing or does not wish to see. He will say this or that may be in these areas. The auditor thenhas him create those things or change those things and shift those things which he is afraid maybe in those areas until he is no longer interested, at which time he can envision the actualsurroundings. By continuing this “trick” of rehabilitation of potential occupation of space (for apreclear will not occupy space which he considers dangerous), the preclear may be found toexteriorize suddenly and sometimes with violence. In such a case he believes himself to beoccupying yet another space, hiding perhaps in the darkness of deep MEST space, as well as ina body. Routine orientation and creative processing remedies this.By making the preclear alter the body he is occupying, making mock-ups which hesuperimposes and changes around in disagreement with the MEST universe -- upside downand right side up -- he becomes better able to have a viewpoint from which he can create spaceor from which he can at least handle MEST universe space.The preclear who does not exteriorize readily is not sure he is here at all and, indeed, hemay be co-occupying other areas. A study of the preclear with the E-meter, locating him inother spaces and bringing him into the space where he is being audited, can best be done withcreative processing, not by running facsimiles, for these only make him disperse even further.This preclear often has difficulties with time and has space confused with time. Time is nothandled by moving space; time is handled simply by having and not having. The MESTuniverse insists that anything that disappears must have gone somewhere; thus the preclear issaddled with the belief that he must create space to put things in whenever time changes.Having the preclear conceive time change in the space which he occupies by refusing to let himgo on looking at it in yesterday or to see it in tomorrow, but simply making him know that it isnow in yesterday and the space is the same, does much to rehabilitate his orientation.Drills in which space is assigned are highly beneficial to any preclear, and particularlyso to those preclears who do not exteriorize readily or who cannot easily find themselves whenthey are out of their body. Simply have the preclear disagree with dimensions round him andsee them with purposeful, creative distortion and he will at length focalize his viewpoint so thathe can handle space and know that he is the center. A being can be knowingly in many placesbut being scattered into many places unknowingly is the worst of conditions. Creation and Destruction"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Self-determinism seeks as its goal the attainment of the goal of theta itself.Theta has the capability of locating matter and energy in time and space and of creatingtime and space.Any action requires space and time, for space and time are necessary to motion.Motion can be defined as change of location in space, and any change of locationrequires time.Thus we have an interacting triangle, one corner of which could be labelled space,another corner time, and the third energy. Matter is not included in the triangle because matter isapparently cohesion and adhesion of energy.The cycle of a universe could be said to be the cycle of creation, growth, conservation,decay and destruction. This is the cycle of an entire universe or any part of that universe; it isalso the cycle of life forms.This would compare to the three actions of energy which are Start, Change and Stop,where creation is Start, growth is enforced Change, conservation and decay are inhibitedChange and destruction is Stop.The two extremes of the cycle -- creation and destruction or, in the terms of motion,Start and Stop -- are interdependent and are consecutive.There could be no creation without destruction; as one must eradicate the tenementbefore building the apartment house, so, in the material universe, must destruction and creationbe intermingled. A good action could be said to be one which accomplished the maximalconstruction with minimal destruction; a bad action could be said to be one which accomplishedthe minimal construction with maximal destruction.That which is started and cannot be stopped and that which is stopped without beingpermitted to run a course, are alike actions bordering upon the psychotic. Unreasonablenessitself is defined by persistence in one or the other of these courses of starting something whichcannot be stopped (as in the case of an A-bomb) or of stopping something before it has reacheda beneficial stage.Unlimited creation without any destruction would be insane; unlimited destructionwithout any creation would be similarly insane.In actuality, insanity can be grouped and classified, detected and remedied by a study ofcreation and destruction.An individual will not be responsible for that on which he will not use force. Thedefinition of responsibility is entirely within this boundary. That person will not be responsiblein that sphere where he cannot tolerate force, and if one discovers in an individual where hewill not use force, he will find where that individual will also refuse to be responsible.An assessment of a case can be done by use of the accompanying graph. We see herecreation with an arrow pointing straight downward and find there the word insane, and, underthis, we list the dynamics. Wherever along any of these dynamics the individual cannotconceive himself to be able to create, on that level he will be found aberrated to the degree thathe does not believe himself able to create. This might be thought to introduce an imponderablebut such is not the case, for the individual is most aberrated on the first dynamic and, rightly orwrongly, conceives that he could not create himself. This goes to the extent, in homo sapiens,of believing that one cannot create a body and, rightly or wrongly, one is then most aberratedon the subject of his body."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Potentially, because of the character of theta itself, an individual in an absolute andpossibly unattainable state, should be able to create a universe.

Use of this graph and these principles enable the auditor to assess hitherto hiddencompulsions and obsessions on the part of the preclear. This is an auditing graph. If one looksat it another way than that of an auditor, he finds there laid out what has been occasionallyposed as a philosophy of existence. Friedrich Nietzsche, in his book “Thus SpakeZarathustra,” presents as a desirable code of conduct unlimited willingness to destroy.Philosophically the graph has little or no workability. In order to survive in any universe,conduct must be regulated by a sense of ethics. Ethics are possible on a reasonable level onlywhen the individual is high on the tone-scale. In the absence of such height, ethics aresupplanted by morals, which can be defined as an arbitrary code of conduct not necessarilyrelated to reason. Should one attempt to regulate his conduct on the basis of unlimited creationor destruction, he would find it necessary to act entirely without judgment to put his philosophyinto effect. It is noteworthy that the late Nazi regime can serve as a clinical test of theworkability of a scheme of things wherein unlimited creation and destruction are held as anideal. I heard a rumor lately that Adolf Hitler was dead. Be, Have and DoThe physicist has long been on a carousel with regard to the component parts of thematerial universe.He has had to define time in terms of space and energy, space in terms of time andenergy, and energy in terms of time and space, and matter as a combination of all three. Whenthree factors exist at such an altitude in a science, there can be no further clarification unless thematerial can be related to experience of an equal magnitude.The current definition in Scientology has this liability: if self-determinism is thelocation of matter and energy in time and space, and the creation, change and destruction oftime and space, then there is no comparable data by which to evaluate this level. The physicisthas found the interrelationship of time, space and energy to be invaluable and has, indeed,produced a civilization from this interrelationship. Just as, with our definition of self-determinism, it is possible to de-aberrate an individual and increase his potentialities in a waynever before suspected possible, and with a speed which exceeds all past estimates even in thescience of Scientology.Because we are now working from a higher understanding than time, space and energy,it is possible to compare these to experience in such a way as to broaden their use and modifytheir force or increase it. Control of time, space and energy comes now well within ourcapabilities.Space, time and energy in experience become Be, Have and Do, the component parts ofexperience itself.Space could be said to be BE. One can be in a space without change and without time;one can also be, without action.The essence of time is apparently possession. When possession ceases, the record oftime ceases. Without possession change cannot be observed; in the presence of possessionchange can be observed. Thus it is deduced that time and possession are interdependent.The past could be subdivided into Had, Should Have Had, Did Not Have, and Got,Should Have Gotten, Did Not Get, and Gave, Should Have Given, Did Not Give.The present could be subdivided into Have, Should Have, Do Not Have, and Giving,Should Be Giving, Not Giving, and Receiving, Should Be Receiving, Not Receiving."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"The future is subdivisible into Will Have, Should Have, Will Not Have, and Getting,Will Be Getting, Will Not Be Getting, and Will Receive, Will Not Receive.In each of the above, past, present and future, the word would apply for any individualor any part of the dynamics to all the other dynamics.The way one knows there was a past is by knowing the conditions of the past. Themost revelatory of these is the facsimile which was taken in the past. However, without anyimportant possession in the present stemming forward from the past, the past becomesunimportant; or, because possession ceased, the past is obliterated. The single matter of thebody of a past life not being in the present life invalidates the existence of the past life to theindividual who then does not -- or does not care to -- remember it. Yet the facsimiles can benevertheless effective upon him.Similarly the individual does not conceive to any extent time, past the death of his body,since he will have no body.Energy, whether in the field of thought, emotion or effort, can be summed into DO. Itrequires beingness and havingness in order to achieve doingness. Here we have the static ofspace acting against the kinetic of possession to produce action in the field of thought, emotionor effort, the various categories of doingness.Should one care to test this as a process on a preclear, he will find that the missingportions of the preclear’s past have to do with loss of something. Loss itself is the single mostaberrative factor in living. It has long been known in this science that the release of a griefcharge was an important single improvement in the preclear. Grief is entirely and onlyconcerned with loss or threatened loss. Pain itself can be defined in terms of loss, for pain isthe threat which tells one that loss of mobility or a portion of the body or the environment isimminent. Man has pain so thoroughly identified with loss that in some languages the wordsare synonymous.Loss is always identified with HAVE, for if one doesn’t have, one cannot lose.The Hindu sought to depart into his Nirvana by refusing to have anything to do withhaving. He sought thus to promote himself into Being. He saw that so long as he retained agrasp on a body in any degree he was Having, and thus was pressed into Doing.Having and Being are often identified to the degree that many people attemptexclusively to Be only by Having. The capitalist judges his own beingness solely by the degreeof possession, not even vaguely by the degree of action he is able to execute.Possessions absorb and enforce time; only without possessions would one be able toregulate time at will. This is a singular attribute of the cleared theta clear, and to him possessionof MEST is extremely unimportant.One can make up for a lack of Having by Doing, and by Doing accomplishes Havingand thus regulates time.Having enhances either Being or Doing, as is sometimes severely recognized by onewho would like to take a vacation or a trip to foreign lands.Doing can enhance either Being or Having: a balanced Doing slants in both directions,but if one does without Having, his Being increases, as is well known by anyone who insistson doing favors without recompense, and without gain.There is an optimum speed of Doing. If one travels less than that speed he has littleBeing and Having; if one travels greater than that speed, he has to abandon both Being andHaving. This is applicable especially to the MEST universe. The case of a race driver is in"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"point. He must assume a contempt for Being and Having in order to achieve the speeds hedoes.When change is too rapid both Beingness and Havingness suffer. When change is tooslow both Beingness and Havingness suffer. For Change is essentially the redirection ofenergy.In the assessment of a preclear one can easily trace, by use of the triangle, Be, Haveand Do, and by placing this over a second triangle with space at the point of Be, time at thepoint of Have and energy at the point of Do, where the preclear is overbalanced and why thepreclear cannot handle time or why he is trying to occupy too much space without being able tofill it, or why his life is complicated with too much havingness and has reduced his beingnessto nought.In the MEST universe as well as in a constructed universe, these three factors should bebalanced for orderly progress.Creative ProcessingThe whole of the data covered in this volume is utilized in creative processing. Whenone has mastered the component parts of the mind and the interrelationships of space, energy,items and experience, he will find creative processing surprisingly easy to apply and productiveof very swift results. The goal of this process is the rehabilitation of as much of the thetan’scapability as possible to permit him to utilize or be free of bodies as he chooses and, even inlesser magnitude, to rid the preclear of psycho-somatics, eradicate compulsions, obsessionsand inhibitions, to raise his reaction time and intelligence level. This process does whatever hasbeen previously intended by earlier processes -- utilizing a knowledge of these in order toassess the state of the preclear, and in order to parallel this difficulty with creation, change anddestruction of mock-ups.Gradient scales are vitally necessary in the application of creative processing. The term“gradient scale” can apply to anything, and means a scale of condition graduated from zero toinfinity. Absolutes are considered to be unobtainable. Depending on the direction the scale isgraduated, there could be an infinity of wrongness and an infinity of rightness. Thus thegradient scale of rightness would run from the theoretical but unobtainable zero of rightness, upto the theoretical infinity of rightness. A gradient scale of wrongness would run from a zero ofwrongness to an infinity of wrongness. The word “gradient” is meant to define lessening orincreasing degrees of condition. The difference between one point on a graduated scale andanother point could be as different or as wide as the entire range of the scale itself, or it couldbe so tiny as to need the most minute discernment for its establishment. The gradient scale ofthe creation of a being could be -- but in creative processing generally is not -- concerned withtime. In creative processing, the gradient scale, as it would refer to the creation of a person,could be, first, the envisionment of an area where the person might have been or might be; thenthe envisionment of an area the person commonly frequented; at last, the creation of a footprintthe person had made, and then perhaps some article of apparel or a possession such as ahandkerchief. The creative steps would then continue until more and more of a person wasestablished, and at last the entire person would have been created. Likewise in the destructionof a person, the gradient scale could, but generally would not, begin with blowing him up ormaking him grow old. If the auditor finds the preclear diffident about destroying an illusion ofsome person, the environment can first be diminished slightly; then perhaps the person’sshadow might be shortened, and so on until the entire person could be destroyed. The essenceof gradient scale work is to do as much creation, change or destruction in terms of illusion asthe preclear can accomplish with confidence, and to go from successful step to greater step untilan entire success in destruction, alteration or creation (or their companion states of experience,such as start, change and stop) is accomplished.The mind works easily if led through successive successes into a complete confidence.The mind can be confused and set back enormously by demanding that it do too much too fast."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"The same “too much” can be accomplished by requesting of the mind that it do small portionsof the task; this does not mean that processing should go slowly or that illusions which are easyto create, change or destroy should have much time spent on them. It does mean that as soon asan auditor has established a disability on the part of the preclear in creating illusions of certainplaces, persons, conditions, things, colors or any other thing in this or any other universe, heapproaches the subject gradually by gradient scale and by accomplishing repeated successeswith the preclear of greater and greater magnitude, finally achieving a complete banishment ofthe disability.The reason a preclear cannot alter a postulate, or change or start or stop, lies in theinfluence upon him of his agreements and experiences in the MEST and other universes. To run out these agreements and experiences as such would be, in part, to agree withthem over again. The mind is actually quite free to alter postulates and change its owncondition, if permitted to do so at a speed that it finds comfortable. The mind will not take widedivergences which seem to it to tend toward its own diminishment or destruction. It was by agradient scale of agreement that he came at last to accept and very nearly succumb to the MESTuniverse itself. The build-up of illusion was so slow and insidious that only the closestassessment would reveal to the preclear and the auditor how far these tiny steps of agreementled at last.The motto of the MEST universe could be said to be: “Thou shalt have no force norillusion, nor thine own space, nor self-made energy or thing, for all illusion is mine and withthat thou shalt agree. If thou art, I shall not be.” By a series of minute agreements, the preclearhas at last given up all his own belief in his ability to make a universe, or even to create andmaintain minor illusions. He does not know or even suspect that he is capable of producingillusions sufficiently strong to be observable by others, and if he thought this were true, hewould attribute it to some mysterious thing and, so short and final are the punishments of theMEST universe, he would tend to shy away from this; but upon his ability to create illusiondepends the very existence of all his hopes and dreams and any beauty he will ever see or feel.In truth, all sensation which he believes to come from these masses of illusory energyknown as the MEST universe, are first implanted through agreement upon what he is toperceive and then perceived again by himself, with the step hidden that he has extended hisown sensation to be felt and perceived by himself. He is fully convinced that the MESTuniverse itself has sensation which it can deliver to him, whereas all the MEST universe has isan enforced agreement which though of no substance, yet by a gradient scale came to be anillusion which seems very masterful to a preclear.To prove the reality and solidity of the MEST universe, the preclear could pound his fistupon a desk and demonstrate that his fist bed met something. He is making again the error ofimplanting sensation and not knowing he has implanted it, for the fist which he pounds on thedesk is a MEST universe fist consisting of MEST universe energy, which is itself a MESTuniverse agreement, and it is meeting a desk which is MEST universe; he is only demonstratingthat when the MEST universe is perceived to impact upon the MEST universe, one can thenimplant a realistic impact and perceive it for his own wonderful edification. Reality, then, is adelusion because it is one’s own illusion which has been disowned by one and is then receivedby one as being another thing.Only by shedding all responsibility for one’s own energy can one fall into this coverttrap. If one is unwilling to be responsible for energy, he is capable of using energy and thennot perceiving that he uses it. One who blames others continually can be discovered to effectmost of the things for which he is blaming other people. In such a way, an individual with the“very best MEST universe, Mark 10,000 ears” takes no responsibility for having implanted thesensation of sound in order to receive the sensation of sound. A preclear as he comes up thetone-scale more and more often catches himself doing this, and even though he does not knowthe principles involved (for no preclear has to be educated in Scientology to receive benefitfrom it), he recognizes that even in the case of a loud crash, his continuation of association"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"from his environment permits him to perceive with others that a crash has taken place of objectswhich he with others continuously recreates solidly, and that he must actually cause for hisown perception the sound of the crash. In that the beingness of an individual is actuallyextended for miles in all directions around him, if not much further, any idea or thought or pastthought (as there is no past) is part of his beingness, and so he must continually strive to be“faithful to his agreements with the MEST universe.”To undo this state of affairs it is only necessary to rehabilitate the awareness of thepreclear that he himself is capable of creating illusions. As he rehabilitates this faculty, thepreclear, without any coaching or evaluation on the part of the auditor, begins to recognize thathis viewpoint is expanding and that he is becoming all-pervasive, but that he can collect hisawareness at any point, and that the “brutal reality” all around him is continuouslymanufactured by himself out of agreements and association with other viewpoints.So long as he is fixed in a condition where he is in agreement with all spaces andviewpoints, he sees and feels automatically with all other such viewpoints. He is above thelevel of energy, if one can use the term, on the same wavelength with all other beingness, acondition which does not permit differentiation. As he rehabilitates his abilities in independentcreation, he can change this “wavelength” at will, and can go into or out of agreement with allother points of beingness.The matter of perceiving, then, becomes entirely a matter of self-choice. It is, forinstance, quite startling of a preclear to discover that as soon as he is free of the ridges of thebody (which is to say, when he has discovered he can change his viewpoint) that he is alreadypartly out of agreement with other viewpoints, and that the MEST universe becomes slightlyjumbled. He is apt to be very anxious about this, for it is in conflict with the agreements towhich he is subject. He immediately may struggle very hard to regain a state of affairs wherebyhe can view the MEST universe as everyone else views it.Indeed, the auditor must continually be on guard to prevent the preclear from attemptingto reassume these agreements. A badly-trained auditor can always be identified by the fact thathe shares the preclear’s anxiety that the preclear view the environment as the environment“should be.” The reason why a non-cleared auditor does not do well with these processes isthat he is very anxious for the preclear to continue agreement with all others and to perceive thesurroundings as exactly when exteriorized as he did when he was looking through MEST eyesand perceptions (which is to say, when the preclear was at his exact, agreed-upon point ofviewpoint).The ability to perceive the MEST universe is the ability to agree. The preclear’saccuracy of perception of the MEST universe is of no consequence. An auditor can act topermit or even encourage a preclear to try to see, feel and hear the MEST universe whenexteriorized long before the preclear is prepared to do so with equanimity. The auditor whendoing this, is dramatizing his own urge to agree with viewpoints and perceive. A preclear whoexteriorizes readily may find with a shock that he is not perceiving the MEST universe as hecommonly supposes it should be perceived and quickly go back into his body to reassurehimself that he is “keeping his contract of agreement.”If the auditor demands that the preclear perceive the environment when exteriorized,then the auditor will discover that the preclear will drop in tone and that, when he has gone intohis body once more, a great deal of patient auditing is necessary to regain the preclear’sconfidence in himself. The preclear exteriorizing may find himself in all sorts of space and timecross-ups, for he has insufficient command of space and energy to independently sort outviewpoints when unassisted by the orientation of the MEST body itself, which is, of course, indebased and degraded agreement of a very set nature.There are two “shuns.” These are invalidation and evaluation.The auditor must eschew them vigorously. The major invalidation which could be"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"practiced in using Scientology 8-8008 would be a demand that the preclear see the environmentas it is seen through MEST perception or to criticize him for not being able to do so. Themajority of the preclear’s perceptions may be correct but some percentage of his perception isgoing to be enough “off wavelength” with other agreement viewpoints to cause him to perceivestrangely.After a very large amount of auditing, when the preclear has regained his ability tocreate with considerable solidity his own illusions, it will be found that the preclear can at willperceive the MEST universe and can do so with accuracy. He can further, without the aid of abody, move objects and do a thousand other “interesting tricks” which could very well beviewed with considerable awe, for they have not been seen on earth in recorded history buthave lived in legend.Using Standard Operating Procedure, Issue 3, as given in this volume, the auditor yettakes a very thorough assessment of his preclear with an E-Meter. He discovers, in accordancewith information in this book, what the preclear is unable to start, change, stop; create, alter,destroy; be, do or have; differentiate, associate or identify; on each and every one of the eightdynamics and their component parts. The auditor makes a complete list. This is the Can’t list.Exteriorized, if possible, or interiorized as in the later numbered cases, the preclear is thenmade to “mock-up” illusions about each one of these Can’ts and to change the size, characterand position of the illusion or any part thereof in space, shift it in time simply by knowing ithas been shifted by him, until at last the preclear is able to handle the whole object of the Can’twith complete facility.Can’ts may be an inability to destroy women or snakes or specific persons, or createmachinery, or write legibly. The preclear is requested to accomplish by illusions the smallestgradient of the Can’t with which he can successfully start; and, under auditor direction, bymoving this small portion of the whole here and there in space, tipping it this way and that andmaking it, in particular, disobey “natural laws” in the MEST universe, the preclear is led to anability to create, change or destroy the Can’t.The Can’t is also the Must. Can’t is an inhibition; Must is an enforcement. What mustthe preclear do and what must be done to him? By whom? By creative processing and gradientscales, he achieves mock-ups until each one of these musts becomes a “Can if I want to, butdon’t have to.”There are also the Desires. These are the cravings for sensation or possession oridentification which brought the preclear into and made him continue agreements. Behind everycase the Desires are paramount and of greater importance than the Can’ts. Why does he desirebodies? Why is his second dynamic aberrated? Why does he feel he cannot be free? Can hedifferentiate between his own actual wantingness and the wantingness of MEST itself which istrying to have him? The desires are resolved by creative processing wherein the preclear doesmock-ups of the necessary acts which he desires or the necessary behaviors which brought himinto agreement until he can at last laugh at them.In that creative processing does not take long in terms of time, the assessment list canafford to be very broad and to cover every possible phase through the system of the dynamicsand the cycles of action.This is a list of things the preclear must be able to do with an illusion: Create the condition, energy or object Conserve it Protect it Control it Hide it Change it Age it"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"Make it go backwards on a cycle of action Perceive it with all perceptions Shift it at will in time Rearrange it Duplicate it Turn it upside down or on the side at will Make it disobey MEST laws Be it Not be it Destroy it.In order to accomplish these things, if the whole of any condition cannot be fulfilled bygradient scale some tiny portion of the condition must be fulfilled.When a small condition has been fulfilled, the condition is then enlarged until the wholecondition can be fulfilled.That preclear who cannot get even a shadow of an illusion so that he can perceive it inany manner must be coaxed to see white spots, black spots, of his own creation, and to changethose in space and time, enlarge and contract them, until he has a certain command and controlof black and white. This must be done with such a preclear without regard to the number ofhours it takes or the patience of the drill. It can be done with the eyes open or closed,whichever the preclear finds best.When the preclear is discovered to be trying to prevent a motion or condition, theauditor should magnify that very condition with new mock-ups related to it, i.e., if objects keeprushing in on the preclear, mock up objects rushing in until the action is enormously magnifiedbut under the preclear’s complete control. If the preclear cannot start something, make him stopit. If he cannot reverse a direction, make him change the nature of the object which he is tryingto reverse enough times to permit him to reverse the original disability. If the preclear cannotcreate something, have him create anything even vaguely associated with it, and by associationat last have him mock up the actual thing.The essence of creative processing is moving objects in space when they have beenmocked up. They are moved near and far, to the right, left, behind the preclear, below his feet,above his head and in front of him. He must know that he has changed the location of theobject. If he cannot make a large change, have him do a small change of location. If he cannotdo a small change of location, have him alter the object by turning it different colors, or byenlarging or contracting it, or by pushing it away or bringing it near him, until he can make itmove sideways. In failing to do this, have him do a change with some allied object.The essence of creative processing is a continuation of success. Be careful not to givethe preclear things which make him fail. Do not let his failures mount up. Estimate the preclearand pay attention to what he is doing; find out from him continually the condition of hisillusions, if you yourself as an auditor cannot see them. Putting objects into yesterday ortomorrow or well into the future or into the past is vitally necessary to processing.Control of the illusion is the essence of commands. The preclear must be able to create,grow, conserve, decay and destroy; start, change and stop; be, do and have; differentiate,associate and identify; handle in space, with energy and in time, any object, actual or mythical,in all the eight dynamics, and with high preference given to anything which disobeys “naturallaws” of the MEST universe.That auditor with a high order of imagination who is himself clear, finds mock-ups veryeasy to “think up” and request of the preclear, but it is not necessary to have such animagination, as a routine assessment will discover immediately that the most ordinary thingsfall into the Can’t, Must and Desire brackets in the preclear’s life."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"The preclear will be discovered on the first dynamic, quite ordinarily, not to be able tocreate, change or destroy, especially destroy, his own body or bodies in which he thinks he isencased within his own body (old time-track bodies such as a Fifth Invader Force body). Hewill be found to be incapable in many directions with facsimiles, communication lines and othermatters on the first dynamic alone. On the second dynamic, many incapabilities will come toview, and so on along all the dynamics. On the fifth dynamic, he will quite ordinarily be foundincapable of handling snakes, spiders, vicious fish, bacteria, wild animals and domestic pets.On the seventh dynamic he will be discovered unable to handle other thetans, even in the mostelementary fashion of bringing two dots of light into proximity and then separating them (anexercise which blows head ridges in many preclears quite explosively). On the eighth dynamichis limitations quite ordinarily become too obvious for comment, but on each and everydynamic he must be able to do or fulfil any of the above cycles or conditions.Standard Operating Procedure tells how to exteriorize a thetan. Creative processing,rising-scale postulate changing, postulate processing, are then necessary to bring him toward astate of a cleared theta clear. The state of theta clear simply demands that the preclear remainsoutside his body when the body itself is hurt, and the state is adequate to prevent his beingtrapped again by a body except in unusual circumstances. There is no guarantee of longcontinuance in the condition. The state of cleared theta clear is, however, another thing, for itmeans a person who is able to create his own universe; or, living in the MEST universe, is ableto create illusions perceivable by others at will, to handle MEST universe objects withoutmechanical means and to have and feel no need of bodies or even the MEST universe to keephimself and his friends interested in existence."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"R2-51: RISING SCALE PROCESSINGExerpted from the Book: The Creation of Human AbilityThis is one of the older processes of Scientology. It consists of the individual beingasked to get whatever idea he can about the buttons of the chart of attitudes and then change hisideas upwards. Using this process, the entire endocrine system of the preclear has been alteredfor the better.The auditing commands would be dependent upon the chart of attitudes. The buttons ofthe chart of attitudes are: DEAD - SURVIVE, NOBODY - EVERYONE, DISTRUST - FAITH,LOSE - WIN, RIGHT - WRONG, NEVER - ALWAYS, I KNOW NOT - I KNOW, STOP -START, NO RESPONSIBILITY - FULLY RESPONSIBLE, STOPPED - MOTIONSOURCE, FULL EFFECT - CAUSE, IDENTIFICATION - DIFFERENCE, OWNSNOTHING - OWNS ALL, HALLUCINATION - TRUTH, I AM NOT - I AM, HAD -BEING.The auditing commands involved in this process follow: ‘How close can you come totrusting everybody?

The variations and some of the most potent processes are not included in this TrainingBulletin but will appear in the Student Manual when published in September 1957.NUMBER: Training ONAME: Confronting Preclear.COMMANDS: None.POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other a comfortable distance apart— about fivefeet.PURPOSE: To train student to confront a preclear with auditing only or with nothing.TRAINING STRESS: Have student and coach sit facing each other, neither making anyconversation or effort to be interesting. Have them sit and look at each other and say and donothing for some hours. Student must not speak, fidget, giggle or be embarrassed or anaten.Coach may speak only if student goes anaten (dope off). Student is confronting the body,thetan and bank of the preclear.HlSTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington in March 1957, to train students toconfront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessivecompulsions to be “interesting”.NUMBER: Training 1NAME: Dear Alice.COMMANDS: A phrase (with the “he saids” omitted) is picked out of the book “Alice inWonderland” and read to the coach. It is repeated until the coach is satisfied it arrived where heis.POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart .PURPOSE: To teach the student to send an intention from himself to a preclear in one unit oftime without vias.TRAINING STRESS: The command goes from the book to the student and, as his own, to thecoach. It must not go from book to coach. It must sound natural, not artificial. Diction andelocution have no part in it. Loudness may have.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, April 1956, to teach the communicationformula to new students."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"NUMBER: Training 2NAME: Acknowledgments.COMMANDS: The coach reads lines from “Alice in Wonderland” omitting “he saids” and thestudent thoroughly acknowledges them. The coach repeats any line he feels was not trulyacknowledged.POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE: To teach student that an acknowledgment is a method of controlling preclearcommunication and that an acknowledgment is a full stop.TRAINING STRESS: Teach student to acknowledge exactly what was said so that preclearknows it was heard. Ask student from time to time what was said. Curb over and underacknowledgment. Let student do anything at first to get acknowledgments across, then evenhim out. Teach him that an acknowledgment is a stop, not beginning of a new cycle ofcommunication or an encouragement to the preclear to go on.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to teach new students thatan acknowledgment ends a communication cycle and a period of time, that a new commandbegins a new period of time.NUMBER: Training 3NAME: Duplicative Question.COMMANDS: “Do fish swim?” or “Do birds fly?” Communication bridge between.POSITION: Student and coach seated a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE: To teach a student to duplicate without variation an auditing question, each timenewly, in its own unit of time, not as a blur with other questions; and to teach him how to shiftfrom one question to another with a communication bridge rather than an abrupt change.TRAINING STRESS: One question and student acknowledgment of its answer in one unit oftime which is then finished. To keep student from straying into variations of command. Toinsist on communication bridge when question is changed. Even though the same question isasked, it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone before. To teach students that acommunication bridge consists of getting three agreements—one agreement to end thisquestion, second agreement to continue session in general and maintain ARC, third agreementto begin a new question. Teach student that preclear is part of these agreements. To teachstudent never to vary question or shift question or command without a bridge.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, April 1956, to overcome variations andsudden changes in session.NUMBER: Training 4NAME: Preclear Originations.COMMANDS: The student runs “Do fish swim?” or “Do birds fly?” on coach. Coach answersbut now and then makes startling comments from a prepared list given by instructor. Studentmust handle originations to satisfaction of coach.POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other a comfortable distance apart."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"PURPOSE: To teach a student not to be tongue-tied or startled or thrown off session byoriginations of preclear and to maintain ARC with preclear throughout an origination.TRAINING STRESS: The student is taught to hear origination and do three things: (1)Understand it; (2) Acknowledge it; and (3) Return preclear to session. If the coach feelsabruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he corrects the student intobetter handling.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to teach auditors to stayin session when preclear dives out.NUMBER: Training 5NAME: Hand Mimicry.COMMANDS: All commands are by motions of one or two hands. The auditor makes a simplehand motion, holding his hand or hands in the final position. The coach bobs his head ashaving received it. The coach then, mirror-wise, makes the same motion with his hand orhands. The student then acknowledges. If the motion was not correctly done by coach thestudent acknowledges doubtfully, then repeats the motion to the coach. If the coach does itwell, student thanks coach by shaking own two hands together (prize fighter fashion). Keepmotions simple. Student must always be able to duplicate own motions.POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other at a short distance, coach’s kneesinside student’s.PURPOSE: To educate student that verbal commands are not entirely necessary. To makestudent physically telegraph an intention. To show student necessity of having preclear obeycommands.TRAINING STRESS: Accuracy of student repeating own commands. Teaching student to givepreclear wins. Teaching student that an intention is different from words.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, April 1956, from the principles of bodymimicry developed by LRH in Camden, N.J., in 1954.The following group of processes are usually taught in Upper Indoctrination Course:NUMBER: Training 6NAME: Plain 8-C.COMMANDS: “Look at that wall.” “Walk over to that wall.” “With your right hand, touch thatwall.” “Turn around.” All with acknowledgments. Not Tone 40. (Preclear is acknowledgedwhen he originates, no physical contact.)POSITION: Student and coach both ambulant in a room with no center obstacles. Studentwalks with coach who does process for student.PURPOSE: To give preclear reality on environment, control in following directions andhavingness. Not all effects fully explored.TRAINING STRESS: Precision in repetition of commands by student and experience on agradient scale in directing another body than own. Handling of originations. Acknowledgingexecution of commands by preclear. When this process develops somatics on a preclear it mustbe continued until flat."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Camden, 1953. Originally called “OpeningProcedure of 8-C”, 8-C being a full auditing procedure aimed at negative thought. The onlysurviving part of this is now called 8-C and means the above process. Original intention was toplace preclear within the control of the auditor so auditing could occur. Proved so successfulbecame an end-all in itself. Nominated in Summary Research Project 1956 as responsible all byitself for approximately 50% of results achieved by auditors across the world.NUMBER: Training 7NAME: Hi-School Indoc.COMMANDS: Same as 8-C but with student in physical contact with coach, student enforcingcommands by manual guiding. Coach has only three valid statements to which student mustlisten: these are “Start” to begin process, “Flunk” to call attention to student error, and “That’sit” to end session. No other remark by coach is valid on student. Coach tries in all possibleways, verbal, covert and physical, to stop student from running 8-C on him. If the studentfalters, comm lags, fumbles a command or fails to get an execution on coach, coach says“Flunk” and they start at beginning of command cycle in which error occurred. Coach fallingdown is not allowed.POSITION: Student and coach ambulant. Student handling coach physically.PURPOSE: To train a student never to be stopped by a preclear. To train him to run fine 8-C inany circumstances. To teach him to handle rebellious people.TRAINING STRESS: Stress is on accuracy of student performance and persistence bystudent. Start gradually to toughen up resistance to student. Don’t kill him off at once.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, 1956.NUMBER: Training 8NAME: Tone 40 on an Object.COMMANDS: “Stand up.” “Thank you.” “Sit down on the table.” “Thank you.” These are theonly commands used. (If student has trouble with Training 9, have him do Tone 40 on anObject with 8-C commands.)POSITION: Student standing beside table holding ashtray which he manually makes executethe commands he gives.PURPOSE: To make student clearly achieve Tone 40 command. To clarify intentions asdifferent than words. To start student on road to handling objects and preclears with postulates.To obtain obedience not wholly based on spoken commands.TRAINING STRESS: have student give orders for a while alone. Then begin to nag him to getthem up to Tone 40 commands. Have student silently permeate object with command and anexpectancy that it will do it. When student can “see” his intentions going in accurately, when hewonders why object doesn’t instantly obey, when he is not stumbling through energy ordepending on his voice, the training process is flat. This process usually takes the most time intraining of any process and time on it is well spent. Objects can be ashtrays or rag dolls.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., 1957, for the 17th ACC.NUMBER: Training 9"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"NAME: Tone 40 on a Person.COMMANDS: Same as 8-C. This is not Tone 40 8-C (CCH 12).

Student in manual contact with coach as needed.PURPOSE: To make student able to maintain Tone 40 under any stress of auditing.TRAINING STRESS: The exact amount of physical effort must be used by student plus acompelling unspoken intention. No jerky struggles are allowed since each jerk is 3 stop.Student must learn to smoothly increase effort quickly to amount needed to make coachexecute. Stress is on exact intention, exact strength needed, exact force necessary, exact Tone40. Even a slight smile by student can be a flunk. Too much force can be a flunk. Too littledefinitely is a flunk. Anything not Tone 40 is a flunk.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., for the 17th ACC.The following processes are taught in the Communication-Control-Havingness Course:NUMBER: CCH 0NAME: Rudiments, Goals and Present Time Problem.COMMANDS: Establishing session beginning by calling attention to room, auditor and thesession to begin. Discussing the preclear’s goals for the session. Auditor asks for present timeproblem and settles it with problems of comparable magnitude or incomparable magnitude orby Locational Processing. In general, remarks and commands enough to bring about ARC atsession’s beginning but not enough to run down havingness of the preclear.POSITION: Auditor and preclear seated at a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE: To make known the beginning of a session to a preclear and the auditor so that noerror as to its beginning is made. To put the preclear into a condition to be audited.TRAINING STRESS: To begin sessions, not just let them happen. To educate the student intothe actual elements of a session and condition of preclears. To stress the inability to auditsomething else when present time problem is not flat. To demonstrate what happens whenpreclear doesn’t know session has begun or has no goals for it or what happens when presenttime problem only half flat when other things are engaged upon. Stress that it is done eachsession. Explain closure mechanism of problem with preclear, the solution of “the liability ofsolutions”.HISTORY: Developed by L.

Finding present time. Havingness. Other effects not fully explained.TRAINING STRESS: Absolute auditor precision. No drops from Tone 40. No flubs. Totalpresent-time auditing. Auditor turns preclear counterclockwise then steps always on preclear’sright side. Auditor’s body acts as block to forward motion when preclear turns. Auditor givescommand, gives preclear a moment to obey, then enforces command with physical contact ofexactly correct force to get command executed.

This is audited on anotherand is audited until the other student is in present time. It will be found that the processdiscloses the cycling action of the preclear going deeper and deeper into the past and then moreand more shallowly into the past until he is recalling something again close to present time.This cyclic action should be studied and understood and the reality on the pictures the precleargets should be thoroughly understood by the student. The fact that another has pictures shouldbe totally real to the student under training.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in 1951 in Wichita, Kansas. This was once a veryimportant process.

If the preclear’s “field” is invisibility, have him putglass objects of many sorts and sizes on a table and one after the other “keep them from goingaway”. If mock-up disappears have preclear keep on trying at it because he will eventually beable to get it back.POSITION: Auditor and preclear seated facing each other.PURPOSE: To Remedy the Havingness of the preclear’s bank.TRAINING STRESS: Not to give the preclear any losses. He must successfully complete eachstep and the auditor must do things on a gradient scale until the preclear has successfullycompleted each command given.HISTORY: These and other creative processes were developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Londonin the fall of 1952.NUMBER: CCH 13NAME: Subjective Solids.COMMANDS: “What can you mock up?” “O.K.

To clear up his bank. To disclosehis life computation. To show up the whole track. To give preclear practice in handling time.To get rid of unwanted facsimiles. And in general to handle in its totality the reactive mind.TRAINING STRESS: On leading up with gradients toward any failure that the preclear mayhave in making something a little more solid. In keeping the auditor from chasing all over thebank every time the preclear has a second picture show up or a third or a fourth or a fifth on thesame command. The auditor wants one picture and wants one thing or the picture itself to bemade a little more solid. We do not do two or three pictures and then a room object. Thepreclear can get easily lost on the track unless this is obeyed. Furthermore, it will be noted thatthe preclear goes out of present time further and further and then less and less and then furtherand further and then less and less and this cycle of further into the past and then less into thepast finally winds up with bringing the preclear wholly into present time.HISTORY: Developed from Over and Under Solids, which was developed by L. Ron Hubbardin late 1955 and improved by him in 1956. The process more or less completes the work begunon the reactive mind in 1947. It will be noted that many earlier processes and effects are woveninto Then and Now Solids.NUMBER: Training 12NAME: Think a Thought.COMMANDS: “Think a thought.” “Thank you.”POSITION: Auditor and preclear seated a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE: To give the student some reality on the thinkingness of other people anddemonstrate that the control of thinkingness is possible.TRAINING STRESS: Should be on the fact that after the control of the body has been assertedand control of attention flattened, control of thinkingness can take place. There is really nothingwrong with the preclear except that he cannot control his thinkingness, thus he cannot changeconsiderations at will because he is stopped by the bank. This is the most permissive of suchprocesses since the preclear cannot really help to think a thought and we do not much carewhether he thought it or the bank thought it.HISTORY: Developed in 1955 in Phoenix, Arizona, by L. Ron Hubbard.NUMBER: CCH 15NAME: Rising Scale Processing.COMMANDS: The Chart of Attitudes is employed, the top and bottom buttons of which are:DEAD-SURVIVE, NOBODY-EVERYBODY, DISTRUST-FAITH, LOSE-WIN, WRONG-RIGHT, NEVER-ALWAYS, I KNOW NOT-I KNOW, STOP-CHANGE-START, NO"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"RESPONSIBILITY-FULLY RESPONSIBLE, STOPPED-CAUSES MOTION, FULLEFFECT-CAUSE, IDENTIFICATION-DIFFERENTIATION, OWNS NOTHING-OWNSALL, HALLUCINATION-TRUTH, I AM NOT-I AM, NO-GAME-UNLIMITED GAMES.The auditing commands in this process are “Get the idea of (bottom button).” “Do you havethat idea?” “All right.” “Now change that idea as nearly as you can to (top button).” “O.K.”“How close did you come?” “Thank you.” This is run many times on the one set of buttonsuntil the preclear has a certainty that he can maintain the upper scale idea.POSITION: Auditor and preclear seated a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE: To give the preclear drills in changing his mind and to demonstrate that he canmaintain higher levels of certainty and that he can alter his considerations. And incidentally toprobably change his glandular structure to the better until they have a better performance whichis of no great importance to the process and has little to do with Scientology.TRAINING STRESS: The training stress is on maintaining ARC with the preclear, yet beingdefinite about what idea the preclear is supposed to get. The prerequisites demand that thethinkingness of the preclear be to some degree under the control of the auditor. The auditormust not be impatient with the preclear, but let the preclear try again and again to get these twoideas, one a low-scale idea and change that idea into an upper-scale idea. The preclear must bein fairly good condition with regard to havingness or the process can fail.HISTORY: This process was developed in the fall of 1951 by L. Ron Hubbard in Wichita,Kansas, and is taken from Scientology 8-8008 as published in England and as given in TheCreation of Human Ability, page 129, as R2—51. This is probably the oldest purelyScientology process in existence. It was not entirely workable in the past because it was notunderstood that the body has to be brought under the auditor’s control and that the attention hasto be brought under the auditor’s control before the thinkingness of the preclear can be broughtunder the auditor’s control. The process, however, run on preclears who were not in too badcondition, has been continually successful both in changing their physical beingness andabilities, the latter being in the sphere of interest of Scientology.

When thepreclear experiences a somatic, when he sighs, when he gives a reaction to a Tone 40 process,the auditor repeats the process two or three more times (random number) and then pausing theprocess asks the preclear, “How are you doing now?” or “What is going on?” and finds outwhat happened to the preclear just as though the auditor has not noticed that the preclear had areaction. The auditor does not point out the reaction but merely wants a discussion in general.During this discussion he brings the preclear up to at least a cognition that the preclear has had asomatic or a reaction and then merely continues the process without further bridge. This is donerandomly. It is not always done every time the preclear experiences a reaction."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"POSITION: Whatever position the preclear and auditor are in as directed by the process theyare running. But usually with the auditor touching the preclear. For example, in “Give Me YourHand” the auditor continues to hold the preclear’s hand after he has said “Thank you” and asksthe preclear how he is doing.TRAINING STRESS: Is that the fishing of a cognition is an art and it cannot be taught bygeneral command, that the auditor must not as-is the preclear’s havingness by asking him,“How are you feeling now?”, that the preclear must not be placed in possession of theknowledge that he can stop the auditor from auditing by having a reaction or experiencing areaction to the processing, otherwise he will begin to experience them simply to stop theauditor. Thus the use of Training 13 is not routine and regular but is random. It should bestressed that this can be used while running any and all Tone 40 processes. It should bestressed that the Tone 40 is run as itself and that fishing a cognition is run into the processbetween cycles of command and acknowledgment and command and acknowledgment. After athorough acknowledgment one can fish for a cognition thus pausing momentarily in theprocess, get things straightened out, maintain ARC with the preclear and then go on with theTone 40 process. One does not enter fishing a cognition between the command and theacknowledgment. One never reacts to what the preclear is doing the instant that the precleardoes it, otherwise one educates the preclear to stop one. Training stress here is that a Tone 40process is not run on an automaton basis.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., in 1957 while developingCCH on the following notes from LRH’s notebook: “I use processes to restimulate thought oraction and when this happens I fish out a cognition and either continue the process or bridge tothe next process.” It was developed basically to keep auditors in communication with thepreclear since Tone 40 processes give some auditors, when they are studying them, the ideathat they are supposed to go out of communication with the preclear.

Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Effort ProcessingExerpted from the Book: Advanced Procedure and AxiomsIt should be clear that there are three distinct levels of processing. The first is thought,the second is emotion, the third is effort. Each has its own particular skill.Thought is done by straight-wire, repetitive straight-wire and lock-scanning and isdirected towards concepts of conclusions or evaluations or actual precise moments where thepreclear evaluated or concluded.Emotion is done by straight-wire, lock scanning and lock and engram and secondaryrunning, with the total address to emotion. A moment of sympathy, of determinism, ofdefiance, of agreement is run just as though the incident were an engram -- which is to say, thepreclear is made to re-experience the emotion and, incidentally, a few perceptics over and overfrom beginning to end until the emotion is off the lock.Effort processing is done by running moments of physical stress. These. are run eitheras simple efforts or counter-efforts or as whole precise incidents. Such incidents as thosewhich contain physical pain or heavy stress of motion, such as injuries, accidents or illnesses,are addressed by effort.It should be seen, then, that we have three levels of operation. The most intimate isthought. An individual evaluates or concludes a certain thing. He is thereafter bound by hisconclusion. He has caused an effect of which he is the recipient. If such a thought is recalledover and over until it is thoroughly de-sensitized, emotions and efforts resulting from such apostulate fall away. The individual lets go of the facsimile and it is no longer effective upon himif the postulate tended to use a facsimile to make it effective.Thought communicates its decisions to body and environment by use of the emotion.Thought is intimately in contact with the trigger mechanisms of emotion and might be said torule through emotion. Via emotion thought causes physical action and reaction to take place. Toaccomplish such physical action and reaction, thought uses earlier experiences -- facsimiles --and utilizes their motion, effort and counter-effort to cause activity on the part of the body andenvironment.Thus emotion is a bridge which is used by thought to effect effort. Take away or de-sensitize the emotion and one has again disconnected facsimiles, of any kind, from theorganism, and the organism and its thought are not affected longer by the facsimile.Thought can seem to be smothered in emotion in that it is necessary in most cases tounburden emotion from the case in order to discover many major and vital evaluations andconclusions. By unburdening the case of emotion, evaluations and conclusions long lost toview -- but still effective -- come to light and are de-sensitized. Thought, self-determinedoriginally, may postulate conflictingly from time to time with resultant failures, sympathies andother mis-emotions. Mis-emotion then \"smothers”the motor control panels and hides thepostulates. Thus the running of emotion is done to lay bare past postulates and evaluationswhich are the actual sources of aberration and the suspended pain, which has been called in thepast psychosomatic illness and is called, in Dianetics, chronic somatics, somatic meaningphysical state.A heavy, painful facsimile need not itself be exhausted for it is held in place primarilyby the preclear’s desire (past postulate, not agreeing with present environment) and thispostulate is smothered by emotion. Run the emotion, discover and de-sensitize the postulate,and the facsimile ordinarily drops away and does not further concern the preclear. Further, hedoes not substitute another ache or pain for it because the original reason for the facsimile (pastpostulate) is gone."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"Effort processing is applied to heavy facsimiles. It happens occasionally that the efforton a facsimile is so heavy that it occludes the emotion, which in turn occludes the thought.Thus, enough effort must be recovered to lay bare the emotion so as to get at the postulates andde-sensitize them. A heavy facsimile is thus treated by effort processing in order to free theemotion and thus the postulates. The facsimile is not treated to complete exhaustion but only tothe point where the emotion and thought are reached. It then should fall into disuse, and it doesnot matter that effort is left on it.The last thing which is done to the heavy facsimile is, of course, to pick up thepreclear’s agreement with the auditor to run it and the emotion of determinism involved in therunning itself. Otherwise the facsimile may remain somewhat in force. This is done by lockrunning or lock scanning.A heavy facsimile used to be known as an engram. In view of the fact that it has beenfound to be stored elsewhere than in the cells, the term heavy facsimile has now come into use.A heavy facsimile is an experience, complete with all perceptions, emotions, thoughts andefforts, occupying a precise place in space and a moment in time. It can be an operation, aninjury, a term of heavy physical exertion, or even a death. It is composed of the preclear’s owneffort and the effort of the environment (counter-effort).The emotion of a heavy facsimile is marked by the thoroughness with which thecounter-efforts have overcome the preclear. Thus, total overcoming of the preclear’s own effortby the counter-effort is apathy. Less thoroughly overcome, the preclear’s own effort is in grief.Even less thoroughly overcome, the preclear is in fear. Even less counter-effort and morepreclear effort results in anger. When the preclear’s own effort is greater than the counter-efforts the emotion is antagonism. As the counter-effort is slighter and more diffuse but thepreclear’s effort is not punitive, boredom results as the emotion. When the preclear’s owneffort is punitive and successful against counter-efforts, we have varying degrees of happinessand effectiveness.Thus the tone of any individual or any heavy facsimile is established by the response tothe environmental effort and this response varies from no effort, all counter-effort to all effort,slight counter-effort. This is made up into a tone scale which goes from 0.0 for the lowestcondition to 20 at optimum condition and then dwindling activity to 40 for a top static, thebottom static being death.An individual may be so involved in combating a heavy facsimile which is chronicallywith him that he is chronically ill. Holding on to a chronic facsimile, the preclear has certainpattern responses and aberrations.In a facsimile where he is overwhelmed by motion he islistless and apathetic. In one where the forces balance he is in anger.The auditor, in an occluded case, may find it is helpful to open the case by runningeffort. He looks at his preclear to discover some obvious physical aberration. This is held inplace by a counter-effort. The auditor simply asks, \"If your (head) were being pushed, whichway would it be moving?” Or a leg or some deformed area. The counter-effort is right there,waiting. The preclear answers with a direction. The auditor then asks the preclear to feel hishead moving against the counter-effort. A somatic will turn on. The auditor simply continues toask for the various efforts and counter-efforts. Perceptions quite ordinarily fall out of the effort.A whole incident may come to view. This is the heavy facsimile and also the chronic facsimile.It is also a service facsimile. There is no sending the preclear around on his time track. He isright there in the heavy facsimile.The facsimile thus uncovered is run until its emotion can be recovered. This is thenscanned off until the postulates appear and these are then de-sensitized. The preclear’s ownthoughts and postulates are the aberration source. What is said to him is simply evaluationcausing him, at times, to postulate. The auditor has no concern for what is said, for repeatertechnique or for perceptions save only in that they may slightly aid the recovery of the emotion."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"There are many tricks in effort processing. An auditor can ask for the effort to do or beanything and the preclear can work it out. There is an automatic response mechanism whichgives forth the proper effort for the question, an interesting and reliable phenomenon. Anauditor could take a dictionary and simply begin asking for any and all efforts suggested to himby the dictionary. However, using effort to this extent is neither indicated nor even broadlyuseful.Every effort is in a non-survival direction in that it was once a counter-effort.One can get the effort within the effort within the effort and have his preclear back intothe genetic line at a swift rate. For efforts and counter-efforts are the stuff of which theblueprint of the human body itself is made. These are two cellular lines going back from theshellfish stage, for at this stage two cell lines become a team. The ancestors of this stage,before this point, go back into two separate experience stages. One can take a preclear, allunsuspecting of anything but the \"lived only once theory\", and throw him back with effortswithin efforts into some remarkable experiences. This is a biologist’s dream, for he can look atoriginal forms and trace genetic lines in individuals who may not even know of evolution. Thegenetic facsimiles of the whole evolution chain are on file and have thus been discovered. Thisshould not be too surprising, for the blueprint had to be somewhere and, in efforts, it has beendiscovered and a trail blazed along its track. The problems of the initial photon converters, the\"missing link”between the vertebrate and invertebrate stages, can be located, amongst otheritems of interest. The simple locating of efforts to make efforts throws anyone back down thelong line. In ordinary processing this is vast beyond count, and contains the whole physicalexperience. The body is composed of efforts and counter-efforts. In theory, if they were all runout, the preclear would vanish. Fortunately this is not necessary for processing.The basic efforts are not to be, to be. These resolve into the efforts to start, to stop, tochange, not to start, not to stop and not to change.The basic goals are to remain in a state of rest against counter-effort and to remain in astate of motion against counter-efforts.Newton’s laws would apply and we would have stimulus-response thinking except forthe ability of the mind to interpose self-determined action and motion despite stimuli ordisregarding it.There are efforts to have affinity, efforts to have communication, efforts to haveagreement and reality. There are efforts to see and not to see, to hear and not to hear. There areefforts to do or not to do anything.When the preclear switches from his own valence to another valence, he is actuallytaking the position of a counter-effort against himself. In his own valence he exerts his ownefforts. In a counter-effort valence, he exerts counter-effort against himself. By valence ismeant identity. In a dental operation under general anesthetic, the preclear’s own effortbecomes so nulled that he takes the counter-effort. Then he recalls the incident out of valence(as the dentist or the nurse or, quite irrationally, even the dental tools or the bed) and hurtshimself. (Self-auditing is done ordinarily out of valence and results in the preclear expendingcounter-efforts against himself. Thus he succeeds only in hurting himself.)The no effort state is the state in which counter-effort is overwhelming the individual.Thus the auditor finds the case in apathy at a no effort point. Every heavy facsimile has pointsfor any point on the tone scale and thus the preclear can hang up in a place where he can haveno effort of his own. The auditor solves this by running out the counter-effort until it issufficiently null to rehabilitate the preclear’s own effort. Some testing still remains on thisparticular point of effort processing.A service facsimile is very resistive to effort processing, ordinarily. The auditor mustremember to run the emotion as soon as possible and get the matter into good recall so that the"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"postulates can be run. That should be the end of the service facsimile or at least one of its chain.Effort processing is not an end in itself, but an end toward recovering emotion so that one canrecover thought. Effort processing should be thoroughly understood by an auditor and shouldthen be minimally used.A preclear who cannot re-experience an effort can be educated into the ability bycausing him to make a present time effort and then recalling it. He will shortly discover thatefforts can be re-experienced. Various efforts can then be run.It is sometimes much easier to get a case to run emotion than to run effort. This shouldbe done by all means, for emotion is closer to thought than is effort. Do not use efforts on low-toned preclears.The only thing of value to recover from an engram is the effort; the only reason onerecovers the effort is to recover the postulates the individual himself made during the engramand the only engrams one processes are on the service facsimile chain. It is not necessary toprocess any more of these than necessary to permit the preclear to let go of the chain.If one sees an obvious deficiency in the preclear (glasses, deafness, baldness, thinness,etc.) he can request the effort the preclear must make to be deficient (have poor eyesight,hearing, baldness, etc.)The only aberrative efforts are non-survival efforts.Efforts exist within the efforts within the efforts within the efforts, much on the orderof a picture of a picture within a picture within a picture, etc.By calling for efforts to have efforts, the preclear can be taken all the way back on thetime track to prime thought.A preclear can be trained into feeling efforts by coaxing him to make one in present timeand then to re-experience it.The auditor must know about efforts and counter-efforts. He can do much with them,and much of what he can do is startling and bizarre. Efforts contain perceptics. If you run aneffort long enough, you can recover perceptics from it in most cases.You will find it difficult to run an effort against the postulate to keep the effort.There are countless billions of efforts and counter-efforts in any case.The main thing the auditor can do wrong about effort is to run too much effort, or tothink effort is more important than thought, which it is not.You cannot rehabilitate an organism chemically to any degree. You cannot rehabilitate itwith effort; this is the wrong side of the board.The only efforts are to start, stop and change, not to start, not to stop, not to change.Happiness is applied individual effort. Apathy is no effort, all counter-effort. Otherefforts and counter-efforts range the tone scale in the degree that the individual is handling thecurrent effort in the service facsimile."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"B O A R D T E C H N I C A L B U L L E T I N1 DECEMBER 1971RISSUE IVREVISED & REISSUED 24 JULY 1974 AS BTBRemimeoClass IVCANCELSAuditorsHCO BULLETIN OF 1 DECEMBER 1971& aboveISSUE IVC/SsSAME TITLEHAS Specialist(The only revision isChecksheet P.1, paragraph 2 isquoted from LRH.)EFFORT PROCESSINGRefer book “Advanced Procedures and Axioms” page 15-17.“The bank can be considered to have 3 layers.

Somatics turn on, a whole incident may come to view. The process iscontinued and eventually the emotion concerning the disability will be mentioned by the PC.Eg: I don’t feel shy about wearing glasses now.I don’t feel frustrated about being left handed anymore.I’m not afraid to have people know I’m bald. This is not an End Phenomena and by notchopping the PC at this point (by indicating an F/N) the PC is allowed to then voice theconsideration and his own thoughts concerning the disability.

Whatever else you may do with a Preclear,he must be brought to accept the physical universe and his own and other bodies, all in everykind of condition. The way out is the way through. In Eastern practices, the goal wasabandonment, desertion. Scientology’s main difference from Eastern practices is this: itaccepts to free. And it frees. That which one cannot accept chains one. For instance, revulsionto sex inclines at last to slavery to sex. A ruler’s motto could be ‘make them resist’, and hispeople would become enslaved.In 1870 we find capitalists resisting Marx. In 1933 we find Marx the basic text of U.S.government. Resistance and restraint are the barbed-wire of this concentration camp. Accept thebarbed-wire and there is no camp.On test this process exteriorizes the worst case if run long enough.This process is important because it is one of the few (like R2-16) which does not havealter-isness as its operative factor. This is not, then, an altering practice, confirming somaticsand aberrations, it is a freeing process.That which one cannot accept he cannot as-is.The commands of this process are as follows: ‘Find something about yourself whichyou can accept’, ‘Something else’, ‘Find something else you can accept’, etc., etc., until thereis no comm-lag. Then: ‘Find something about yourself you can reject’, ‘Find something elseabout yourself you can reject’, etc., etc., until there is no comm-lag.

Then: ‘Find something in this universe you can reject’.Remember, this is not an altering process. It is a high value escape process.

I-am-right-and-they-are-wrong is the lowest concept that can be formulated by an unaware case.What is right and what is wrong are not necessarily definable for everyone. These varyaccording to existing moral codes and disciplines and, before Scientology, despite their use inlaw as a test of “sanity”, had no basis in fact but only in opinion.In Dianetics and Scientology a more precise definition arose. And the definition becameas well the true definition of an overt act. An overt act is not just injuring someone orsomething: an overt act is an act of omission or commission which does the least good for theleast number of dynamics or the most harm to the greatest number of dynamics. (See the EightDynamics.)Thus a wrong action is wrong to the degree that it harms the greatest number ofdynamics. And a right action is right to the degree that it benefits the greatest number ofdynamics.Many people think that an action is an overt simply because it is destructive. To them alldestructive actions or omissions are overt acts. This is not true. For an act of commission oromission to be an overt act it must harm the greater number of dynamics. A failure to destroycan be, therefore, an overt act. Assistance to something that would harm a greater number ofdynamics can also be an overt act.An overt act is something that harms broadly. A beneficial act is something that helpsbroadly. It can be a beneficial act to harm something that would be harmful to the greaternumber of dynamics.Harming everything and helping everything alike can be overt acts. Helping certain thingsand harming certain things alike can be beneficial acts.The idea of not harming anything and helping everything are alike rather mad. It isdoubtful if you would think helping enslaves was a beneficial action and equally doubtful ifyou would consider the destruction of a disease an overt act.In the matter of being right or being wrong, a lot of muddy thinking can develop. Thereare no absolute rights or absolute wrongs. And being right does not consist of being unwillingto harm and being wrong does not consist only of not harming.There is an irrationality about “being right” which not only throws out the validity of thelegal test of sanity but also explains why some people do very wrong things and insist they aredoing right.The answer lies in an impulse, inborn in everyone, to try to be right. This is an insistence"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"which rapidly becomes divorced from right action. And it is accompanied by an effort to makeothers wrong, as we see in hypercritical cases. A being who is apparently unconscious is stillbeing right and making others wrong. It is the last criticism.We have seen a “defensive person” explaining away the most flagrant wrongnesses. Thisis “justification” as well. Most explanations of conduct, no matter how far-fetched, seemperfectly right to the person making them since he or she is only asserting self-rightness andother-wrongness.We have long said that that which is not admired tends to persist. If no one admires aperson for being right, then that person’s “brand of being right” will persist, no matter howmad it sounds. Scientists who are aberrated cannot seem to get many theories. They do notbecause they are more interested in insisting on their own odd rightnesses than they are infinding truth. Thus we get strange “scientific truths” from men who should know better,including the late Einstein. Truth is built by those who have the breadth and balance to see alsowhere they’re wrong.You have heard some very absurd arguments out among the crowd. Realize that thespeaker was more interested in asserting his or her own rightness than in being right.A thetan tries to be right and fights being wrong. This is without regard to being rightabout something or to do actual right. It is an insistence which has no concern with a rightnessof conduct.One tries to be right always, right down to the last spark.How then, is one ever wrong?It is this way:One does a wrong action, accidentally or through oversight. The wrongness of the actionor inaction is then in conflict with one’s necessity to be right. So one then may continue andrepeat the wrong action to prove it is right.This is a fundamental of aberration. All wrong actions are the result of an error followedby an insistence on having been right. Instead of righting the error (which would involve beingwrong) one insists the error was a right action and so repeats it.As a being goes down scale it is harder and harder to admit having been wrong. Nay,such an admission could well be disastrous to any remaining ability or sanity.For rightness is the stuff of which survival is made. And as one approaches the last ebbof survival one can only insist on having been right, for to believe for a moment one has beenwrong is to court oblivion.The last defense of any being is “I was right”. That applies to anyone. When that defensecrumbles, the lights go out.So we are faced with the unlovely picture of asserted rightness in the face of flagrantwrongness. And any success in making the being realize their wrongness results in animmediate degradation, unconsciousness, or at best a loss of personality. Pavlov, Freud,psychiatry alike never grasped the delicacy of these facts and so evaluated and punished thecriminal and insane into further criminality and insanity.All justice today contains in it this hidden error—that the last defense is a belief inpersonal rightness regardless of charges and evidence alike, and that the effort to make anotherwrong results only in degradation."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"But all this would be a hopeless impasse leading to highly chaotic social conditions wereit not for one saving fact:All repeated and “incurable” wrongnesses stem from the exercise of a last defence: “tryingto be right”. Therefore the compulsive wrongness can be cured no matter how mad it may seemor how thoroughly its rightness is insisted upon.Getting the offender to admit his or her wrongness is to court further degradation andeven unconsciousness or the destruction of a being. Therefore the purpose of punishment isdefeated and punishment has minimal workability.But by getting the offender off the compulsive repetition of the wrongness, one thencures it.But how?By rehabilitating the ability to be right!This has limitless application—in training, in social skills, in marriage, in law, in life.Example: A wife is always burning dinner. Despite scolding, threats of divorce,anything, the compulsion continues. One can wipe this wrongness out by getting her to explainwhat is right about her cooking. This may well evoke a raging tirade in some extreme cases,but if one flattens the question, that all dies away and she happily ceases to burn dinners.Carried to classic proportions but not entirely necessary to end the compulsion, a moment in thepast will be recovered when she accidentally burned a dinner and could not face up to havingdone a wrong action. To be right she thereafter had to burn dinners.Go into a prison and find one sane prisoner who says he did wrong. You won’t find one. Onlythe broken wrecks will say so out of terror of being hurt. But even they don’t believe they didwrong.A judge on a bench, sentencing criminals, would be given pause to realize that not onemalefactor sentenced really thought he had done wrong and will never believe it in fact, thoughhe may seek to avert wrath by saying so.The do-gooder crashes into this continually and is given his loses by it.But marriage, law and crime do not constitute all the spheres of living where this applies.These facts embrace all of life. The student who can’t learn, the worker who can’t work, theboss who can’t boss are all caught on one side of the right-wrong question. They are beingcompletely one-sided. They are being “last-ditch-right”. And opposing them, those who wouldteach them are fixed on the other side “admit-you are-wrong”. And out of this we get not onlyno-change but actual degradation where it “wins”. But there are no wins in this imbalance, onlyloses for both.Thetans on the way down don’t believe they are wrong because they don’t dare believe it.And so they do not change.Many a preclear in processing is only trying to prove himself right and the auditor wrong,particularly the lower case levels, and so we sometimes get no-change sessions.And those who won’t be audited at all are totally fixed on asserted rightness and are soclose to gone that any question of their past rightness would, they feel, destroy them.I get my share of this when a being, close to extinction, and holding contrary views,grasps for a moment the rightness of Scientology and then in sudden defence asserts his own“rightnesses”, sometimes close to terror."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"It would be a grave error to go on letting an abuser of Scientology abuse. The route is toget him or her to explain how right he or she is without explaining how wrong Scientology is,for to do the last is to let them commit a serious overt. “What is right about your mind” wouldproduce more case change and win more friends than any amount of evaluation or punishmentto make them wrong.You can be right. How? By getting another to explain how he or she is right—until he orshe, being less defensive now, can take a less compulsive point of view. You don’t have toagree with what they think. You only have to acknowledge what they say. And suddenly theycan be right.A lot of things can be done by understanding and using this mechanism. It will take,however, some study of this article before it can be gracefully applied—for all of us are reactiveto some degree on this subject. And those who sought to enslave us did not neglect to install aright-wrong pair of items on the far back track. But these won’t really get in your way.As Scientologists, we are faced by a frightened society who think they would be wrong ifwe were found to be right. We need a weapon to correct this. We have one here.And you can be right, you know. I was probably the first to believe you were,mechanism or no mechanism. The road to rightness is the road to survival. And every person issomewhere on that scale.You can make yourself right, amongst other ways, by making others right enough toafford to change their minds. Then a lot more of us will arrive.  L.

This was occasioned by a speed-up caused by various events. You aregetting about a century of research (or more) in a very few months. So bear with me. The end isnot only in sight. It’s here. My job is mainly now to refine and get the data to you.The order brought into our work by making FIVE LEVELS OF SCIENTOLOGY is payingoff rapidly. Level One is in development. Level Two is well away. Level Four is complete. Andsuddenly Level Three leaped to a final phase.We can CLEAR, CLEAR, CLEAR.This has been a stepchild for months, even years now. It has been mauled, messed up,invalidated and rehabilitated and knocked around. But a BOOK ONE CLEAR was what mostpeople came into Scientology to obtain. And now I’ve done it. I’ve found out why not and how.And this HCO Bulletin is a hurry-skurry outline of the steps so you can do it. There will belots of HCO Bulletins on this. The tapes of August 27, 28 and 29, AD13, give most of its theory.CLEAR DEFINED—Book One definition holds exactly true. A Clear is somebody with no“held down fives” in this lifetime (see Evolution of a Science).CLEAR TEST—Clear sits at Clear read on the TA with a free needle. No natter. No upsets.No whole track keyed in. No SERVICE FACSIMILE.CLEAR STABILITY—We are not concerned with stability. But we can now key out sothoroughly that we need not stress “keyed out clear”. I have found the means, I am sure, to makethis state far more stable and recreate it easily if it slips.So forgive me for being indecisive about clear states for these past many months.The breakthrough is stated as follows: IF YOU CANNOT MAKE A CLEAR IN A 25-HOURPREPCHECK THE PC HAS ONE OR MORE SERVICE FACSIMILES.The barrier to clearing and the reason for fast relapse when clear was attained has been theSERVICE FACSIMILE.SERVICE FACSIMILE defined: Advanced Procedure and Axioms definition accurate.Added to this is: THE SERVICE FACSIMILE IS THAT COMPUTATION GENERATED BYTHE PRECLEAR (NOT THE BANK) TO MAKE SELF RIGHT AND OTHERS WRONG, TODOMINATE OR ESCAPE DOMINATION AND ENHANCE OWN SURVIVAL AND INJURETHAT OF OTHERS.Note that it is generated by the pc, not the bank. Thus the pc restimulates the bank with thecomputation; the bank, unlike going to OT, does not retard the pc in this instance.The Service Facsimile is usually a this lifetime effort only. It might better be called aSERVICE COMPUTATION but we’ll hold to our old terms. The pc is doing it. In usualaberration the bank is doing it (the pc’s engrams, etc). Where you can’t clear the pc by auditingjust bank, you have to get out of the road what the pc is doing to stay aberrated. If you clear only"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"what the bank is doing the clear state rapidly relapses. If you clear what the pc is doing the banktends to stay more quiet and unrestimulated. It is the pc who mostly keys his bank back in.Therefore the pc who won’t go free needle clear is himself unconsciously preventing it. And byknocking out this effort we can then key out the bank and we have a fast clear who pretty wellstays clear (until sent on to OT).The state is desirable to attain as it speeds going to OT.All this came from studies I’ve been doing of the Tone Arm. The Tone Arm must moveduring auditing or the pc gets worse. All those pcs whose Tone Arms don’t easily get into actionand hang up are SERVICE FACSIMILE pcs.Note that the SERVICE FACSIMILE is used to:FIRST: Make self right.Make others wrong.SECOND:To Avoid Domination.To Dominate Others.THIRD: To Increase own survival.To hinder the survival of others.The Service Facsimile is all of it logical gobbledegook. It doesn’t make good sense. That’sbecause the pc adopted it where, in extreme cases, he or she felt endangered by something butcould not Itsa it. Hence it’s illogical. Because it is senseless, really, the computation escapes casualinspection and makes for aberrated behaviour.TO MAKE A CLEARThe steps, in brief, are:1. ESTABLISH SERVICE FAC. This is done by Assessment of Scientology List One of2-12 and using that for a starter and then using the Preliminary Step of R3R as published (HCOBulletin of July I, AD 1 3). One uses only things found by assessment, never by wild guesses orpc’s obvious disabilities. These assessments already exist on many cases and should be used asearlier found.2. AUDIT WITH RIGHT-WRONG. Ask pc with Itsa Line carefully in, FIRSTQUESTION: “In this lifetime, how would (whatever was found) make you right?” Adjustquestion until pc can answer it, if pc can’t. Don’t force it off on pc. If it’s correct it will run well.Don’t keep repeating the question unless pc needs it. Just let pc answer and answer and answer.Let pc come to a cognition or run out of answers or try to answer the next question prematurelyand switch questions to: SECOND QUESTION: “In this lifetime, how would (whatever wasfound) make others wrong?” Treat this the same way. Let the pc come to a cog, or run out ofanswers or accidentally start to answer the first question. Go back to first question. Do the samewith it. Then to second question. Then to first question again, then to second.If your assessment was right pc will be getting better and better TA action. But the TAaction will eventually lessen. On any big cognition, end the process. This may all take from 2hours to 5, I don’t think more. The idea is not to beat the process to death or sink pc into bankGPMs. The pc will have automaticities (answers coming too fast to be said easily) early in the run.These must be gone and pc bright when you end. You are only trying to end the compulsivecharacter of the Service Facsimile so found and get it off automatic and get pc to see it better, notto remove all TA action from the process.3. AUDIT SECOND PROCESS. Using the same method of auditing as in 2. above, usethe THIRD QUESTION: “In this lifetime how would (same one used in Step 2) help you escapedomination?” When this seems cooled off use FOURTH QUESTION: “In this lifetime howwould (same one) help you dominate others?” Use THIRD QUESTION and FOURTHQUESTION again and until pc has it all cooled off or a big cognition."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"4. AUDIT THIRD PROCESS. Using the same method as in 2. above use the FIFTHQUESTION: “In this lifetime, how would (same one) aid your survival?” and then SIXTHQUESTION: “In this lifetime how would (same one) hinder the survival of others?” Use FIVEand SIX as long as is necessary to cool it all off or to produce a big cognition.5. PREPCHECK WITH BIG MID RUDS, using the question, “In this lifetime, on (sameone) has anything been . .. ?” and get in Suppress, Careful of, Failed to Reveal, Invalidate,Suggest, Mistake been made, Protest, Anxious about, Decided.If the pc has a really shattering cognition just halt Prepcheck and end it off.This Prepcheck is done of course off the meter until the pc says no, then checking it on themeter and cleaning it off. Once you’ve gone to meter on a button stay with meter for furtherqueries. But don’t clean cleans and don’t leave slows or speeded rises either. And don’t cut pc’sItsa Line.--------------That should be the end of a Service Facsimile. But a pc may have several, so do it all againthrough all steps as often as is needed.Pcs who have had Scientology List One of R2- 12 should be given these as the first thingsused. Pcs who have had assessments done for R3R chains should have these assessment resultsused (or as much of them as apply) for the next runs. Even if the chain assessment has been runon R3R still use it for R3SC.COMPLETING CLEARINGTo complete clearing then, it is only necessary to give a permissive In This Lifetime 18button Prepcheck making the pc look hard for answers, short of ARC Breaking pc.And you should have a beautiful free needle and TA at the clear read and the pc shining.If clearing did not occur these following faults were present in the auditing:1. Pc did not agree with assessment, it read only because pc did not understand it orprotested it.2. The assessment was wrong.3. The atmosphere of auditing was critical of pc.4. The Itsa Line was not in.5. The auditor let the Itsa Line wander to early track.6. The auditor Q’ed and A’ed and went off process and into engrams on pc’s “sell”.7. The process was not done.8. The assessment was done by physical disability inspection or by choosing pc’s habits,not by actual assessment.9. The auditing did not produce TA action (wrong assessment and/or Itsa Line out wouldbe all that could produce no TA action).10. Pc already sitting in a heavy ARC Break by reason of whole track by-passed charge.11.

Questions were under-run.15. Auditor too choppy on Prepchecking.16. ARC Breaks in these sessions were not cleaned up.17. Pc trying to plunge into early track and stay restimulated.18. Pc trying to get early track GPMs or engrams run to avoid giving up ServiceFacsimile.19. Auditor missed withholds accumulated during clearing.20. Process end product “clear” overestimated by auditor, pc or supervisors.The keynote of clearing a Service Facsimile is INTEREST. If pc isn’t interested in it,the assessment is wrong.The keynote of auditing tone is permissive, happy, easy, not militant. Let pc run on and on.On phrasing question, no matter what is assessed it is always IT MAKES PC RIGHT ANDOTHERS WRONG. Pc is not trying to make it wrong.--------------An ordinary Prepcheck, done with a Service Facsimile present, will turn on mass on the pc.Why? Pc is asserting Service Facsimile.--------------Well that’s the fast rundown on R3SC (Routine Three, Service Facsimile Clear). And that’sclearing. A lot of theory is missing in this HCO Bulletin but not one essential step.

My only doubtabout what I’ve done is that I may have been combining R1C (Itsa Line) with R3SC but anyway itworked so if I’ve got my data straight you may like to pass it on to other auditors. Here it is:Aim: To keep the pc talking (Itsa-ing) about his present time environment, getting as much TAaction as possible, for as long as possible without finding and running a “glum area” that makesthe TA rise.To do this an Auditor should be aware of, and able to use the following definitions:Pc “Itsa-ing”: Pc saying what is, what is there, who is there, where it is, what it looks like, ideasabout, decisions about, solutions to, things in his environment. The pc talking continuously aboutproblems or puzzlements or wondering about things in his environment is not “Itsaing”.Present Time Environment: The whole area covering the pc’s life and livingness over a definiteperiod. It may be the last day, the last week, the last year, depending on the pc.A Glum Area: That area which when the pc is supposedly “Itsa-ing” about it, makes him glumand the TA rise, indicating that a Service Facsimile is doing the confronting on that area and notthe pc.The following diagram and the explanation below illustrate just what is taking place in aSlow Assessment and how the definitions given above apply."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"While the pc is talking about football he can say Itsa game, Itsa played by two teams, Itsaplayed on a field, etc, etc, etc. The same applies to the areas TV, Work, Wife, Club, Garden, Houseand Mountains. All this will give nice TA action and good gains for the pc.Now, when he starts talking about cars he will say, “I often have punctures,” “I wonderwhy my car will only do 100 mph,” etc, etc. While he’s talking like this there will be no TAaction or a rising TA and if the auditor lets the pc continue, he will get steadily worse. So, theauditor must put in an Itsa line—e.g. “What have you done about this?” and the TA will startmoving again and the pc will get brighter as now he is “Itsa-ing”, before he wasn’t.Later, or earlier, the pc will start talking about Taxes, his problems, worries, puzzlements,wonders about Taxes—the TA will rise and the pc will become glum. Then, even though theauditor puts in an Itsa line as with the subject of cars, the TA continues to rise and the pc remainsglum. This is because the pc can’t Itsa this area—he’s “got it all made”—”IGNORE THEM”and this does all his confronting for him. In other words, the Service Fac is a substitute confrontand so the TA rises (Note the old rule about rising needle equals no confront! ). This is a glumarea so the auditor lists “In this lifetime what would be a safe solution regarding Taxes?”,completes the list, nulls it, gets the Service Fac “Ignore them”, runs it on R3SC and soon the pcwill be able to Itsa on the subject of Taxes. This area could be found in the first 5 minutes inwhich case it may be possible to just note it down and get the pc on to areas he can confront andcome back to this one later.The assessment should go on for hours and hours and hours with excellent TA action andthe pc gaining in his ability to Itsa all the time. However it won’t go that way if the auditordoesn’t get the pc to really Itsa what is in his environment, e.g. the auditor shouldn’t be contentto have the pc say he lives “out in the suburbs”, he wants the address, its distance from the city,the type of house, how many rooms, what the street looks like, the names of the houses, occupants,who the neighbours are, etc, etc, etc. Itsa! Itsa! Itsa! Also, it won’t go that way if the auditor tries tolist safe solutions every time the pc starts talking about his problems in an area as in the examplegiven above with the car. Problems are not Itsa.Itsa! Itsa! Itsa! Equals TA action! TA action! TA action! Equals Pc better! Pc better! Pcbetter! Good gains! !I hope you find this all okay and pass it on Ron as it’s sure a doll of an auditing activity.  Very best,  Ian TampionP.S. I found out how most of this goes in auditing by making mistakes first so I learnt the hardway.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH: dw.rdCopyright © 1963by L.

An example ofthis is:“All horses sleep in beds.”Such a computation locked away in the mind will obviously precipitate many compulsivedoingnesses, beingnesses and havingnesses.An example of a doingness precipitated by the above computation would be:“Making beds for horses.”If on assessing for a Service Facsimile you get “Making beds for horses” as the servicefacsimile please note that it is a doingness and not a computation, so if you fit the doingnessinto the bracket of Service Fac Commands, i.e.:How does “Making beds for horses” make you right?How does “Making beds for horses” make others wrong? etc.,then observe very carefully exactly what the preclear says, because he might give the EXACTWORDS OF THE ACTUAL SERVICE FACSIMILE—”ALL HORSES SLEEP IN BEDS”.And observe very carefully and note all meter reaction to what he or she says.Note all of this, remembering that you were NOT running a real Service Facsimile in thefirst place, and that in order to really flatten all the compulsive doingnesses, beingnesses andhavingnesses precipitated by the basic computation you will have to run the exact computationin the Service Fac bracket.If the doingness you run is a basic one then it is possible that the preclear will blow all thecharge on the Service Fac and this you will assess by pc indicators and meter phenomena (i.e.free needle).It is obviously best to get a real Service Fac (computation) and taking beingnesses,doingnesses and havingnesses as Service Facsimiles if done by auditors must be thoroughlyunderstood.Service Facsimile auditing can give great gains, so understand what you are doing withthe technology and have many wins.LRH:lb-r.rdL.

Slow assessment with ITSA (overrun Grade 0)2. Assessment by problems (overrun Grade 1)3. Assessment by parts of existence (overrun Grade 0)This leaves as acceptable methods:1. “In this lifetime, what do you use to make others wrong?”2. “In this lifetime, what do you think your service facsimile is?” (for a Scientologist trained to Level IV)3.“In this lifetime, what would be a safe solution to .....?” (the blank having beenobtained by questions given on the tapes to find either a hidden standard or hiddenproblem).4. Assessment of a prepared list, using level found, in “In this lifetime, what have you......(prehav level)?”The point being not to start out at the beginning by listing a question which OBVIOUSLYWILL NOT RESULT IN FINDING A SERVICE FAC, in which instance the rule of declaringthe grade on a floating needle obtained on the list could not possibly apply.

What is this?Audience: August 27.27 August A.D. 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course.All right. If I can get the text written on it, these two new students will be getting a ScientologyI process known as Acquaintance with Saint Hill. We’re making strides here at an incrediblerate of speed on a lot of things, and I’ve been working hard on getting processes arranged as totheir exact uses and getting exactly what you can do with a case and how to put a PC’s tonearm exactly under the auditor’s control so the auditor doesn’t have to worry about it and soforth.There have been quite a few breakthroughs of great importance here recently. And all this stuffis going down in bulletin form, and I thought this morning—I was sitting there, I was thinkingto myself, well, this morning, here I should be putting it all down in a bulletin; I’ll probably goout there and put it down in a lecture, don’t you see? And then having put it down in a lecture,then I won’t bother to put it down in a bulletin, you see? Then you’ll all forget about it becauseit was just in a lecture, don’t you see? Horrible. So it left me in between, you see. So I didn’tknow whether to give you a lecture on the subject of what I was currently doing, you see, andwhat you needed to know, or throw away the lecture and put it down in a bulletin, and it leftme in a terrible confusion. So I guess the best way to resolve the confusion is just tell you whatI know about it—and also write it down in the bulletin. But you probably won’t see the bulletinfor a long time, so you better get it here.Very complicated. Are you sufficiently confused about it? If I keep on this way, you see, youwon’t in a moment know whether you’re reading a bulletin or listening to a lecture. And this isRussian technology, Russian technology: how to convince somebody that black is white andthat he’s somewhere else when he isn’t.It’s Lubyanka Prison, I think, they practice this sort of thing. A guy is walking down to aninterrogation, a woman dentist will step out from a secret door in the hall and start examininghis teeth. See, totally non sequitur. The guy is trying to understand this, you see? And whilehe’s busy trying to understand this, something else unpredictable happens to him, see? Guy’scome in looking tough with big rubber hoses, and so forth, and offer him a cigarette and talkabout his wife, you know? It’s all th th-th-th-th-th, see? When he gets through, he doesn’tknow what he is or where he is, so he joins the communists.The use to which mental technology is put in this universe, remember, is put that way and isput to the use it is put to in this universe because people don’t know what they’re doing,because there is no mental technology.Now, if you stop and think about it for a moment, the purposes of mental technology mustconsist of survival, with its consequent domination— necessity to—and must, therefore,thereafter, consist of being right and wrong. It may be somewhat mysterious to you how thesethree things fit together in a channel, but they do. This fellow is trying to be right, trying to beright, trying to be right. Why is he trying to be right? He’s trying to be right about the mostaberrated things you ever heard of. He’s always trying to be right.If you as an auditor look at this bloke who is suffering from alcoholism or dope addiction or"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"something like this, there’s one thing that you can always be right about, see? It might be that itwas made available to him while he was in high school and he was being blackmailed into itand he was this and that. And it might be this and it might be that and it might be somethingelse, and it might be because his medulla oblongata has slipped—a lot of might-be’s:, might-be’s, might-be’s—but in actual fact all he’s trying to do is be right. And if you want to be rightabout him, then you should realize that the reason he is drinking or hitting dope or somethinglike that, or doing anything else he’s doing, or cooking bad dinners or anything else—whateverelse this person is doing which is apparently weird or contrasurvival—is in actual fact his effortto be right. And you can always be right about somebody’s aberrations when you recognizethey’re trying to be right. That is the lowest ebb of aberration. Sounds completely weird.Well, that’s because a thetan can’t do anything else but survive, and in order to survive youhave to be right more than you’re wrong, so you get obsessed in being right. This iselementary, my dear Watson. Do you follow that?If you go out here and make a practice of being wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, you’renot going to survive. See, if you’re always going to be wrong: you go out here and you get ona motorcycle, and you turn the petrol on and you turn the spark on full, advance it all the way,and—particularly one of these big boys—and kick the kick starter, and so forth, you sailsomewhat gracefully over between the handlebars because the machine kicks back. Well, if youconsistently do this, why, you’re apt to be nonsurvival in the extreme. You follow this?So, actually, right and wrong are the tools of survival ant nonsurvival. In order to survive, youhave to be right. In order to get somebody else to succumb, they; have to be wrong. Youfollow this?You see, actually, no great military commander ever wins a battle on anything else but thewrongnesses of the enemy. And he compounds these wrongnesses up to a total attack whichreally makes them wrong. So even they realize they are wrong, and of course at that momentthey no longer survive. And the point you degenerate into succumb from survive is the pointwhere you recognize you are wrong. That is the beginning of succumb—the recognition thatyou are wrong.Naturally then, if that is true—and that is true; that’s not sensible, it’s true—naturally thisfollows, then, that if a person is surviving at all, if they are “thetaning” at all, no matter insideof what mass, there must be some residual rightness, even if it’s only an insistence uponrightness. So rightness goes hand in glove, immediately, with survival.So this works itself back and forth into an aberrated A=A=A. If the individual is surviving, hemust be right. It can even go to—if an individual is undertaking an action, it must be a rightaction, if he is surviving. Do you see how A=A=A this becomes. In fact, it becomes completeidiocy from the lucidity of its begining because in actual fact there was nothing for a thetan toworry about survival in the first place.See, he has to enter this lie into the scene before he gets off into this other series of lies. Hestarts worrying about his own survival. Now, we can well ask, “How does he start worryingabout his own survival?” Well, he worries about the survival of something else and thenidentifies himself with it. You see? He says, “This thing has got to survive, and I am it, sotherefore. . .” and here comes his nest lie—and he needn’t make this fantastic lie at all, but theymanage it—and that is “I am now worried about my survival.” And actually, it isn’t until hetakes that step that he goes halfway round the bend. See, he’s practically finished now.There is no reason at all, just because you have built a bunch of sand castles and are protectingthese sand castles from destruction by the tide or naughty boys—there’s no reason at all thatyou can’t go on protecting these sand castles ad infinitum and safeguarding their survival. Youdon’t have to take the idiot step of becoming a sand castle. See? It isn’t until the individualtakes that idiot step of becoming a sand castle that he himself becomes worried about his ownsurvival."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"But at the moment he becomes worried about his own survival, he then enters into the necessityto dominate in order to continue to survive. Best way to protect your sand castles, of course, isto dominate anybody who would threaten to destroy your sand castles. That’s elementary, isn’tit? You have to be tougher than the other tough boys on the beach, in other words. You have todominate their behavior to the degree of restraining them from destroying the sand castles. Thismakes domination a necessity, if you’ve already entered the game of survival. See, you don’teven have to have become a sand castle to start dominating.Now, what happens now? What happens now? The game of domination consists of being rightand making the other fellow wrong. And that is all the game consists of. There isn’t any other .. . I mean, out of this vast universe, you finally shake out this one little, tiny, idiotic simplicity,you know, and it all makes everything look silly, you know, when you come to think about it.Russia and the United States—the great game; Well, that’s silly! The game is silly. Russia hasto dominate the United States in order to survive; therefore, capitalism has to be wrong;therefore, communism has to be right. The United States has to dominate Russia in order tosurvive, so communism has to be wrong and capitalism (capitalism?) has to be right. What’swrong with this? Well, what’s wrong with this is there isn’t any capitalism to amount toanything. Ha! And there’s practically no communism. That’s getting idiotic about that stage ofthe game, you see? Anybody can see that one.But let’s go back to why does Russia have to dominate the United States and why does theUnited States have to dominate Russia. Well, that’s because Russia is liable to destroyeverything in the United States, and the United States is liable to destroy everything in Russia.Now, let’s look at this a little more closely.Why are they liable to destroy everything in the United States and Russia? Why is this liable tohappen? I don’t think you have any more answer than anybody else does. Exactly why? Well,that’s because Russia is threatening to destroy everything in the United States, and the UnitedStates is threatening to destroy everything in Russia. And that’s why the United States have tobe very careful not to be destroyed by Russia, and Russia has to be very careful not to bedestroyed by the United States. You see, this is very elementary.You work this thing out. You don’t need these Russian idiocies pronounced at great length toexplain the international situation, to see, actually, what is taking place. Yes, but Russia isdevoting so much of her production capacity to weapons and rocketry and other things in orderto dominate the United States, that communism is failing. And the United States is devoting somuch of its production capacity—it actually amounts now to three quarters of the totalproduction capacity of the United States and three quarters of the total engineers, scientists andtechnicians of the United States we involved in this effort—that it is destroying capitalism.Because, you see, it “has to” in order to keep the effort going, in order not to be destroyed.Well, this is a typical game.You start examining this game on the basis of survive, dominate and right and wrong, andwhere’s the right and wrong come in—you start to examine it, or examine any game on thebasis of just these things: survival, domination and rightness and wrongness. Examine thegame and immediately the rightness and wrongness that you see residual in it appears to bepretty mixed up.Well, the United States would-be very wrong to destroy its economic stability and prosperity inorder to destroy communistic economic dominance or prosperity, see? And reversely,communism would be very wrong to destroy any benefit residual in any communistic system,if there is any, in order to knock out the capitalistic lines, you see? She’d be wrong to do that,but she is doing it and she is doing it on the supposition that she is right. And the United Statesis doing all this on the supposition that it is right. So you’ll see that A=A enters into thesituation where rightness becomes wrongness. And people will defend the most fantasticwrongnesses on the basis that they are being right."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"As you audit people, if you specialize in this particular line as you audit them you willsometimes be appalled by the justification of the person’s own actions. You’re utterly appalled.Gauze is armor plate compared to the argument that they will put up, don’t you see? I mean,they put up this thin facade. “Well, you see, the reason I left my wife . . . reason I left my wifeis because she seldom, uh . . . very, very seldom, uh . . . was ever home, you see, to put outmy bedroom slippers. And therefore, I had to leave her.”“Well, why wasn’t she home?”“Well, she was working and supporting me.”And you say, “End of scene. Rmrmrm.” And yet he will go right on leaving, you see, andstaying “left,” and perpetuate this action and defend it down to his last breath.I can see it now, the hammer and sickle flying over the White House, you know, and all of thearguments and press releases that are coming out from the White House saying, “Down withRussia,” you see? “Down with Russia. We are absolutely right to continue to supportcapitalism.”Then you’ll say finally, “Well, what is capitalism?”“Well, capitalism is all the workers are told exactly where to work, and exactly how muchthey’re going to get, and all the property belongs to the government, and a capitalist gives you aclenched-fist salute. That’s what . . . And we are being right. This is a right action. And it’sright, what we are doing.”Well, maybe the actions were sensible. If you look down along the line, you see, you’ll seesome sensible actions have taken place, and this is what throws you. Because you can seesome sensible actions going forward through all this, and you may understand some of this,but what you don’t understand is how right this is, or why they don’t recognize that theconsequences of it are just wrongness, and that they are actually being very wrong while theyare saying they are being very right.You go over to Russia and say, “How come you got income tax these days, bud? How comeyour workers all get different rates of pay, and status symbols which seem to be entering inhere, and what’s all this about some unions being organized, and well, what’s all this going onhere? This doesn’t look like communism to me.”“Oh, yes, yes, yeah Oh, this—this is communism. This is communism. You see, a goodcommunist—a good communist loans money at interest. That’s the definition of a goodcommunist. And we’re perfectly right in everything we are doing. And that is really correctcommunism.”And you look at this and it just becomes complete idiocy to you. You don’t see whether you arecoming or going, you see? What is all this about?Well, you see this sort of thing taking place on the international front. It’s very, very easy torecognize at that level of action. Very easy to recognize. But it’s not quite so easy to recognizewhen you see this skid-row bum. He’s just all soiled from having spent the night in the gutter,you see? And you smell the canned heat on his breath, you know? And there he is, you see?He’s about ready to hit the chutes. Now somebody tells you, “Why is he doing it?”“He is doing it because it is a right action “You say, “Oh, no!”“Yes,” you say, “he’s being right. He is asserting the rightness of being a skid-row bum andcanned heat and all the rest of that. And he’s asserting that as a rightness. And that i5 why he is"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"doing it.”Well, you see, you’ve undercut the simplicity and you’ve left a large zone of unreality, becausethe society itself has worked out all kinds of rightnesses and, wrongnesses on its own bat as towhy he’s a canned-heat eater, see? They worked out this fantastic . . . “Well,” they say, “afterall, he probably had few opportunities in his youth.” The guys who want more appropriationfor the university say he never had a chance to get a university education, you see? The milkproducers who want to sell more milk said, “Didn’t have enough milk and there wasn’t enoughstrontium 90 in it.”Everybody has got explanations for this, so you come down to the final, last-ditch explanation,which is the right one, and nobody recognizes the rightness of the explanation. He is assertingthe rightness of eating canned heat. Why? Because everybody has always tried to make himwrong. His automatic response is to be right, so he has no choice but to eat canned heat. Getthe idea?Now, if he at any given instant says, “I am wrong to eat canned heat,” he’ll collapse. He’sfinished. He may go into a coma. He may even die. I mean, it’s on that elementary basis. It’s afantastically elementary situation.What is it all about? Well, behavior doesn’t necessarily have everything to do with the wholetrack, you understand? Behavior is behavior, and then people have tried to aberrate it one wayor the other and have tried to twist it around one way or the other and mess it up and makepeople do some other way, but the science of life still remains the science of life.The factors of life still remain the factors of life. And if you were to delete all of the GPMs andincidents and everything else, you would not have removed the basic laws on whichScientology is built. That’s interesting, isn’t it? Come to think about it, you get so involved inerasing things. These simply enforce and exaggerate and destroy freedom of choice. Theydestroy freedom of choice over the exercise of the ability to be happy or powerful or normal oractive, or something of the sort. They destroy power. They destroy freedom of choice. Theydestroy the ability to be self-determined or to be pan-determined about things. They make aperson one-sided about everything under the sun, you see?And they simply use basic and residual law—unwittingly, by the way—to exaggerate certainthings which then lead a person to enslave himself. And the basic mechanism of enslavement issurvival—the insistence upon surviving, followed by the necessity to dominate, followed by,then, the necessity to be right or wrongThe necessity to be right or wrong then becomes as irrational as the original postulate tosurvive. And these postulates go downhill, and you will find in them the most incrediblesituations you will find. You will blink—I told you about this, you look for it. And one ofthese days you are really going to blink at what somebody is doing in order to be right. Theyjust become totally concentrated on the last way they can be right. This is how they can beright! And everybody’s working all around them, on top of them, pounding them, publicizingthem, kicking their head in on the subject, and the more that people kick, why, there it is.Then the person will go more degraded. You’ll see sometimes a person who is only nominallydegraded—they’re a politician or something like that, see? And you’ll see this person godownhill and become a covert criminal and slip a little bit further and a little bit further. Andyou’ll see him out lecturing for the Salvation Army, protesting against the very thing whichthey recently held to be right. This individual has sort of died a death now. He is talking aboutgoing to heaven. He’s talking about being dead. That is mainly what he’s talking about.You very often go into—you go into a church of one of these older faiths, and you’ll find theminister up there haranguing and screaming, you know, about “the evils of the demon rum,” orsomething like that, to the congregation. “Stay ye away from that pub, bud,” you know?Yelling, you know? And he goes back to his study, you see, and he takes this little nip of"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"medicine to fortify himself, you see, after the exertions of his lecture.Now, these birds who are working this hard were working inevitably and invariably in the fieldand area of death, because they are right down to the point where you get an aberrated rightnessand wrongness; cessation of survival is so threatened that it becomes imminent. It actually getsdramatized before it happens.And you’ll see somebody turning against religion because of the amount of hypocrisy in it.You know, the guy is saying, “Well....” Well, the Roman Catholic church probably lost itsgrip on the world which it’s trying to reassert now by killing off the Buddhist. I beg yourpardon, the better interpretation is that it’s only those in charge in Vietnam who are members ofthe Catholic church. That actually isn’t everybody. There are some Presbyterians there, too, inthe American troops, and so forth.I have opened up a chapter here which is leaving you blinking just a little bit.I’m sure somebody is going to make the assumption sooner or later, though, that if the onlygovernment in the world being maintained in force actively by U.S. arms is a Catholicgovernment, that that government’s turning against another religion has something to do withsomething here that we haven’t quite put the finger on. And we add to the fact that that samegovernment is attacking the only other organization on the face of earth who doesn’t believe indeath forever, we begin to ask interesting questions. You probably hadn’t linked the attacks onthe Buddhist up with U.S. arms supporting the government of Vietnam, nor the attacks of theFDA against the FCDC in Washington, D.C.Yeah, everybody else is all right. Criminals, they’re fine, and so forth. Everybody’s all right.But it’s just these two organizations on the face of earth plus one other, the Theosophist, whotalk about reincarnation and who talk about coming back to life again and who talk about theseother things. And it’s an oddity that just in the last two or three years all three of theseorganizations have been furiously attacked by the U.S. government. Sort of an interestingpuzzle, isn’t it? Well don’t worry about it. We’ll get there before they do. This is just aninterjected thing.Now, they’re evidently asserting a rightness about death. I know it’s mean of me, it’s cabalist,it’s rabble-rousing for me to infer that the majesty of government is actually being used tofurther some foul, religious end in some way and to cause everybody to be dead. But I’m veryinterested in the fact that the Church of England, of all organizations, right down here in theform of a vicar (who, I think, has had to move since). This bird—I’m looking at a face or twohere who were present in this—was being very censorious about our giving death lessons toyoung children. Story went around the world. What do you think this guy does every time hestands up there in the pulpit? It gives one to wonder, you know? He’s talking about going toheaven and 811 this sort of thing. He’s giving death lessons to little kids.Diana came home from school one day crying. She was going to a local school up here. Shewanted to know if all this stuff about poor Christ was true. And I gave her the hot dope, and . .. Well, as a matter of fact, I did. I was very reasonable about the whole thing. I said, “Nativepopulaces have their religious beliefs, and wherever you are, you must remain tolerant of thecurrent beliefs,” and so forth, and she took this in.But it’s interesting that this bird down here is asserting how wrong it is, don’t you see, to givechildren death lessons while he himself is giving them death lessons. Only our death lessonsare straight dope—this is what happens with regard to death—but his are a darn lie. Somehowor another, this makes him right. How does this make him right? Well, you can just go roundin circles trying to figure out what’s the rightness and wrongness of this, you see? Why shoulda powerful state attack a truthful philosophy, you see? Why, you know, why some of thecalmest and most decent people in Asia—the Buddhists—why are these people being attackedand shot down and their pagodas burned and that sort of thing? Why? What . . . ? And you cango round and round and you can get real confused and you’ll get real upset."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Well, there’s always one stable datum. There’s always one stable datum: Somehow, whateverthey’re doing—no matter how mad the action may appear —is undertaken by them to be right.Now, you would actually have to get them on a meter or get them to explain and put in a long,long itsa line on this subject and get off the automaticities until they finally told you therationale. And the reason it isn’t a rationale is because A=A=A along the whole line. You justwould not be able to believe how or why this guy had to, you know, [eat] canned heat.You ask him a question, “Now, how does it make you right to eat canned heat?” You say,well, he sure can’t answer that, you know, because—ha-ha! It’s ruining him. Everybody hasbeen down on him. The “I Will Arise” and everybody else is jumping him about this, and he’sbeen talked to by all the ministers and everybody. He’s read about how the evils that it’ll doand so forth. So, heh-heh, he can’t defend this one so, of course, one would never normallyask that question. So “How does it make you right to eat canned heat?” See? Well, brother,only an auditor would be able to adventure this far, because you’re going to get a screamingautomaticity.Well, it makes him right—”Eat canned heat? Well, that’s . . .” Makes him right because rah-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da and ta-da-da-da-da-da, and that makes him right. And ta-da-da-da da,and that makes him right. And “ . . . eat canned heat, and therefore, this makes that right andit’s—that right and that right, and so forth, and so on and so on and so on and so on and . .” Imean, you finally get through, this thing has practically wound itself around the dial.And you say “All right, now. Now, how does it make someone else wrong?” “Oh, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! So-so and so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so, and so-and-so and so-and-so and my father, and so forth and so on.And I parked my bicycle on the church steps there one day, and that old minister came outand—and he actually had the police take away my bicycle, and so forth, and he always waslecturing on the lectures of drink, you see? The evils of drink and so forth and so on—ha-ha!There you are. That should—wait a minute. That isn’t sensible.”And do you know, whether he has understood it very well or not, he will, now have a veryhard time eating canned heat. See, here’s sanitariums, the Keeler Institute; Keeley, I think it is.One has lie detectors and the other has alcoholism. I always got them missed . . . He’s beenthere. He’s been treated. He’s been biochemically injected, you know? He’s beenpsychoanalyzed. He’s been everything you could think of, see? They’ve given him stuff thatwhen he eats canned heat it makes him sick. He just goes right on eating canned heat. Therewasn’t any stopping it because of this block—this block he had. And that intention is thestrongest intention in the universe. There is no stronger intention than that at a mental level.Above that, of course, you have the effort to dominate, and above that level you have the effortto survive. These things are very strong, but I’m talking about a mental activity: a mentalactivity, a thinking activity, an intentional activity—strongest intention. Survival—that justhappens, you see? Domination—that just happens. Those are not intended things. You getdown along the line of intended, and it’s right and wrong. And that’s where that lives.This becomes very remarkable. We’ve got this teenage girl, and she’s running around andhaving an awful time. And she’s been arrested and lectured to and shown motion pictures andbeen horrified and hit over the head and defamed and threatened with kicking out of her homethat if she doesn’t behave on the second dynamic, you see. And she goes right on misbehavingand that sort of thing and so on and so on and so on. Now, this is an actual case history.I had one in my office one day. Changed her whole life—almost accidental. One of the researchcases that furnishes data that leads to data of this particular kind. She was just trying to makeher parents wrong. She realized it. That was the change of her behavior pattern, right there. Wedidn’t even touch in that particular case on her trying to be right. She was just trying to makeher parents wrong. Well, obviously? how could you make them wrong? Well, you could makethem wrong by trying to make them change their mind on what they insisted upon the most.And the diagnosis of how do you make a person wrong is, what does that person most insist"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"upon? Therefore, if that person most insists upon this particular factor, then that is the one youmust make them wrong on.So the criminal tries to make the forces of law and order wrong, you see? The diagnosis takenfrom the viewpoint of the being involved is simply, what are these persons insisting is wrong?What do these people insist is wrong? And then make them wrong on it. It’s a perfect Q and A,see? What they say is wrong: make them wrong. You can’t get a closer identification than that,you see? Mother is saying, “Be a good girl, daughter. Be a good girl, daughter. Be a good girl,daughter. Be a good girl, daughter.” Daughter, getting more and more antagonistic against theold lady—she knows now exactly how to handle Mama. You make Mama wrong. How do youmake Mama wrong? All you got to be is not a good daughter. Elementary, my dear Watson,see?It isn’t what aberration the individual is dramatizing. It’s what aberration does the individualdredge up in order to make somebody wrong. That’s behavior. See, it isn’t the accidental thingthat you think it is.So we’ve got a schoolteacher. And he says, “Children, you mustn’t chew gum. Children, youmustn’t chew gum Children, you mustn’t chew Sm.” Well, the characters that like him the leastare going to chew gum. Don’t you see? That’s how to make him wrong. You can’t destroy himovertly with 16 inch guns, but you can cave him in trying to make him wrong covertly. Andhe’ll sit around ant worry about those children chewing gum. It does. It serves to cave him in,too, a little bit, you know—a little bit, a little bit, a little bit. He may even go away sometimeant stop teaching school and leave the children alone, you see? This is fantastic.So a government which is trying to conduct decent law and order has worked against it,continuously, this factor: that bringing about decent law and order is wrong. Now, agovernment with that force pushed against it continuously, endlessly, on and on and on, willeventually come to the realization of exactly what keeping law and order is: It’s being ascriminal as possible. See, it’s been made wrong to a point where it now identifies the right labelwith the wrong action It knows how to be wrong: to be a decent government.See, on this broader perimeter you watch this thing as it works its way out. If you can see that,it gives you a rather vast understanding of aberration. Now, whether or not you can reach thisaberration is not the subject. This is simply, can you understand it? Not whether or not you canreach it and do something about it with an E-Meter; because this particular rationale, although itis very true, happens to have been booby-trapped by some very evil-intentioned characters onthe whole track, who implanted goals which contain—and items and implants and GPMs—which contain in them right and wrong.And you start running an individual very long on rightness or wrongness, he is liable to collidewith one of these implants and it goes into restimulation, and the cure is therefore barred. Andyou’re unable to cure him of this particular thing, because you can’t audit him on the processnecessary to resolve that particular facet of aberration. This is a barrier, in other swords, that’sbeen installed. It is totally accidental that right and wrong are there, and be is not acting the wayhe is acting because he has that GPM.Now get that through your head, see? He’s not. That just intensifies this action, but it doesn’tbring about that action. That action would, in any event, exist whether or not there had everbeen an implanter or not. But unfortunately there have been some of these implants, so youcan’t ordinarily say with complete security—oh, yes, you can without any security, and oftenget away with it—ask this little girl, “Now, how does being sexually promiscuous make youright, and who does it make wrong, and how does it make them wrong?” see, and get thosetwo things worked out, and all of a sudden she’s completely reformed. She isn’t doing this atall. Oddly enough, she’s no longer able—this isn’t necessarily making her well—she’s just nolonger able to get the power into it that she had in it; she’s no longer this interested in it; she’sno longer this fixated on it. Because in any itsa line you will tend to trigger out enough todeintensify the force ant power and concentration of the aberration."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"It’s very interesting that aberration is very hard to maintain. Let’s say this fellow is—he’s anaccident prone. He takes an automobile out and runs it into a brick wall; and he takes anautomobile out and he runs it off the edge of an embankment; and he takes an automobile outand he runs into another automobile; and he takes an automobile out and he leaves it parked onthe train track, and so forth. And you let him come anywhere near this automobile well, all ofus have accidents to some degree, but he is carrying it to excess.And sooner or later somebody is going to notice the number of accidents this character has.And if you as an auditor noticed this and you were just doing this job just for this thing inview—is just knock out the number of accidents this character was having with anautomobile—you could first find out what he is having. In other words, he might be havingwrecks or he might be having accidents, don’t you see? You have to find out, what is hehaving? That is necessary, because you sometimes are very sure you know what the fellow ishaving, but that isn’t what he is having, see? He might be having physical injury, see, notaccidents at all. He might merely be having physical injury. So you have to isolate that factor,and that would be the stage of analysis.This doesn’t take very long, by the way. This is nothing very laborious. This is more or lessoff the cuff. Sometimes it’s enough to listen to him on the subject of these things, and he labelsit several times for you, so you just use it, you see? That’s the ordinary off-the-cuffassessment. Nevertheless, you have to dignify it with an assessment. It’s also the clarificationof the auditing command. You say, “All right. Now, how would an automobile accident makeyou right?” or “How has it made you right?” or any such thing as this. And you expect he’sgoing to have to sit there and fumble with this for quite a while. Oh, no, brother! That is—ifyou’ve spotted it, that is sitting right on top. That’s the easiest itsa line you ever had anything todo with—Brrrrrmrrrmrrr, and rrrrr—rrrr. And also rrrr-rrr-rrr-m -mrr.All right. Now, you’ve got to keep this thing balanced because you might run into a GPM, sodon’t leave him on one side of it, see? You see, the GPM would say just right and wrong.You’ve personalized it, so it’s “How would it make you right?” and “How would it make them(or another) wrong?” do you understand? Them wrong, you right. That is the way you biasthis thing. You understand, the GPM is totally—it doesn’t care. There’s just a right and awrong, so that you could also play this thing the other way to, as far as the GPM is concernedbut not as far as the aberration is concerned. Life is what has thrown this thing awry.All right. So, we say to this fellow, then, when he runs down and starts to catch his breath onthe subject, and the automaticities are out of the way—you have to sort of sit back and wait forthe automaticities to roll on this kind of a process—you say to the individual, “How would itmake another or others wrong?” or “Who would it make wrong and how?” I don’t care howyou put it, you see? But it’s “who wrong” out that way, you see, and “you right.” That’s theway the question has to be designed. And if the question is completely designed in this fashion,you will get another rolling avalanche that will finally wind up with some earlier life—that is,this-life, usually—key-in, cognition, of some kind or another. He’ll find the first person he’strying to leave- make wrong on it. Very often this happens.You don’t have to direct it very much. He’ll do most of his direction on it. Then you turnaround and you ask him again, “Well, how would it make you right and how would it makeyou wrong.” Well, it tends to make a repetitive. type process out of it. ‘I’m not actually giving you a repetitive process. For instance, I’m looking at a student herethat’ll be going over to a Central Organization soon. There’s two or three bad boys around thatorganization that have been raising hell with themselves and everybody else. It’d take, in actualfact, a good itsa line and two questions to resolve the whole ruddy mess. “How doesborrowing money make you right?” And a half an hour later, “How does borrowing moneymake others wrong?” Now, it might not even be real to him, and he might have an awful timedoing it, but that’s the end of that behavior.Now, this is processing actually below the level of recognition or cognition. You can dig this"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"one awful deep with a pickax. You can also do some weird things to a case in changing itsbehavior! going along this line. But too much of a good thing is too much of a good thing, andit’s a hunt-and-punch process. In actual fact, contained in this is the answer to neurosis.Neurosis could be defined as an antisocial action or an anti survival action which iscompulsively undertaken by the individual. We just wrapped up the work of Sigmund Freud.It’s as elementary as that. You understand we didn’t —if you don’t intend to make the personhappy, and don’t intend to make the person cheerful, don’t intend anything except just to fit theperson better into the social framework, and if that’s all that mental therapy is for, why, yougot it wrapped up. I think it’s faster than implanting.Now, in the first place, the only condition for this sort of thing is we have to be more capableof communicating, perhaps. We have to be able to communicate to the person in that we wouldhave to listen to the person. We’d have to listen to the person. We’d have to ask the person aquestion. But we’d also have to get out hands on the person in order to do that. The cowboy inthe black hat has to get his hands on the person to implant him too. And they also have to dosome communication, too don’t they? And then they create a hell of an ARC break, don’t they?I think they get twice as much aberrated behavior afterwards. I don’t think it’s a solution. Idon’t think the development of mental technology for the purpose of aberrating people down toa level of powerlessness where they won’t bother us—I don’t think that’s a successfulapproach.Well, let’s just be practical. This has nothing to do with decency or overt-motivators oranything else. Let’s just be cold-bloodedly practical, as cold-bloodedly practical as thesecharacters fancy themselves to be. I don’t think that it’s valuable I don’t think it’s valuabletechnology. It’s valuable to know about it, of course, from your point of view. But as far asknowing how to implant people and calling that a mental technology, or knowing how to givesomebody a transorbital leucotomy and calling that mental healing, knowing how to shootsomebody with some weird powder or something of the sort that makes them bounce about inthe middle of the floor for an hour or two, it looks to me like all of those lines of action areunsuccessful. I don’t think they’re successful. They always have a hole in them, and the holein them is that survival can futurely be threatened.Suppose anybody ever undid it: I wish I had a nickel for every implant station that’s ever beendestroyed. I’ve known thetans to make a career out of it. In fact, I’ve knows thetans to tilt aplanet ten or fifteen degrees, with the equivalent avalanches and glacial epochs and so forth, orpull the air cover of a civilization just because it went on implanting. In fact, there’s a lot ofthings happen because of this. Why? Because somebody was implanting. I don’t think it’s asensible solution at all. In fact, I don’t think it’s a solution. I just think it’s a dramatization ofrightness and wrongness. I don’t think there’s any more intention about it than that.Look at the amount of time and effort and energy expended. Why, in any given day theappropriation of the U.S. armed forces is probably less than the Marcabian appropriation forthe maintenance of implant stations. I think it’s expensive I just think they do it because theyare trying to be right. I don’t see any other reason for it at all. They’re trying to be right andmake others wrong. That’s all.Now, you can add political significance just as you can on Rusk’s pronunciamentos: “NATOmust be in accord with the Franco-Berlin Wall unity because the ruddy rods are all on the leftside of the rifles,” you see? “And therefore, all us Turks must pull together with all usHungarians because the great entente of northern Rhodesia must be maintained,” you see? Well, it’s not quite as insane as that, but in actual fact if you take it apart and examine it verycarefully, the aggregate sum total of it is insane. It is not sensible. What’s the end product of it?The end product of it is no solution and a worsening condition.Now, whenever you see this rightness-and-wrongness situation where somebody is actingsimply to be right and making others wrong simply to make others wrong—you know, there’sno more action to it than that, no more reason to it than that—whenever you see that, you’ll see"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"a worsening condition. Wherever that zone and area is, you’ll see things worsening.The young girl trying to make her mother wrong with sexual misbehavior: that young girl isgetting worse herself and is making her family worse, don’t you see? In other words, it isn’tthat a status quo is being maintained. You’re getting a dwindling spiral out of this sort of athing, see? It’s the last dregs of domination, this whole action, you see? No matter how covertit is, it’s still an effort to dominate. It’s like the guy lying on the ground with four knives inhim, he’s still being right and the enemy is still wrong. It’s still his final effort, you see, todominate the enemy And many of these methods of dominating the enemy exist. And it’s justan aberrated war which is in progress.Now, we look over this implant situation as an implantation proposition, and we cannot reallyassign to it any improvement of circumstances. If any improvement of circumstances existed, itexisted for such a short term as to render it relatively useless. A short term on the whole trackmight even go to a hundred thousand years. That’s a short term. That’s no duration for anempire. They might say, “Well, we’ve got it all licked here. We’ve got it all solved,” but theyhaven’t. They’ve just got a lid on, and you’ll notice the situation deteriorates. The situation getsworse, gets worse, gets worse.So that any activity that enters in upon this type of a rightness-wrongness solution—”We aredoing what we are doing simply to be right and simply to make somebody else wrong”—anytime any solution is entered which has that sole rationale, you can then expect a continuousworsening, not only of the person who is engaging in enforcing that solution, but also thepeople in that person’s vicinity. So the whole thing becomes a dwindling spiral. This thing isgoing to develop a leak sooner or later. It’s going to blow out at the edges, don’t you see? Anysuch situation is going to go blingo! someplace or another, because it isn’t a solution, it’s adramatization.Now, you may not suspect it, but you are looking at the final ranks not only of neurosis butpsychosis. That is the madman. That is the madman. He sees spiders on the wall. Medicaltreatment consists of telling him there are no spiders on the wall. This looks to me like onemadman handling another madman, both with the same solution. The madman is saying, “I ambeing right and you are being wrong,” and the person “handling his case” is saying “I am beingright and you are being wrong.” Because of this basic agreement, you find many of thesemedicos winding up themselves in the padded cells.First place, they don’t understand what they are doing. They don’t understand that theirsolution is just as crazy as the patient’s assertions.Guy is having trouble thinking: cut his brain up. Can’t think. Well, ding, ding, ding, herecomes the wagon, man! This is nonsense, don’t you see? I mean, there isn’t anything to begained in this. I don’t see anything happening on the subject of medical mental healing butmore insane people. The insane population of the world is going up, up, up, up, and themedical doctors say they’ve got to have more people to take care of these insane and there havegot to be more buildings to take care of them. Statistics are increasing. Statistics are going up.There are more and more people going insane. And therefore, we got to have more doctors tomake more people insane.You begin to look at this after a while—you say, what the devil is wrong with a legislator whowon’t look over how fast the statistics are rising on insanity, therefore, the money we havebeen appropriating it for is being wasted? Obviously, there is no proper solution to this, weobviously have the wrong people on the job. But they never do this because they’re engagedthemselves in a rightness-wrongness type of piece of nonsense, and most of government ishow to be wrong convincingly. So the end product of the thing is no solution, don’t you see?You want to know why they did this to you, or why you ever did something to somebody else.Well, in the final analysis, the overt-motivator sequence hinges, basically, simply upon thisaberration concerning survival - the effort to dominate—which falls into a contest of “I’m right"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"and you’re wrong.”Now both sides are saying “I’m right and you’re wrong,” and therefore, you get a double-clashing sort of a proposition. You have A saying “I’m right and you’re wrong”; you have Bsaying “I’m right and you’re wrong.” You get a natural commingling of their ideas. After awhile they don’t know what the hell they’re talking about. They don’t know what’s right. Theydon’t even know what they started out to say was right, you see?Now, a mental technology, so-called, which engages itself upon the worsening of people, ormaking people wrong and making themselves right as an exclusive activity, is not in essence avery broad or a very intelligent technology. This is hardly worthy of the name “technology,”yet it does have technology, don’t you see? It certainly is not a mental science which embracesvery much understanding. There’s very little understanding involved in this thing. Somethinglike the psychologist or Pavlov: if you put a young man on the table and make a dog bark, theyoung man slavers. (I’m being sarcastic.) Well, I don’t know. I’m tempted to say on thesubject, you see, “Well, I don’t know. I look around and I’m not having any trouble withslavering dogs. I mean, why are we working on this problem?” It’s as idiotic a statement, yousee, as their own conclusions.Stimulus-response mechanisms and so forth. Why be interested in a stimulus-responsemechanism? And, that tells us right there that somebody must be interested in being right andmaking the other fellow wrong. Don’t you see? The stimulus-response mechanism—that’s asfar as they ever advanced. Stimulus-response mechanism. Well, stimulus-response be damned.The consequences of the stimulus-response is what the Scientologist is interested in. And thatgoes at once into the overt- motivator sequence.You move right on upstairs from stimulus-response, you see, into a proper piece oftechnology. They seem to have avoided that whole piece of technology. Why? Because they’reonly interested in being right and making somebody else wrong, don’t you see?Now, a mental science cannot be worthy of the name “mental science” if it keeps dramatizingan unknown one of its parts. See? That outlaws anything which continues to dramatize one ofits parts, you see. It outlaws it from the proper name of a complete understanding. You said ascience; a science would be a complete understanding of something. Well, if something isdramatizing one of its parts, it certainly does not have a complete understanding of life.Now, the sciences of life are difficult just to this degree: You are living. See, you have a day-by-day interrelationship with the laws of life. And to rise superior to this, in any waywhatsoever, is so phenomenal as not to have happened ever before. It’s one of these tricks. It’sby your own bootstraps, don’t you see? And for a while, if you know all the aberrative angles,you find yourself batting about in the bottle like a bluefly; see? Every direction you fly, you runinto something else. If you started analyzing your own behavior in a single day according to thebasics that you know, and if you had all of them available in Scientology, you see—if youanalyzed your behavior throughout any twenty-four-hour period, you’d find out, a short periodof that time, somewhere along the line, you were dramatizing something. In fact, you wouldn’thave to do very much analysis.In fact, right now, all these people out in front of me are dramatizing breathing. Automaticity:they think to stay alive they have to breathe. You tell some doll that someplace and his Jawwould drop, you know? You say, “Well, you can’t live on X-nu because there’s no air.”There’d be a lot of beings that would look at you awfully blankly.“What you want sir for? What’s the air supposed to do?”“Well, you know, air, you know, air—you got to have air, you got to have oxygen.”“What are you going to do on X-nu that you need oxygen for?” They’d try to figure it out howyou’re going to put it in bottles or sell it or you . . . Maybe you got a new fuel for rocket ships"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"has to do with oxygen. Couldn’t make . . . They’d finally understand what you were talkingabout. They’d finally understand that you were peculiar. You get the idea?So a total cessation of the dramatization of the game called life, you see, renders one, at firstglance, in a very confused situation, since he’s trying not to dramatize its various parts, yousee, and yet he inevitably must dramatize certain of its parts. And then he finally comes to theconclusion, “In order not to dramatize life, you climb away to a large cave on the side of a verybare mountain and hope people will put crusts of bread outside, while you sit and meditate anddon’t have anything whatsoever to do with life.”Now, by not having anything to do with life you have now rendered yourself free ofdramatizing life. And oddly enough, there’s enough workability to that. You get away from allrestimulative factors and your restimulation dies down, you see? Get less restimulated, you feelquite calm. So you say, “Well, this is the way to do it. You don’t be any part of life.”No. The real challenge of a science of life is to know it and be able to live - be able to live thatlife, you see? That’s the real challenge, and oddly enough, if you know all the answers you canalways do that. It isn’t necessary— because you know a half a dozen lies, you see, that youthink are answers, it isn’t necessary to go crawling off to some cave all by your lonesome, yousee? You can stand out in the middle of life and live life, don’t you see?The final challenge of a science of life is does it produce life? Not does it produce death?When you analyze this thing all the way on down, it’ll leave you kind of buggy at first. You getall sorts of weird ideas. “Well, maybe I ought to stop auditing. Maybe I ought to leaveauditing. And maybe I ought to get back to my knitting or whatever else I was doing,” don’tyou see? “And I ought to . . .” something or other.And then you suddenly realize that what you’re trying to do is drop part of what you weredoing, you see, in order to get away from what you were dramatizing in order not to dramatize.You can get into an awful confused state, man. You can sit around for days trying to sortsomething out along those lines. Well, that’s all right.It’s enough to realize, however, that you are in a situation where it can be sorted out. Andthat’s a remarkable situation to be in. Very remarkable situation to be in.Myself, I’ve had to groove off the importance’s of existence—what are the important things?—because time, making a problem, you see, has made it necessary to concentrate on certainimportance’s of existence and wrap these various things up. Well, that’s a very proper solutionto the thing, but it certainly isn’t inactive. It’s flat out, man, flat out—activity going along at avery high rate. I notice that there’s more and more of a tendency—more and more of a tendencyas one goes along the line—to recognize more and experience more life. He doesn’t have towork so hard to experience life. That’s one of the things.Person who can’t experience very much has to work very hard to experience something, andget all involved trying to experience existence. Existence is all around them. Walk down thestreet and they’re experiencing existence. But to convince themselves that they are surviving,they think they have to stand under a truck. And that is another way of going about it. Theyhave to suffer impacts. They have to be in there living. What is living to them? Well, living, tothem, you find to some degree is being right. They have to be convinced that they are beingright or convinced that they are surviving or convinced they are dominating some thing, yousee?And you take some king of olden times: Why, there he sat upon his huge throne, and so forth,and all of his courtiers are saying bog-bog ant bow-bow and walking backwards three quartersof the entrance hall, don’t you see, and bumping into the guards and messing it up. All ofwhich w simply designed to convince this fellow and convince others that he is dominating,you see?"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Well, I’d say he couldn’t have had much of an impression on people if he had to work at it thathard. That’s simply the mechanisms of domination. You find anybody who has to work at itthat hard, see, he’s practically dead, man. He’d be gasping most of the time.You find some teenager, for instance, out here going to dances and listening to music anddiving and experiencing all sorts of weird new thrills and sensations and so forth; they’re tryingto convince themselves they’re alive, don’t you see? They’re half-dead about nine tenths of thetime. They’re having a hard time of it.But a science of life should bring about living.Now, there is a level at which rightness and wrongness ceases to be analytical orcomprehensible. And when we speak of aberration, it’s when it drops below that point. It isn’tthat trying to be right is wrong: It’s obsessively being right about something that’s obviouslywrong that goes loopy. See, that’s when that mechanism goes astray, and the level of neurosisis only reached when the individual is no longer able to select his own courses of behavior,when he is obsessively following courses of behavior in order to be right.Now, everybody has a few of these. You can all try them on for size. This fellow eats salads.He hates salads, but he eats salads, and you just get on this. “Is there anything you’re doingthat you really don’t like to do?”And this fellow says, “Oh, I just don’t like to eat salads.”You say, “Well, how does eating salads make you right, and bow does it make somebody elsewrong?”Now, you’re going to get into an interesting situation where you’re going to find out he hasbeen already overwhelmed on the subject of salads. This thing is going to cross back the otherway. It’s a question of how was Mother right in making everybody wrong on the subject ofsalads, don’t you see? And that is not a good processing question. That’s somebody else’saberration, so we’re not particularly interested in that.So we just bring him up to that point and this thing will snap. You’ve got a lot of these things,but by and large they have no value. They have no value.It isn’t until a person reaches inability, weakness, stupidity and other suchlike things as a wayto be right, that the dwindling spiral is entered.Now, he’s being right by being unable. When you see that one loom over the horizon in anyzone of behavior, you have approaching neuroses if it’s not there already. And when acivilization goes all out for this, watch it, because it’s going to be dead tomorrow. The dust isgoing to be moaning through its temples and the tumbleweed rolling down its freeways,because that civilization has already entered in upon the necessity to be unable in order to beright. The way to make somebody else wrong, then, is to be nuts—incapable.Now, a dramatization, any dramatization (entering in upon this whole field of mental science),which brings about a further disability is wrong for that civilization, no matter how right thatcivilization thinks it is. And anything which enters a civilization into more life, more livingness,more ARC and so forth is, of course, by basic definition, right for that civilization.So, you see, it’s also capable—this also renders itself susceptible to understanding what oneshould do, as well as knocking out neuroses. Now, anything that is mad in an individual, atsome higher level, was okay. All madness is simply an exaggeration of some ability orcapability; it’s some perversion or exaggeration of this.Let us take in the lower rungs of it—well, let’s take sexual misbehavior of some kind oranother. This, of course, is a lower-harmonic enforcement of the ability to create, see, way"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"upscale. By the time you get this thing all mixed up and clouded up, and this way and that way,you get it down here, you got some sexual disability of some kind or another, and that is howthe person is still being right about this upper thing, you see? So these things really enter alongthis line. Way up here it was right—really right—you see? And then it came down a little bit,and it was a method of survival, and then it was a method of dominating, and then it was amethod of being right in order to make others wrong. And then in that contest one got enoughoverts—the communication line did a switcheroo don’t you see so what was right about it isnow wrong about it, but what is wrong about it is now right about it. And we’ve got this thingall the way down to the bottom of the scale. It’s very recognizable where it came from, but it’sgone through all of this switcheroo, and down at the line it’s practically unrecognizable from itsimmediate state as far as a person’s behavior is concerned.This fellow is an artist. He could paint. Let us say he could paint a side of a house, you see,you know, with a beautiful scene, you know. Prrrrrroooom— nothing to it, you know. Andyou find this fellow down there nursing a girl’s shoe, you see, to his chest, you know? And hehides this all the time. It’s a girl’s shoe, and he sniffs it occasionally, you know, and it giveshim kicks, you see? I mean, it’s more or less the same channel, but there the upper-scale abilityhas become the lower-scale mockery.And you get these lower-scale mockeries all the time get the upper-scale abilities in trouble.And once in a while you go around feeling ashamed of yourself for having suddenly thoughtyou could do something about the United States or something like that because some nut in thebooby hatch is talking all the time about doing something for the United States, don’t you see?Well, the difference is you probably could and he couldn’t There’s a slight difference of ability.Now, when you look over this whole panorama of behavior and what a person is trying to do,you enter in upon an ability to understand much of the nonsense which at the present momentyou may only be protesting against. You just look around on it. But this task is rendered verydifficult by the fact that the explanations so obscure the kernel of insanity of the rightness-wrongness that it’s very hard to get at what they are really doing.I don’t know what the United States is doing today; maybe it’s having a revolution. But it’sbeing right about something. It’s being right about something, and it’s making people wrongabout something. We’re not sure what it is, but on a careful analysis or on an auditing level, wecould discover those two points. The moment we discovered them, they’d all go unsnarl.So a science of life actually is a science of examination of behavior, and behavior is based uponlots of ramifications, tremendous explanations in all directions, but narrowed right on down tothe middle, looked at in its bare bones, it comes down to survival, dominate, rightness andwrongness. That becomes the main line of behavior. I hope sometime when you’re looking atsomebody who is sitting there picking bugs off himself, one after the other, cockroach here anda cootie there, let us hope you don’t jump back to keep them from getting on you. And let’shope also you don’t try to convince him that there are no bugs there, because you are nowplaying the one game which makes him make you wrong, and at that moment, you will cutyour communication line just like that.So now he has only one purpose in view, and that is to make you wrong and make himselfright. And you can cave him in, you can deteriorate him, you can put him further down scale,but you can’t bring him back up the line again. It’s impossible. Because you’ve taken the onestep to cut the communication line which could have made it all right. Do you see that?So a dramatization of rightness and wrongness is not the answer to a dramatization of rightnessand wrongness, and probably out of all the factors of a science of life, that one you would haveto know. Otherwise, you would simply get trapped into the dwindling spiral of everything youtried to do anything about anyplace. It is the essential piece of understanding which isnecessary to keep you free of going the chute. Okay? Thank you."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"R3SCA lecture given on3 September 1963What is the well-known date?Audience: September 3rd, A . D. 13.3 September A.D. 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. And we have a lecture on R3SC.Notice, Moms no hands. No papers, no notes. Cold, like that!All right. Now, once upon a time we had something called a rock slammer. You remember thehistory of a rock slammer? All right.You did a Scientology List One, which is not the L1 in that bulletin, but the old ScientologyList One. And what did you find in this? You found that occasionally as you went down theline you picked up a tick, and when you put in the big mid ruds on that particular tick, you allof a sudden got yourself a nice, handsome rock slam. So you say “auditing” to somebody andyou got a rock slam, right?You remember this technology? Well, this meant that something was going to go wrong in thevicinity of auditing with regard to this person, by reason of aberration.Now, of course, punitively, punitively, we said at once all rock slammers were bad, and theyall ought to be shot, and so forth, until we found out that practically everybody rock-slammed.And then, of course, we had to come off of it. But that isn’t all that we came off of. We justdropped that piece of know-how in the mire and let it lie. You notice suddenly we weren’tsaying anything about that at all.Well, that didn’t mean that I forgot it, completely. That didn’t mean that it was utterly gone asfar as I was concerned. But I had seen some phenomena which I definitely had to straightenout. And that phenomena had to do with the reason a person doesn’t recover under auditing.Now, that’s the whole department head; that heads up that whole department: the reason theperson doesn’t recover under auditing.Now, this has been with us, actually, since 1949, 1948. It must have been present then. Ididn’t run into it head-on until about 1950, and it became very crucial in 1950. One of thereasons this would peak up is that in the type of auditing which I was doing in 1950 there wasa great deal of slippiness. A lot of it was very slippy. And there was a lot of this and that wouldwork its way through, and you didn’t have a hard, tightly bound process, you see? And assoon as you got a tightly bound process that was limited to running of engrams, you ran intothis phenomenon of people not getting well. So again we have run into engrams and again weall of a sudden come up with this interesting datum—but not for the same reason—of peoplewho just don’t recover.Now, in my catalog of things to be done, this business of rock slammers and reasons whypeople didn’t get well continued to ride right along there and take a prominent position inlooking over all new things.And all of a sudden I collided with the old service facsimile. But the collide was rather oblique.And the way we collided with that was by a study of the tone arm, the necessity to get tone armmotion and the various positions of the tone arm.Now, all of that material which you’ve had in a recent lecture very germane to this. It becameobvious that if an individual were audited for three sessions without tone arm action, he got"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"into pretty terrible condition. Bad. Bad show. Bad show. Therefore, you had to audit with tonearm action.I don’t say be fell to pieces, but he just wasn’t feeling well—he didn’t feel so good. You’d findhis session goals became gloomier and gloomier. In other words, you could predict any timethat a case was going to feel not so good by noting that he had no tone arm action during thesession you had just run. And this I tested out. And I tested this out. I watched it, coordinatedit and so forth —no vast series of cases but that wasn’t necessary. I had a considerablebackground on all this material.Now, there we are: person gets no TA action during a session, person doesn’t feel so good.Three sessions—they feel pretty wog. No TA action. So we mustn’t run without TA action. Soit became very, very important to find out what was stopping TA action. And there are severalreasons why TA actions stop. The basic reasons are still those; all the reasons I have giventhere are very valid reasons. But they fall away from the very high theoretical to the very easilyapplied practical aspect of it. And the practical aspect of it indicated just this: that an individualwould release charge or an individual wouldn’t release charge. And that’s about all it camedown to.Now, that you are getting—now get these slight divisions here: that you are getting tone armaction does not guarantee that your PC will feel better. Now, that is one for you there. Doesn’tguarantee your PC is going to feel better. But getting no TA action guarantees that your PC isgoing to feel worse. Do you see that, see? So you haven’t got quite a yes or no.Now, why the individual who gets TA action doesn’t necessarily feel better is contained inrestimulation and overrestimulation. The individual is overrestimulated: the restimulation i8 toohigh and yet the charge is still releasing. Now, that’s quite interesting there. You’ve got maybefifteen sources of charge that can be released, and they’re all in restimulation. And you’re onlyrunning one of them, so you’re releasing charge off of that one.Let your PC’s attention wander off of what you are running and you instantly have added morerestimulation to the case. All you have to do is be a clumsy auditor at Level IV auditing on theitsa line and you’ve had it.Now, let’s grade up auditors here—let’s grade up auditors. just in passing. I: Well, we justleave it on accident whether the guy gets TA action or not. We hope he gets TA action, see—Class I. We just hope he does. And it’s not going to endanger anybody very much because thefundamental questions that they’re being asked are very unfundamental. They’re being askedhow they cured their lumbosis or something of the sort. All right, so they don’t get TA action.So the guy gets a percentage of wins and he gets a percentage of loses, and we just hope thepercentage of wins that the auditor gets at that level are greater than the percentage of loses, andthat he doesn’t get discouraged about it all, and so forth. We just hope, you understand?Because frankly, at that level of training, we can’t do anything else. See, it’s—look at theamount of technical material which goes into this and you see at once that it’s too formidable.This guy would go on—he’d have to go on for months or years of training before he wouldcome up to being able to cope with that situation.Well, it’s a very small price to pay. Because the funny part of it is, now with the itsa line, wecan take that chance very nicely and come out with, a great deal of percentage of wins. But yourecognize that the auditor at that level is taking that chance that he’s going to run some sessionswithout TA action. He’s going to listen to a lot of natter and he’s going to listen to this and he’sgoing to listen to that. And he’s going to get a certain number of service facsimile-type casesthat don’t get TA action, you see; he’s not going to get any TA action. And this isn’t seriouslygoing to put somebody in the hospital or anything like that, because the process isn’t thatstrong, don’t you see? But it’s going to be the guy just doesn’t really think auditing is gettinghim anyplace— that sort of thing, you know? And he just feels gloomier than he wouldordinarily feel, and so on."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Well, what’s happening with all this? Well, we can’t expect at the level of training of Class Ifor the auditor to be able to remedy it. And of course the second that you, instructing auditorsand so forth, come back to remedy this situation, you are no longer operating in the zone orarea of Class I and you are actually trying to make a Class II auditor. So you see, that still stayswith the definition.You start saying to this guy—the moment you start saying to this guy, “Hey, for God’s sakes!Read those rules, man, read those rules in that R1C. Read ‘em! You’re asking this person forproblems, problems, problems—what problems have they had in life? And what have theybeen trying to solve in life? That’s a backwards question, a backwards question, man! Ofcourse that TA is going to stick.” You know? Well, you’re working on Class II, see, straightaway. See? So, you see, the condition still remains as it is in Class I, which is a relativelyuninstructed auditor.All right. Now, we move up into Class II: we get “with tone arm action.” And the way wehandle it there is actually not with the change and shift of processes, beyond just altering thequestion a bit. But we get listening with tone arm action, and that means that a certain amountof direction of attention is going to have to be done, even if it’s just directed by the questionthat is being asked. “What have you done about your lumbosis?” See? Now, he’s supposed toknow the rules of what not to ask, and so on, and to get TA action, and he’s got some variousramifications there that are pretty good. And he can do some things in this line, but it’s verylight attention direction, don’t you see very light indeed. In fact, we don’t even instruct him todirect attention; we rather tend to instruct him not to direct attention. For instance, “Don’t dropthe E-Meter,” you see?All right, we get up to Class III and what have we got? What have we got at Class III? We’vegot a direction of attention at Class Level III toward service facsimiles and the state of Clear.Now we’re starting to drop out this endless, wandering itsa line, don’t you see? We’re startingto clip this guy for letting the PC’s attention wander off too far into other subject matter. We’resupposed— that auditor at the level of m is supposed to be able to control the PC’s attention tokeep the PC’s attention on what the PC is supposed to be talking about We get—the limitationof attention is what enters in here, see, to some degree. We start telling the fellow, “Now,don’t let this PC start wandering around on the early track. And don’t do this and don’t do that;and keep the PC’s attention centered on what you’re trying to run and don’t let the PC’sattention wander over into his environmental restimulation. And if it is there, clean it up withsince mid ruds.” See, at this level we’re using mid ruds; we’re knocking down environmentalattention. We’re paying a lot of attention to the PC’s attention at Class Level III.Now, that control of the PC’s attention is at a very high high, you see, there at III. That’spretty high, now. This PC is really being put in the groove.This PC is supposed to talk about A and B and his attention is supposed to be freed up from Cand D so that he will talk about A and B. You get the idea? In other words, here’s control—control of attention here is getting rather heavy. That’s fine, has to be.Now, let’s take Class Level IV: Man, you’re living with the lightning now. You’ve got this PCon a backtrack. You’ve got this PC there. You’ve got him on stuff that is quite overwhelming.All he has to do is skid around inside the GPM. All he’s got to do is say “Let me go back upand pick up those two early items that we missed.” Zzzzzp!—and he throws forty RIs intorestimulation. Why? Because he had to walk through forty RIs to pick it up that are only —yousee—that are not properly discharged. All right, that isn’t so bad, you see?“Let me repair . . . Oh, I see what this item is. Let me repair it in the earlier goal....” And then,much to your embarrassment, you have missed a GPM between these two goals, and hereturns up to the earlier goal and throws a whole GPM into restimulation, consisting of some230 items in the Helatrobus. Eeerk! Look, you’re walking across Grand Canyon on a wire onemillimeter thick."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Now, if you see the various classes in terms of expertness of control of the PC’s attention, allwill start to make sense to you on the subject of these classes. If you only see these on thecomplexity of the information the auditor has, auditing will not occur. Oh, well, yeah, youknow all about GPMs and you know all about engrams, you know all about processes, youknow all about this and you know all about that, and therefore you’re Class IV. No, no, no,no. There could be that one element missing—that one element missing: control the PC’sattention with expertise—and you would not have a Class IV auditor.Now, you start letting a PC talk, you start putting in the itsa line on the backtrack. Ha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a! I’ve done it myself; I know exactly what I’m talking about, because I’ve got a goodsubjective reality on that sort of thing. “Hey! I just had a cognition. There’s a this and a thatand a tho and a thee, and down there in that engram there’s a spot and a bolp and a bo—oh, myGod!” Bow! The roof falls in. You got the idea? Suddenly throw into restimulation fifteen ortwenty chains of something, see, just with a nice cognition. There is something earlier! Zoom!See?Now, the auditor in that particular case wouldn’t even have time to open their mouth, youknow? PC is sitting there in a brown study. You think he’s looking over the next RI, youknow? PC all of a sudden says, “I think this came . . . I think this came from . . . Yeah, there’sa . . . there’s a GPM there about eighteen trillion years ago. Oh yeah. Oh yes. There it is. Andit’s there and there, and that fits into the other two and it comes up to here. And then that iswhat gives you the background music of all that—uh-uh-uh. What’s the matter with mythroat?” The auditor actually doesn’t have time to say a word.Now, how does that situation take place? That situation takes place when the case is alreadyoverrestimulated—greasy on the track, attention hard to control. Greasy on the track. Now, ifthis PC is quite a bearcat, he will go right on getting tone arm action but very uncomfortably.He’ll go right on getting the tone arm action necessary to resolve the case, that’s for sure. Buthe’s running in an atmosphere of exhaustion, of worry; misemotion comes up here or there. Inother words, he’s a bit overwhumped all the time. You see, you’ve gotten up to the point ofoverrestimulation, and with this overrestimulation now in progress, you are still dischargingthings. Do you see? Case still runs but the case isn’t comfortable while running. Case will stillmake it, but doesn’t feel like he’s getting many auditing wins, see? Awful hard grind. Spendsmost of the time between sessions in a fog, don’t you see? Case still making it and tone armrunningNow, let’s add this other liability. Now, you see that we’ve gone over some difficulties here.Now let s really clobber it. Let’s say that this case we’re doing this with has a fragile tone armto begin with, which is susceptible to being stuck low or stuck high or stuck dead thetan. Let’sadd that liability to all this other complexity.Now what do you think is going to happen? Well, the auditor is going to spend all of hissessions worrying about the PC, and the PC may or may not spend any sessions worryingabout auditing, or between sessions, but just going around being blaaah, or having a bad timeor being very nattery or something.But the auditor is wild. Auditor is trying to get tone arm action, trying to get tone arm action.And he keeps looking. He comes back into the session. He finally got tone arm action in thelast session. Oh boy, finally got it. He got four blowdowns of one division in the wholesession. Oh, that’s fine. That’s more than he’d seen for a long time, and so forth. And hecomes back in; he got this PC halfway through a GPM, don’t you see? Now all he’s got to donow in the nest session is pick it up and finish it and that means—you know, was getting tonearm action, more tone arm action, and you run some GPMs, you know, and you get tone armaction. That’s obvious, you know, wonderful. That’s obvious, and so forth.And he comes back in, and there’s the tone arm. “What the hell? Well,” he says, “somethingmust have keyed in between sessions. Something must have keyed in. This tone arm is sittinghere at about six and a half. Something must have keyed in between sessions. All right. All"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"right. Something keyed in between sessions. All right.“Since the last time I audited you . . . Now! when was that? When was the last time I auditedyou? Last time, last time now? When—when was that?”PC finally thinks and thinks and thinks and thinks, and finally remembers. No tone arm action.“Now, since the last time I audited you, has anything been suppressed?” There it sits. Right ondown through all of those buttons, there it sits. PC tells you all sorts of things, but there it sits.You say, “That’s obvious enough to give anybody tone arm action,” but there it sits! Horrible!You say, “Well, if I can just finish off the rest of this GPM . . . Now, in this session, if I canjust finish off the rest of the GPM . . .” You say, “All right, now let’s pick it up at the last itemwhere we left it,” and so forth.And the PC says, “Last item? What . . . what’s the last item?”“Well, that last item. It was ‘absolutably coughing,’ you know,” and so on. “Let’s pick it up.”And the PC says that and then the needle doesn’t twitch and nothing happens and nothingmoves, and . . . You realize suddenly that if you stay there any longer, this PC is liable to doan around-the-clock and go into maybe a low. tone-arm case, or something like that. Yourealize that you’re looking at something here which can’t hold, because you’re gettingabsolutely no discharge at all. And you hit the silk, and you get out of that. And you say you’regoing to put in the itsa line on auditing or you’re going to do a Prepcheck on auditing or you’regoing to take anything that you’ve had as a good way, you know, to key off the case, and soforth.Now, in this particular case we’re talking about, this tone arm here, let us say, has gone at5.75. So you say, “All right, we’ll just destimulate the auditing. That’s easy. Just destimulatethe auditing and we’ll get tone arm action back, obviously.” So we say, “All right. Now, onauditing, when was—well, how many years have you been audited?” or something like that, or“How many months? Has anything been suppressed?” And of course you get the same story asthe since mid ruds. There it sits at 5.75—no tone arm action. The restimulation is now too greatto permit even the discharge of the key-in. That’s what you’ve run into. In other words, you’rerunning this case downhill on a toboggan. And it all traces back to what?Now, you see, this is quite a problem I’ve outlined to you here. And I see from the looks onsome of your faces that you yourselves have had something like this problem. Now, theresolution of this problem is therefore pretty gargantuan. And that’s what—just to get it all inline that’s what’s been resolved with service facsimile.Service facsimile, in actual fact, is not an accusative thing. It is simply a solution that theindividual has himself so restimulated that it won’t discharge and nothing will discharge past it.In other words, it’s a solution that is so valuable, so survival, so magnificent, that if one got ridof it as a solution, one would, of course, perish at once like a wax effigy, you see, would justmelt right there, you see, and be gone. Too horrible to contemplate getting rid of this solution.Actually, it is simply an overcharged solution. That is all it is.Now, how does it get so overcharged? Well, it’s because the PC is restimulating it. It isn’tbeing restimulated by life. There’s volition going on here. The PC himself is keeping this thingkicked in.This girl has life solved, has life solved: Don’t eat. Every time the boss is mean to her,something like that happens, “Well,” she says, “I don’t have to eat. That’s the good, sensiblesolution to the whole thing. Therefore, really, I don’t really need a job; I really don’t needanything.”"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"The husband, he’s a little bit mean, nattery and upset some evening. So she says she knowswhat to do about this: He don’t eat. Dinner accidentally burns or something like this, see? Andone of the children gets upset, something like that. Well, she knows what to do about that: Kidjust won’t eat, that’s all. That’s it. He’s had it, see? And all of this is so complicated and sofilled with ramifications that it actually has become a survival computation. And it sits there. Itsits there like a mountain rising out of the plain or a dam across a river, and no charge can flowby it. Because if charge were permitted to flow by it . . .You see, the difference between our rationale, and so forth, is we know people do things See,it’s not on the automatic, push-button type mentality of Pavlov, you see, and Wundt and therest of these birds—gents—jerks—fellows. Push-button mentality, you see, that it’s alwayscaused by some mechanical thing. No, there’s also a being there. He’s also up to something,and that’s the further complication, don’t you see? The person can do something, you see?Now, if you tell somebody that the survival computation is “not to eat”— if you told somebodyelse—they’d say, “You’re nuts!” But not—not this one. See, that is the survival computation.Well, naturally, it’s aberrated, but unfortunately for this being, it works: Hubby always gets inline; the kids always shut up. Don’t you see? And she can relax enough about her job or doingwhat she’s doing, so that by saying “Well, I don’t have to eat,” you see, that actually that sortof—she stops attacking in that zone and sphere. And it actually has some weird, backwards,upside-down survival computation, see?So what it is, is a nonsurvival solution which has become survival. And it doesn’t makesense—not even to the person, when they begin to take it apart. It really doesn’t make sense,but it appears to make sense. It appears to make sense. And that solution can become so fixedin the activities of the individual that the individual feels that if it were disturbed in any way, lifewould become unlivable. And this can be a pretty batty solution.You maybe are looking at a service facsimile when you look at a suicide type of thing: The wayto live is to dive off the top of the Empire State Building, see? Now, you say, “That’s nutty.”But the funny part of it is when you run it, if it weren’t so pathetic, you would probably be ableto sit there and just almost ruin your stitches, because this—it’s wild! I mean, how this thingworks out. l mean, the way the put-together, the A=A=A and the disassociate, and so forth, ofthis is so—so fantastic.And very often in the early stages of it, the PC will sit there and they give it to you with such astraight face and with such a solution to the whole thing and, “Well, yes, obviously.Obviously, the way to cure a fear of height is to fall off the Empire State Building,” orsomething like this, you see? It’d be something fantastic. Even that’s too sensible.But what it is, is a solution which has become fixed and which the individual is actuallyworking with. And maybe they’ve been overwhelmed by this solution—it’s explainable inbank terms, too—but the individual keeps that chain or channel in restimulation, And then youstart to audit the engrams of this thing, and all the individual sells you is bring up moreengrams of this thing, but oddly enough they won’t erase.And this was another source of search. The other source of search, of course, was why dosome engrams erase and some engrams not erase. That is an old, idle datum—been kickingaround for a long time. Some engrams grind out and some discharge. Why? Some PCs turn onmass when you prepcheck them and some don’t—mostly don’t—but some do.What’s with this PC who does? What’s with this PC who can’t erase this particular engram?You go over on the left and right of this engram channel and you can find engrams that willerase, but the PC never gives you those; they only give you the engram channel. That’sbecause they’re obsessively restimulating this particular channel in the bank. They’reobsessively restimulating it, because it’s survival to have that. Therefore, they will sell you asthe auditor that particular channel if it is a service facsimile, because their penchant is to keep itrestimulated. So they always sell you that channel."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"And then you, you knuckle head, you going to run it out, man. Why, you’ve picked—if thatperson is a service-facsimile case, which—not all cases run this way, fortunately.Unfortunately for us, many cases run quite easily and smoothly without any of thesecomplications, don’t you see? In fact a little more than half of your cases will run smoothly,without these computations.Well, that makes it bad, don’t you see, because then you’re unable to understand this otherpercentage of cases that doesn’t run smoothly, see? So you say these techniques work, but onsome cases they don’t work. Well, therefore, you have to bring the broad line of restimulationand so forth. Aberration is always of some use. At some time or another anybody’s aberrationon any subject has been of some use to them—always. You can trace it always—you can traceit back. It’s been of some use. Otherwise they wouldn’t keep mocking it up. But it normallydoesn’t amount to this fixed service-facsimile-level crash, you see? And it erases, and ithandles up, and the guy cognites on it, and it straightens up, and all that sort of thing happens.But on a service facsimile none of these things occur. The engrams don’t erase, the Prepchecksdon’t work, the tools of the game are suddenly null and void, apparently, unless you know thislittle, secret channel down through the middle of it. And that secret channel is advised by anytone arm trouble.... That doesn’t mean that for a quarter of a session . . . Since you always getthe top of a GPM almost always early on in a case, you’re going to find the tone arm hung uphigh or something like that. The tone arm normally will hang up on the first fifteen, twentyitems of a GPM and then suddenly loosen up and tone arm action restores. That’s on aHelatrobus type GPM. In the fast stages of hitting a GPM, you normally will get a bit of alockup. That’s beside the point. That’s just a point in the session where the thing locks up. No,we’re talking about the case that gives you trouble with a tone arm, the case that is a deadthetan, a low-tone-arm case, a high-tone-arm case or a case whose tone arm hangs up at thedrop of a hat.The full, complete diagnosis of the case is done with the tone arm, not with how loopy they’reacting in life. I think anybody on this planet is acting loopy in life, see? If you put it up againstsurvival standards, you’d find it was very nonsurvival. You cannot be human and be right. Sothere’s no reason at all to try to trace it back, analytically, or medically, psychiatrically—sayhe’s got schitzobonga, or something, you see? There’s no sense in any of this. This is all forthe birds. There isn’t any reason to do it off of a graph. There isn’t any reason to do it off ofany of your tests. Nothing. The only place you’ll really see this is by putting the PC on an E-Meter, and then, if the PC’s tone arm looks all tight, running the PC a while to see if you runinto the trouble.You see, you could even be fooled—and some of you will be by a dead thetan case that merelyhas a Clear read and a tight needle. Maybe the person isn’t a dead-thetan case; maybe they’rejust sitting in the middle of a bump of some kind or another that’s got the needle slightly tight.And you ask them one question and you practically have a free needle, see? Needles change intheir characteristic. This may be hard to analyze, but that’s the only state that is hard to analyze.The low tone arm, the high tone arm—the second you-put them on the meter . . . The low tonearm, the dead thetan: definitely, always service-fac case. Dead thetan: service fac. Bang, bang.That’s all.This person cannot get discharge in life. In the process of living he discharges no aberration.So living is a very, very aberrative thing to him. See, he’s right up against it there: there’s noaccidental discharge of anything. Give him a birthday present, he doesn’t say “Hey, what doyou know!” you know, and his tone arm moves, even though you haven’t got him on themeter, see? No, nothing like that ever occurs. This guy’s tone arm is fixed all the time, all thetime all the time, you see? Always fixed. And as he lives, he just gets unhappier and unhappier;life becomes crueler and crueler. And eventually he becomes a newspaper reporter, you know,or something like that.It’s a very weird thing how many newspaper reporters I’ve seen who are dead-thetan cases.Restimulation of life is too high for their level of understanding."},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"Now, the low-tone-arm case: definitely service facsimile. All you have to do is put somebodyon the tone arm, see it’s got a low tone arm, see it’s hanging down below two here: nah,service facsimile. That’s it. See? Diagnosis right now, bang; you just know.High: questionable, but probable. You can question it, but it’s probable. But you justaccidentally put somebody on the tone arm—you just put somebody on the meter and you findhis tone arm is reading high, that’s enough, see: service fac.Now, case down here at 3.5, 3.75, something like that, with a fairly decent needle and soforth: some possibility still exists that this is a service-facsimile case. So it goes from somepossibility still exists to maybe/maybe-not but probable on the high-tone-arm case.Low-tone-arm case: yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes—nothing else. Dead thetan case: well, you’relucky if you can get them to talk to you long enough to give you the service facsimile.Definitely service-facsimile cases.So any difficulty with this tone arm; any difficulty with this tone arm . . . Now, I’m talkingabout tone arm difficulty; I’m not talking about difficulty with a case. You know, difficultygetting a PC into things and difficulty getting them out of things. And you can have a thousanddifferent things that could be difficult in running a case. Well, just—it’s just difficult to runcases. That’s not diagnosis, that’s just a banality.Oh, this guy, every time you let him anywhere near the backtrack. why, he all of a suddenstarts picking up things at trillions-eight, then there’s one at trillion-thirteen, and then there’sone at trillions-six, and so forth. Yeah, you have trouble with this guy. You have troublelimiting his line, getting him into something and so forth. Well, the case is simplyoverrestimulated. You could use this same technology and possibly hope you could find aservice facsimile on him to cool it down. Wonder why this stuff doesn’t bleed off faster or whythe case restimulates himself to this degree: Maybe it still lies in the realm and zone of a servicefacsimile, you see? Possibility that it does. It’s worth scouting, worth scouting.But all these troubles I’m talking about are troubles with the tone arm. Anybody who’s got atroublesome tone arm, has given you a bad time, won’t move enough, gets stuck in these threepositions with great ease no, man, you’re looking at a service-facsimile case.Now, what you’re doing is looking at the normal river of discharge blocked up with a great,big, high stable datum—”horses sleep in beds,” see—with this slight trimmings: He knowsthat if he gets rid of this and if he no longer believed that horses slept in beds, oh, cut histhroat! Finish him! The hallmark of a service facsimile is that some time during—in the runningout of this service facsimile—some time during its run-out or between sessions (you’ll hearabout it when the PC comes back into the next session), a person questions the wisdom ofgetting rid of it. I don’t care if it’s jabbing butcher knives in their right arm. He will questionthe wisdom of getting rid of this aberration. And you might miss hearing it on some cases, butit is always there Sometime in the process of running it out, they got up to this level.“Now, let’s see, if I got rid of this, uhhhh . . . ohhh, I don’t know. I don’t know.” Say hisservice facsimile is “hitting policemen,” see? “Oh, I don’t know —if I got rid of that, man, Ijust might be in jail all the time.”You look at him in amazement, you know? “If you got rid of the service facsimile of hittingpolicemen, you would be in jail all the time.” You don’t treat him like that as an auditor, see,but you’ll hear some weird ones. The guy is in jail all the time from hitting policemen, see? Butif he got rid of the service facsimile of hitting policemen, something would go very wrong inhis life and he couldn’t survive and it would be finished, see?It’s where life has been so overwhelming and he has done so much overwhelming that it—actually, it makes no more sense: he has abandoned it, and in lieu of any good sense he haserected this monument. See? And that monument is a monument to total asininity."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"“The way to have good health is to smoke cigarettes, you see, and never take any exercise,”and so forth, and so forth. And you’ll hear this guy going on along in this and you’ll hear adissertation and it seems to be just a little bit offbeat. And you’ll wonder how on earth this—what this really adds up to.Well, without precise assessment you probably could not establish exactly what it was. But itmight be as banal as “good health.” The service facsimile is “good health.” How do you havegood health? Well, the best way to have good health is eat poisonous foods and throw yourselfunder trucks wherever possible, and so forth. You see, the thing is completely twisted aroundthe other way to. It’s an aberrated survival computation, is what it is.Now, it might better be called a service computation, or a survival computation—but wealready have this term service facsimile, so we might as well stay with it for the present atleast—because it isn’t just one facsimile. It actually isn’t a facsimile at all. It’s the guy himselfkeeping facsimiles in restimulation because he knows what’s best.You see all this wild aberration inside of a society which compels its citizens to do this or that.You’re probably looking at third-dynamic service facsimiles. They get stuck on these things.Take the jail system which is used right now in the West. The jail system is rather interesting.Because they know for a fact, and all their statistics demonstrate, every single one of themdemonstrates—the lot—that they increase criminality with the present prison system. All thepenologists know this and they adhere to it slavishly.In 1835 a study was conducted to find out what penal systems were in use around the world—not to find out which was most workable, but what ones were in use, And they adopted thepresent system in Philadelphia. They adopted this present system of the cell and theconfinement and the guard and the this and that. And at the time they adopted it, they knew thatit did the least rehabilitation.I mean, the committee that did this had the data in front of them that they were doing the mostthey possibly could to perpetuate crime by adapting the present prison system. Now, thisprison system today is so general and it is in use so far and wide, and the present courtsystem—court system is not any part of it—is so wide and general and so forth, that everybodythinks that is the only prison system there could be. That is very far from a fact. There areactually hundreds of prison systems. And yet they have hung themselves with the one whichthey found was the least rehabilitative, the least workable and produced the most crime. Andthat was done by study—by careful, analytical study. So you must realize that there are third-dynamic service facsimiles at work. It’s a totally nonsurvival computation to choose the worstprison system you could possibly choose, and yet they set out to do so.So I don’t think they were studying public safety. See, they weren’t any longer studying publicsafety. They were simply studying how to make criminals wrong!So penology, by 1835, had ceased to be a study of how to make an honest society safe fromthe inroads of a criminal and had begun to be just a system by which to dramatize “the criminalis wrong,” see, so no longer had any useful application. I don’t care what money they’respending on crime today: If they’d stop spending it, they’d have less crime. I don’t care howweird and aberrated that happens to look. But I’m just showing you, here is a solution stuck inthe society.Not to go on this subject, because it’s not a horse I ride; it just happens to be an interestingdatum. I got this out originally and was rather interested that Warner Brothers did one on this along time ago. Crime colleges: that’s what they’ve established. You want to—as I asked you inan earlier lecture, how is it that argot is the one thing that seems to be a current slingo that goesalong, a language that carries along, and yet it’s the most secret language there is. How is thisperpetuated? Well, it’s perpetuated by the state with its existing prison system. So with thatargot, then, must go all the systems of defrauding, robbing, murdering and wrecking thesociety. And they have gratuitously, at public expense, erected these universities all over the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"place in which these fellows can carefully communicate to one another the very best criminalmethods. And this is all done at great public expense.And that’s a service facsimile at work. That solution—the prison, see— stands up there rightnow as the primary method why the society is going criminal. And yet it is supposed to be thereason why the society is never criminal. See, it’s erected to protect the public from thecriminal. And there it is, however, educating criminals, perpetuating crime, going forward in avery businesslike way at great public expense to do the least possible rehabilitation for thecriminal, make him feel the most outlaw of any other system, make him feel the mostindividuated from the society, spoil his reach and therefore his sanity. It makes sense to aScientologist particularly: put a guy in this place so he can’t reach anything, can’t itsa anything,he’s naturally—get a case deterioration. Well, if he’s already a criminal because he’s crazy,how about deteriorating his case? Well, naturally he’ll become more of a criminal, won’t he?So, all kinds of actions of this character—I’m not even standing up for another system.Frankly, if you just erected a big stockade someplace or another and told the fellows to go inthere for a while, and we didn’t care who they took with us, we’d probably, you know, have abetter system.If the Scientologist were to go about this—I already figured this out for the federal prisons ofthe United States. The head of all federal prisons in the United States has required Dianetics tobe read, by the way, by all his wardens. And I worked out a system for him. Too much workfor me to put into effect and so never went into effect. We are not without friends orconnections or influence, in spite of the fact that some two-bit—some drug addicts, the FederalDrug Addicts, are after us, because they’re actually not under the government, they’re underthe AMA.Well, that’s who pays them, you know? People work for those who pay them, don’t they,normally? Naturally. They, by the way, recently got some legislation through, I see. Now, sothat anything is mislabeled, all they have to do is arrest the guy and throw him in prisonwithout a hearing. I was interested in this new legislation that came through from the FDA.When they do something like this, they get a level of unpopularity that has exclamation pointsafter it. So they’re doing their best, and we’ll help them out. The direction which they want togo, we will help them go, any day now.But there is service facsimile.Government sets itself up a stable datum: “Foods must not have noxious products in them.”And this outfit is now protecting the public against good electrical equipment and certifyingelectric-shock machines that break people’s teeth and spines. And they pass these. But the E-Meter: no, that’s deadly. It’s pretty grim—I mean, it’s pretty gruesome when you start to thinkover the level of action.Well now, that again, on a third-dynamic level, is a service facsimile in action. See, somebodyput up this solution that the public shouldn’t have to eat noxious food products OF somethinglike this, or poison should be kept out of foods. That, basically, you see, is a good idea. Andthen this idea starts going all mad, and madder and madder and madder, till practically the onlything that’ll get certified is something that kills somebody. See? You get the idea?Well, all right, so they must be there simply to make somebody wrong. I don’t think they haveanything to do with anything except making somebody wrong. I don’t know who they’retrying to make wrong. They’re not going to make us wrong. But they must have somebodythey want to make wrong, and we’re not quite sure who it is. But there is, you might say, aservice facsimile.Well now, you take any good solution to a situation and then plow that solution in so that itlower-harmonics. It goes through several flips. Stays itself, you see, but it’s lower and lowerand lower on the tone scale. It finally gets below all other solutions and becomes itself anaberration."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Now, it isn’t true that all solutions become service facsimiles. You could immediately concludethis. As a matter of fact, I have looked at it rather wildly occasionally and said, “My heavens, ifyou—if any time you solve something, why, you’re in the soup.” No, no, that isn’t it.A service facsimile is a solution which is insisted upon but won’t itsa. It’s a solution which isinsisted upon but won’t itsa. A solution, to be a solution, leads to a further ability to itsa.Now, if you solve something on the basis of the solution reduces the itsa or the ability to itsa,then you’ve set up a-potential service facsimile. This is one of the reasons why Scientologywould never become a service facsimile in a society. See, it increases the ability to itsa.Now, let’s look back at the F1)A for a moment. They are taking over a role of classifying forand protecting the public from making up their own minds about food. They’re denying thepublic an analytical attitude toward products. And they step in there and protect the public fromthemselves, which is to say, they cut the public itsa. Now having reduced the public itsa veryseverely along a level where it didn’t need reduction, they have then set up a situation whereanybody they pass is okay. The public then loses the criterion of inspection; the public nolonger does its own inspection. They don’t buy Salinas Valley lettuce because it’s good andavoid Mexican lettuce because it’s bad, see? But the FDA, aberratedly, because it’s in somewild state, then goes in and passes—because somebody slipped them a quick buck orsomething like that (slipped them Mexican lettuce)—and says, “Well, that’s okay. Mexicanlettuce: that’s—that’s all right, that’s all right. Seal of approval—bang. It’s fertilized withdysentery.”Look what happens to the public suddenly. The public can be caved in by it, because it’sopened a gate which is destructive. See what they are? They are not, then, increasing familiaritywith the environment. They are decreasing it and leaving this area in a mystery. And it’s all setup on the irrational supposition that they’re infallible.:They had some non-pregnancy drug the other day and it had wild side effects, and they passedit. They passed it. There’s been several drugs of recent times that have been passed that areterribly destructive one way or the other. Now, obviously, some role exists for such anagency. But every time you set up such an agency, you set up a potential service facsimile,which will then accumulate to it a great deal of evil. And the next thing you know, you have setup a situation where nobody can live with it. Now, you get how that’s done? It’s by reducingitsa.For instance, you’d almost never look for travel agencies to aberrate a society. See, youwouldn’t look to a travel agency as a primary source of aberration in the society. They couldbring in a little bit. We had a situation here in England where anybody that could buy a ticket inthe West Indies, you see, could come to London. And some shipping company made millionsshipping everybody to London. And this was looked on in some particular lines as something.And then oddly and wildly enough, the Parliament up here was faced with the embarrassingsituation, suddenly, of limiting the amount of immigration from one of its own colonies—veryembarrassing. They managed to get over it and pass it and nobody has ever heard of it since.And they’ve limited immigration in that particular line. But I’m afraid this wasn’t even much ofan aberration. 1 mean, that’s about as close as a travel agency could come, you see?So it doesn’t mean that all these sources are perfect. Little randomities exist around these othersources, don’t you see? But broadly, those that directly reduce the itsa—those that directlyreduce the itsa and don’t help or support the itsa line in any way—are most likely to becomeservice facsimiles. They’re a solution without inspection which is too broadly applied.This girl has a survival solution: She simply says, “Families are no good.” This is what she’smade up her mind to. She holds that in place. She proves it to herself all the time. She worksday and night. She sits there—you can see her in a brown study, you know? She’s sitting thereand so on. “Hmm, yesh. Yeah,” she’ll say to herself, “yeah. Proves it. Mother didn’t sayanything to me this afternoon, so that of course proves, you see, families are no good.” See,"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"and it all works out. Now, she doesn’t have to look to find out why didn’t Mother speak to herall afternoon. And that brings about a no as-isness of mass. There’s no necessity to inspect.She’s got it solved. Mother didn’t speak to her all afternoon because families are no good.That’s it. She didn’t have to inspect the fact that she, last evening when she took the car out,bent the front fender and then didn’t say anything about it and didn’t offer to do anything aboutit and put it back in the garage. And Mama found it at noon and cut the communication linebecause she already knows that it’s disastrous to try to talk, you see?So you’ve got a situation there. Now, that little ARC break is never going to blow away, is it?It’s never going to be talked about, not going to be any communication on the subject and soforth. Well, what’s preventing it from being talked about? “Families are no good.” That provesit.You understand, it gets charged up because every one of these ARC breaks that contributes to itin its immediate vicinity charges it up further, and the person holds it in line harder, and moreARC breaks pile up on it until it eventually becomes an accumulation of mass. And therefore,when you prepcheck somebody with a service facsimile around the vicinity of this servicefacsimile without hitting it on, you turn on mass. The source of the mass is nothing has beenitsa’d.Now, you’re prepchecking them this way: “Since the last session, has anything beensuppressed?” Let’s say it’s auditing that’s the target. This is in vignette; this is not a real servicefacsimile—”My auditor is no good.”(“There is no reason to answer this question because my auditor is no good, because auditorsare no good.”) “No.” Now the case is in a solid, continuous ARC break so it doesn’t registeron your meter.“Since the last session, has anything been invalidated?” you see?“Nope.” (“Auditors are no good. Wouldn’t do me any good to answer the question anyway,because auditors are no good.”) You see?Yet the case isn’t thinking this consciously. Case isn’t thinking that consciously. That’s justeverything that you ask the case comes up against this.And you—my God—you’re trying to talk to this case. You’re trying to get this case to talk.You’re trying to get this case to do something. And you do know what you’re doing. And yetyou’re going up against some kind of a barrier like this in this case. And then all of a sudden,you wheel back and you say, “Uhh-uhh! I’m a failure as an auditor.”No, you’re not a failure as an auditor. You just didn’t clip the service facsimile that madeauditing impossible. You see that? And this is expressed by the no-motion of the tone armaction. Because there is no itsa in that immediate vicinity, there’s no, then, dismissal ordischarge of the charge hanging up on it. You see that?Now, you’re listening to this opinion, “Auditors are no good,” on somebody who neverinspects an auditor or auditing. There’s no itsa. In other words, the whole thing is justcompletely unjustified. How do they know whether the auditor is no good or not? They’veseldom heard one; they’ve never looked at them. See, how would they know?And let’s get another situation: I’m very, very sure that some of you have been over the coalsof being considered immature, or some other way, by either your mother or father or family—irresponsible, see? Now, you probably have never asked yourself this other question: “Didthey ever look at me?” Now, there’s lots of mothers, the last time they looked at little Roscoewas when he was about two. And they’re still trying to advise two-year-old Roscoe at the ageof thirty what he should do about his marriage. Well, they don’t know anything about him."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"If you want to give somebody a send that has a lot of family trouble, just ask them questionsalong that particular line, and so on. Ask them what they have observed about their family.There’s a good R1C. Probably get tone arm action out of that, you see, because it’s on thefringe of something if they’re having trouble with something. And they’re liable to come upwith the realization that their family has never looked at them and doesn’t know them. See, weitsa the situation, some preconceived notion.Societies tend to get stuck with these things, to get stuck with some idea. And it’s veryinteresting that this is probably the way that a society reduces its strength, just as an individualreduces his strength this way. I feel sorry for this society, in a number of ways, because incertain zones and areas which the society depends upon for its control of mean, vicious, nastypersons (and things like us), these guys haven’t got any itsa line out. Do you realize what’shappening? If you want to look at it bluntly, these guys are sitting back taking the wrongactions with regard to certain situations. They’re trying to prevent—through their wrong itsa onScientology—they’re trying to prevent certain zones and spheres of activity, which is to say,“the public must not be practiced on by an unqualified guy who doesn’t happen to pay dues tous,” and that sort of thing.All right, now they’re set with certain set, fixed ideas, see? They believe these ideas. And theybelieve that what we’re doing and what we have to do with is no good and it’s corn, see, andthat it’s not any advance on anything.And my God, during this whole period of time we’re moving right straight on ahead into moremental technology and more technology about life and livingness than they ever dreamed couldever exist. We have actually been effectually isolated and insulated from any furtherinterference, or from having our energies drained down by being made to comply with or agreewith the mores of their particular practice lines. That would have slowed us down like mad,don’t you see? We’re moving forward at express-train velocity.There isn’t any faculty of any college or something like that is going to tell you or me whetheror not we had better research or not research some particular sphere of existence. If we can putan itsa line on it, we look at it. It doesn’t then make it “bad” or “impolite,” see, or somethinglike that—”this is why we shouldn’t look.” And we’re actually traveling as a subject without aservice fac, and it’s making fantastic velocity. And here these poor sods are, whose whole lifeis bound up in these—you know, the mustard-plaster level of healing. And they’re not incontest to keep their developmental line coming forward, so there they sit, and there we go.How high can it rise before the potential suddenly explodes? They’re nuts. That’s what itmakes them look to us. The potential will eventually explode in their faces. In what way? Theysuddenly won’t have any patients. Nobody will be paying any attention to them, because theyhave a wholly authoritarian educational system. That is to say, they put it on TV, ‘‘You mustsee your local doctor. Your local doctor receives you in open arms.” Well, they’re so unrealthey don’t realize that that isn’t the public line. Their word of mouth—I don’t care how muchadvertising you buy, you got to have good word of mouth, man. You can buy newspapers fullof advertising to get somebody to go see a movie that’s no good and the theater will stayempty, because their word of mouth is bad, you see? And the word of mouth on medicine isvery bad. Very bad.And while they’re taking fortunes away from people in the United States for not healing them,and not advancing their own technical lines, and not really measuring up the way they should,they’re not making the effort necessary to survive. Why? Because they have a service facsimileon us. They don’t even know they’ve got it. It’s hidden down amongst their case, amongst anyother batty lines.I had a good news story on the subject. I didn’t release it. It might have woke them up. Theyhave to reorganize the whole of mental and physical healing before they could cope with whatwe’re doing. This potential—these poles are stretching further and further and wider and widerapart, and eventually they will become a no-factor. That’s what happens to them: they’re a no-"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"factor. They simply are not powerful enough or influential enough or anything else enough todo anything about it.You may not think that we’re growing. But I look back over any six months of the last ten andeleven years, and frankly, I hardly recognize a comparable size—just six months to the next sixmonths. This is a rather fantastic thing, only this is going on internationally.Now, did you ever double a penny for thirty-two days? It’s the old mathematical trick. A guysays, “Well, you needn’t pay me anything but one cent doubled every day for thirty-two days.”And somebody says, “That’s fine,” but of course at the end of thirty-two days—I don’t knowwhat the figure is. It’s either a million pounds, or it’s something like that that it has grown upto, don’t you see? It only takes this type of curve growth going on up.Now, therefore, they’re not impeding what they should be impeding if they wanted to survive,themselves. They’re not handling the situation within its own zone of reality. And that’s allaberration is, is a failure to handle the situation in its own zone of reality.So this, then, is the service that a service facsimile performs. It makes it unnecessary for anindividual to handle the situation in its own sphere of reality—makes it unnecessary to do so.So nobody ever does anything about it; so mass accumulates up on it. Now, any mass thataccumulates on a case, any mass that accumulates by reason of Prepcheck, any body mass thatoccurs by reason of processing and so forth, must to some degree or another then be batting upagainst a service facsimile. And if a person cannot be knocked out on the subject of apsychosomatic illness of some character or another by processing, then that must be part of aservice facsimile.Those things that auditing won’t change are, then, rooted in this other mechanism. They’re asolution without inspection which pulls in upon it all the uninspected mass. That’s all. And ofcourse, mass disappears because it’s as-ised. And when a person does not as-is the mass that isthere, be naturally gets an accumulation of mass. And the mass that accumulates around one ofthese service facsimiles is rather marvelous to behold. And of course, it’s that massaccumulating which holds and prevents the Prepcheck action. And those are the technicalmechanisms which prevent tone arm action.If you don’t get tone arm action, it’s because the individual does not as-is and has not as-isedany mass in that zone or area for a long time. And not having as-ised any, when you get into itsvicinity, you go into it with a thud if it gets anywhere close to processing, getting well orhandling the environment in which the individual finds himself.The auditing session, to this effectiveness, extends out to everything the individual does duringthe period of time that he’s being audited and every environment he finds himself in. So that ifany service facsimile exists which is being reacted upon in any of his environment, anyplace, itwill to some degree influence his auditing. And the more of these things exist, the harder it isfor you to get tone arm action—until it gets impossible.Now, an individual can have a service facsimile and still get tone arm action—get some tonearm action. And it would be better in some cases to make sure that the service facsimiles are outof the way before plunging backtrack. The amount of time that you could save in processing isa very large factor. I’ve just made a restudy of this. And I’ve been brushing off Clear left andright and saying no good, no good—you know, I mean, and so on, Keyed-out Clear. And Irecently found out that you can stabilize—there’s a possibility here of stabilizing a Clear by theeradication of the things that will key in. So, you see, if you knock out a number of servicefacsimiles out of an individual, why, the case then stays stable to the degree that it doesn’t stillhave service facsimiles.Now, R3SC is an extremely workable process. I have written it up; it’s been released. Ofcourse, one can expect certain refinements of a process of this particular character. But this is"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"peculiarly complete, because we accidentally already had a couple of types of assessment thatyou could do for this. We have the old 2-12 assessment, and we have the R3R assessment—preliminary step. They’re perfectly adequate, don’t you see? There are slippier assessments thatyou can do and I’m sure we’ll have some fancier assessments on it one way or the other, butthese happen to be adequate assessments. And you’ll find that the mere inspection of a folderfrom beginning to end will give you a bunch of candidates. Just inspect the folder. Just startturning over things and looking at auditors’ notes and mentions of this and that, and what theindividual has had bing-bang runs on of one character or another—whether they gave tone armaction or not, you see? But look particularly for periods of no tone arm action and then go backbefore those periods and find out what was being addressed on the case. And you’ll probablyhave a service facsimile combo sitting right there, and just use it in your ordinary steps ofR3SC.You get an idea: let’s take a period—we found a period here the individual was audited for anintensive and toward the last half of the intensive got no tone arm action. We notice this fromthe old, old, old, old auditor’s reports, see? We find out that on Wednesday “form” wasaddressed by the auditor and that was the end of tone arm action. We notice that there may havebeen two subjects there that could have been addressed. Well, run them both! Don’t be chickensee?Now, you can run almost anything with R3SC, which is what makes it very good. Just don’toverrun it. And if the PC says nor and he can’t give it answers and so forth, come off of it;don’t shove it down his throat. With those ramifications, then, it doesn’t much matter what youpick to be the service facsimile. But if you do a slippy assessment, which is a preliminary-stepassessment, it’s a bingo assessment right dead on—and something like that— boy, you getaction, man, you’ll get action. But if you pick almost anything else, you will also get someaction.So it’s not critical—the assessment is not terribly critical. Of course, the faster you get what isreally the service facsimile on the case, then the faster your tone arm action restores and thecase reverts to battery. So there’s a lot of ramifications to this sort of thing. But in the finalanalysis is, here is a process, full-bloom, which totally replaces your R2-12 type processes—makes them utterly unnecessary—and takes care of this thing we call a rock slammer, and takescare of body mass and a lot of other things in cases that we’ve been particularly worried about,and particularly takes care of the auditor’s main worry which is “How do I get tone arm actionon this PC?” Obviously, if he can’t get tone arm action on the PC, the PC is sitting in a servicefacsimile. I mean, that’s the end product of that.Now, you may have to run two or three or four service facsimiles, but by that time you’regoing to Clear. So you might as well go ahead ant clear the guy: Throw it all out ofrestimulation; make the case sit there with a free-flop needle, and so forth, and say, “All right, Icleared you.” Let the guy enjoy it. Let him enjoy it for a day or an afternoon or something likethat before you reach for the earlier GPM.All right. Now, that’s R3SC. And I hoped . . . I noticed—do you notice that it’s tabulated 3? Iwant to make a short note on that. It’s the tabulation of 3 is because, actually, it is a 3process—being a clearing process. We rehabilitate Scientology levels against the existing scale,and that means that your R3N, and so forth, will be called R4N. It’s a reorientation. But I’mnot going to reuse I their letters when they’re moved up to 4. And there aren’t any other R4s,so they’re very easy to recognize, and they won’t get you tangled up in any way.And then we’ll be able to throw these clearing techniques straight where they belong and thereare a few of them there, so we want them tabulated. We’re getting our house in order, and it’smaking very good sense the way it’s going together.That means that there’s quite a few cases around here will have to be cleared before they go onto OT. I’m sorry, but that’s the way it is. Thank you."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND A SERVICE FACSIMILEA lecture given on4 September 1963Thank you.I’m very, very glad to announce that there are some of you who are not in trouble. Thoughtwe’d start the lecture on a happy note.What’s the date?Audience: 4 September.4 Sept. A.D. 13. Don’t know what the month is named after, but probably something verybarbaric.Well, the shadow of your big toe has approached within several yards of a service facsimile.You remind me of a scout looking over a citadel which is bristling with guns and quite hostile,observing it from as far deep in the neighboring woods as you possibly can get. And I thinkmaybe you’ve caught the tip of one turret or have seen a sign which says Citadel. And I’mgoing to ask you now to be brave and even get out to the edge of the woods and take a look atthis thing, because it’s well worth looking at.And perhaps the fault that you have not seen it is resident with me. It appears to be quite lucidto me; it doesn’t seem to be offering very much complication and so on.But I know what this breed of cat is. I myself have taken a look at it and have audited it andhave seen the results of it, and over a period of years have had an unhappy history of collidingwith it. You know, you’re going down M1 there and you’re wide open, you know, andeverything is fine and I’ll be a son of a gun if somebody hasn’t piled barrels across the road,don’t you see? And well, that’s the end of that one, you see?PCs have always been full of surprises, and it’s been of great interest to me to find out howthey create these surprises. And so I’m very, very happy with what we’ve got here in theservice facsimile, because it is how they create these surprises and what happens. Apparentlythere’s a great deal to know about this thing. And I have not, to any great degree, relayed thisinformation even in the bulletin of R3SC. Apparently this takes a lot of grasp, basically becauseit’s terribly simple. And it’s not that anybody is protecting their service facsimile—you canalmost wipe that out.You head a person’s attention toward the service facsimile, and they go right on in, man. Theygo down the toboggan and over the falls—crash! They are no more able to keep out of theservice facsimile than anything. And you needn’t erect, now, a structure of philosophy toexplain bad assessment by saying the PC will defend himself against his service fac beingfound. The PC will not. The PC gets to the middle of this whirlpool and just whirls. That’s it,man. All you’ve got to do is swing him somewhere in the vicinity of the lake in which thewhirlpool exists, and he dives right in and swims like mad and goes right to the whirlpool andsays that’s it—unless he’s prevented from doing so.My first plea, then, is don’t prevent the PC from finding his service facsimile. That seems to bea rather obvious point to make, and I’m sorry that it sounds sardonic or sarcastic, but I’mafraid has to be made.Because you could say, “Well, of course, if the PC counts on this for survival, he’s not goingto let it be found,” you see? And you could go off on that line and make a lot of hard work foryourself, and actually it’s not of that nature at all."},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Now, there are so many ways of isolating a service facsimile that to cover the area ofassessment at this particular stage of the game is merely to put in your hands a lot of rote thisand that which will more assist you to miss the service facsimile than to find it. There is nosubstitute whatsoever for knowing what one is; there is no substitute at all.Now, the service facsimile, first and foremost, is a tremendous solution which the PC believes,if disturbed, will end his survival. It is always an aberrated solution; it always exists in presenttime and is part of the environment of the PC. And it is something that everyone,unintentionally or otherwise, is telling the PC is wrong and causing him to assert that it is right.Now, you get to understand a service facsimile a little bit better when you recognize that lastpoint. That last point is very, very important. Otherwise, you’re going to be running some ofthe silliest things and calling them service facsimiles, and you’re not going to make the boat atall.The environment, the mores, one or another dynamics, is insistently and constantly at worktrying to tell the individual that the service facsimile is wrong, and the individual is constantlysaying that it is right. And when you have that situation you have all unauditable PC, becausehe is getting audited only to prove that this is right and actually will constantly bring it up inauditing.It is about as hard to find as a burning tar barrel in the middle of an empty field on a dark night,see?The PC is always bringing this to the auditor’s attention. This is so much the case that once youhave found it you will consider that you have been very obtuse indeed. But sometimes it’sbeing brought to the auditor’s attention in different wordings, in different conduct, in differentapproaches that one doesn’t find it easy to label. And it is probably labeling it that is harder thanfinding it.Now, let us first look at the exact thing we are trying to do with a service facsimile—the exactthing we are trying to do with it; there is one thing we are trying to do with it—and then thiswill move out of your perimeter, as an auditor, any necessity of trying to use this principle tomake an OT, because that is not what we’re using it for.I’ll give you an idea now of this. Reg and I just had a discussion a moment ago, and he wassaying, “Well, a human body would be a service facsimile.” He’s absolutely right. He’sabsolutely right. But this, of course, is being applied to going OT—not for the purpose we areapplying it.See, the remark is absolutely correct. It turns on mass. See? It is being asserted constantly, andso forth. Obviously it’s a perfectly good service facsimile, you see? Well, all that’s wrong withit is that it isn’t the service facsimile we are trying to target. See? The wrong target. Because ifyou used that, you would be going to OT, don’t you see? And we are not using the servicefacsimile for that. We’re simply using it to get a person auditable this lifetime and get out of theroad those constantly restimulated solutions that make it hard to audit this person. And that’s itspurpose. Its purpose is simply to clear this lifetime.Now. I’ll give you some beauties on the application of the service facsimile on the whole track.What do you suppose you have a bank for? It obviously must be some sort of a servicefacsimile. Obviously: it turns on mass, doesn’t it? It follows all of the rules.Obviously, “How would having a bank make you right and others wrong?” well, obviously—ha!—obviously would kill the PC. Why? Well, you’d just restimulate the whole early track andyou’d throw him into countless GPMs and you’d overrestimulate him like mad. But obviously,according to the theory, it’s a perfectly valid service facsimile. A reactive mind is a perfectlyvalid service facsimile, but not for the purposes that we are going to use this for."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"It’s well to remember the basic principles of the service facsimile when you are runningsomebody to OT, because sooner or later you’re going to find this guy, and he just can’t seemto get up to a point where he can tilt a planet. You’re having trouble with this PC. He sits downthere on one mountain top, and you sit there on the other mountain top and you’re trying toaudit him, see? And the E-Meter you use are the little glows that appear in the various parts ofhis vicinity. See, you say something; you see something glow, you say, “That read.” Probablyyour auditing commands are all in telepathy or something like this, but we don’t care muchabout that. That’s a good thing to remember. This guy just keeps complaining, complaining—ARC breaking. Weather gets terrible on the planet, you know—keeps ARC breaking.Thunderstorms and other things occur. And he’s got this PTP, you see? He just can’t tilt aplanet. Weak. And I bid you remember this point, you see, that undoubtedly you are nowbucking a service facsimile, see, which would probably, after you’ve talked for a while, add upto something like “being incapable.”And you ask him, “All right. How would being incapable make you right and how would itmake others wrong?” and so forth. And you run it on up with just the same steps of R3SC.You undoubtedly got this boy flying again, you see, into some new zone or area.So you’re never really rid of the principles of the service facsimile. He’s got some tremendoussolution, and that solution is “being incapable.” How does he survive? By being incapable. Atwhat level? At some very upstage level of some kind or another, you see? All right. So that’sperfectly valid.So it’d be valid almost at any point of a case, but that isn’t what we are using it for and that isnot the design and style of R3SC. It’s the same breed of cat—the same breed of cat. But we areattacking here a solution which, just like any other solution, is a barrier to the discharge of theconfusion.What’s made this possible is a new evaluation and a new road found through the bank on guesswhat? You’ve had a new communication level in auditing, and so forth, and that clarified a lotof things. But, of course, the service facsimile is borne out of a reevaluation and a readjustmentof the confusion and the stable datum—that basic: confusion and the stable datum.The confusion can only stay in place as long as it has a stable datum to hang it up. Now, that isso light and so easily changed by a thetan or a being that this does not much get in anybody’sroad. It’s only when it becomes an aberrated solution, the loss of which threatens survival, thatthe individual fails to be able to discharge the mass associated with it.So if you could see confusion as a stable datum (you know those principles; they’re old HCAprinciples), you should realize that you can actually pluck,, out of the center of the confusion,the stable datum, and at that point get a discharge of the energy held in place. It’s a newdiscovery, you see? What holds the confusion in place? A stable datum. That’s a new thought,do you see, because you handle life all the time on the reverse line. You’ve got too muchconfusion: put a stable datum in and the confusion lines up on the stable datum. That’s howyou’ve been using it before.All right, let’s take a reverse look: How is the confusion held in place? The confusion is held inplace by a stable datum. So the removal of the stable datum then discharges the confusion. Anda confusion is a very good description of “what is charge?” Charge is an electrical confusion.Now, as long as a stable datum is held in place by the person, the confusion will not discharge.Do you see this? So here’s a new piece of advanced technology—rather remarkable piece oftechnology—that we have had around for a very long time and it’s simply a reverse look at thething, and we know now how to hold a confusion in place.Now, fortunately for us—fortunately for us—confusion’s are tolerable and not alwaysaberrative. In fact, the biggest part of the confusion’s of life are not at all aberrative; they couldgo on for a long time without hurting any thetan or incapacitating him for a moment."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"You’re playing a card game; you’re playing a card game and you’re having an awful timeplaying this card game. You just never seem to really get anyplace playing this card game. Andyou discover a little booklet and it says “How You Play Canasta,” see? And you read over thisbooklet and it gives you some hot dope on the thing, and after that you can play canasta. This isjust about as aberrative as eating blueberry pie. You understand?Nevertheless, the confusion’s of canasta are held in abeyance by these little rules you havelearned about canasta.Now, of course the confusion’s concerning canasta, as I say, have no aberrative valuewhatsoever. Zero. Life, you see, as I’ve told you several times in recent lectures, is not in itselfan aberrative activity. Aberration has to be rather extraordinary. It has to be worked at; it has tobe kept in restimulation all the timeNow, this rather innocent action of the switchboard girl solving the confusion of her job on theprinciple “If I have twelve calls simultaneously appearing on the board, I handle one and thenhandle two and then handle three,” don’t you see? In other words, she’s got a confusion ofcalls, all you have to do is teach her to handle one call. Each confusion she has from that pointthereon is handled by that. Well, that actually is not at all aberrative to her. Nothing going todrive her mad because she has twelve calls simultaneously, don’t you see? That’s nonsense.So now, we pull off the case—we say, “All right, what system or solution have you had toanswering calls when they were too many or a confusion of calls?”And she says, “Well, I answer one at a time,” and so forth. We get the motion of the tone armhere could not be detected with a micromilli-vernier UNIVAC. See, it actually doesn’t back upany charge. You get the idea?No, there’s got to be force and violence mixed up with these things. There’s got to besomething fabulous. Now, she could add this up and you could add this up as part of theconfusion of trying to survive by having a job—and this could be part of it. And you mighttouch on it and it might appear to move some mass, but actually she’s got something else she isworried about. Her survival is threatened by the fact that she could not handle her job and she’sliable to be dismissed, don’t you see? Ah, but look, solving how she handles a switchboarddoes not solve what she is worried about. She is worried about the fact that if she does nothandle her job she will not have a job and her survival will thereby be threatened.Ah, there’s a much bigger tower on which this little piece of confusion was leaning, don’t yousee? All right, so we address this. How does she hold her job? By being a competentswitchboard operator. Well, I’m afraid that this is not very aberrative either.Why is she worried about holding her job? You say, “What solutions do you have for holdingyour job?” And you get a little TA action, see? Get a little bit of TA action.She says, “So-and-so, and be nice to the boss” and so forth, and so forth, and you get a littleTA action, see. Because this threatens her survival, don’t you see, much more intimately.But the case is still relatively unauditable. There must be something on this case if we’reauditing this case and we’re having trouble with the case; there must be something else that weare bucking into here. What are we running into? Something else. Something else.And we look around and we find out, “Well now, what makes you upset, particularly, aboutlosing a job?” or something like that. “What would be upsetting about this?”And you hear, marvel of marvel and wonder of wonders, you hear—you expect to hear, youknow, “My aged mother would then starve to death,” you see, or something like that. And shesays, “Well, actually, it’s my dog.” You can’t add this up. Actually, she can’t either. Actually,it’s unaddable."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"And you say, “Well, what about the dog? What’s this got to do with the job?”“Well, you see, uh . . . they’d put the dog to sleep if I couldn’t feed the dog, you see?”Now, you might be getting here close someplace and that even looks a little bit sensible, don’tyou see? That doesn’t look quite completely dippy. But you’ve got the idea of a human beingworking like mad and terribly worried about their job and so forth, and we’ve traced it back toa dog. Now, ordinarily human beings do not work to support dogs. But this one is; this one is.And my golly, we work this around for a little while and we suddenly find out that she has lotsof trouble all the time and lots of upsets about keeping the dog in an apartment. And we mayhave a service facsimile that is simply described as keeping a dog.See, that’s probably too mild a look at it, and I haven’t given it to you as rough as you wouldactually find it or as incredible, because I want you to understand it, not sit there with your jawdropped, see? But keeping a dog— keeping a dog, or keeping a dog in an apartment, somesuch action as this, or keeping a dog.. . “And how would keeping a dog make you right? Andhow would keeping a dog make others wrong?”We find out that this girl has one computation in existence which makes her right and makesothers wrong, and it has to do with keeping a barking dog in an apartment where it’ll annoypeople. And that makes her right and makes others wrong, and she feels if she were deprivedof that solution her survival would be shattered. And this is what’s causing her to worry abouther job. Don’t you see?So she always carefully gets these little, sharp-bark terriers, you see, that scraffle and rafflewhen they walk around on the floors, you see, and that yip and yap endlessly, particularly inthe middle of the night. Sooner or later as you’re running this thing, she’ll all of a suddencognite, “You know, I always seem to get very noisy dogs. Wonder why that is?” Well, ofcourse, naturally. It bothers people more.And you run this thing down and you will get some kind of an incident, early-life incident andthat sort of thing, where somebody insisted that a dog be put to sleep or something like thisbecause it was getting old and scrawny. And she had to drive it down to the pound, andeverybody was busy making her wrong and, he [she] was trying to make everybody elsewrong, don’t you see? And this thing is all wound up in a ball. And wonder of wonders, weget this thing audited out—it’s all about dogs, you see? And suddenly, because keeping a joband handling a switchboard was attached to an aberrated service facsimile, you see, to thisdegree, then, her worries and anxieties all have a big lie in them, you see? And they’re alltwisted around wrong way to, and all of a sudden she can operate a switchboard much better—doesn’t even have to have a stable datum to operate one, she just operates a switchboard, don’tyou see? And she can keep a job, she doesn’t worry about the job, and so forth. She’s releasedon this line. You get this action?Now, I’ve given you a very, very simple, understandable solution here— very simple, veryunderstandable. And they’re not quite that simple when found in real life; they are moreaberrated. I gave you a more intelligible one because I wanted you to understand there wassome connection. Now, as you walk across this in real life they jump, usually, a wider gapthan from job to keeping a dog, see? Probably be more involved than this.They arc across a larger spark gap. You may find out that it is “breaking dishes.” So you mayhave some more steps in it, you see? Breaking dishes. And t this doesn’t make any sense at allabout keeping dogs or holding jobs, but nothing makes any sense anyway. She’s breakingdishes to be right, you see, and breaking dishes to make others wrong, and this is the servicefacsimile on which everything else is piling up. And oddly enough, if she’s not permitted tobreak dishes, she knows she cannot survive.She may not know what the barometer reads; she may not know how wide the street is; shemay not know a lot of other things in life. But this she does know: that if she ceases to keep the"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"dog or break the dishes or something like that, why, that’s the end of her—total tertiary line ofdefense.Now, you may not discover this at once on a case. You may not discover this promptly,immediately and at once on a case. You may audit off one, two or three apparent servicefacsimiles that all answer up to the complete description of a service facsimile, but are actuallyonly leaning on the central service facsimile that is restimulated in present time, don’t you see?But as you take these things off, why, the central one comes to view.Now, you see now why, when you say or imply to me, “Now Ron, you should give me somekind of a rote procedure by which to isolate this every time,” you’re asking me, of course, toapply a logical system to an illogical action. I probably could do it and we probably will do itand all of that sort of thing, but I actually would much rather you understood what you aredoing. See, I’d much rather. Because, frankly, you can hunt and punch around on a case. Youcan take old case assessment sheets and folders and 2-12 and something, you know, on thecase, or the case reports or auditors’ reports or case histories or something; and you could get awhole list of things—anything that’s been found on the case. And you can have a discussionover these various things and points, and you can assess them in various ways and get one oranother of them to read. And you’ll find out the PC’s interest will hang up someplace on thislist. He’ll be very interested in it. Far from leaving it, they dive right in on it, see? And here’sthe PC’s interest; it’ll hang up with a somatic, so forth.And now, in fooling around with this, it is sometimes necessary to reword it. You don’t haveto worry about rewording the command. You’ll get results on cases by running differentcommands, but you’ll only be running oddball, flank material on the service facsimile itself,don’t you see?Now, the command is always “How would it”—whichever you have found, makes the PCright and makes others wrong. It’s always that command, see? It’s not “How would opposingit . . .” “ . . . stepping on it . . .” “ . . . throwing it away . . .” or something like that, or “ . . .fighting it make you right?” see? Because you haven’t got the idea of what the service facsimile is, see? Because the condition, the final identification is that the service facsimile solution is thePC. That solution is the PC, so it is something be has. It’s “How would it make him right andmake others wrong?” Now, you can vary it: “How has it made you right?” and “How has itmade others wrong?” You could even say “What would be made wrong by it?”Now we’re going afield, but the PC sometimes springs over, and when they’re operating in anaberrated area of this particular character, their ability to follow an auditing commanddeteriorates markedly and they slop. That’s all right.The way you handle that, and so forth: All of a sudden PC is answering what and notanswering how, see? You say, “All right. Well, just give me the rest of the what’s and we’llget back to the how,” you know? I mean, they’re not very tough. You know, don’t make themwrong and stop them and all this sort of thing. Let them go because you may be standing in theroad of an avalanche at an automaticity, see? They’ll slop on that auditing command, do youunderstand?But the auditing command is not ever “How has it made you wrong?” Never. Never. Never.Oddly enough, it’ I run, but it’ll run the PC down scale. “How would doing things to it makeyou right?” see? Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no. You’ll get some tone arm action. See, this is what’llfool you. You’ll get a little tone arm action. It’ll look okay.Well, let me take the case in point. We assess Father, and some “genius” has just read the restof the 2-12 bulletin and found out that it was always “oppose”—you were supposed to opposewhat you found on that. So he ran 2-12 plus R3SC, which is pretty good. I suppose you canrun several other processes in conjunction with it, too. You could probably have the PC feelingthe walls at the same time you ran the process. I mean, you could do a lot of things. Butanyhow . . . I’m sorry, but that actually happened. And the command was “How would"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"opposing Father”—this is not quite the right one, but don’t want to cast too many bricks—”How would opposing Father make you right?”Brother, that is not a service facsimile: opposing Father is not a service facsimile that’s anaction. See, that’s just an action. Now, if you assessed it out, you’ve got to try it. You got totry it on for size and you got to find out if there’s anything to this, because it would be if youassessed Father—it just simply—I mean, it’s too idiotically simple: Father must be a solution.See, it must be a huge solution. So we say, “How would Father make you right?” And “Howwould,” you know, “Father make others wrong?” you see?Now, you can drag this over into the cow pasture and say, well, hating Father is probably theservice facsimile and so forth, but actually you’re just looking at a secondary or tertiarycondition of a service facsimile. You’re not looking at a service facsimile, because this is noaction. See? This’d be something which was the result of a service facsimile.And the first rule is—what I first gave you in this lecture—if the PC doesn’t immediately jumpinto the lake and swim right straight to the whirlpool, but tells you “Oh, well, Father . . . makeme right . . . Father . . . Uh . . . —make any sense,” I call to your attention the PC is stillstanding on the bank—not service facsimile. Got the idea? PC has not swum madly in and gotall embroiled in this thing. Because that’s the first thing they want to do: Hit the servicefacsimile—drown. Why? Because to drown is to survive. Obviously—that’s the characteristicof a service facsimile.The PC says, “Um . . . I don’t think . .-. um . . . I don’t know. It’s . . . I’ll have to . . . right .. . I don’t know whether that’s right or not. I’ll just . . . make me right? And . . . don’t . . . Idon’t know if that would make me right or not. Let’s see, would it make me right? Would itmake anybody else wrong? I don’t know. I can answer the question. There doesn’t seem to bevery much wrong “ Wake up there in the auditing chair and take a look at what’s going on. PCis standing on the bank, feet not wet, whirlpool not approached—equals service facsimile notbeen found.So go on and do something else clever. Say, “Well, that’s fine. I’m glad we covered that,”cheerily, cheerily, cheerily, cheerily, cheerily, and you gather up your papers and get the hellout of there, see?PC won’t be able to keep out of it—that I guarantee you, man. Won’t be able to stay out of it.You say the service facsimile is “burning cats.” See, something weird like this comes up, see?Or “being a cat,” you know? Something like that. “Being catlike.” “How would being catlikemake you right?”“Oh, well, that’s so-and-so and so-and-so, and so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so, andthen, of course, so-and-so and so-and-so, you understand. There’s quite a suite a—that’s quitea thing when you start really thinking about it like that. You see, catlike is so-and-so and so-and-so and so on, you understand? And so on, and a lot of times been catlike because, you see,it—it uh . . . it’s catlike, you know, and—and so forth, and uh . . . that’s the way it is and soon.” And when you can’t get in an auditing question to get the session properly started, knowthat you have hit one.Now, the reason it turns on automaticities is, of course, that it is automatic, unanalyzedsolutions, and they simply just pour off in a Niagara. When you got a real one and you’rerunning one, always note in your auditor’s report “automaticity.” It merely means, moreanswers than the PC can articulate are arriving from the bank—conveyor belt stacking up. Justnote down when you find one of those automaticities. It’s a guarantee you’ve hit on a servicefacsimile.Now, this gives us the way it has to be run. Because it is susceptible to avalanches, you can’tthen run it with the old TR 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, see? You’ve got to throw the question into the arena"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"and let the lions fight over it for a while, you understand? And just don’t stop it with a newquestion; don’t stop it with acknowledgments; let it sort of run out. After a while, the PC hasgiven you fifteen, twenty answers and so forth, and seems to look rather blank—doesn’t seemto have one now, and that sort of thing. Well, you can either give him another question or youcan change the thing over to the other side, and it does the same thing then. So it’s actually notone auditing question for one auditing answer. You’re not running it that way. You’re runningit one auditing question for one waterfall.But sometimes the PC swaps ends in the middle of it. Well, this is no time to stop him either.He’s busy making others wrong with this “being catlike,” you see, and others wrong, otherswrong, others wrong, others wrong, “ . . . and it’d make me right to so-and-so and so-and-so.” And he’s just reached the end of the flow and he’s turned around and he’s on the backflow. You can also overrun these things and put the PC into a stuck-flow sort of a driftinganaten. You’re insisting that more answers must exist, you see? Well, he’s already at the end ofhis rope, and you’re making him run too long on that side. So it’s run very permissively.What you’re trying to do is get rid of this avalanche and automaticity and get some tone armaction. That’s your main purpose. So how you do that as an auditor is give only enoughquestions to get the PC going and only enough acknowledgments to acknowledge the fact thatyou had a lot of answers. And turn it around whenever it comes toward the end of the rope; andturn it around the other way. It’s very simple stuff.Now, trying to keep the PC answering the auditing question is sometimes difficult, as I justtold you because the PC will skid around on this and disassociate because he’s in disassociatedarea. And don’t you ever tell me that you’re very shocked because this PC has given you awhole bunch of answers that weren’t answers to the auditing question. Now, that’s expected.That’s expected, see? Because what?This solution—now, let’s talk on the theory of the thing. This solution, you see, is holdingback a tremendous amount of aberration, none of which makes sense, so it doesn’t as-is. Sothere sits this solution, see, “keeping a dog,” you see?All right. All this stuff is back of it and nothing is going to flow, because as long as this personis able to keep a dog, life is handled: Jobs are taken care of; everything is protected; all is rightin the world except, of course, for the painful stomach, a hatred of dogs and some littlemarginal fringe worries, you know, of one kind or another. And being broke all the time andnot being able to have a job or hold a job.It’s like trying to solve a problem with a whopping lie, don’t you see? And boy, would youhave to get busy to keep this problem solved with this whopping lie. So it has to becontinuously asserted—continuously asserted. And that solution, then, is just a solution.That’s all it is. And the PC doesn’t even have to work on it consciously because the PC has gotit all triggered to be worked on all the time anyhow. It’s the immediate answer to anything.So life just continues to stack up on this solution, and it accumulates mass on this solution, andthe solution accumulates mass.Now, because the solution . . . Now, let me give you the condition of what kind of a solutionit’s got to be: It’s got to be a below-2.0-on-the-Tone-Scale solution—always below 2.0,nothing above 2.0, see? It’s a below-2.0 solution, because it, perforce, is a substitute for anitsa line. It’s a substitute for an itsa line.The PC started out by feeling he or she could not itsa the object that he or she was trying tomake wrong and so dreamed up this solution—dreamed up this solution as a final solution.And that, then, is a substitute for an itsa line, believe it or not.Well, there’s a girl sitting there and Mother has not spoken to her since noon because the fenderof the car has been dented. And she has this solution: “Well, families are no good,” you see?"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"Makes it unnecessary to observe Mother; makes it unnecessary to observe the environment;makes it unnecessary to participate; makes. . . No necessity at all to do anything about itbecause it’s all done—it’s all contained there in the solution. And then because, you see, thereis no isness occurring on the environment, you get an accumulation of mass. See, mass onlyaccumulates in the absence of itsa. So there goes the old shell game. So it’s actually a substituteitsa line.Now, because of this, of course, it then is referred to every time one refers to anything. Andwhen it is a below-2.0-on-the-Tone-Scale solution, it of course is propounding this—it’spropounding this very clearly, as aberrated as this sounds: To survive it is necessary tosuccumb. And that solution always propounds that, one way or the other, in some oblique,aberrated way.Survival is made up of a numerous number of succumbs. How to survive: “Not to have anyfun”—that’s a good way, see? “To cry all the time.” “To appear to be destitute.” See,obviously, see, I mean, to... These are all manifestations of nonsurvival, don’t you see? It’snecessary to manifest nonsurvival in order to survive. It’s always this kind of an oddballsolution, see? You’ll get something like “not eat,” see? That’s a quite common, by the way,service facsimile; refusing to eat, not eating—common service facsimile. Little children willplay this an awful lot of the time, and when it gets out of that realm and range and moves intoadult life, why, you have diets. They usually don’t amount to a service facsimile, but whenthey do, you’ve really got a mess on your hands. It’s really a nice, big mess. And this must beterribly common because one of the major problems they have in insane asylums is makingpeople eat. Not eating is one of the final protests—hunger strikes. Throw guys in jail, one ofthe first things they think of is go on a hunger strike—if they want to make a big protest, theygo on a hunger strike. So there’s a very common service facsimile.Some version of no sex—no second dynamic. I don’t care how you have it or how you phraseit. It’s got to be some no-second-dynamic one way or the other, see? It’s an incapacity on it;it’s an aberrated practice of it. It can go worse than that. How to survive, you see, is to murderchildren. How does that add up? Well, it adds up to the guy all right, you see?And on the first dynamic, how to survive? Well, commit suicide, you see? In innumerableways, you can commit suicide on many gradients, you see? “Be ugly,” you see? “Beoverweight.” “Be too thin.” Be this, be that, be disabled, be something, be something. Doesn’tmuch matter what it is, you see? You might collide with that on the first dynamic.On the third dynamic, “to be antisocial.” See, these are all sure methods of nonsurvival, don’tyou see? And yet they are added up as a survival computation. “Shoot policemen.” Third-dynamic solution: how to survive shoot policemen. Simple, effective. And you say, “Yesh.But that couldn’t be a service facsimile in this lifetime, because this PC has never shot apoliceman in this lifetime”—ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Don’t make me laugh. This PC has always shot apoliceman; every time they see a policeman they shoot a policeman.“Robbing houses.” You say, “Well, robbing houses—this individual . . . This couldn’t be aservice facsimile, because this person has never robbed a house.” Oh, well now, don’t be toosure. Never passes one but he doesn’t rob it—thinks about it and so forth.Well, how does he use this service facsimile? Oh, he uses it via the newspapers. He alwaysclips out robberies and shows people about robberies and that sort of thing. Figures outrobberies; reads nothing but detective stories, see, and—robbery—robbing houses. That’s agood service facsimile. So, you see, it doesn’t even fit in with the guy’s environment.Therefore, it sometimes is rather hard to trace.You get somebody who is in a death cell, you see, having already shot up innumerablepolicemen and so forth. Well, you know what his service facsimile is—you think. You say it’sobviously “shooting policemen.” You know, I’ll point something out to you: He’s shotpolicemen. Probably wasn’t his service facsimile at all. His service facsimile is probably “never"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"loading guns” or—you know? Service facsimile is “being kind to everyone.”See, the exact circumstance of the person doesn’t always guarantee you that you have yourhands on the service facsimile. That’s what I’m trying to point out here. Because this thinggoes underground. It’s not very visible, and they very often . . . The most effective servicefacsimiles are those which are totally hidden—until you’ve come anywhere in their vicinity andthen they’re laid in your lap, see?You don’t find service facsimiles above 2.0 on the Tone Scale. Now, it’d be completely silly,then, to add up the ARC of the lower Tone Scale, like “not communicated” or something likethis, and say “Well, his service facsimile is ‘not communicated.”’ “How would notcommunicated make you right?” or “ . . . not having communicated make you right?” or “ . . .not communicating make you right?” and so forth,Well, this is, I’m afraid, a little bit too general, see? You don’t use these buttons by theirisolated selves because they are insufficiently directional, and the PC answers them toobroadly. And all you do in such a case is restimulate the service facsimile without labeling it.Well let me give you—just dream one up here; don’t say it’s terribly workable: “Who or whatwould make themselves right by not communicating?” Something like this. Or “Tell me ameans of not communicating,” and make a list and assess the list. Don’t you see? Some oddaction of this particular character. Such a button, then, is useful for the location of a servicefacsimile, but is not in itself a service facsimile.You eventually get, on this list, “hiding pencils.” And you say, “Well, this can’t be verydamaging, but we will run it anyway.” Well, it’s not maybe very damaging; but you find outthat the reason the PC has always looked so bulky is because they’re always carrying fifteen ortwenty gross of pencils; can’t get into their room at night because of the crates of pencils, youknow? Everybody in their vicinity misses pencils all the time. Never spotted him. This is loopyconduct of one kind or another. But sometimes it can look so ordinary to you—because this isthis planet—that you sometimes don’t put your finger on an obvious service facsimile.Let’s say it isn’t “being sick” but it’s “having chills.” “How would that make you right andmake somebody else wrong?” or something like that, you see? Or “having a cold,” orsomething like this. That still could separate out into a service facsimile, don’t you see? But itmight not be on and it might be on: it doesn’t matter.See, I’ve given you a bunch of stuff that you may think, by this time, the service facsimile,again, is very hard to locate. No, it isn’t. I’m just giving you she idea that you’ve got to lookfor it. You’ve got to prowl around. After this character has given you something that might beit, make a “represent” on it. Be quite frank with the PC. Don’t pussyfoot on this thing. There’sbeen too much pussyfooting about already.Say, “We’s looking fo’ you’ service facsimile. What is it, boy?” You know, subtle.“What do you think your service facsimile is?” Do a list. Pull the missed withholds and nullthat list—good reliable method. PC [will] withhold it perhaps, and then just the fact that youput it down on pulling the missed withhold—and all of a sudden he dives into the water, swimsright over to the middle of the lake, dives right into the middle of the whirlpool and says “Therewe are. Uhhhhhh! What am I doing here?” Interest! Attraction! So forth.Because, of course, it’s not a volitional solution. That is to say, he doesn’t think up thissolution all the time. It’s a sub-awareness solution which goes into automatic action. It’s thatburied. He’s right on the verge of it all the time, he’s in direct connection with it all the time, soyou just lay down the faintest link to it and he can’t help but travel that link, don’t you see?That’s one of the reasons, you say, that neurosis and psychosis are very, very difficult tomaintain. All you practically have to do is spot them and they start blowing up. It’s very hard todramatize the exact reason for them."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Why anybody would go through heroic actions to explode a psychosis or neurosis, or electric-shock people or go into brain treatment, just because the person is jumping about the floor andscreaming or refusing to eat or doing something like this, and so on—that’s not a good enoughreason. That doesn’t mean that the psychosis or neurosis is violent, you see? That only meansthat it produces violent reactions. See, it doesn’t mean that it is violent at all. Maybe this girl,insane, is jumping about the floor because she doesn’t like cockroaches. And that’s the logicalexplanation of the thing, and people fail to note that this is true because there are nocockroaches there. But she’s seeing cockroaches, you see?So you might have something on this order (this becomes very elementary): You say, “Whatreally might be worrying you all the time?” You make a little list. And she jumps about the floorand hangs from the chandelier and rolls up in a ball and so forth, but she’ll talk to you and shegives you, finally, a list. And you assess this list out according to interest: Which one is shereally most interested in? And you’ll find out that it’s cockroaches. She’s very interested inthese cockroaches that are all over the floor. And you’d say, “Well, how would seeingcockroaches make you right?” And that’s probably the end of her insanity. Why, she probablycouldn’t maintain it from that point on. She wouldn’t be well; she wouldn’t be calmed down oranything like that. But she’s now going to have a hard time maintaining it because she’s got aconnection to it. And the thing will discharge. See, it’s hard to do now. Now you got to getvolitional about jumping around in the middle of the floor; now you got to mock up thecockroaches to put them on the floor, don’t you see? And she just can’t make it. And thatcharge, just that much charge, and it’s gone.That, by the way, was practically the totality—the accidental fact there, is probably the totalityof the Freudian recoveries—is contained right in that. It’s just that they would evaluate in somefashion or another, like you do with an ARC break, you see? And they’d happen every nowand then to strike something that was a service fac, and the individual would think about it, andit would be impossible then to dramatize it. But not knowing the mechanics of it, it neverthelesswould slightly discharge, don’t you see? And it’s all those false assignments that made theirpeople sick, see? It was the assignments that weren’t service facs, and that sort of thing.So you can learn from that just in passing. And don’t give a guy a bunch of phony service facs,see? Let him decide what it is, you see? Don’t ever foist one off on anybody. You’ll find that’salways a good part of the rules. If he says it isn’t it, it isn’t it, man. That’s it. That’s the rules.Customer is always right. Because frankly, if you’ve got it, he can’t stay out of it, see? Man, ifyou keep that little fact up your sleeve, why, you can afford to reject any quantity of them. Yousay, “All right, ‘beating dogs’ and so forth. You don’t think that is it. I had it on the list here. Itread a little bit.”“No, I don’t think that is . . Beating dogs, beating dogs, beating dog, beating dogs, beatingdogs, and so on.... Beating dogs ...”“Would it make you right in any way?”“Nah. Would beating dogs make me right? Hm. Heh. No. No. No. Wouldn’t do much. Well,actually, could add it up—it could make me right to object to bad behavior on the conduct ofdogs and make dogs wrong to indulge in bad behavior.” End of computation, see?You’ll find every once in a while a PC will give you something like that. And then they’ll say,“Oh yes. Let’s see. How would it make me wrong? Now, let’s see. How would bad auditingmake me right or bad auditing wouldn’t make me right—it’d make me wrong.” Of course,that’s the end of that. You pursue that no further, see?But, “How would getting stuck in an engram make you right and make others wrong?”“Wouldn’t do it.”“Well, how would auditing make you right and make others wrong? you see? How would"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"auditing make you right?”“Well, it’d make me right if I got better and it’d make the auditor wrong if 1 didn’t.” End ofcomputation.Of course, that’s no service fac. Perfectly logical answer. There are no further answers behindit. No vast blast of the TA as it falls down; there’s nothing going on here particularly. So youdon’t want to hang people with these things, because it’s too easy to find the right ones. Andthey abound, man.This is one of the most interesting little treasure hunts you ever engaged upon, see? And youmight as well get used to what it is and figure out what it is and put your own itsa line in on it,and so forth, because you’ll sure know what it is, then, see? You say, “Here it is, man. Thisguy has got this thing which is some kind of a horrendous solution of some kind or another,and it’s got all this charge backed up. And whenever I audit him with a Prepcheck, why, verylittle TA action or mass turns on with a Prepcheck—must be a service fac. This case not veryeasy to audit; has a fragile tone arm; tone arm gets stuck hard— another condition, you see?—must be a service fac, and so on. Can’t get this thing. Why?” Well, look-it—obviously, if allthe discharge you’re going to get is a confusion running off in the form of charge—if thecharge won’t run off, there must be a solution there which p events the charge from runningoff. And that’s all there is to it. He’s got it solved. He doesn’t have to look around: Back’s badand his head’s bad and his ribs are bad and he can’t sleep at night and he’s got ulcers and soforth; but he doesn’t have to inspect this. See?Say, “Well . . .” You start running this down, you’ll find out, well—do this little list orsomething like that, or however you’re going to run it into, or do past data, moving in towardthis thing—you find out he sleeps on the floor. Doesn’t sleep in bed—has a bed but he sleepson the floor.Well, I’d try that on for size and just say, “Well, is there any possibility you do that because itwould make you right?”Now, you’re going to get one of two reactions: “Pprffff. Well, it would make the landladywrong, because she doesn’t change the sheets very often, and so I sleep on the floor, see?” Or,the other reaction, which is the one you’re looking for, see, is “Well, sleeping on the floormake you right? Oh, yes, yes. As a matter of fact, it would, so on. And a long time ago when Iwas in—when I was in . . . in boarding school, you know, we used to have these bed—bighigh beds and so forth, and could pull you out on the floor and ma ---. But that isn’t the realreason why this thing was. You see, I kept sleeping on the floor. Actually, you get more freshair, and so forth, and uh . . .”Well now, look, don’t be a complete knuckle head as an auditor and try to go through somemore action, see? You’re just using auditing actions to cut the itsa line. You got one running,man. Just sit back and let it run. Now, do the easy thing, see? All you got to do is sit back andlet it run.The only trouble you’ll get into is sometimes the PC starts running backtrack on it in a hurry,and then you should start getting nervous. So if you can get in an auditing question on thething, why, slide “in this lifetime” or something like that on the front of the auditing question,providing you have asked an auditing question. If you haven’t, why, try to get it in at the nextquestion—if you get a chance to ask the nest question. Got the idea? You might not get achance to ask the question at all. It may run all the way out and he’s now ready for the otherside, see?Now, the main thing that you gain from all this and the main thing you gather from all this istone arm action. You’ve got the mass flowing that kept the PC from getting tone arm action.And that’s your interest in it. You’re not interested in his social conduct. You’re interested inhis auditing conduct. Where old medical psychiatry went adrift, we needn’t go adrift. They"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"become so fixated on the subject of “r-r-r-right conduct,” without even being able to definewhat it is (except maybe a slaver when the bell rings), that these birds are always adjudicatingeverything on the subject of conduct. Insanity is a brand of conduct. Neurosis is a brand ofconduct—conduct, conduct.Well, the unfortunate part of it is—the unfortunate part of it is—that it doesn’t catalog, itdoesn’t classify. You can’t do that, see? Because it just renders everybody open to the chargeof being neurotic or psychotic. just everybody, wide open—which is one of the moreinteresting factors, and then they can use this politically, don’t you see? And then anybody theydon’t want around, they merely say some of his conduct is aberrated and they can throw him inthe local spin bin and chop his brains up for hamburger. I don’t know what they eat.The point I’m making here is that’s highly dangerous—highly dangerous—saying a person isinsane or sane when your sole basis of adjudication, you see, is conduct.So this doesn’t always meet the eye. Some of the most roaring insanity’s on this planet areclassified as sane behavior, see?Now, in actual fact, you’re measuring up not a person who is in agreement with this planet butyou’re measuring up a person who has lived a very long time. So whatever is the service fac isthe service fac, don’t you see? It’s not because he does something peculiar, or not because hedoes something this, or . . . We have a list of things. I can tell you what it’s more likely to bethan something else. But action that is peculiar is only peculiar, not compared to the mores ofthe society in which you find yourself but just compared to the datum of survival. See, justcompare it directly to the datum of survival. And it’s always a contrasurvival action which isposing as a survival action.Revolt. I don’t even know why you’d revolt against an earth government; they’re all convicts,see? You’re living in an area where there are no wardens, see’? Actually kind of silly to doanything particular in this particular direction because they’re nuttier than anybody else, don’tyou see? They probably need their hands held twice as hard as anybody in the spin bin, youknow? They don’t know what they’re doing.So what is considered normal on this planet might at any one point be completely batty. So theservice facsimile comes down to the comparison with the datum of actual survival and the factthat the PC is interested in it and that it releases tone arm action because it must be a fixedsolution.So actually, what you’re studying are fixed solutions uninspected by the person, which arecontrasurvival. Now, when you hit all of those, man, you’ve hit the jackpot.In any case which has a fragile tone arm which is liable to stick at the drop of an E-Meter cord,see—bang! like that—you’re looking at a service facsimile. You must be. There must be afixed solution. Why? Because there’s no charge runs by it. So if no charge runs by it, it mustbe a fixed solution, and it gets in the road of auditing, so it must be contrasurvival. Actually, itcould be a fixed survival solution which really was a survival solution, and you’d find itwouldn’t even vaguely influence auditing.See, you’d go out and audit the guy and you get tone arm action, and he’d go on flying andhe’s got these fixed solutions all over the place. He’s practically nothing but a bundle of fixedsolutions. You’re trying to find the black spot in the middle of the ball of yarn, see? The blackspot in the middle of a mountain of white spots. The mountain comes down if you find thatspot. Fortunately for you, there are several gray spots in its immediate vicinity, any one ofwhich can be hit and do the case some good. So it’s a constant prowl on this route. You handleone. All right. Fine. Is this case going to remain stable? Well, that’s very doubtful so let’s findtwo. Let’s find three. Let’s make sure we got it, see?Now, your tone arm is flying around and your needle, by this time—the thing can’t stick. You"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"find you find one, the case will tentatively resume its stuck-needle condition, momentarilyresume it. Interesting. Can’t hold it, but it’s a drop, you know?You haven’t got all of these now; you haven’t got all of them you want, and it’ll still be a littlethis way. And the next one you find—pshew-sss-sss-ssss-ssssew. It’s coming down. Needle,is getting so it can’t stand upright, because there’s nothing to hold it. Just the weight of theneedle causes it to bang against the sides, you see” You actually have trouble reading your tonearm, as you’re winning on these, when you are really hitting center. You’re having troublewith that tone arm because you can’t find out where to center it.Your needle is not as nice as it was before. It’s too floppy. You’re having a trouble centering it.And you just about get it centered and it moves, see? And you just about get it centered, it flopsover the other way. Your tone arm reading gets very, very inaccurate as this really starts to bite.You can’t quite keep it properly centered. It’s moving too fast, too. PC just thinks a thought,see, and it goes clank! It’s gone. But, gee, how much charge went off there? Well, we don’tknow. It’s because you’re bleeding, you see, a central reservoir of charge and it’s flowing in aNiagara.Now, the other thing it does for you and the reason why this is very beneficial to the casecompletely aside from unblocking this—is a service facsimile is always protruded into presenttime, always protruded into present time. So any constant PTP that your PC has had will ofcourse produce the service facsimile. And that is very good news for you. You can produce theservice facsimile out of any PTP that has been constant and continual with the PC.“What did you come into Scientology to resolve?” And he’ll give you a long series of this andthat.Now, it’s very, very dangerous to list too many problems on a PC. You list too manyproblems on a PC and you’re going to wind him up in a . . . bang. That’s dangerous. Call thatto your attention. Listing problems—not so good, see, not so good. Bad show. Doing anincomplete list of problems will ARC break the PC. A complete list of problems is very oftentoo long and is a bit dangerous to the PC’s needle and case condition.So how do you find out the problems? Well, you have to take a step backwards before you takea step forwards. See, locating the problem that you’re trying to solve—you can’t let that runforever because that’s the exact opposite of an itsa line. It’s a whatsit line. See, a problem lineis a whatsit line. And you can freeze your tone arm gorgeously with a whatsit line. So a whatsitlist will freeze your tone arm, and so forth. So it had better be on the basis of a friendlydiscussion which you can leave in an awful hurry. And you recognize that you’re taking a stepbackwards with this case, making him whatsit, which is basically what’s bum with theseassessments, and so forth.“What was your chronic present time problems when you got into Scientology, and so forth?What were these things? What are these things you were trying to solve at that particular time?”Now, if you hang up this case too badly, you can take that little list and ask for a solution foreach one of the problems he’s given you—if you’ve made a list—ask for some solutions forthose problems, and you will take the tension off the tone arm. So there is a cure for thissituation, but it’s rather a lengthy and involved cure. But you may have, sitting right there . . .The solution, you see, is not a problem; the solution is not a problem, but a few of theseproblems can be looked at as pointers to a possible solution.He’s having trouble in a certain area. Now, your problem, once you’ve got any idea of hisproblems, is to put your finger on some solution with regard to that problem. Ant that solutionwill be the fixed solution which gives you the service facsimile.Now, notice that R1C and R2C are designed to strip away solutions, decisions and stable dataoff the case—so-called stable data. Therefore, they are very, very easy to run and they produce"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"tone arm action and are the least likely to hang up the tone arm. You start asking for whatsits,however, in R1C: “Well, you say you have had a . . . you—you’ve had the idea that all snakeswere lived in the tops of houses, and so forth. Now what problem would that solve?”Man, cut your throat! You’ve asked the reverse side of R1C and the tone arm is going to go upand stick. But notice that your R1C and R2C, these itsa-line questions and run, are designed tostrip away charge from the service facsimile area.Therefore, it is a very good thing to find out if the PC has been run on R1C and R2C. Ofcourse, they won’t have discharged the service facsimile, but they may have some data therethat they uncovered in looking at all this, which you might then sort out and get an idea, don’tyou see? So you say, “While you were being run in the co-audit down there, what did you runinto that you found very interesting while you were running your case? What did you really runinto?”“Well, I ran into this and that and the other thing and the other thing and the other thing,” andyou make your little bit of list of these types of solutions and zones and areas and you’ve gotyourself an assessment, see? Then run this thing down, and—with a little further discussionwith the PC—and you’re liable to hit right on it just like that.Funny part of it is that R3R is almost a dead-center pitch on a service facsimile, providing itwinds up in a statable solution.Now, “failing not to communicate with eating figs in Smyrna,” I don’t think you would find agood service facsimile. I call that to your attention. If it doesn’t make sense to you, it’s notlikely to make sense to the PC So don’t go astray on this, because, after all, the preliminarystep of R3R was designed to do an entirely different thing and it may be only a fragment of thatand it won’t be the tone level you found, see? It won’t be that. It’ll be some fragment of it or arewording of it.Now, I funnily enough have found one on an incomplete R3R assessment that two stayed inon. The list had to be extended, don’t you see? And one of those was the service facsimile. Ifind that quite interesting. In other words, if we had completed the list to the final run, wewouldn’t have found the service facsimile, see, because it would have been buried back on theline a little bit, don’t you see?Well, this tells you that it doesn’t really have to be a terribly good assessment—any kind of anassessment. You’ve run something like “failed to shoot” — “What have you failed to shoot?”or something like this, or “failed to have been with?” or something. And you get a list, get a listof this; go on down the line; assess the thing out. Well, even if your “failed to shoot” is kind ofa lousy level, as long as it’s in, not because it’s been protested or was a mistake on your part,see’? PC has protested it, so it’s in, you know? That’s the corny way those assessments goastray.PC didn’t understand it, didn’t know what it was. So it keeps reading, you know? If you don’tclear anything with the PC while you’re assessing the PC, you can expect that problem to comeup on auditors that are green in your supervising sometimes.That can be sort of corny and it’ll still produce something. And you’re doing yourself a listover alongside of this thing, and you didn’t even really get a chance to complete your list verywell, and so on, but it went out, and you finally had a level stay in. It’s much more likely to bethat level if the PC is interested in it. You get the idea. It’s the item—pardon me—it’s muchmore likely to be the item, you see, than it is the level, because the level is too broad. And justrunning it sets up the bank enough so that you can then do one with greater accuracy, becauseeverything on that—as long as you just got something to stay in for fifteen strikes or somethinglike that—you know, one of these arduous lists where everything is alive on the whole list.Everything is knocked out at one fell swoop because restimulation by reason of present time isalways about 50 percent of the restimulation present on any case at any given moment, that has"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"service facs, you see? It’s about 50 percent of the charge on the case.You’ve only got, then, 50 percent, you see, that you can restimulate with safety because thetolerance for restimulation, you see, is lessened by 50 percent. All of a sudden this characterwill run like a startled gazelle if you can get this service facsimile out of the road, because yourenvironmental restimulation has nothing to kick back on.Now, we used to try to solve this by processing him faster than the environment can kick himin. Remember? You know? Process him twenty-five hours during the week, keep him awayfrom home, and his wife won’t kick his head off, and when he goes back home he’ll staystable. You know? That kind of thing. But we were just hoping we’d get the service facsimilebefore he went back home. You understand? So if you could reduce that factor out of the case,then all the gains the case made in session would stay. So there’s another bonus. See, the caseswouldn’t drop between sessions, see?Now, the amount of attention which the PC has turned in on this service facsimile and thedisabilities which accompany it, and so forth—the attention that he has on that—also keep himfrom looking at his bank. I could say that an expert handling of service facsimiles—this is justa wild guess—would probably raise the runability of the case about a hundred to one. Youdon’t actually know how easy a case would be to audit. See, if every case has some of this andit only becomes visible when some cases make it impossible to audit, see, well, how easy is acase to run? Well, we probably don’t know the answer to that question.See, but we know some cases are impossible to run, and those are the ones we have attentionon right now. So, you take care of those for me just now, will you please?Thank you.
