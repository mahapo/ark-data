Within5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. “Quickie grades”entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this PolicyLetter are HIGH CRIMES resulting in Comm Evs on ADMINISTRATORS and EXECUTIVES. It is not“entirely a tech matter” as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a 2 year slump. IT IS THE BUSINESS OFEVERY STAFF MEMBER to enforce it.ALL LEVELSKEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKINGHCO Sec or Communicator Hat Checkon all personnel and new personnelas taken on.We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology.The only thing now is getting the technology applied.If you can’t get the technology applied then you can’t deliver what’s promised. It’s assimple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what’s promised.The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is “no results”. Troublespots occur only where there are “no results”. Attacks from governments or monopolies occuronly where there are “no results” or “bad results”.Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if thetechnology is applied.So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P,the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied.Getting the correct technology applied consists of:One: Having the correct technology.Two: Knowing the technology.Three: Knowing it is correct.Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Five: Applying the technology.Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied.Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology.Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications.Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology.Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application.One above has been done.Two has been achieved by many.Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper mannerand observing that it works that way.Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world.Five is consistently accomplished daily.Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently.Seven is done by a few but is a weak point.Eight is not worked on hard enough.Nine is impeded by the “reasonable” attitude of the not quite bright.Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity.Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area.The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Threeabove can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too-bright havea bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shutoff from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselvesagainst anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks toknock out the good and perpetuate the bad.Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight,Nine and Ten.In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide openfor research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of Century hasthoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only ahandful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long run value and none were major or basic; andwhen I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I repented andeventually had to “eat crow”.On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions andwritings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction ofall our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and howinsane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology”. By actual record the percentages areabout twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroygood technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had better steel"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attackedas “unpopular” “egotistical” and “undemocratic”. It very well may be. But it is also a survivalpoint And I don’t see that popular measures, self- abnegation and democracy have doneanything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorse degradednovels, self- abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses,and democracy has given us inflation and income tax.Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had nosupported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that in itsformative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume,will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done.There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which willbe valuable-only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications.The contributions that were worth while in this period of forming the technology werehelp in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, ofadvices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are,appreciated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discoverycontribution was not however part of the broad picture.We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank.We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact-the group left to its own devices would nothave evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called “new ideas” wouldhave wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workablemental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve-psychiatry,psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infinitum.So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense,and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlesslyfollowed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish.So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I havenot failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’s not goodenough for just myself and a few others to work at this.Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight. Nine and Ten has been relaxed the wholeorganizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.l., Wichita, the early organizations andgroups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, whenthey were all messed up you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. But ahead of that theyceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons.The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks havedifferent responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bankprinciples. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual andseldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid cravingfor agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement hasbeen what has made Earth a Hell-and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it wouldcertainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the greatgovernments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on theplanet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasantthings on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by theGroup Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by “public opinion” media.Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves.Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group offreed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that isdestructive."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bankdominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it,(b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and(d) encourage incorrect application.It’s the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the Bank thatsays we must fail.So just don’t play that tune. Do Seven. Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out ofyour road all the future thorns.Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pcspin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C.Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak on Threeabove and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the CaseSupervisor “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly at each of One toSix above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door tothe introduction of “new technology” and to failure.What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s all thathappened. This is what he should have done: Grabbed the Auditor’s report and looked it over,When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the restmissed: that. Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but thatnear session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while itstill gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B’s own manufacture, which nearlyspun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A wasfound to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The CaseSupervisor was found to be “too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases”.All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven,Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That process X didn’twork.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s your auditor’sreport for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stoppedProcess X. What did you do?” Then the Pc wouldn’t have come close to a spin and all four ofthese would have retained certainty.In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct processrecommended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one had (a)increased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable.Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process crackedthe case. Yet they were reported as not having worked!Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every timeinstruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the auditor,is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten areeven more important in a course than in supervision of cases.Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “because hegets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisions asession are reported. “Of course his model session is poor but it’s just knack he has” is alsoincluded in the recommendation. A careful review is undertake because nobody at levels O toIV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read anE-Meter dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered thathe “overcompensated” nervously swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed togo to place the needle at “set”. So everyone was about to throw away standard processes andmodel session because this one student “got such remarkable TA”. They only read the reportsand listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were makingslightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hidden under a lot of departuresand errors.I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot ofoff-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The academy students were in a stateof electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought under control andthe student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck.Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wifedied of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough instructor at that moment couldhave salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to dowhatever they pleased.Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes aboutfrom non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but someearlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood.When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can becounted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came fromorgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology under instruction inScientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And theorgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened outeasily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. hence, adebacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So properinstruction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must bemerciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student,dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be thecause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology gothome to him.With what we know now, there is no student we enrol who cannot be properly trained.As an instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards insideout personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeve rolled up can crack theback of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole classonly. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don’t wait untilnext week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him. If you can’t graduate them with theirgood sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll havenightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three inthem and they’ll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing.When somebody enrols, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of theuniverse- never permit an “open-minded” approach. If they’re going to quit let then quit fast. Ifthey enroled, they’re aboard, and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the same terms as the restof us- win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. Thefinest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pambybunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It’s a tough universe. The socialveneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive-and even they have a hard time. We’llsurvive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly hebecomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scaredto enforce, we don’t make students into good Scientologists and that let’s everybody down.When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in he eye into afixed, dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. Theproper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist Now we’re going to makeyou into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you dead that incapable.”Fitting that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the crosswe have to bear.But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and timewe will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow. Fast. And as wegrow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less.So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s ourpossible failure to retain and practise our technology.An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of“unworkability”. They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or notdone.If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all therest.We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to do forlack of something better.The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and yourown destiny for the next endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now withand in Scientology.This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we maynever again have another chance.Remember, this is a our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of thepast. Don’t muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine andTen.Do them and we’ll win.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1965, 1970by L.

Adding comments to checksheets or instructions labelling any material“background” or “not used now” or “old” or any similar action which will result inthe student not knowing, using, and applying the data in which he is being trained.3.

Failing to strike from any checksheet remaining in use meanwhile any suchcomments as “historical”, “background”, “not used”, “old”, etc. or VERBALLYSTATING IT TO STUDENTS.5. Permitting a pc to attest to more than one grade at a time on the pc’s owndeterminism without hint or evaluation.6. Running only one process for a grade between 0 to IV.7. Failing to use all processes for a level.8. Boasting as to speed of delivery in a session, such as “I put in Grade zero in 3"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"minutes.” Etc.9. Shortening time of application of auditing for financial or laborsavingconsiderations.10. Acting in any way calculated to lose the technology of Dianetics and Scientology touse or impede its use or shorten its materials or its application.REASON: The effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs wasconsidered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades. The pressureexerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered byjust not delivering.The correct way to speed up a student’s progress is by using 2 way comm and applyingthe study materials to students.The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going onto the next and repairing them when they do not.The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirelyanswered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materialsand actions.Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to anyrecovery.The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs. When theproduct vanishes, so does the org. The orgs must survive for the sake of this planet.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1970by L.

The coach is not boundafter starting to answer the student’s question but may comm lag or give a commenting typeanswer to throw the student off. Often the coach should answer.Somewhat less often the coach attempts to pull the student in to a Q and A or upset the student.Example:Student: “Do fish swim?” Coach: “Yes.” Student: “Good . “ Student: “Do fish swim?” Coach:“Aren’t you hungry?” Student: “Yes.” Coach: “Flunk.”When the question is not answered, the student must say, gently, “I’ll repeat the auditingquestion,” and do so until he gets an answer. Anything except commands, acknowledgementand, as needed, the repeat statement, is flunked. Unnecessary use of the repeat statement isflunked. A poor command is flunked. A poor acknowledgement is flunked. A Q and A isflunked (as in example). Student misemotion or confusion is flunked. Student failure to utterthe next command without a long comm lag is flunked. A choppy or prematureacknowledgement is flunked. Lack of an acknowledgement (or with a distinct comm lag) isflunked. Any words from the coach except an answer to the question, “Start”, “Flunk”,“Good” or “That’s it”, should have no influence on the student except to get him to give arepeat statement and the command again. By repeat statement is meant, “I’ll repeat the auditingcommand.”“Start”, “Flunk”, “Good” and “That’s it” may not be used to fluster or trap the student. Anyother statement under the sun may be. The coach may try to leave his chair in this TR. If hesucceeds it is a flunk. The coach should not use introverted statements such as “I just had acognition.” “Coach divertive” statements should all concern the student, and should bedesigned to throw the student off and cause the student to lose session control or track of whatthe student is doing. The student’s job is to keep a session going in spite of anything, usingonly command, the repeat statement or the acknowledgement. The student may use his or herhands to prevent a “Blow” (leaving) of the coach. If the student does anything else than theabove, it is a flunk and the coach must say so.HISTORY: Developed by L.

Acknowledge it; and 3. Return preclear to session. If the coach feelsabruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he corrects the student intobetter handling.PATTER: All originations concern the coach, his ideas, reactions or difficulties, none concernthe auditor. Otherwise the patter is the same as in earlier TRs. The student’s patter is governedby: 1 . Clarifying and understanding the origin. 2. Acknowledging the origin. 3. Giving therepeat statement “I’ll repeat the auditing command,” and then giving it. Anything else is aflunk.The auditor must be taught to prevent ARC breaks and differentiate between a vital problem thatconcerns the pc and a mere effort to blow session. (TR 3 Revised.) Flunks are given if thestudent does more than 1. Understand; 2. Acknowledge; 3. Return pc to session.Coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on TR 3. Student’s failure to differentiatebetween these (by trying to handle them) and coach’s remarks about self as “pc” is a flunk.Student’s failure to persist is always a flunk in any TR but here more so. Coach should notalways read from list to originate, and not always look at student when about to comment. ByOriginate is meant a statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case. ByComment is meant a statement or remark aimed only at student or room. Originations arehandled, Comments are disregarded by the student.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to teach auditors to stayin session when preclear dives out. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditormore about handling origins and preventing ARC breaks.As TR 5 is also part of the CCHs it can be disregarded in the Comm Course TRs despite itsappearance on earlier lists for students and staff auditors.TRAINING NOTEIt is better to go through these TRs several times getting tougher each time than to hang on oneTR forever or to be so tough at start student goes into a decline.L.

The coach’s needle is dirty. The student’s out comm cycle has cut his comm insome way, but PRIOR to that the coach failed to flunk the part of the comm cyclethat went out. Correct flunking by coaches equals students with no dirty needles.2. If a coach’s TA starts climbing on a drill and the needle gets sticky, it means that thestudent’s comm cycle has dispersed him and pushed him out of PT. The coach iseither (1) not flunking at all (2) flunking the incorrect thing.3. The correct flunking by the coach of an out comm cycle, which has dispersed himand pushed his TA up, will always result in a TA blowdown. If there is noblowdown, the coach has flunked the wrong thing.4. Needle not responding well and sensitively on assessment drills, although theneedle clean. Coach has failed to flunk TR 1 (or TR0) for lack of impingement andreach.5. Coach reaching forward and leaning on the table, means TR 1 is out with thestudent.6. Student asking coach for considerations to get TA down, but TA climbing on theconsiderations—the coach is cleaning a clean, instead of flunking the out commcycle, which occurred earlier and pushed his TA up.7. Student getting coach’s considerations off to clean the needle, but needle remainingdirty—student is cutting the coach’s comm while getting the considerations off andthe coach is not picking this up.8. Students shouting or talking very loudly on assessment drills to try and get theMeter to read by overwhelm. The reason for this is invariably—”but I’m assessingthe bank!” They haven’t realized that banks don’t read, only thetans impinged uponby the bank—therefore the TR1 must be addressed to the thetan. The meterresponds proportionately to the amount of ARC in the Session.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH:emp.rdCopyright © 1965by L.

The unwise supervisor will actually furnish “extraordinary solution”after “extraordinary solution” “to handle this different case”. It may be John Jones who “cannotthink of any changes in his life” or it may be Mary Smith who “just doesn’t respond to SecurityChecking”. And the supervisor burns the midnight oil and gives the auditor some new involvedsolution. Then as often as not, the auditor comes back the day after and says, “That didn’twork either.” And the supervisor goes a quarter around the bend and again burns the midnightoil .... If this seems familiar to you as a supervisor, know you should have asked, “Whatdidn’t work?” Usually the auditor can’t even recall the solution—it was never used. Or it wasapplied in some strange fashion.For today, the reasons for failure all lie under the heading “Gross Auditing Error”.Such an error would be, the auditor never arrived for the session, the E-Meter wasbroken throughout, the pc hadn’t eaten or slept for three days, the din from construction nextdoor made it impossible to give commands or hear answers. The auditor didn’t run any knownprocess. That is the order of magnitude of a “GROSS AUDITING ERROR”. It is never, the pcwas unhappy, the pc has difficulty remembering, etc. In supervising auditing, always look forthe gross auditing error and never give out with an extra-ordinary solution.Well, taking my own advice, when I saw some tricky elements in new clearing processestaking far too much time, I didn’t look for “different” pcs, I looked for the gross auditing error.And found it.The auditors who were having trouble couldn’t read an E-Meter.Impossible as that may seem, it proved to be true. I put Mary Sue on this at once andHerbie Parkhouse carried through. The errors found in E-Meter reading where there had beentrouble, were so huge as to have been missed on any casual inspection.The errors went like this:1. The auditor believed the E-Meter could not be read while the needle was swingingaround. The auditor was waiting until it stopped every time before asking aquestion.2. The auditor believed the needle had to be exactly at “set” on the dial before it couldbe read.3. The auditor did not know a rising needle could be read by stopping the rise with a"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"question or making the needle twitch.4. The auditor had not done the body reaction drills in E-Meter Essentials and wasreading only body reactions and ignoring all others.5. The auditor thought an E-Meter could not be read if it showed breathing or heartbeat.6. The auditor always looked at the pc for a few seconds after asking the question,then looked at the meter, and so missed all but latent (non-significant) reads.7. The auditor sat staring at the meter for twenty seconds after the reading hadregistered.8. The auditor thought E-Meters could be fooled so easily, it was more reliable tomake up his own mind about what the pc’s item or guilt was.9. An auditor thought that if the needle rose on a rudiment question, the rudiment wasout.These and many, many more panned out to be:IF A SECURITY CHECK OR PROBLEMS INTENSIVE WAS PRODUCING NORESULTS, IT WAS BECAUSE THE AUDITOR COULD NOT READ AN E-METER.That’s the gross auditing error.In this bulletin, I am not trying to give you any methods to remedy this. I am just callingit widely to everyone’s attention.The fact is big enough to merit study by itself.And to get cases started by no other mechanism than learning to really read an E-Meter orby teaching people to read it.This one point remedied could change the entire future of Scientology, an organization oran auditor.

An instant read may be anychange of characteristic providing it occurs instantly. The absence of a read at the end of themajor thought shows it to be nul.All prior reads and latent reads are ignored. These are the result of minor thoughts whichmay or may not be restimulated by the question.Only the instant read is used by the auditor. Only the instant read is cleared on rudiments,What questions, etc.The instant read may consist of any needle reaction, rise, fall, speeded rise, speeded fall,double tick (dirty needle), theta bop or any other action so long as it occurs at the exact end ofthe major thought being expressed by the auditor. If no reaction occurs at exactly that place (theend of the major thought) the question is nul.By “major thought” is meant the complete thought being expressed in words by theauditor. Reads which occur prior to the completion of the major thought are “prior reads”.Reads which occur later than its completion are “latent reads”.By “minor thought” is meant subsidiary thoughts expressed by words within the majorthought. They are caused by the reactivity of individual words within the full words. They areignored.Example: “Have you ever injured dirty pigs?”To the pc the words “you”, “injured” and “dirty” are all reactive. Therefore, the minorthoughts expressed by these words also read on the meter.The major thought here is the whole sentence. Within this thought are the minor thoughts“you”, “injured” and “dirty”.Therefore the E-Meter needle may respond this way: “Have you (fall) ever injured(speeded fall) dirty (fall) pigs (fall)?”Only the major thought gives the instant read and only the last fall (bold-italic type in thesentence above) indicates anything. If that last reaction was absent, the whole sentence is nuldespite the prior falls.You can release the reactions (but ordinarily would not) on each of these minor thoughts.Exploring these prior reads is called “compartmenting the question”.Paying attention to minor thought reads gives us laughable situations as in the case,written in 1960, of “getting P.D.H.ed by the cat”. By accepting these prior reads one can prove"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"anything. Why? Because Pain and Drug and Hypnosis are minor thoughts within the majorthought: “Have you ever been P.D.H.ed by a cat?” The inexpert auditor would believe such asilly thing had happened. But notice that if each minor thought is cleaned out of the majorthought it no longer reacts as a whole fact. If the person on the meter had been P.D.H.ed by acat, then only the discovery of the origin of the whole thought would clean up the wholethought.Pcs also think about other things while being asked questions and these random personalrestimulations also read before and after an instant read and are ignored. Very rarely, a pc’sthinks react exactly at the end of a major thought and so confuse the issue, but this is rare.We want the read that occurs instantly after the last syllable of the major thought withoutlag. That is the only read we regard in finding a rudiment in or out, to find if a goal reacts, etc.That is what is called an “instant read”.There is a package rudiment question in the half truth, etc. We are doing four rudimentsin one and therefore have four major thoughts in one sentence. This packaging is the onlyapparent exception but is actually no exception. It’s just a fast way of doing four rudiments inone sentence.A clumsy question which puts “in this session” at the end of the major thought can servethe auditor badly. Such modifiers should come before the sentence, “In this session have you........?”You are giving the major thought directly to the reactive mind. Therefore any analyticalthought will not react instantly.The reactive mind is composed of:1. Timelessness.2. Unknownness.3. Survival.The meter reacts on the reactive mind, never on the analytical mind. The meter reactsinstantly on any thought restimulated in the reactive mind.If the meter reacts on anything, that datum is partly or wholly unknown to the preclear.An auditor’s questions restimulate the reactive mind. This reacts on the meter.Only reactive thoughts react instantly.You can “groove in” a major thought by saying it twice. On the second time (or third timeif it is longer) you will see only the instant read at the exact end. If you do this the prior readsdrop out leaving only the whole thought.If you go stumbling around in rudiments or goals trying to clean up the minor thoughtsyou will get lost. In sec checking you can uncover material by “compartmenting the question”but this is rarely done today. In rudiments, What questions, et al, you want the instant readonly. It occurs exactly at the end of the whole thought. This is your whole interest in cleaning arudiment or a What question. You ignore all prior and latent reactions of the needle.The exceptions to this rule are:1. “Compartmenting the question”, in which you use the prior reads occurring at theexact end of the minor thoughts (as above in the pigs sentence) to dig up different data not"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"related to the whole thought.2. “Steering the pc” is the only use of latent or random reads. You see a read the sameas the instant read occurring again when you are not speaking but after you have found a wholethought reacting. You say “there” or “that” and the pc, seeing what he or she is looking at asyou say it, recovers the knowledge from the reactive bank and gives the data and the wholethought clears or has to be further worked and cleared.You can easily figure-figure yourself half to death trying to grapple with meter readsunless you get a good reality on the instant read which occurs at the end of the whole expressedthought and neglect all prior and latent reads except for steering the pc while he gropes for theanswer to the question you asked.That’s the whole of reading an E-Meter needle.(Two Saint Hill lectures of 24 May 1962 cover this in full.)L.

This is not a prior read. Preclears poorly in session, being handled byauditors with indifferent TR One, anticipate the instant read reactively as they are under theirown control. Such a read occurs into the body of the last meaningful word in the question. Itnever occurs latent.In other words all reads occurring when the major thought has been received by thepreclear must be taken up and cleaned. This does not mean all needle reactions occurring whilequestion is being asked must be cleaned, but it does mean that the instant read is often to befound before the last meaningful word is spoken fully, and it is catastrophic not to take it upand clean it.Goals and items are however read only when the read occurs exactly at the end of the lastword.This will give you cleaner sessions and smoother needles.

Usually the decimalsystem is used. But fractions can also be employed. Needle falls are neglected in thecomputation, only actual motion of the Tone Arm is used.One can add up or approximate the TOTAL DOWN TONE ARM MOTION. After asession, if an auditor is keeping good reports of TA motion, one adds up all the divisions andfractions of division of Down Motion (not up) and the result is known as TOTAL TA FORTHE SESSION.A needle gives about a 10th of a Division of motion in one sweep across the dial but, asabove, is not used in his computation. Needle action is neglected in the add-up.Example: As noted in the TA column of an auditor’s report, 4.5, 4.2, 4.8, 4.0, 3.5 givesyou .3 + .8 + .5 gives you 1.6 Divisions of TA action for that period of time.

A case analysis will locate the by-passed charge. On any auditingwhere charge has been by-passed but TA action was good the pc’s subjective reality on gainwill not seem to compare with the TA action gotten in the auditing, but the moment the by-passed charge is located the gain attributable to TA action will be felt.

As a Clear’s postulates read as a surge, usually fairly long (over 1”), “No” can readif the pc says it to himself as an answer to a question asked.A read, therefore, does not mean invariably “yes” or that the question is charged. All itmeans is that the Meter has read.The Auditor must now find out what the read was before determining he should dosomething about that portion of the Green Form or List. One doesn’t just assume the read was“yes”.One asks about the read as a general rule, not assuming at once the thing asked wascharged.Example—Auditor: “Do you have a missed withhold?” Meter surges.Auditor: “What was that?”Pre OT: “I thought No I don’t.”Auditor: “Ok. Do you have a missed withhold?”Pre OT: “No.”—Meter didn’t read.Auditor: “Anything suppressed—asserted—protested—invalidated. Ok that’sclean.”Ticks (1/8 inch) often mean something is there. A Pre OT’s postulates have greater lengthwhen they surge.It is not important how you handle this phenomena of postulate or to-oneself comment bya high level case. It is important that the Auditor does not hang the case with a wrongadjudication of what’s wrong by thinking every surge means “yes”, or that the question ischarged because it surges. A question is charged only if it won’t clean up with buttons until theaction itself is taken.A Pre OT, unlike pcs below Grades I or II, usually recognizes what is wrong as soon asit is mentioned.

When technique and case analysis seem tofail “even when done by the book” the fault commonly lies in Basic Auditing. One or more ofthe five faults elsewhere listed will be present and these faults effectively prevent any techniqueor case analysis from working.Where Scientology “isn’t working”, the wrong first places to look are technique and caseanalysis. The right place to look is Basic Auditing.Until an auditor can handle a pc in session easily, handle a meter smoothly and accuratelyand is flawless in his auditing cycle, he or she should have no hope of making any techniquework or of analyzing any case for anything.In smooth Basic Auditing lies the open sesame to all cases, for only then do techniqueand case analysis function. The gun barrel is Basic Auditing. Technique and Case Analysisform the Ammunition and sight. A poor basic auditor using a fine technique is firingammunition with no gun. It doesn’t go anywhere.There is a level of Basic Auditing for every level of Scientology. At the lowest level it isonly the ability to sit and listen. It grows in complexity from there up to the fabulous co-ordination of pc, auditing cycle and meter so flawless that neither auditor nor pc are aware ofthe presence of Basic Auditing at all, but only the actions of the technique and the guidance ofcase analysis. And between those two practices of Basic Auditing lie many gradients.Basic Auditing is the rock on which all gains are built.TECHNIQUEThe techniques of Scientology are many, spread out over 13 years of development."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"A technique is a process or some action that is done by auditor and pc under the auditor’sdirection.The lowest technique is the single co-audit question given by the supervisor to let the pcItsa. The highest is the complex listing of goals and GPMs.A technique is a patterned action, invariable and unchanging, composed of certain stepsor actions calculated to bring about tone arm action and thus better or free a thetan.There have been thousands of techniques. Less than a hundred, at a guess, are incommon recommended use for the various levels of auditing.Techniques have their place in various levels of auditing today rather than variousdifferences of case.As cases may be audited only at the level in which they are trained, by modern ruling, andas several techniques exist at each level for choice out of Case Analysis, it will be found quitesimple to select a technique and get results with it. Safe auditing and good sense dictate suchselection and classing of techniques, and trouble only results when someone sells himself outof his level to a high fast flounder.Techniques exist in tables and texts for the various levels and it will be found that thesegive the best case results applied in that way.CASE ANALYSISCase Analysis establishes two things (a) What is going on with the case and (b) Whatshould be done with it.Case Analysis is a new subject to auditors at this time. It is commonly confused withtechniques and the gravest fault is treating Case Analysis as only another assessment technique.There is a level of Case Analysis for every level or class, to compare with the BasicAuditing and Technique of that class.My first development in this new segment of processing was Programming. This is theconsecutive techniques or actions a case should have to get adequate Tone Arm action andachieve a new plateau of ability.But Case Analysis itself has steps like (a) and (b) above.There is also an invariable sequence of application in a more advanced Case Analysis.These steps should be very, very well known by a trained auditor since all Case Analysis fitsinto them:1. Discover what the pc is “sitting in”.2. Have the pc detail what assumptions and considerations he or she has had about it;and3. Identify it fully and correctly.The “it” above can be as slight as a worry, as bothersome as a Present Time Problem oras overwhelming as a Goals Problem Mass. Whatever “it” is the Case Analysis steps would bethe same.In the first step the survey may be very brief. It should certainly have certainty in it for the"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"pc. It can be very general. It can be a part of a case or a geographical location. The pc could beclear or insane. The sequence or the 3 steps would be the same.The next step (2) gets the lies off, giving TA action and thus clearing away charge for amore accurate assault in (3). This second step can be very lengthy as in Level Two or very briefas in OT auditing techniques. But it must exist whether short or long. Otherwise the analysis isheavily hindered by the lies and these will read on the meter and upset the analysis or they willcloud the pc’s perception on which all Itsa depends. So the lies must come off in any CaseAnalysis. Usually this is quite permissive and gently done. But it can amount to also pullingmissed withholds. It all depends on the level on which the analysis is being done and what isbeing analyzed. This step (2) becomes itself a technique at lower levels. It is just a spatter andpromise at high level auditing.The third step can be long or short but must always be there. Here, with the charge gonein (2), the auditor and pc can now identify the thing much better and the pc can have a finalcertainty on it. Usually at lower levels, the certainty is only that it is gone. The familiar “Howdo you feel about that problem now?” “What problem?” is a lower level result of CaseAnalysis. At the highest level, “On checking the meter, I find that is a wrong Item” would bethe auditor’s final (3) statement.So Case Analysis at any level has as its action establishing what the pc is in, what it hasbeen supposed to be and what it now is (or isn’t).Anything from a habit to a headache could be analyzed in this way. At the lowest levels itcould occupy an intensive, at the highest levels five minutes.ARC Break handling has been the most familiar tool of Case Analysis.Case Analysis handles the momentary or prolonged problem, determines the technique tobe used, and is always done with Basic Auditing.An auditor has three hats. One is his Basic Auditor’s hat. This he never takes off. Theother two are his Technique hat and his Case Analysis hat and these he switches back and forthat need.These are the three segments. Put together well, they make successful auditing.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH :dr.rdCopyright © 1963by L.

Here theyare given names and assigned to Levels so that they can be taught moreeasily and so that general auditing can be improved.(Note 2: These have not been written before because I had notdetermined the results vital to each Level.)There is a Style of auditing for each class. By Style is meant a method or custom ofperforming actions.A Style is not really determined by the process being run so much. A Style is how theauditor addresses his task.Different processes carry different style requirements perhaps, but that is not the point.Clay Table Healing at Level III can be run with Level I style and still have some gains. But anauditor trained up to the style required at Level III would do a better job not only of CT Healingbut of any repetitive process.Style is how the auditor audits. The real expert can do them all, but only after he can doeach one. Style is a mark of Class. It is not individual. In our meaning, it is a distinct way tohandle the tools of auditing.LEVEL ZEROLISTEN STYLEAt Level 0 the Style is Listen Style Auditing. Here the auditor is expected to listen to thepc. The only skill necessary is listening to another. As soon as it is ascertained that the auditoris listening (not just confronting or ignoring) the auditor can be checked out. The length of timean auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be a factor. What the pc does isnot a factor considered in judging this style. Pcs, however, talk to an auditor who is reallylistening.Here we have the highest point that old-time mental therapies reached (when they didreach it), such as psychoanalysis, when they helped anyone. Mostly they were well below this,evaluating, invalidating, interrupting. These three things are what the instructor in this styleshould try to put across to the HAS student.Listen Style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this:Listen to the pc without evaluating, invalidating or interrupting.Adding on higher skills like “Is the pc talking interestingly?” or even “Is the pc talking?”is no part of this style. When this auditor gets in trouble and the pc won’t talk or isn’tinterested, a higher classed auditor is called in, a new question given by the supervisor, etc.It really isn’t “Itsa” to be very technical. Itsa is the action of the pc saying, “It’s a this” or“It’s a that.” Getting the pc to Itsa is quite beyond Listen Style auditors where the pc won’t. It’sthe supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to Itsa."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The ability to listen, learned well, stays with the auditor up through the grades. Onedoesn’t cease to use it even at Level VI. But one has to learn it somewhere and that’s at LevelZero. So Listen Style Auditing is just listening. It thereafter adds into the other styles.LEVEL ONEMUZZLED AUDITINGThis could also be called rote style auditing.Muzzled Auditing has been with us many years. It is the stark total of TRs 0 to 4 and notanything else added.It is called so because auditors too often added in comments, Qed and Aed, deviated,discussed and otherwise messed up a session. Muzzle meant a “muzzle was put on them”,figuratively speaking, so they would only state the auditing command and ack.Repetitive Command Auditing, using TRs 0 to 4, at Level One is done completelymuzzled.This could be called Muzzled Repetitive Auditing Style but will be called “Muzzled Style”for the sake of brevity.It has been a matter of long experience that pcs who didn’t make gains with the partiallytrained auditor permitted to two-way comm, did make gains the instant the auditor wasmuzzled: to wit, not permitted to do a thing but run the process, permitted to say nothing butthe commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgmentwithout any other question or comment.At Level One we don’t expect the auditor to do anything but state the command (or ask thequestion) with no variation, acknowledge the pc’s answer and handle the pc origins byunderstanding and acknowledging what the pc said.Those processes used at Level One actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst tomisguided efforts to “Two-Way Comm”.Listen Style combines with Muzzled Style easily. But watch out that Level One sessionsdon’t disintegrate to Level Zero.Crisp, clean repetitive commands, muzzled, given and answered often, are the road out—not pc wanderings.A pc at this Level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him, exactly what the auditorwill do. The pc is even put through a few “do birds fly?” cycles until the pc gets the idea. Thenthe processing works.An auditor trying to do Muzzled Repetitive Auditing on a pc who, through past “therapyexperience”, is rambling on and on is a sad sight. It means that control is out (or that the pcnever got above Level Zero).It’s the number of commands given and answered in a unit of auditing time that gets gains.To that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have a release in short order, usingthe processes of this Level.To follow limp Listen Style with crisp, controlled Muzzled Style may be a shock. But theyare each the lowest of the two families of auditing styles—Totally Permissive and TotallyControlled. And they are so different each is easy to learn with no confusion. It’s been the lackof difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about. Well, these two are"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"different enough—Listen Style and Muzzled Style—to set anybody straight.LEVEL TWOGUIDING STYLE AUDITINGAn old-time auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names: (a) Two-Way Comm and (b) Formal Auditing.We condense these two old styles under one new name: Guiding Style Auditing.One first guides the pc by “two-way comm” into some subject that has to be handled orinto revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitivecommands.Guiding Style Auditing becomes feasible only when a student can do Listen Style andMuzzled Style Auditing well.Formerly the student who couldn’t confront or duplicate a command took refuge insloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or “Two-Way Comm”.The first thing to know about Guiding Style is that one lets the pc talk and Itsa withoutchop, but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitivecommands.We presuppose the auditor at this Level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy theviewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc. We also presuppose at thisLevel that the auditor, being able to occupy a viewpoint, is therefore more self-determined, thetwo things being related. (One can only be self-determined when one can observe the actualsituation before one: otherwise a being is delusion-determined or other-determined.)Thus in Guiding Style Auditing, the auditor is there to find out what’s what from the pcand then apply the needful remedy.Most of the processes in the Book of Remedies are included in this Level (II). To usethose, one has to observe the pc, discover what the pc is doing, and remedy the pc’s caseaccordingly.The result for the pc is a far-reaching re-orientation in Life.Thus the essentials of Guiding Style Auditing consist of Two-Way Comm that steers thepc into revealing a difficulty followed by a repetitive process to handle what has been revealed.One does expert TRs but one may discuss things with the pc, let the pc talk and in generalone audits the pc before one, establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisprepetitive auditing, but all the while alert to changes in the pc.One runs at this Level against Tone Arm Action, paying little or no heed to the needleexcept as a centering device for TA position. One even establishes what’s to be done by theaction of the Tone Arm. (The process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fellwhen he was running what’s being run, now belongs at this Level (II) and will be re-numberedaccordingly.)At II one expects to handle a lot of chronic PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks with Life (but notsession ARC Breaks, that being a needle action, session ARC Breaks being sorted out by ahigher classed auditor if they occur).To get such things done (PTPs, overts and other remedies) in the session the auditor must"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"have a pc “willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties”. That presupposes we have anauditor at this Level who can ask questions, not repetitive, that guide the pc into talking aboutthe difficulty that needs to be handled.Great command of TR 4 is the primary difference in TRs from Level I. One understands,when one doesn’t, by asking more questions, and by really acknowledging only when one hasreally understood it.Guided comm is the clue to control at this Level. One should easily guide the pc’s commin and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time. As soon as an auditorgets the idea of finite result or, that is to say, a specific and definite result expected, all this iseasy. Pc has a PTP. Example: Auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimulate thePTP so pc is not bothered about it (and isn’t being driven to do something about it) as the finiteresult.The auditor at II is trained to audit the pc before him, get the pc into comm, guide the pctoward data needful to choose a process and then to run the process necessary to resolve thatthing found, usually by repetitive command and always by TA.The Book of Remedies is the key to this Level and this auditing style.One listens but only to what one has guided the pc into. One runs repetitive commandswith good TR 4. And one may search around for quite a while before one is satisfied he has theanswer from the pc needful to resolve a certain aspect of the pc’s case.O/W can be run at Level I. But at Level II one may guide the pc into divulging what thepc considers a real overt act and, having that, then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasn’tan overt and so eventually blow it.Half-acknowledgment is also taught at Level II—the ways of keeping a pc talking bygiving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone TR 2.Big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going offthe subject.LEVEL IIIABRIDGED STYLE AUDITINGBy Abridged is meant “abbreviated”, shorn of extras. Any not actually needful auditingcommand is deleted.For instance, at Level I the auditor always says, when the pc wanders off the subject, “Iwill repeat the auditing command” and does so. In Abridged Style the auditor omits this when itisn’t necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it.In this style we have shifted from pure rote to a sensible use or omission as needful. Westill use repetitive commands expertly, but we don’t use rote that is unnecessary to thesituation.Two-Way Comm comes into its own at Level III. But with heavy use of repetitivecommands.At this Level we have as the primary process, Clay Table Healing. In this an auditor mustmake sure the commands are followed exactly. No auditing command is ever let go of until thatactual command is answered by the pc.But at the same time, one doesn’t necessarily give every auditing command the processhas in its rundown."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"In Clay Table Healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time. This isdone more often by observation than command. Yet it is done.We suppose at III that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe.Thus we see the pc is satisfied and don’t mention it. Thus we see when the pc is not certain andso we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question.On the other hand, one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and getsthem executed.Prepchecking and needle usage is taught at Level III as well as Clay Table Healing.Auditing by List is also taught. In Abridged Style Auditing one may find the pc (being cleanedup on a list question) giving half a dozen answers in a rush. One doesn’t stop the pc fromdoing so, one half acknowledges, and lets the pc go on. One is in actual fact handling a biggerauditing comm cycle, that is all. The question elicits more than one answer which is really onlyone answer. And when that answer is given, it is acknowledged.One sees when a needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate allthe pc’s relief. And one sees it isn’t clean by the continued puzzle on the pc’s face.There are tricks involved here. One asks a question of the pc with the key word in it andnotes that the needle doesn’t tremble, and so concludes the question about the word is flat. Andso doesn’t check it again. Example: “Has anything else been suppressed?” One eye on pc, oneon needle, needle didn’t quiver. Pc looks noncommittal. Auditor says, “All right, on “ andgoes on to next question, eliminating a pc’s possible protest read that can be mistaken foranother “suppress”.In Abridged Style Auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it impedescase advance. But that doesn’t mean one wanders about. One is even more crisp and thoroughwith Abridged Style Auditing than in rote.One is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected result.By “Abridged” is meant getting the exact job done—the shortest way between twopoints—with no waste questions.By now the student should know that he runs a process to achieve an exact result and hegets the process run in a way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time.The student is taught to guide rapidly, to have no time for wide excursions.The processes at this Level are all rat-a-tat-tat processes—CT Healing, Prepchecking,Auditing by List.Again it’s the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time thatmakes for speed of result.LEVEL IVDIRECT STYLE AUDITINGBy direct we mean straight, concentrated, intense, applied in a direct manner.We do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide. We mean it isdirect.By direct, we don’t mean frank or choppy. On the contrary, we put the pc’s attention onhis bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"It could also mean that we are not auditing by vias. We are auditing straight at the thingsthat need to be reached to make somebody clear.Other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed.At Level IV we have Clay Table Clearing and we have Assessment type processes.These two types of process are both astonishingly direct. They are aimed directly at theReactive Mind. They are done in a direct manner.In CT Clearing we have almost total work and Itsa from pcs. From one end of a sessionto another, we may have only a few auditing commands. For a pc on CT Clearing does almostall the work if he is in session at all.Thus we have another implication in the word “direct”. The pc is talking directly to theauditor about what he is making and why in CT Clearing. The auditor hardly ever talks at all.In assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pc’s bank and wants no pc in front of itthinking, speculating, maundering or Itsaing. Thus this assessment is a very direct action.All this requires easy, smooth, steel-hand-in-a-velvet-glove control of the pc. It lookseasy and relaxed as a style, it is straight as a Toledo blade.The trick is to be direct in what’s wanted and not deviate. The auditor settles what’s to bedone, gives the command and then the pc may work for a long time, the auditor alert, attentive,completely relaxed.In assessment the auditor often pays no attention to the pc at all, as in ARC Breaks orassessing lists. Indeed, a pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of a list.And in CT Clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at a stretch.The tests are: Can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without ARC Breakingthe pc? Can the auditor order the pc to do something and then, the pc working on it, can theauditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour, understanding everything and interrupt alertlyonly when he doesn’t understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him? Again without ARCBreaking the pc.You could confuse this Direct Style with Listen Style if you merely glanced at a sessionof CT Clearing. But what a difference. In Listen Style the pc is blundering on and on and on.In Direct Style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to Itsa, let us say, with no claywork and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay, you’d see theauditor, quick as a foil, look at the pc, very interestedly and say, “Let’s see that in Clay.” Orthe pc doesn’t really give an ability he wants to improve and you’d hear a quiet persuasiveauditor voice, “Are you quite certain you want to improve that? Sounds like a goal to me. Justsomething, some ability you know, you’d like to improve.”You could call this style One-Way Auditing. When the pc is given his orders, after thatit’s all from the pc to the auditor, and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruction.When the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc. Only when the assessmentaction hits a snag like a PTP is there any other auditing style used.This is a very extreme auditing style. It is straightforward—direct.But when needful, as in any Level, the styles learned below it are often also employed,but never in the actual actions of getting CT Clearing and Assessment done.(Note: Level V would be the same style as VI below.)"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"LEVEL VIALL STYLESo far, we have dealt with simple actions.Now we have an auditor handling a meter and a pc who Itsa’s and Cognites and getsPTPs and ARC Breaks and Line Charges and Cognites and who finds Items and lists and whomust be handled, handled, handled all the way.As auditing TA for a 2l/2 hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions (compared to 10 or15 for the lowest level), the pace of the session is greater. It is this pace that makes perfectability at each lower level vital when they combine into All Style. For each is now faster.So, we learn All Style by learning each of the lower styles well, and then observe andapply the style needed every time it is needed, shifting styles as often as once every minute!The best way to learn All Style is to become expert at each lower style so that one doesthe style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs.It is less rough than it looks. But it is also very demanding.Use the wrong style on a situation and you’ve had it. ARC Break! No progress!Example: Right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty. The auditor can’tcontinue—or shouldn’t. The auditor, in Direct Style, looks up to see a-puzzled frown. Theauditor has to shift to Guiding Style to find out what ails the pc (who probably doesn’t reallyknow), then to Listen Style while the pc cognites on a chronic PTP that just emerged andbothered the pc, then to Direct Style to finish the Assessment that was in progress.The only way an auditor can get confused by All Style is by not being good at one of thelower level styles.Careful inspection will show where the student using All Style is slipping. One then getsthe student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it a bit.So All Style, when poorly done, is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one ormore of the lower level styles. And as all these can be independently taught, the whole can beco-ordinated. All Style is hard to do only when one hasn’t mastered one of the lower levelstyles.SUMMARYThese are the important Styles of Auditing. There have been others but they are onlyvariations of those given in this HCO Bulletin. Tone 40 Style is the most notable one missing.It remains as a practice style at Level One to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to gethis command obeyed. It is no longer used in practice.As it was necessary to have every result and every process for each Level to finalizeStyles of Auditing, I left this until last and here it is.Please note that none of these Styles violate the auditing comm cycle or the TRs.LRH :jw.rd L.

Only change—[page 79] word “arrived” corrected to “aimed”.Correction in this type style.)C/S Series 6WHAT THE C/S IS DOINGIn Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health considerable stress is placed on thewords and phrases in engrams. This is still functional. However as I did further research Ifound that (a) many pcs were unable to get the words in the engram and (b) the apparent forceof the words was derived wholly from the pain, emotion, effort contained in the engram. InStandard Dianetics the words in an engram play no major role in the auditing.The use of the words to de-aberrate and concentration on phrases in engrams is valid butjunior in force to the pain, misemotion, etc in the engram. Thus if you run out the force thewords drop into insignificance. This is often how the pc gets cognitions: the words andmeaning concealed in the engram are changing value and devaluating. The pc can then thinkclearly again on a subject previously pinned down by the force. Get the force out and the wordstake care of themselves and need no special handling.The meaning of things plays a secondary role in processing to forces.Thetans find counter-forces objectionable. Almost all chronic (continual) somatics havetheir root in force of one kind or another.In that the handling of things with bodies involves force to greater or lesser degree,incapability and derangement of mental values is proportional to the thetan’s objection to force.This objection descends down to a wish to stop things. It goes below that intooverwhelmedness in which propitiation and obsessive agreement manifest themselves.LOW TAsThe low TA is a symptom of an overwhelmed being.When a pc’s TA goes low he is being overwhelmed by too heavy a process, too steep agradient in applying processes or by rough TRs or invalidative auditing or auditing errors.A low TA means that the thetan has gone past a desire to stop things and is likely tobehave in life as though unable to resist real or imaginary forces.HIGH TAChronically high TAs mean the person can still stop things and is trying to do so.However, all one has to do is restimulate and leave unflat an engram chain to have a highTA. High TA is reflecting the force contained in the chain.An “over-run” means doing something too long that has engrams connected with it which"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"means an engram chain with too many engrams on it being restimulated by life or auditing.Hence Over-run.If this overrun persisted unhandled eventually the pc would be overwhelmed and one, intheory, would have a low TA.MENTAL MASSESMental masses, forces, energy are the items being handled by the C/S on any pc.If the C/S loses sight of this he can wander off the road and go into the thickets ofsignificance.Engrams, secondaries, locks all add up to mental masses, forces, energies, time, whichexpress themselves in countless different ways such as pain, misemotion, feelings, oldperceptions and a billion billion thought combinations buried in the masses as significances.A thetan can postulate or say or reason anything. Thus there is an infinity ofsignificances.A thetan is natively capable of logical thought. This becomes muddied by out-points heldin by mental forces such as pictures of heavy experiences.As the masses and forces accumulated and copied from living build up, the logic potentialbecomes reduced and illogical results occur.PC SEARCHThe pc is continually searching for the significance of a mass or force—what is it, why isit.The C/S is easily led astray by this.All forces in the bank contain significances.All forces can be unburdened and lightened up by the various procedures of auditing.The search of the pc is for significance.The action of the C/S is reduction of forces.THE E-METERThe E-Meter records what force is being discharged in every slash, fall and blowdown.The amount of TA per session is the C/S’s index of gain.Note that a discharged process no longer gives TA and gives case gain.The amount of significance recovered or realized by the pc only shows up as cognitions.As the TA works off the case, then one has two indicators:1. There is needle and TA action.2. The pc cognites."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"One shows that force is coming off. Two shows that thought is releasing from force.BACKWARDS C/SingIf a C/S processes toward significance only he will get cases that do not progress.The needle action detects not so much significance as where the force is.Diving toward significance the C/S winds up shortening grades, looking for “magic one-shot buttons” and overwhelming cases by shooting them on up the grades while levels remainloaded with force.RELIABLE INDICATORSWhen a pc gets no more TA action on Level I he will have made Level I and will know it.He will therefore attest to “No problems”.The reliable indicators are TA action and cognitions while a level is still charged.Diminished TA action and cognitions mean the purpose of the level has been reached.A feeling of freedom and expansion on a subject is expressed in a normal TA and a looseneedle.The pc will now attest to an ability regained.F/N ABUSETo process only to F/N and even chop off the cognitions on a process abuses theindicator of the F/N.You can find many pcs who bitterly resent F/N indications. They have been:A. Not run on all the processes of a level;B. Still have force on the subject;C. Were chopped off before they could cognite.The ARC Break in this is UNFINISHED CYCLE OF ACTION.The proper End Phenomena for a process is F/N Cognition VGIs. Now look at thatcarefully. That is the proper end phenomena of a PROCESS. It is not the end phenomena of aLEVEL or even of a TYPE of process.Let us say there are 15 possible Scientology processes for orienting a pc in his presentlocation.To run one of these 15 and say, “F/N that’s it. You’re complete,” is a Quickie impatientaction that rebounds on the pc eventually. If there are 15, run 15 !Possibly the pc on no. 12 will cognite he’s really right where he is. Only then could youcease to work at it.An F/N Cog VGIs tells you a process is finished, not a whole class of actions!"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Thus 21/2 minutes from 0 to IV is not only impossible, it is murderous. It will result in anoverwhelm, a low TA or a high TA eventually.Level I says, amongst other things, “Problems Processes”. There are certainly half adozen. Each would be run to F/N Cog VGIs. When these and the other processes of the Levelare run, the pc will come to have no further reaction to problems and will be able to handlethem.A cognition in lower levels is not necessarily an ability regained. Thirty or fortycognitions on one lower level might add up to (and probably would) the realization that one isfree of the whole subject of the level.It is safe to run more processes. It is unsafe to run too few.PC ABILITIESIt is not enough for the pc to have only negative gains of deleting force. Sooner or later hewill have to begin to confront force.This comes along naturally and is sometimes aided by processes directly aimed at furtherconfront. “What problem could you have?” sooner or later is needed in one form or another.What force can the pc now handle?All auditing in a body—and any living in a body—makes a being vulnerable. Bodiesbreak, suffer, intensify pain.Sooner or later a pc will go Exterior. The Interiorization Rundown must be ordered as thenext action or you will have a pc with a high TA. 2-way comm Ext-Int must be given in afollowing session (not the same one) so the full cognitions will occur.After this the pc is less subject to the body and his ability to confront force will improve.Do not be too worried or surprised if after this the pc has some minor accident with thebody. Exterior he forgets its frailty. However, such things are minor. He is “learning how towalk” a new way and will run into chairs! He gets this figured out after a while.Pcs sometimes improve their ability to handle force while interior so as to havemysterious headaches or new body pressures. Inevitably they have been exterior and needInteriorization run. They were just using too much force while still inside !Thus force is the thing, significance very secondary.Force of course is made up of time, matter, energy, flows, particles, masses, solids,liquids, gasses, space and locations. All this gets inherently handled in processes publishedlong since.The pc tends to dive for the thought imbedded in the force. He will tell you he’s beingprocessed to find out who his parents were or why he is sterile or who did him in, etc, etc. TheC/S who chases after this is a deerhound illegally chasing mice!C/S PURPOSEThe C/S is there to make certain that the pc makes gains and attains the actual abilities ofthe level."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The C/S is for the pc.C/S auditor control exists only to keep the auditing standard, the TRs good, the processesordered done and to End Phenomena each one.No other reasons for C/Sing exist.

The needle of course isfalling to the right.That is a period of charge blowing off the bank. It is accompanied by realizations for thepc. Sometimes the pc does not voice them aloud. They nevertheless happen.If the auditor speaks or moves beyond adjusting the TA quietly with his thumb the pcmay suppress the cognitions and stop the blowdown.To see if a needle floats the TA must be halted for the moment between 2 and 3 on acalibrated meter. A floating needle cannot be observed during a blowdown.For an auditor to sit up suddenly and look surprised or pleased, or for an auditor to saythe next command or “That’s It” during a blowdown, can jolly well wreck a pc’s case. So it’s areal goof to do so.To get auditing results one must audit with a good comm cycle, accept the pc’s answers,handle the pc’s originations, be unobtrusive with his auditing actions, not hold the pc up whilehe writes, not develop tricks like waiting for the pc to look at him before giving the nextcommand, not prematurely ack and so start compulsive Itsa, and be very quiet during and justafter a blowdown.LRH:ml.cden L.

It shows in Dianetics that basic on that chain and flow has beenerased, and in Scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run. A new flowor a new process can be embarked upon, of course, when the END PHENOMENA of theprevious process is attained.DIANETICSFloating needles are only ONE FOURTH OF THE END PHENOMENA in all Dianeticauditing.Any Dianetic auditing below Power has FOUR DEFINITE REACTIONS IN THE PCWHICH SHOW THE PROCESS IS ENDED.1. Floating needle.2. Cognition.3. Very good indicators (pc happy).4. Erasure of the final picture audited.Auditors get panicky about overrun. If you go past the End Phenomena the F/N will packup (cease) and the TA will rise.BUT that’s if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena, not past a floating needle.If you watch a needle with care and say nothing but your R3R commands, as it begins tofloat you will find:1. It starts to float narrowly.2. The pc cognites (What do you know—so that’s . . .) and the float widens."},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"3. Very good indicators come in. And the float gets almost full dial, and4. The picture, if you inquired, has erased and the needle goes full dial.That is the full End Phenomena of Dianetics.If the auditor sees a float start, as in 1, and says, “I would like to indicate to you yourneedle is floating,” he can upset the pc’s bank.There is still charge. The pc has not been permitted to cognite. VGIs surely won’t appearand a piece of the picture is left.By being impetuous and fearful of overrun, or just being in a hurry, the auditor’spremature (too soon) indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pc’s end phenomena.SCIENTOLOGYAll this also applies to Scientology auditing.And all Scientology processes below Power have the same end phenomena.The 0 to IV Scientology End Phenomena are:A. Floating needle.B. Cognition.C. Very good indicators.D. Release.The pc goes through these four steps without fail IF PERMITTED TO DO SO.As Scientology auditing is more delicate than Dianetic auditing, an overrun (F/N vanishedand TA rising, requiring “rehab”) can occur more rapidly. Thus the auditor has to be morealert. But this is no excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena.The same cycle of F/N will occur if the pc is given a chance. On A you get a beginningF/N, on B slightly wider, on C wider still and on D the needle really is floating and widely.“I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating” can be a chop. Also it’s a falsereport if it isn’t widely floating and will keep floating.Pcs who leave session F/N and arrive at Examiner without F/N, or who eventually do notcome to session with an F/N have been misaudited. The least visible way is the F/N chop, asdescribed in this session. The most obvious way is to overrun the process. (Running a pc afterhe has exteriorized will also give a high TA at Examiner.)In Dianetics, one more pass through is often required to get 1, 2, 3, 4 End Phenomenaabove.I know it said in the Auditor’s Code not to by-pass an F/N. Perhaps it should be changedto read “A real wide F/N”. Here it’s a question of how wide is an F/N? However, the problemis NOT difficult.I follow this rule—I never jolt or interrupt a pc who is still looking inward. In otherwords, I don’t ever yank his attention over to the auditor. After all, it’s his case we are"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"handling, not my actions as an auditor.When I see an F/N begin I listen for the pc’s cognition. If it isn’t there, I give the nextcommand due. If it still isn’t there, I give the 2nd command, etc. Then I get the cognition andshut up. The needle floats more widely, VGIs come in, the F/N goes dial wide. The real skill isinvolved in knowing when to say nothing more.Then with the pc all bright, all end phenomena in sight (F/N, Cog, VGIs, Erasure orRelease, depending on whether it’s Dn or Scn), I say, as though agreeing with the pc, “Yourneedle is floating.”DIANETIC ODDITYDid you know that you could go through a picture half a dozen times, the F/N gettingwider and wider without the pc cogniting? This is rare but it can happen once in a hundred. Thepicture hasn’t been erased yet. Bits of it seem to keep popping in. Then it erases fully andwow, 2, 3 and 4 occur. This isn’t grinding. It’s waiting for the F/N to broaden to cognition.The pc who complains about F/Ns is really stating the wrong problem. The actualproblem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and themeter a moment too soon.The pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward.Charge is then left in the area. A pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often willbegin to refuse auditing.Despite all this, one still must not overrun and get the TA up. But in Dianetics an erasureleaves nothing to get the TA up with!The Scientology auditor has a harder problem with this, as he can overrun more easily.There is a chance of pulling the bank back in. So the problem is more applicable to Scientologyas a problem than to Dianetics.But ALL auditors must realize that the END PHENOMENA of successful auditing is notjust an F/N but has 3 more requisites. And an auditor can chop these off.The mark of the real VIRTUOSO (master) in auditing is his skilled handling of thefloating needle.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH.jz.ei.rdCopyright © 1970by L.

Misapplication of this definition can result in underrunand overrun processes or actions and the pc snarled up with BPC.TYPES OF EPsIn Power Processing the auditor waits for a specific EP and does not indicate an F/Nuntil he has gotten the specific EP for the process. To miss on this in Power is disastrous, thusPower auditors are drilled and drilled on the handling of Power EPs.In Dianetics, the EP of a chain is erasure, accompanied by an F/N, cognition and goodindicators. You wouldn’t necessarily expect rave indicators on a pc in the middle of an assist,under emotional or physical stress until the full assist was completed though. What you wouldexpect is the chain blown with an F/N. Those two things themselves are good indicators. Thecognition could simply be “the chain blew”.In Scientology, End Phenomena vary with what you’re auditing. An ARC Broken pc onan L-1C will peel off charge and come uptone gradually as each reading line is handled.Sometimes it comes in a spectacular huge cog and VVGIs and dial F/N, but that’s usually aftercharge has been taken off on a gradient. What’s expected is an F/N as that charge beinghandled moves off.In Ruds it’s the same idea. When you’ve got your F/N and that charge has moved off,indicate it. Don’t push the pc on and on for some “EP”. You’ve got it.Now a major grade process will run to F/N, Cog, VGIs and release. You’ll have anability regained. But that’s a grade process on a set up flying pc.F/N ABUSEMistakenly applying the Power EP rule to Ruds will have the pc messed up by overrun. Itinvalidates the pc’s wins and keys the charge back in. The pc will start thinking he hasn’tblown the charge and can’t do anything about it.In 1970 I had to write the HCO B “F/Ns and End Phenomena” to cure auditors ofchopping pc EPs on major actions by indicating F/Ns too soon. This is one type of F/N abusewhich has largely been handled.That bulletin and Power EP handling have been in some instances misapplied in the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"direction of overrun. “The pc isn’t getting EP on these chains as there’s no cognition, just ‘iterased’,” is one example. Obviously the C/S didn’t understand the definition of cognition orwhat an EP is. Another example is the pc spots what it is and F/Ns and the auditor carries on,expecting an “EP”.OTs and EPsAn OT is particularly subject to F/N abuse as he can blow things quite rapidly. If theauditor misses the F/N due to too high a sensitivity setting or doesn’t call it as he’s waiting foran “EP”, overrun occurs. It invalidates an OT’s ability to as-is and causes severe upsets.This error can also stem from auditor speed. The auditor, used to auditing lower level pcsor never trained to audit OTs, can’t keep up with the OT and misses his F/Ns or reads.Thus overruns occur and charged areas are bypassed.This could account for those cases who were flying then fell on their heads with the sameproblems that blew back again.REMEDYThe remedy of this problem begins with thoroughly clearing all terms connected withEPs. This is basically Word Clearing Method 6, Key Words.The next action is to get my HCO Bs on the subject of EPs and also related meteringHCO Bs fully understood and starrated. This would be followed by clay demos of various EPsof processes and actions showing the mechanics of the bank and what happens with the pc andmeter.TRs and meter drills on spotting F/Ns would follow, including any needed obnosis drillsand correction of meter position so that the auditor could see the pc, meter and his admin at aglance.Then, the auditor would be gradiently drilled on handling the pc, meter and admin atincreasing rates of speed including recognizing and indicating EPs when they occurred. Whenthe auditor could do all of this smoothly at the high rate of speed of an OT blowing things byinspection without fumbling, the last action would be bullbaited drills like TRs 103 and 104, ona gradient to a level of competence whereby the auditor could handle anything that came up atspeed and do so smoothly.Then you’d really have an OT auditor. And that’s what you’ll have to do to make them.SUMMARYOverrun and underrun alike mess up cases.Both stem from an auditor inability to recognize and handle different types of EPs andinexpertness in handling the tools of auditing at speed.Don’t overrun pcs and have to repair them.Let the pc have his wins.LRH:ams.rd L.

Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"TWO -WAY COMMUNICATIONA lecture given on1 November 1954Like to talk to you about two-way communication. This might possibly be a good moment tobring to you some small inkling of the fact that a number of centuries ago, there was a man—number of centuries ago—in a small town in Bavaria who could communicate. But since thattime, there’s been very little of this. And it is in an effort to bring the auditor into cognizance ofthis condition amongst man, and so perhaps bring at least one more man into communicationand get him to communicate, that I dedicate this particular talk.Now, I don’t want you to get an extreme idea about two-way communication. There have beenmany examples of this. I don’t want you to get this idea that two-way communication iscommon, commonplace, is undertaken, is done, and so forth, amongst men. Because to do sowould be a lie. But you, as auditors, are pretty well trained by social usage and actionthroughout most of your lives to believe that you are communicating with human beings, and Iwish at this moment to knock that now. It is highly improbable that you have communicatedactually and accurately on a two-way basis with more than one or two people in your entirelives. Now, you can tell me who these people are right now.Two-way communication has to embrace a certain amount of understanding. The fundamentalparts of understanding are A-R-C. If you were really in two-way communication withanybody, it would be denoted solely by this fact: you right now can think—if you’ve ever beenin two-way communication in this lifetime with anybody—you can think of somebody withsome affection. Now, if there’s any person right now that you can think of, in your whole life,with some affection and an affectionate feeling right at this moment, you have been in two-waycommunication with that person.And you will note as you remember this person that there are a great many things that you canremember about this person, and a great many things that they have said would come ratherrapidly into mind. I do not say that you have had such a person in your lifetime, necessarily.Because it is not a common thing in man in this twentieth century to be in good communicationanyplace. But real good communication is a lot different than what you think of ascommunication. Do you follow me? Good communication is a lot different than your casualand common experience with education and communication —lot different.So, the possible high Of a two-way communication may or may not have been attained by yousometime in this lifetime, but if you can think of any person you have known in this lifetimewith some affection, then you are approaching a good two-way communication with thatperson.Now, am I putting the point across to you? Now, isn’t it odd and peculiar that with such aperson you would have a considerable recall on—if you thought it over for a moment—onwhat they’d said and what you’d said to them, and so forth. You’d have quite a recall; quite alot of stuff there.When a mother has been very, very affectionate to a somewhat reluctant son, you get acommunication inflow so strong that it practically occludes. This is a one-way communication.Son—very reluctant, doesn’t like all this; affection from women, you know, standoffish. Babytalk. They kissed you, fool around, carried you around, very affectionate, worried about you,would let you climb the backyard fence, very concerned about the time when you decided totake up the air force or flying or diving, or something of, quite concerned for your well-being.You’ll get a different manifestation where you yourself felt no great affection. That’s ARC:affinity, reality and communication, of course. And where you had somebody feeling veryaffectionate toward you, where you didn’t feel very affectionate back, the very funny part of it"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"is, is the material is liable to sit there with you as thoroughly occluded, but very, very, verycontrolling on you—a control factor.When this sort of thing takes place, you have the individual giving us an opinion of his ownpast—what he’s been told his own past was. You follow this?Let’s take a daughter, and Mother was very affectionate toward the daughter, and the daughterwas rather standoffish, see? Maybe had a couple of other children in the family, and they sortof knocked the daughter around. There were a lot of other manifestations took place a lot ofridges, you might say, of one kind or another. But you had Mother very affectionate towardher daughter, and you had the daughter, then, twenty years after childhood, tell you about herchildhood. And she would say, “And when I was two, so-and-so-and-so and yap-yap-yap.And when I was five, yap-yap-yap, and so-and-so and so-and-so. And when I was ten, I wasso-and-so and so-and I—we lived there at that time. It was a very beautiful house.”Do you know who you’re talking to? You’re talking to Mama. You: “Now, where did youlearn that was what you did at two?”—because you think, as an auditor, this is pretty good forthis preclear to have a straight recall back to two.“Where’d you learn about this?”“Well I . . . “ (comm lag) “Oh, my mother told me.”And you’d find it out that what her mother told her about when she was ten was what she wastelling you. And what her mother told you [her] about when she was twenty. That’s her life. Itwould be enough for Mother to call up . . . Mother could come up and tell her that she wasmarried to another man, and she would have to have a comm lag before she could reject it.Here you have this big flow from one terminal—high affinity, see? Mama may have had veryhigh reality too. And Mama certainly did communicate to this child. But the other terminal wasonly resisting. And when you have a familial situation where the child is resisting a parent, theyonly resist them just so long. They only usually resist them only the first or three, four years oftheir life. And after that they become affinity (same terminal).The basic definition of affinity is actually lost in antiquity. The word is chosen, by the way,from the ancient days of magic. The magicians, the ancient magicians, used this wordconsistently and continually. It actually meant “occupying the same space.” A complete, totalaffinity would mean “occupying the same space as.”But, where we have distance intervening with spatial occupation possible, we have perfectcommunication. Now, follow me on that. We have possibility of occupying the same space,you see, but a distance intervening. We get communication; we get duplication.What is duplication? Duplication is simply cause-distance-effect, you see, with the same thingas effect as is at cause. Well, that’s duplication.Now, let’s take the most complete duplication there would be, which would be a perfectduplication, and we would discover, then, that cause and effect could occupy the same spot.And the moment they occupy the same spot—no ridge, no energy, no space, no universe. See?No energy manifestation or spatial manifestation then takes place when you get a perfectduplicate. So therefore, you could have two people standing facing each other with thepossibility in either one that they could occupy the same space (see, as thetans; awareness ofawareness units), and what would we get?We’d get a very curious manifestation. They would both know what they were saying beforethey said it. Both know this. They’d have an instinctive understanding. They could conversewith a minimum of words. One of them would say, “Hey, Joe. Ah . . . mmm.” And Joe would"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"hand him the spanner. But these two people would make a considerable team against life; theywould be very, very hard to combat.Did you ever know a pair of twins? And did you ever try to fight a pair of twins—fight oneindividually? You’d find yourself fighting two twins. See? When they try to talk to each other:well now, they’ve been—they understand. They have a very high understanding of each otherand considerable affection. So much so, quite often when one twin is killed the other onesimply kicks the bucket. I mean you get an immediate duplication on a bad situation. You neversee one twin of a pair of twins that—identical twins I’m talking about, not fraternal—who areoperating very individually. One gets sick; the other one gets sick.Well, this is a communication—on a lower level. But if both of them felt in high affinity foreach other they would have, as a pair, much less chance of getting sick. They’d as-iseverything, you know, that was bad that was coming in. They’d talk it over, and it’d be gone.Quite in addition to that, if they themselves could maintain a fairly high communication andaffinity line to their environment, you would discover that their entire environment would beimproved by the fact that they were present. Two terminals are always better than one. Six arebetter than two. A thousand are better than six—if they’re in high affinity.Now, we get into this factor in the military when we talk about esprit de corps. If you have aunit where everybody is fighting everybody else in the unit, you’ll have bad communicationinside the unit—real poor communication. You give them an order, “Squads right,” and theywill all have a tendency to rag it up, and training might, and force might carry them through.But if you ever put them on a parade ground in competition or something like that, gee, they’dbe terrible. I mean, they’d just—no matter how long you drilled them or trained them theywould never come through. Training is no substitute for ARC or understanding.Now, an individual could have such high ARC with his environment that he would not have tolearn about any part of the environment; he would simply know all about it simply byobserving it, because he could occupy its same space with no liability to himself. You see thatclearly?Now, the first oddity about which I talked to you was where you have a high-ARC outflowfrom one terminal hitting another terminal of a low-ARC potential. The low-ARC potential getsswamped up. It just plain ordinarily gets drowned.Now, actually, a person - Mother in this case - would not have to be very affectionate toaccomplish this if the other terminal, the child, were way down, see? So that all we have tohave here is a difference of potential to get a flow.Let’s take a battery and put ten thousand volts on it, and let’s take another plate or battery andput two volts on it. And now let’s connect the two of them together. Which battery getsswamped? The two-volt plate, of course. Right?Life and beingness and the granting of beingness, and so forth, are all phrases or descriptionswhich simply describe this thing called communication or an outflow of understanding or anactivity of understanding. See?We could say granting of beingness: we mean high-potential ARC. See? He can grant high-potential understanding, or he can flow out to . . . We’d say, he can also make live and makealive . . . Get the idea here? See? We say high ARC: we’re also saying high potential ofgranting beingness; we’re also saying high potential of granting life; we’re also saying highknowingness, and we’re also saying—right along with those things—we are saying that thisindividual can understand or can be understood.Well, believe me, an individual like that’s liable to be understood—he’s liable to be understoodthoroughly—to such a degree that a low potential facing him is liable to understand nothing"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"else. You see this?Now, let’s take a look at life at large, and we find out that the successful life forms are simplybeing successful relative to other life forms. Now we have a study in relativity, and notEinsteinian relativity but Hubbardian relativity. And that’s of more use to man, I’m afraid.All due respect to Professor Albert and his umbrella, I don’t quite see how he’s done verymuch for existence, except maybe to speed it on its way. You know, I don’t think anybodywould have gotten real serious about the atom bomb if somebody like Einstein hadn’t given it agood hard shove. And you notice right after they built one, Einstein was one of the first boysjumping in to try to organize in order to help and save humanity; and of course, he just didn’thave enough on the ball. He lent his name to a couple of organizations, and they flopped, and itwas a sorry mess.But this was not an outflow of high life except in relationship to other mathematicians, otherelectricians and other engineers. Isn’t that right? So Einstein has a terrific outflow or potential,and so forth, compared to others in his field.Sister Kenny probably has so much more life potential or ability to grant beingness or ARC andactual understanding of life and its problems than Albert Einstein that it’s very doubtful if thetwo of them could converse without Mr. Einstein suddenly buying anything and everything thatSister Kenny said. Get this high/low potential.But now, Einstein can’t talk to a bunch of mathematicians or engineers or government politicallads without getting them swamped. Get the relative factors involved here just taking people’sname in vain. And maybe be the most useful thing he ever did was to be included in theconversation.That’s a hell of a funny thing to say, but let’s look at it. Let’s look right up to it, and let’s seethat right out here in Nevada there’s a quarter-of-a-mile-radius hole in the sand which is greenglass, which to this moment is radioactive.And this might be a high understanding compared to that stove, but you see, we’ve almostmoved out of the life band. Did you ever write Mr. Einstein a letter and get an answer? No, younever did, and you never will. Now, this is an interesting fact, isn’t it? But here we havesomebody who is exclusively making MEST produce an effect upon MEST.There’s even medical doctors in this town who have a higher understanding potential of lifethan Albert Einstein. I don’t mean in the field of medicine; I mean just of life at large, who cangrant more beingness, who are more worthwhile to be alive. Now, life itself is happier to havethem around. You see? Because they can produce an effect upon living beings which is a goodeffect or an improving effect with a higher ARC.And I just said we were talking about medical doctors! I mean, let’s really crawl over thethreshold and slime up on the first mark on the ladder, because these boys are not high in thatparticular direction.Actually, today, the minister of the gospel is right there. He isn’t even vaguely starting to climbthat ladder.Now, undoubtedly around town you could probably pick up a guy or two who could producean optimum effect or something more optimum on the subject of life than any medical doctor intown—who hasn’t even studied medicine. You know, he sort of walks in and says “Hello ‘ orsomething like that, and people feel better. There’s undoubtedly somebody circulating like that.Maybe it’s a salesman out here; maybe it’s a girl in a library; or maybe he’s a plumber. Wedon’t care what this fellow is doing.The ability to understand life, and life’s assignment of labels to life forms are two different"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"things. Life assigns labels to forms, which are thereafter supposed to perform on this level.Well, the actual understanding of life . . . I’m reminded of Mark Twain’s “Visit to Heaven ‘think it was—Mark Twain —and he saw this tremendous line of men standing there, and theywere all lined up to get signed up or something of the sort, and they were in order of precedent.And Mark Twain said, “Who’s this?” And his conducting angel said, “Why, those are thegreatest generals that earth ever had.”And he says, “They are? Well, who’s that fellow up there in front?” (He didn’t recognizeNapoleon or Alexander the Great or anybody.)“Oh, he’s . . .” I’ve forgotten the man’s name out of the book, but “that’s Ebenezer Smaltzfrom Poobar, Vermont.”“Well, I never heard of this general. You say he’s the greatest general ever lived?”“Yes, yes, he was actually easily the greatest general ever lived, but he just never got around todoing any generating.”The success label assigned by life, as represented by a race or a government, is not necessarilythe actually-borne label of the individual. You see, if you were asked to believe all the signsthat you see around, that everybody is carrying on his chest one way or the other, you wouldget an entirely erroneous idea. But I tell you how you could get an erroneous idea corrected:You could get an idea about the value to life or actual position on the gradient scale ofimportance to life at large; you could get the understanding and ARC of the individual. And theunderstanding and ARC of the individual is a direct monitoring factor on how Valuable thatindividual is to the remainder of life. And that’s the only factor there is that’s worth measuring.So, we don’t care if Doris Duke comes in to see you as a preclear or whether this person is Dr.Jow of the Jow Clinic or whether it’s Menninger or Mayo or the president of the United States.The label on this preclear, put there by social agreement, has nothing whatsoever to do with hisvalue to life at large nothing; it has nothing to do with it at all.There is a way to measure it, and that is his understanding and his ARC potential. If youexteriorized at a tremendously high potential—I mean, you’re exteriorized and really swampedup—your ability to understand that at which you look, your ability to have ARC would be sohigh, could be made so high, that your communications would have no slightest symbol value.But you could be so high that you would not even be observed by the rest of life, and youwould simply find them caving in (as far as you were concerned) and simply accepting yourideas with no critical eye of any kind whatsoever. And you would make a race of slaves.Difference of potential? You could get yourself up to a point where it would be enough for youto think a thought to have everybody run around and move like puppets to that thought,because you have assumed an ARC potential of such magnitude that your just thinking towardthem caved them in.Now, every once in a while somebody comes up and says, “Well, why do you talk to us,Ron?” See? “I mean, why do you put these things in words and phrases. Why do you bother toteach them in this arduous fashion?”—inferring “If you were really on the ball, you see, youwould just think a thought, and then we’d all know it.” You see?Well, if I ever were up that high and adopted this method of education or training, I’m afraidthere would not be much individuality or self-determinism or life or power of any kind on thepart of any auditor I trained.Now, you boys don’t feel particularly reduced in your ability to get on in life through beingtrained by me, do you? That’s because I’m training across the face of your own decision andcriteria, and through your own experience, right?"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"I’m not saying I simply could think a thought and then everybody’d walk around like puppets;that’s not my inference. That’s a lot of malarkey. It’s a theoretical possibility, but to train in thatway would be an error, wouldn’t it? Hm? It would be an error. Then, all of a sudden, whoevertrained you might get bored and go off to Arcturus or something of the sort, and that wouldleave everything on a completely robot basis. An individual cannot stand by his own inspectionand criteria—if he can’t stand alone and function alone without support, he is not worthtraining. It’s not worth training him unless hey going to be able to stand alone and practice andutilize what he’s learned.See, to train a man and take away from him, at the same time, his individuality would be a veryhorrible thing.All right. We’re right here in the field of communication, and I invite you to observe the factthat we are also in the field of hypnotism. High ARC, low ARC—the potential can besufficiently different that the low-ARC potential will simply become a robot. See this?There’s why your Freudian analyst thought it was necessary for his patient to assume thevalence or personality of the analyst before he was well. What was he trying to do? One way orthe other, he was trying to overpower this personality and make a socially adapted robot. Doyou see that clearly? Because this is the goal of Freudian analysis.And where he couldn’t get a man to do this transference, he said the man could not be helped. Iwould like to know how the man has been helped by having lost his individuality orpersonality.One of the greatest fears there has been in this universe was that some government would formwith some terrifically accurate, useful therapy which would then depersonalize and remove theindividualities of the persons under the control of that government. There would be no greatertragedy, and no government would collapse faster. The duration of that government couldprobably be measured in two winks of the eye.People are afraid of this, but it can’t happen. Because any race so governed would perishbecause they would be leaving up to the government the exact method by which they moved thespoonful of food from the plate to their mouths, the exact number of times they masticated, andthe audible audibility of the gulp when they swallowed. It would all have to be monitored bythe government if you stripped them of their personality.So let this be a lesson to you as an auditor. Please don’t just overwhelm your preclear. Youwon’t ever get anyplace with him. You’ll wonder why . . . He stays overwhelmed for threedays—you’ll see this occasionally: three days he’ll feel wonderful, on the fourth or fifth day allof a sudden he’ll collapse. Why sure, all you did was overwhelm him. This doesn’t mean holdback your ARC. It merely means establish the other guy’s.Two ways you can set up this two-way communication, then, isn’t there? You could set it upon a high-potential-, low-potential-terminal basis and have it simply go from the high potentialto the low potential 80 overwhelmingly that then the low-potential terminal would become thehigh-potential terminal with all of its individualities and peculiarities. Right?There’d be another way you could rehabilitate this, wouldn’t there? There’d be to take twoterminals and make them—not by reducing one, but by increasing the low potential, you couldmake a two-way communication possible between these two, couldn’t you? And that would betwo-way communication then, wouldn’t it? Comparable terminals.All right. Let’s say you as an auditor: You can control a mind. You can control aberrations.You know that you can make people well. Your case is high. It has stayed high. You’veremained in good self-possession. You are perfectly willing to grant beingness, life or ARC—whatever we want to call it—you’re perfectly willing to grant this to other people, and so forth.And you audit this fellow, and you gradually bring him upstairs as a terminal. You found him"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"in the basement someplace. You got him up past scientist; you got him up past medical doctor,up past psychoanalyst, up past a parson, up past a yellow dog out here in the alley, up pastscorpions, upstairs higher and higher and higher and higher, and you got him up theresomewhere in your realm of flight.You think this person is going to be effective thereafter and that life is going to benefit? Yousaid it! And all this is tested solely by his communication ability, isn’t it?The main thing you will see, that is visible, is the communication speed. His communicationlag will be the quickest test of this. When he has a bad communication lag, he then andtherefore cannot have very high ARC, cannot have a very high potential, cannot have muchgranting of beingness—all these things are consequent to this communication lag. See thatclearly?All right. Then underlying every single process that you will ever learn is two-waycommunication. Two-way communication cuts in at the Tone Scale at—8.0. Down at that levelit would just be a hunt-and-punch system— mimicry-in-the-dark sort of thing. It would moveon up the line, it would get on up the line, and it would cut out as the only process possible—the only process possible—at 1.0. It would go all the way from—8.0 on the Tone Scale clearon up to 1.0 as the only process possible. Will you learn that for my sake, by observing it?Preclear walked out of here the other day after thirty-two hours of processing who still had acommunication lag. You know why he did? Because he came in here at 0.5 on the Tone Scale.And the auditor processed him on Opening Procedure of 8-C and Opening Procedure byDuplication for thirty-two hours. Thirty-two hours of improper processing, done by an auditorwho is a pretty good auditor. Number one, this auditor had never studied Science of Survival;did not know his Chart of Human Evaluation even vaguely. Number two, had evidently nevercompletely learned what a communication lag is. And number three, had never understood thattwo-way communication is itself a process. He thought it was something which introducedprocesses. But it is a process, just as clearly a process as Opening Procedure by Duplication.Let’s take the rest of this scale and just look at it in passing. Now, I’ll mention it to you again:the rest of the scale would be that from about 1.1 up to hostility just almost into antagonismthere is only one other process which really has a lot of value, and that’s ElementaryStraightwire. From 1.1 to 1.8, Elementary Straightwire has a great deal of value. But OpeningProcedure by Duplication will be found to fail. All too often. He wasn’t in communication inthe first place. You see?But his idea—when you’ve really got him up to 1.1 he will communicate with his past andyour past and other people’s pasts. You know, it’s past; it’s safe. So you have to get him upthere to where he can look at life before you do much else with him. But the past is nagginghim so much—he’s way back in the past somewhere.So actually, the most facile method of processing, and according to my experience has been—1.1 to 1.8 has been Elementary Straightwire.I’ll give you a process for Elementary Straightwire that is a murderous process - justmurderous. And there’s a little quirk on it that’s equally murderous. And another process—there are two of them in there. Elementary Straightwire, of course, is simply “Something youwouldn’t mind remembering; something you wouldn’t mind forgetting.”I doubt if there’s anybody present has run Elementary Straightwire long enough to do any goodon a preclear. What’s long enough? Oh, couple of hours; three hours, four hours, somethinglike that, at a stretch. And you’ll see some changes made—there’ll be some changes made inthat case.Well, let me give you the other switch—another switch on this. I mean, this is a process. Put inthe Mystery to Know Scale on Elementary Straightwire: “Give me a mystery you wouldn’t"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"mind remembering. Another mystery you wouldn’t mind remembering. Another mystery youwouldn’t mind remembering. Another mystery you wouldn’t mind remembering. Anothermystery you wouldn’t mind remembering. A mystery you wouldn’t mind forgetting”— yougot that lag flat, see, on one of them—”And a mystery you wouldn’t mind forgetting. And amystery you wouldn’t mind forgetting. And a mystery you wouldn’t mind forgetting. And amystery you wouldn’t mind forgetting. Give me another one and another one and another one.Okay.“Some sex you wouldn’t mind remembering. Some sex you wouldn’t mind remembering.Some sex you wouldn’t mind remembering.” Now, finally, “Some sex you wouldn’t mindforgetting. Some sex you wouldn’t mind forgetting.” In other words, people at that level of theTone Scale are pretty doggone wobbly. They’ve got to have a lot of significance, see? So, ifyou asked them something they wouldn’t mind remembering, something wouldn’t mindforgetting—they actually are so complicated as people that they don’t really swerve in towardanything, and they just sit there sort of gaa gaa.But there’s a big liability of processing this individual on a technique that you can’t observeinside his own bank, isn’t there? Hmm? You can’t look in his head. Well, actually, yes youcan, with a communication lag. That communication lag will vary and change. If it stays thesame but is slightly laggy or is fast, he’s kidding you.Now, Opening Procedure of 8-C could be used in such a case just to show him that you wereboss around there, not to get him well.Now, let me give you another quirk on this—I said there were two. “Something you wouldn’tmind remembering” “Something you wouldn’t mind forgetting” is Elementary Straightwire,with ARC Straightwire, as being right in the same band. But, “Something you wouldn’t mindremembering,” and “Something you wouldn’t mind forgetting” on the subject of mystery, sex,eating, symbols, thinking, effort, emotion, looking and knowing. You just run it in there, andit gives them enough significance to keep them going for quite a while. And you’ll see somechange is made.Now, there’s another way of running old-time 8-D: Pick out the fellow whose universe he isinteriorized in. Mama—all right, let’s go to town: “Give me something real about your mother.Time when you were in good communication about your mother.” In other words, the specificperson out of whose universe you’re trying to exteriorize him. See, you’re trying to pull himout of this universe. So something real about him- something real about that other universe,you see? And you’ll see him go bmmr pop! Why? Because he’s as-ising the connectingcommunication lines which still remain to his mother. Mother was obviously of a higherpotential than he was, or otherwise, he wouldn’t be in that universe.All right. Let’s take a look here. Let’s take a look and see and find out that ElementaryStraightwire is intensely usable. But it will depend upon you and your ability to observe toknow whether or not the preclear is actually remembering anything or not, won’t it? Andtherefore, it takes a sharp auditor to use that. It’d also take a knowledge on your part of theTone Scale as given, and nothing more than is given, in Science of Survival. You’d have toknow that great big Chart of Human Evaluation, and you’d be able to look along here and seeby various factors where he actually is on the Tone Scale. You really find him there too.Now, the communication lag will change, and he will rapidly improve. Maybe in a hour or twohe will become quite improved. You’d jump the band, then; you’d get upstairs—up to 1.8.And about 1.8, then you would be able to run Opening Procedure of 8-C. And you would beable to run Opening Procedure of 8-C until he finally hit about 2.3 on the Tone Scale or 2.5 - inother words, the boredom range—and then hit him by Opening Procedure by Duplication fromthere on up and through conservatism. And you’ll knock him out on conservatism on this.Remedy of Havingness actually does not take place as a very, very effective process until youhave somebody at about 3.5 on the Tone Scale. And then it becomes intensely effective."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"And Spotting Spots in Space cannot be done by anybody who is not, at least once in a while, atthe band of enthusiasm.Well, these are the processes you have there, simply plotted on the Tone Scale. But let’s take agood look at this and recognize that the widest band we have—1.1 on down south through 0.0,through—4.0, on through—6.0, on down to—Swathe only possible process anywhere on thatrange would be two-way communication .Well, if this is the case, for Christ’s sakes, how do we use it as a process? Oh, we have aparticular question we ask. That’s how we use it, and it’s profitable. That is ElementaryStraightwire. If this disagrees with anything I have said before, what I’m saying now is true.The only reason you’ve ever been fed a question to go along with two-way communication isjust so that you can at least get in there and stir up a communication lag—you understand? Tothat you can understand the communication lag! But that isn’t what you’re expected to run on apreclear for the rest of your life.Let’s look at it. Let’s take a good look at this, and we’ll find out that from -8.0 up here to 1.0on the Tone Scale, we’ve got no business using anything under the sun except two-waycommunication. Two-way communication means he’s got to say things, and you’ve got toanswer them too.Most curious thing ever happens is when an auditor tells some preclear that he’s fishing up outof the rain barrel—out of some medical school . . . Don’t ever attempt one out of a psychology-major class. Oh, don’t do that to yourself. Just don’t bother, because two-way communicationis too well shielded in that particular case.Freud says, I think in lecture 27 or 28 at the end, “And these people then cannot be healed byus.” We can say this about psychologists: “These people then are not desirous for being healedby us.”You know why? They sit there and observe the effect. They’re trained to sit there and observethe effect. Anybody who’s been trained in psychology will sit back in an auditing chair andobserve the effect.Once in a while, I get real brutal with them, grab them by the nape of the neck, make them goover and touch the wall and then sit there and see if anything happened. They’re not there to beprocessed toward being any better. They’re not there to be processed so as to become Clear.They’re not living in order to attain any goal or be happy or anything else. They’re just living inorder to observe an effect. Not create one, you understand. No, no, no. Just observe one. Outin the street a blade of grass moves. That’s an effect, so they write it down in the book. That’sthe way they’re trained.One of the best ways to get rid of that is to just butcher them on this basis of a two-waycommunication, only you make two-way communication with them one way or the other. Butask them to observe an effect, or what effects can they observe or anything like this that tapsthe circuit. It’s a very curious thing.Now, let’s in this last fifteen minutes really get down to cases on two-way communication.Just what is two-way communication? It is you asking a question and receiving the exactanswer to the question. It is also the preclear asking an exact question and receiving an answerto that question. Got it?And it is being used, ordinarily, on people who are so full of significance that anycommunication on anything is either aberrative or a process. Do I make myself very clear here?It’s either aberrative or a process. Anything they’re doing in life would fall in these twocategories."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"They meet some fellow, tips his hat to them in the morning and they think, “Let me see. Letssee, did he . . . No, what did he mean? No, I-I guess I’m in good con . . . I don’t know.” See,figure-figure-figure-figure-figure—the least it’ll do. Or apathy, an emotional reaction on theirpart. Somebody has actually tipped their hat to them and they’re so degraded, you see, andthey’re just caved in by this whole action. Think I’m exaggerating things, but this is the waythese people live! They cover it up with some social machinery now and then. But whenthey’re rough, they’re rough.How do you know? Well, there’s a thing called disassociation that you certainly better getcognizant with. And I would advise you that you put on your little medallion dong-dongaround your neck and take a walk down to the local spin bin or any home or sanitarium. Andyou just talk to some of those patients in there. And you won’t be asking anybody after thatwhat somebody being out of communication means. You’ll see tremendous varieties of it. Andone of the varieties you’ll see is this sort of thing: Statement on your part— zong-zong-zong—and then they dodge their own.... They dodged yours and then what they said, although itwasn’t on the subject, now has to be dodged, and now anything that they said then now has tobe dodged. In other words, dodge-dodge-dodge-dodge-dodge. See, they’re dodgingeverything in life. They are trying to avert ever being at the effect point of a communicationline. So therefore, anything you say, they change the subject. And then, having changed thesubject, they then have to change the subject for sure in order not to have a straight line there.And this is called disassociation.It is almost impossible for a sane person, unless he simply memorized an actual transcript ofone of these people, to even mock up this type of disassociation. It’s almost impossible to. I’vetried it several times, and I just never really get a grip on it.Therefore, any rendition that I would give you would be a poor one on this subject. Becausethe second I start into that kind of logical traveling, and so forth, I will at least add asignificance of making it funny or something like this. And they don’t do this. It’s justperfectly dull. You say, “Is that chair comfortable?” And you would expect, then, the person toreach down and touch the chair or do something in connection with the chair, but these peopledo not do that—not even vaguely. They will look over at the window. And then you expectthem to tell you that the window is open. But they don’t say anything about the window. Theytalk about the stove which they now have their back to. You see? And having talked about thestove, now something comes up about some relative—only there’s clothing sequitur anyplace.And it’s just a lost circuit that you see these people walking through.Listen, to get a straight stimulus-response on these people, such as you ask a question and theygive you an answer, is one of the most fabulous things you ever heard of. So you know whatyou do with them? You shake them by the hand and squeeze their hand twice. And the firsttime they squeeze your hand once. And you shake it again and you say, “No,” you know, and,“squeeze it twice,” see? Don’t be surprised to see a fear charge come off. They will finallysqueeze your hand twice in reply. You see some relief on this basis—two-way communication.You go in, and you salute them, and they salute you—exact duplication, by the way. I mean,they’re not perfect duplicate, but they’re mirror duplicate, you know? They salute you with thesame hand on the other side—a rapport, something of this character. If you ever get a patient ofthat character to do anything like that with you, and you don’t salute back so they can saluteyou back, and you don’t salute them back so they can salute you back, back and forth, backand forth, and recognize that you really got a process going here, you ought to be examined bySteves.In other words, that’s a process, isn’t it? So what’s this communication? It’s cause-distance-effect with a duplication at effect of what is at cause, and cause changing position on the line.You finally get them to a point where they’ll salute you, and you salute back.Now, people always miss on little kids. They go, “Goo-goo, bla-bla-bla and nya-nya-nya-nya.Wave bye-bye,” and they pick up their hand, you know, and wave it bye-bye like mad, and so"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"forth. And then the next day the little kid comes in and steps on their toe or something likethat—does something, you know, in this line—they don’t two-way respond to the kid at all.They pat him on the head or, you know, say, “Goo-goo, da-da, wave bye-blah-blah.” Whatare they doing? They’re doing a compulsive-obsessive outflow, obviously to a being whocannot register or recommunicate.You want to get into good ARC with a kid so the kid will mind you and not fall in the garbagecan and do other weird and strange things, and be successful in life, so forth, don’t gopounding them around, for heaven’s sakes. There’s just never anything happened in thatdirection. But let them communicate to you once in a while, you know? They walk up to youand they say, “Gub-glubglub.” Well, for heaven’s sakes, say at least yes or no. You know? Orsay “Glub-glub” in response. But let them originate a communication once in a while. And ifyou don’t let anybody originate a communication ever, you get on one of these stuck flowbases, and there you are. And they will either get swamped or pay no further attention to you.In either case, they go out of communication with you. See, they go out of communication.Now, parents wonder where their children get to be four, five, six—and wonder why, whenyou take them out to a soda fountain or a movie or something like that, they sit there and yelland scream, and they want something, and they whine and moan and victimize their parents atevery—why they don’t mind. And they wonder when they’re twenty-one and twenty-two whythey’ve gone off and married the wrong girl or the wrong boy and—you know?— and why incollege they didn’t study, and why they never answer any mail. Particularly, you’ll hearparents always complaining about this: Johnny never writes them a letter.Now, I’ve seen a few slaps administered to a kid (just a few slaps administered to a kid to puthim out of an emanation band; just drop him out of an emanation band)—you know, aroundthe house. He can take it from life, you see, but taking it around the house, that would besomething else, (from a maid or somebody like that). You see, just a few cuffs: all of a suddengo out of communication—just out of the communication band, get sick, stick somewhere lowon the Tone Scale, stay there for a day or so, see, sick, and then finally rebound. You’ve justwatched a person go down Tone Scale and up Tone Scale again. Well, you actually couldproduce the same effect just by letting him reach and you withdraw. See, if he happened toreach toward you just accidentally, you back up. And you get an astonishing thing.Now, I know of a case where a person finds it utterly impossible to make children or dogsobey—utterly impossible. This person cannot understand it. No dog or no child has ever beentrained by this person satisfactorily, and yet this person has tried and tried and tried. Neverworked. Can’t train them. Doesn’t matter what dog it is. Even if a dog is trained at a kennelsomeplace, you know, and is then turned back to him. He says, “Heel,” the dog runs away.He says, “Lie down,” the dog jumps up on his chest and licks him in the face. He just can’tfigure this out.But he never could figure this out either: The dog, in playing around— let’s say a dog’splaying around, see? Just chewing around and chewing on an old shoe, you know, and youwalk in the room and the dog comes over and looks at the shoe you got on and says, “Rrrrahr-rrrahr-mahr-rrrahr-rrrahr,” you know, and grabs hold of your shoe.Now, the person I just talked to you about would say, “Get away. What are you doingchewing on my shoe?” See? Not, “How are you, Rover?” In other words, under hisconditions, with life exactly arranged the way he wants it, he will talk to the dog.The dog offered a communication, didn’t he? He actually offered a game. Dogs play four orfive games as just standard games of dogs. All right, he came in and he offered a game, hm?He didn’t inquire whether or not your shoes had just been shined or not. But then you didn’tinquire whether or not he’d just scratched his ear when you fluffed up the hair on the back of it.He bit you. Well, this person . . . If you were in good communication with life in generalyour—not an analyzed reaction, but just your instinctive reaction would be “Ouch! Don’t dothat! Get away from me, you beast! What are you trying to do to me?” You’re letting him"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"emanate, because you’re not basically scared. You can play a game. See that? This dog willthink you’re wonderful. You’re a stranger. He’s done this. Next time you come to the househe’ll think you’re wonderful, and so forth. He’ll come out, and he’ll look at you, and he’llwag, and he’ll go “Hah-eh-hah-eh-hah.” And you look at him and you go, “Eh-haheh-hah-eh-hah. How are you?” “Ah, that’s a great guy, a great guy,” you know? Two waycommunication in all directions, and so on.I had people say to me “What do you do to animals?” It’s nothing mysterious what you do toanimals. “What do you do to kids? Every time you come over here, Ron, every time you comeover here these children just go completely out of control. What’s the matter with you?”Yeah, I’ve been so mean as to say occasionally, “Completely out of control? Are you sure theywere in control before I came?” But they’ve certainly come to life on this kind of a basis.And I’ve seen kids get beaten down enough so that any playful push in their directions or attackin their directions, they just instinctively cringe away and try to go out of communication. Inother words, a reach in their direction is enough to make them go out of communication.Now, you understand that I’m also talking to you about preclears when I talk to you aboutchildren and dogs? Look, your preclear is well enough off—I’m just talking about livingforms; same thing would apply to ants, plaster saints, anything. I’m just talking about life.All right. Your preclear—the surest measure you ever had is your preclear’s willingness to playa game with you. He’s as bad off as he can’t play a game. A lot of preclears come in, sit down,you start processing, they’ll run anything for you. They’ll give you any kind of effect you canthink of. All over the house they’re in good shape anyhow. Say, “Be three feet back of yourhead,” they probably would be without any trouble at all. They go through a drill; they do this;they do that.Look at this person’s life. Life is a game. Earth is a playing field—no more than that. All right.This other preclear comes in, he says, “I don’t know, I feel pretty bad today. Your auditingsession last week really didn’t do me very much good, you know?” He’s just announced toyou at that moment he can’t play a game.How’s another way he announces to you that he can’t play a game? You say, “Well, let’s see ifwe can get down and finish off that Straightwire we were running last week.”“Oh, uh . . . well, that really didn’t do me too much good. I actually had a dream. Hm-hm-hm.”See, he isn’t in this Straightwire game at all, see? I mean, he’s out of communication with you.You, being educated as a social animal, are liable to believe that you’re talking to somebodywho has a rational reason why he doesn’t want to run Straightwire! All you’re talking to issomebody who cannot answer your question! The sooner you learn that, the sharper you’ll get!They sound so reasonable!Well actually, the band between about 0.75 on the Nine Scale, and about 0.2—pardon me, 2.2(in that band right in there), my God! Reason? Oh! Why, they could give you a totalexplanation, probably with all the physical laws involved of exactly how a sun got created. Butby God, they could never walk in the sunlight! Do you get the sudden difference here? Hm?Oh, can they be reasonable. And they keep on fooling you as an auditor by being soreasonable. You’re guilty of an overt act all the time, too, along a certain part of this band, see?Just by being there—your “thereness.” You want to know what your overt act is, your“thereness” is the overt act. You are in a mass, in a form; you are visible, and that alone is theovert act to people in that Tone Scale band. And you’re going to run these people on OpeningProcedure by Duplication and precision, expect them to get in touch with their environment . . ."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Well, once in a while you’ll be lucky, and that luckiness—that one lucky one—will sell you onthe idea that then you could run this Opening Procedure on anybody, anyplace. You could getthis person to drill around like an automaton and go over and touch walls and that sort of thing,and then after you’d given him a couple of hours of session you would say to him, “How doyou feel now?”And he’d say, “You know, I really don’t . . . uh . . . I-I really didn’t get through. There wasone spot up there that I didn’t . . . “ Crrrr.See, he was willing to go through like a little doll, all wound up. You’re not in communicationwith him. Did it ever occur to you that you have a high enough ARC to run a body around aroom just by dropping a nickel in the slot, and that there’s no preclear walking around theroom? Did it ever occur to you that you could animate a body into 8-C? You sure can!And the only way you can really tell whether you’re doing it or not is two-way communication.Can that person put out a communication that you can answer? Can you put out acommunication that he can answer? Can you talk about something that is interesting in order toget life a little bit uncomplicated and as-ised and get some of these lags out. Just get him talkingat first, and let him get you talking any way... But remember, the only communication there isisn’t talk. There are other ways to communicate, too, you know? All the tactile sensations canbe used in two-way communication.And then you’ll finally get him up to a point where he’ll really talk to you. You had to see himseveral times, you know, and he finally is really talking to you, and you’re talking to him—there’s where analysis misses every time. You know? It takes two-way communication. Thereisn’t a preclear sitting there puking words year after year—that’d make anybody wog. Tomatch that two-way communication, the analyst would have to do the same thing.All right. Back and forth we go here, back and forth we go. We could then get him up toElementary Straightwire. And we can run Elementary Straightwire on him, then we can runalmost anything, you see—when we get him through that lag. He can contact his past; his pastis still there; he can still live; life would become more clear to him; you’ll break him out of thatband and then hit him on 8-C.This is the way I’ve been running them lately, with a tremendous amount of success justoverwhelming quantities of success with them. And the only place Eve been watching auditorsfailing is they forget that they can run a body by their own willpower. And they get a personwho is not in two-way communication, they run his body around the room through 8-C, and Idon’t know how many thousand years they could do it, but they’d get awfully expert inrunning two bodies at once: the body that’s sitting in the chair, and the body that’s goingaround the room.Okay."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"P.A.B. No. 44PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR’S BULLETINFrom L. RON HUBBARDVia Hubbard Communications Office163 Holland Park Avenue, London W.11_____________________________________________________________________21 January 1955TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION IN ACTIONThe first thing one should know about communication is its formula. The formula of one-way communication is Cause, Distance, Effect, with Intention and Attention, where that whichoccurs at Effect Duplicates what emanated from Cause. The elements of communication, then,are Intention, Attention, Cause, Effect, Distance and Duplication. Meaning, Significance, aresecondary phenomena.Communication is part of the triangle of Affinity, Reality and Communication. Reality iscomposed of the degree of duplication possible, and this is also describable under the headingof Agreement. Reality is a quality which depends upon duplication, and in the action ofduplication expertly or poorly done we find agreement and disagreement. The basic definitionof Affinity is “co-existence” and as we drift away from actual co-existence, we drift into theARC triangle and the communication formula. Co-existence is superior to the ARC triangle andthe mechanics of living. Here we would find two things occupying the same space. This wouldbe at the top of the scale. Two things with no space, no mass, and no energy. At the bottom ofthe scale we would find two things compulsively or obsessively almost occupying the samespace. As Affinity enters into the state of not-quite co-existence, we get the manifestations ofparticles and significances, symbols, and, of course, much more intimately, Affinity embracesthe distance part of the communication formula. It begins with the no distance of co-existenceand then, as Affinity drops, the distance factor is more and more important (regardless ofwhether the distance is far or close) until we have at last a complete and positive objection toproximity, or a complete and positive objection to any distance, and in this “state of mind” wefind material objects or the particles which compose them. Under Affinity, of course, we havethe emotional scale: Effort, as found in Science of Survival, and the Know down to MysteryScale as discussed in the Advanced Clinical Course Tapes.The entirety of ARC is the subject of understanding. Knowingness is highest on thescale, and this exceeds ARC and is in the realm of considerations and ideas. The moment weenter into understanding we get into the communication formula and the ARC triangle.Understanding is a highly superior commodity, but still lower than knowing. Understandingitself produces a column of the Chart of Human Evaluation which could be added to it. At thetop we would have a complete understanding of all things, and it would be completeknowingness, but this would require no communication to effect. From this knowingness wewould drop downscale into understanding, and then into varying but dwindling degrees ofunderstanding until we arrived at 2.0 on the scale, where we would find that understanding hadbecome commixed with incomprehensibilities to such a degree that the entire vectors of life arereversed and become the vectors of physical objects. From 2.0 down we specialize in greaterand greater degrees of incomprehensibility.The subject of incomprehensibility is difficult to comprehend. If we examine thecommunication formula we discover that a duplication at effect must take place if acommunication is to be received from the cause point of the line. Similarly, the cause point ofthe line has to take into account the fact that effect must be able to duplicate. Thus, the cause"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"point of the line, if it wishes to communicate, must communicate in a fashion or in a guisewhich can be duplicated at the effect point of the line. This is not a question of being so stupidor incomprehensible as to cause an effect on any incomprehensibility, but it is a willingness toself-determinedly emanate in such a manner as to allow a duplication to take place at effect.The basic stuff of the physical universe, to a thetan, is an incomprehensibility, but he isentirely devoted to trying to understand it. A thetan himself, the awareness of awareness unit,is understanding. Thus, we have this unit attempting to understand the incomprehensible. Athetan can, with perfect ease, understand incomprehensibility, but sometimes until it is called tohis attention, he is continually on the track of trying to find some comprehensibility in theincomprehensible. The very fact that a thing is in a mass form is a puzzle to a thetan, since he,himself, has no mass, no wave length, and no actual position in space other than his owndeclaration of it. He can easily understand a form, since he is generally “experienced” in forms,but he can’t understand the stuff of which the form is made because that stuff isincomprehensibility. Thus we find the thetan very easily “as-ising” forms and altering them,and we find him considering that he is incapable of altering in its actual substance, creating ordestroying the stuff of which the physical universe is made.A thetan looking at the incomprehensibility of the physical universe is, of course, doing ano-duplicate. He is mocking himself up in the role of having to understand theincomprehensible. Thus we get him fixated on the idea of the physical sciences and eventuallydegenerating down to a point where he behaves like MEST, and here we have the lucklessnuclear physicist who can cause MEST to vanish only by blowing it up, physically—a gamewhich will never win. Here we find science in general, and here we find scientists, and theirutter incapability of understanding any slightest particle of human behavior or conduct, andwithout any beliefs to speak of in humanity, and with a perfect and gruesome willingness todestroy it. These, as awareness of awareness units, have agreed so thoroughly with thephysical universe that they have no agreement with actual understanding. They write theirbooks with many communication lags, hemming and hawing, and without any decisions, andthoroughly object to anybody’s writing as though he knows what he is doing. The one thingthat the scientist knows is that nobody knows, and this does not happen to be true. Thus, hisscience is based on a false datum. He originates a theory that man rises from mud because he,himself, is so close to it. When he does go into the field of the human spirit, the spirit itself,and indeed his own beingness, is an other-determinism to him. He sees no virtue in humanfellowship or decency and advises in his books the necessity to turn to higher force. Once ascientist has broken through, in a revulsion against himself, his feelings of non-understandingness about people, it is generally on the downward side and it is in the realmwhere he must obsessively turn to God.I give you this as an idea of what happens to preclears as they go down the tone scale.When they get close to the bottom they become scientific and pretend they know nothing andfight anything else which might know. When they get a little further down they become moreviolently neurotic and a little more south they become psychotic and forget even their science.And this is of considerable interest to the auditor, for the auditor is interested in humanreactions and actions, and all he has to do is understand that he is looking at anincomprehensibility when he looks at anyone who is that neurotic or psychotic. There is noother causation in psychotic behavior than that everything is incomprehensible. There is noprivate, secret button which can be hit in a case, magically turning the individual into sanity,unless, of course, we utilize successfully “Be three feet back of your head” with somebasic preparatory work. But this, of course, returns the person upscale toward understandingsince it takes him from such close proximity to mass.The auditor, then, who is looking at a psychotic, is trying to understand anincomprehensible, and if we were to cease using the word “psychotic” and began to use theword “incomprehensetic,” we would have a word which would serve us extremely well.Thus, an auditor processes the psychotic with considerable difficulty in the absence ofthis understanding of incomprehensibility. For the auditor, to get any communication across,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"has to mock himself up, at least to some degree, as psychotic before he can communicate. Theauditor’s fight to keep from being psychotic, or even seeming psychotic, is such that thisconflict within himself (not because of any emanation from the psychotic, since these people donot emanate) restimulates him. The best way to handle a psychotic is with physical form,making the psychotic mimic the physical form by mimicking, with the physical form, thepsychotic. Thus we have our basic level of mimicry, and thus we have the entering wedge ofcommunication.One-way communication is a first-dynamic operation. Two-way communication is athird-dynamic operation. An auditor who is playing “the only one” does not engage in third-dynamic activities, much less communication, and so he withdraws into one-waycommunication, and thus never lets the preclear emanate any communications, and will notlisten to anything the preclear has to say. To this one fact alone we attribute the breakdown andlack of forward progress of many cases. The auditor did not pay any attention when thepreclear had some vital information he desired to impart.The process involved with running a two-way communication is best entered in the fieldof mimicry, and the best two-way process is then, of course, mimicry. Such a process will begiven in the next PAB.On the subject of communication itself, the auditor must realize that two-waycommunication is part and parcel of every process known in Dianetics and Scientology, and ifit is not established, and if it is not continued, and if no attention is paid to two-waycommunication, only a small amount of benefit will occur. If two-way communication isunderstood as a process, many cases which previously seemed utterly unsolvable can beresolved with considerable ease.CHART OF PROCESSESWHERE THEY ARE ON THE ARC TONE SCALEExteriorized  4.0 Spotting Spots in Space3.63.5 Remedy of Havingness3.13.0 Op.

WHEN NOT ENOUGH DATA TO C/S. “2 way comm to obtain data about caseprogress and status.”2. WHEN PC INFERS SOMETHING IN CASE THAT’S NOT BEEN HANDLED. “2way comm to find what pc thinks should be handled on case.”3. WHEN PC HASN’T COGGED ON END RESULT. “2 way comm on (process just run)to see what thoughts pc had regarding it.”4. WHEN PC’S POST PURPOSE IS BEING CLEANED UP. “2 way comm on how hispost purpose fits into org—or if he can do it.”In all these instances the C/S may be as specific as he likes about what he wants asked orcleared up. In other words the quoted C/Ses above are only examples. Each of the above fourgeneral types can have a great number of different questions. The C/S must be very familiarwith the four types given in capitals above.On his part the auditor can vary the C/S’s question around to get different slants on it.The auditor doesn’t have to get an F/N on the 2 way comm session but often does.The auditor can introduce a curve, an alter-is, by Q and A with the pc and by evaluation.The Drill on 2 way comm is the old ask and listen.A Q and A is of course echoing the pc’s statement. Example: Pc: “I never liked myfather.” Auditor: “What about your father?” Pc: “He was cruel.” Auditor: “What about cruelpeople?” Pc: “I don’t like them.” Auditor: “What else don’t you like?” And so on and on.A correct session is for the auditor to hold to the C/S’s main line of questioning no matterhow he phrases it and listen to and write down what the pc says.Evaluation in auditing 2 way comm is the other deadly sin. The auditor asks and listens.He doesn’t explain anything to the pc. Example: Pc: “I didn’t dig the process.”Auditor: “Well you see that process was intended to ................“ and here we goonEvaluation. Even an auditor’s facial expression can be evaluation.Ask and listen and ack. Prompt only by varying the original question now and then,that’s what the good 2 way comm auditor does.W/SThe 2 way comm worksheet is rather more detailed as to what the pc says than processworksheets."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The C/S needs the data.Or in looking it over the auditor himself, if he’s his own C/S, will need the data.The questions the auditor asks should be noted on the worksheet as a guide.MAXIMIt is a C/S maxim “when in doubt order a 2 way comm”.2 WAY COMM AUDITORAny auditor can 2 way comm. Saint Hillers were best at it. Academy Level Auditors canbe used in this, even Dianetic Auditors.The only reservation is not to assign an auditor whose grade is lower than the pc’s. Theauditor’s class is not as important as his grade. The reason for this is that the OT pre-OT, inbeing 2 way commed by a Grade V, can blow the poor auditor apart or can be stuck with a datawithhold.METERAll 2 way comm is of course done on a meter. It is, however, not a Sec-check orPrepcheck. TA position and needle reaction and F/Ns are important to the C/S.One doesn’t 2 way comm past an F/N, cog and VGIs.  L.

It is a science which has exact rules.Foremost in the rules is:DON’T USE A LISTING QUESTION IN TWO WAY COMM.By a “listing question” is meant any question which directly or indirectly calls for items inthe pc’s answer.Use of “who”, “what”, “which” instantly turns a TWC into a listing question.Listing questions are governed by the rules of Listing and Nulling.If you use a listing question accidentally in TWC you can get the same bad reactions froma pc that you would get on a wrongly done list.The reason for pc upsets in TWC is hidden as it is not apparently a listing process, rarelygets the correction a bad list would get.Asking “who” or “what” or “which” during a TWC after the main question can also turnit into a Listing and Nulling process.TWC questions MUST be limited to feelings, reactions, significances. They mustNEVER ask for terminals or locations.EXAMPLE: “Who upset you?” in TWC causes the pc to give items. This is a LIST.“What are you upset about?” does the same thing. “Which town were you happiest in?” is alsoa LISTING question NOT a TWC question. Any of these results in the pc giving items. Theyare not then nulled or correctly indicated. The pc can get VERY upset just as he would with awrong list. Yet the session is not a “listing session” so never gets corrected.EXAMPLE: “How are you doing lately?” is an example of a correct TWC question. Itgets off charge and gets no list items. “Are you better these days than you used to be?” “Howhave you been since the last session?”“What happened” is different than “What illness”, “What person”, “What town” whichare listing questions.REPAIRWhen other things fail to locate the upset of a pc look into TWC processes in the folderand treat them as L&N processes where the pc has answered with items. The relief is magical.  LRH: ntm.rd L. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1974 Founderby L.

It is a skill.But we have had high and low TAs solved for nearly a year and don’t have to talk themdown anymore as a constant action.Auditors SHOULD know how to do it, and then use it as a rare action.The right way to handle a high TA is to:Do HCO B 24 Oct 71, HCO B 12 Nov 71, HCO B 15 Feb 72, each named FALSE TA ifit has not been done by the auditor on the pc.THEN if TA is high don’t talk it down or do unusual solutions, do a C/S Series 53 or aHi-Lo TA Assessment and handle. The Int-Ext Correction List is done as indicated and so isthe Word Clearing Correction List.As far as a C/S is concerned, when the pc’s TA is seen to be high at session start, heshould order as follows: “Check as per False TA HCO Bs” then when that is done he orders“C/S Series 53 Assess and return to me”.

It is not a new Technique. Ithas been done for many years by well trained Auditors and is done at Flag simply and expertlyas needed.If one understands the anatomy of the Human Mind and what is By-passed Charge hewill understand this simple but important technique.Scientology Auditors of all levels should be able to Talk the TA Down quickly and simplywithout restimulating the pc further.The TA is NOT Talked Down by getting overruns, Ruds or ARC Breaks. It is not doneby Rehabbing Former Releases. It is done by the simple time honored action of ASKING THERIGHT QUESTION, GETTING IT ANSWERED,AND—LETTING THE TONE ARM BLOW DOWN.By letting the Tone Arm blow down, it is meant that the Auditor does not have anyattitudes or ridges toward the Preclear, and lets him blow off Charge which will bring the ToneArm down.THE AUDITOR NEVER INTERRUPTS THE PC WHILE THE TONE ARM ISMOVING .To ask the right question on this technique, you must first know what you are trying toaccomplish.Why do you want to bring the TA down?The Answer is simply, that the TA being high (3.5 or above), indicates that there is somemass the preclear’s attention is on. You want that mass out of the way so that you can direct thepreclear’s attention where you want it.So what you simply do is get the preclear to tell you what is in restimulation so that it willkey out WITHOUT DRIVING THE PRECLEAR FURTHER INTO HIS BANK—ANDTHUS RESTIMULATING MORE MASS.You must not further restimulate the preclear’s bank because it already is restimulated bysomething. The mass is right there. You can see it reading on the meter. But as this is not themass you came into session prepared to run, it would be a Q and A to change the C/S andprogram by running it.So you must DESTIMULATE the pc by having him tell you what it is that his attention ison and thus free his attention so that you can run the Major action.Briefly, in Talking the TA Down, you are freeing the preclear’s attention from where it isso that you can then DIRECT IT WHERE YOU WISH."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"HOW TALKING THE TA DOWN IS DONETalking the TA Down is simply starting the session as usual, and IF the TA is high-3.5 orabove—asking the pc a question such as one of the following—using good ARC, excellentTRs, granting the pc Beingness not soppy or sugary, but being there comfortably and evenpleasantly if the preclear is not upset.Some of the questions you could ask are:“Do you have your attention on any thing?“Is there anything you’d care to tell me?”“Since your last session has anything happened you’d like to tell me about?”“How have things been going lately?”“How have things been going since your last session?”Or on occasion you could ask “Have you had any wins lately?”The question should be phrased to limit the time period to just what the preclear’sattention is on and not to drive him into his bank by restimulating new things.It is LIGHTLY, LIGHTLY, with one eye on the pc and one eye on the meter so you cansee if the Tone Arm blows down and what it blows down on.This does not get wild and complicated. There is no Q and A. Perhaps the pc will say“no” and the question will not have any reaction on the meter. Try another question but stick toone of the types given.If the meter reads and the pc says nothing and the Tone Arm is not blowing down youcould ask “What was that?” or “Did you have a thought there?” (See Fishing a Cognition drill.)You will also find certain subjects the pc mentions give a blow down. These can be usedby noticing them, redirecting the I c’s attention to them when the pc changes the subject and theTA starts up. Example: He says “Mother”, TA blows down, he goes on to “Father”, TA startsup. Casually ask him about his mother again and it will go on down. This is dangerously closeto a Q & A except it manipulates the TA. A little of this goes a long way.When all else fails look back on your W/S for the lowest TA read and redirect the pc’sattention to that subject and you may get your F/N.DON’T GET ACCUSATIVE OR ABUSIVE OR EVALUATIVE.The preclear will answer you and the Tone Arm will start blowing down. Sometimes thepreclear will not answer, but will be looking, and the Tone Arm will start falling.NEVER INTERRUPT WHILE THE TONE ARM IS BLOWING DOWN, EVEN IFTHE PRECLEAR ISN’T TALKING.Write down on the worksheet whatever names, items, events or whatever it was that blewthe Tone Arm down and CIRCLE IT."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"B O A R D T E C H N I C A L B U L L E T I N10 JULY 1970Remimeo REISSUED 28 JUNE 1974 AS BTBAuditors and aboveCANCELSHCO BULLETIN OF 10 JULY 1970SAME ACTION2-WAY COMM - A CLASS III ACTIONAmends HCOB 21 April 1970 2-Way Comm C/Ses And HCOB 3 July1970 C/S Series No. 14, C/Sing 2-Way Comm with regard toClassification of 2-Way Comm actions.2-Way Comm is now classified as a Class III action.

Every one contacted on the track or history had an R6 bank, momentarilykeyed out.This is then the Roller Coaster effect one encounters in one’s own history—OT— aberree—Clear—aberree—OT—aberree, etc, depending on accidental key-outs and keyins of the bank.We are for the first time in the history of the universe making real Clears and real OTs, nobank.You may accidentally make a keyed-out OT as well as a Release.And if you don’t go on auditing even in that session he or she will stay that way.I have good subjective reality on making keyed-out Clear and keyed-out OT in auditing.And also on being overrun.Auditors must be trying for a result not a number of hours. Then they’ll see some of thesephenomena.The trick is stopping when the result is obtained !It can be fatal even to conclude the session in which keyed-out Clear (Release) or keyed-outOT were attained. Just say, “Oh! That’s it!” And STOP. This is true for all attainable phenomena,even getting well. An overrun brings it back.LRH: ml.rd L. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1965by L.

Itsa probably will not recover a floating needlebut will pull down the TA. When it’s down, stop—don’t press your luck too far.The real technical job (other than Itsa) requires expert metering and a thorough knowledgeof dating on a meter and a smooth comm cycle.Best at it would be an auditor who himself was a Former Release and who had himself(or herself) recovered the state.The technically correct procedure is unfortunately a delicate one which requires goodcommand of tech on the subject of the Time Track and perception of the pc and meter alertenough to stop exactly when Re-Release occurs and say “That’s It!” (Never say “End” in suchsessions.)Remember all recovery must be by Key-out, not erasure. Key-outs are done by findingKey-ins. It is de-stimulation, not re-stimulation. Therefore all must be smooth and jolly with noforcing or overrun.The exact tech follows:To regain a Former Release (or Thetan Exterior or Keyed-Out OT [Released OT]):1. Loosely locate the session or time in which it occurred.2. Get in Suppress, Invalidate buttons on the session or time.3. Get in “Unacknowledged” or “What was unacknowledged”.4. Indicate anything found to the pc, as By-Passed Charge.5. Find the Key-in that was Keyed out in that time or session (the person went releasebecause something keyed out in that time or session).6. When this is found and recognized by the pc, the pc will then return to Release orReleased OT.7. If this does not happen, find what keyed in that ended the state and repeat (1) to (6)on it.This is all rough to communicate to the pc who is not well trained."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"This datum will help (a standard datum of early Dianetics): The analytical mind when itbecomes aware of a point in the Reactive Mind, makes it vanish.

But it is the backbone of all auditing.When the person was originally released he had become aware of something that causedthe reactive mind to de-stimulate at that point or become weak. And so he Released. You haveto find that point of sudden awareness again as in ( I ) to (6) above and if you miss it you can atleast find (7).

Don’t overrun.When you have done it, tell the person to get trained so he or she can go on to actualClear.LIABILITYThe Liability in all this is finding the original thing that was keyed in (which when keyedout gave Release).If this happens you have a new key-in in the session you are running right now. It is anew key-in and is handled as one.TECH COMMENTThis tells us that finding and running out key-ins will make a First Stage Release out ofsomeone who has never been one.

The HGC ceased to look for former release grades to rehabilitate and ignoredopportunities to do so on the basis that “outer orgs have rehabbed them all already”. Thiscame out in the Comm Ev held on a D of P of that period. Of course, if the HGC failed torehab earlier grades (or earlier life overruns) it could achieve no later grades or Grade V.This alone would have ended completions promptly on all grades and wiped out thegraph.2. Invalidation of the appearance of a free needle and invalidating any auditor who “thoughthe saw one”. This wiped out all release attainments and made for total overrun of all pcsof all grades. This error existed for 15 years so it is not surprising that it got back inagain.3. Whenever an overrun occurred, “rehabilitation of it” was done by running differenf newprocesses instead of standard rehab routine as in HCOBs, i.e. Doing ARC Break, PTPs,Rudiments, anything but a real rehab of that process that was overrun.4. Abandonment of standard tech in favour of unusual solutions. This is always presentwhen a collapse of Tech occurs.5. One SP was found in the middle of all this but after his departure the statistic did notrecover so one can assume another SP was in the middle of it still or that the HGCremained PTS and didn’t separate from the SP found because he was so convincing, soreasonable and so persuasive as to why aE Tech statistic must remain down.It is interesting that (1) above—ceasing to rehab lower grades—would be absolutely fatalto any upper grades. Therefore this becomes policy:NO UPPER GRADE OF RELEASE MAY BE BEGUN NEWLY ON A PC UN1 ILALL LOWER GRADES ARE FULLY REHABBED TO FREE NEEDLE. THIS APPLIES TOALL GRADES 0 TO VII.Regarding (2)—Invalidation of what a free needle is-and thus running past all freeneedles, let it be noted that t ;is is an Auditor’s Code Break—continuing a process that hasceased to produce change and is therefore a crime. This was wrong too long to be allowed togo wrong again. Thus we get the policy:AN AUDITOR WHO HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE OVERRUN A FREE NEEDLEON A PRECLEAR MUST BE GIVEN AN ETHICS CHIT; AND IF THE ACTION ISSEVERAL TIMES REPEATED, ETHICS MUST ORDER A FULL REVIEW OF THEAUDITOR’S CASE INCLUDING AN EYESIGHT TEST AND CONDUCT A THOROUGHETHICS INVESTIGATION AND HEARING."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Note that a Mark V Meter run with too high a sensitivity does not give a marked changewhen a needle floats. Thus sensitivity must be reduced in ordinary running and increased onlyto get in rudiments. Then a free needle becomes more visible. A Mark V cranked up to 128sensitivity looks like a floating needle all the time at a casual glance on most pcs. Sensitivity 5is ample.Also, meters go out of 5,000 ohm calibration and don’t read on the M and F “Clear”reads and change of electrodes can change M and F “Clear” reads.A free needle, if a process is overrun vanishes with just one extra command so an auditormust be alert.Please also note that this has been part of the Auditor’s Code for ages—running past a flatpoint of a process has been forbidden since the first formulations of the Auditor’s Code.,Regarding (3) Rehabilitation by using other processes—the HCO Bs on rehabs are veryexplicit. To rull another process would clobber the pc. Thus we get the policy:REHABILITATIONS MUST BE DONE BY REHABILITATING THE PC ONLY ONTHE PROCESS OVERRUN AND ONLY BY STANDARD HCOBS ON REHABPROCEDURE.Re (4) unusual solutions - we get the policy:ANY AUDITOR ACCEPTING AN UNUSUAL SOLUTION WITHOUT FILING AJOB ENDANCJERMEN T CHIT OR FOUND USING AN UNUSUAL SOLUTIONMUST BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME AND GIVEN AN ETHICS HEARING.FAILING TO REPORT AN UNUSUAL SOLUTION ADVISED OR USED IS ALSOSO HANDLED. AN UNUSUAL SOLUTION IS ONE EVOLVED TO REMEDY ANABUSE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY.On (5) Statistic failing to recover after an SP is spotted in a department gives us the 2policies:WHENEVER AN SP IS DISCOVERED AND DECLARED IN AN ORGANIZATIONALL HIS ASSOCIATES IN THAT PORTION OF THE ORG MUST BE CHECKEDOUT FOR OR GIVEN AN S & D.andWHEN AN SP IS DISCOVERED IN AN ORGANIZATION, IS DISMISSED ORREMOVED AND THE STATISTIC DOES NOT RECOVER, ANOTHER SP MUST BELOOKED FOR.It is noted that the general condition of the Completion Statistic of Dec 65 to Jan 66 couldbe attributed to the above gross errors.It is now certain that (1) Rehabilitation of earlier grades, (2) Free Needle and (3)Rehabilitation by standard practice are primary targets in our technology for anyone seeking tomess it up and that unwitting tampering with these three things and lack of HCO Enforcementon them will reduce HGC statistics and prevent their recovery.Of course one could also go mad in the opposite direction—(1) rehabilitate earlier gradesendlessly on a pc regardless of how many times a free needle had been obtained, (2) Call anyloosening up of a needle a free needle and (3) refuse to even 2-way comm with a pc underrepair for overrun for fear it violates standard procedure for rehab.The middle course is the correct course in this case. Relax and just be very sure the pc has"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"been properly rehabbed to free needle on each grade up to the one one is going to start bydemanding the awards of release that were granted and if these weren’t ever awarded, then dothe rehabs necessary grade by grade. The only sticky point in this is that if a pc had ever beenrun on a higher grade without rehab of a lower, one must rehab “from the top down” at times,tackling the highest overrun first, but nevertheless doing all of them that were by-passedeventually.The way to recognize a free needle is watch for one. When it happens you will see one.Then you will never afterwards wonder. The free needles available on a case can all beswallowed up by a failure to rehab all grades ever by-passed or overrun. If no free needlesshow up on a case at all then partially rehab any grade available for rehab back and forth untilone has one of them go free needle and then get a free needle on the remainder. Life can also bean overrun and a pc never audited will respond to a rehab of “something overdone”. Thisdoesn’t mean the pc went release before Scientology—it means that purpose overrun thenjams—reh lb of life situations of overrun consists of hitting the purpose that was overrun andwhen this is hit, the pc goes release in PT and was not a release in the past. An example is anoverrun located in 20 AD when the person, alert to Christianity decided to be good, made it andthen overran it for 1945 years. When the purpose was found (to be good) and dated and theoverrun spotted the needle went free. Rough auditing, bad TRs, “letting the pc Itsa” etc canswallow up free needles. Also a totally ARC Broke meter that won’t read at all with badindicators all over the place won’t record a read, looks sometimes like a floating needle, thedifference being the pc has total bad indicators—sour, mean, sad, etc. A free needle occursmost often after a big cognition and the unskilled auditor looks at the pc who is being brightand interesting and just doesn’t see the needle float, asks more questions and overruns, and thefree needle vanishes—when a pc is cogniting, look at the meter not the pc. And the instant theTA starts up and needle goes sticky suspect an overrun and check.As for doing something else rather than Standard Procedure for rehab, plain ignorancecan cause it. The auditor’s desire to help the pc if unaccompanied by solid tech backgroundleads to wild efforts, new processes and anything but cool standard procedure.When the person checking out pcs is also the case supervisor, unusual solutions creep in.The most errors I’ve seen made by a Case Supervisor were made after he had seen the pc ortalked with the auditor. Cases have to be run by report only and auditors have to be supervisedand their sessions listened to by somebody else besides the Case Supervisor. Tech is Tech.There is such a thing as Standard Tech. Pc wild tales and hollow eyes and auditor hobbyhorses have to be kept off Case Supervisor lines. So there must be a person who checks outpcs and supervises auditors and their auditing performance but who never opens his or her faceto suggest instructions about the pc and only writes down that the auditor is rough or theprocess is flat or the process is overrun. The Case Supervisor lives in an Ivory tower. Soundsstrange but unless it’s done that way, wild departures from Standard Rehab Procedure andfrom Standard Tech in general will occur. Hell, all psychiatry went down that drain-thedesperate patient, the desperate measures. Squirrelling stems from the Case Supervisor beingthe auditor supervisor and the pc interviewer. Oil, water, being in two divisions, Commies andFascists, dogs and cats won’t mix. Neither will the personal contacter of auditors and pcs andthe Case Supervisor ever successfully stay crossed. The individual practitioner breaks downonly because he does both auditing and Case Supervision. Auditing is an organization actionwhich is why today we have Field Staff Members and HGCs.Additional notes of things discovered in the investigation of the plummeted statistic onCompletions were:1. Auditors rabbiting out of uncertainty and so stumbling past End Phenomena and floatingneedles.2. Case Supervisor getting auditors to ask leading questions on Pr Pr 2—”Ask the pc if he isinterested in Medical Practices”."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"3. D of P: “Find out what the needle is floating on”.4. Case Supervisor: Told auditor that a floating needle was not the End Pheonomenon of aProcess in which “the TA had to be run out”.5. Lack of knowledge and understanding of the Technology and not knowing the differencebetween such things as Anaten, Secondaries and Engrams by Case Supervisor, D of P,and so confusing auditors.Of course the one thing one can’t technically overcome is an SP keeping an area messedup. His case doesn’t improve because of his intentions and overts and fear of people gettingbetter or being bigger than he. When an SP dominates an area, only Ethics actions can handle.The primary indicator of the presence of an SP in an org is a plummeting statisticimmediately after he starts handling a portion of it.Indifferent leadership, even inaction can’t drive a statistic down. Only active suppressioncan.So watch the statistics and don’t get reasonable when they fall. Either outside the orgsuppression has been brought down on that portion of the org, making it PTS or there is an SPthere. The final answer is what happened just before the statistic fell. If a new appointment wasmade and it fell, unappoint it fast. If nothing cures the down statistic flnd the SP or handle thePTS situation because one or the other are there.Completions stayed down for 15 years. Then we found auditors never noticed freeneedles.

All grades below that are subjectto overrun.Life subjects are subject to overrun before Scientology. The mechanism is this: oneconceived a purpose. He or she succeeded in it, then kept on and overran it. In auditing onehits the purpose and the overrun of it and gets a free needle on it. That doesn’t mean the personwas a release then. It means that the spotting of the purpose and the overrun by auditingproduces a free needle today.It may be necessary to find whole track overruns on some pcs in rehabilitation of grades.If a lot of levels have been run past free needle it may be necessary to take apart the mess like abundle of yarn to get the first free needle. In such a case one rehabs any grade the pc has beenrun on that the pc can remember. One handles this briefly until the pc is happy but notnecessarily to free needle. One then finds another overrun, does the same. One goes on and onlooking for moments the pc felt good about processing at one or another time. If you keep thisup, suddenly you will see a free needle on the pc! Establish what grade it is free on, thenquickly get the needle free on the remaining overrun grades (but not grades pc was never runon). It may be necessary to take into account a whole track overrun of a purpose or even thepurpose to get release, clear or OT.It is all very quick, deft auditing, very much on procedure using standard rehab tech—butno repetitive grind.--------------You won’t see a freeing up of a needle unless you set your sensitivity on a Mark V to astiff needle for the pc. You can increase sensitivity or decrease it as the pc progresses but bysetting the sensitivity so the needle is pretty still and stiff you will see easily a freeing up of theneedle and then a free needle. Using sensitivity 128 will obscure every free needle as the needleis too loose already for the auditor to see any change.--------------Pcs are most apt to go free needle after a big cog. So don’t be so engrossed in looking atthe pc during cognitions. Keep an eye on that needle. And if it goes free, don’t ask anythingelse. Just gently give the pc a “That’s it” and without a chop of comm, ease the pc off to“Declare?” in Qual.

The original purpose still holds—to make a person able to run secondariesand engrams. (Our Tech is still valid, you know, despite the 1950 origin of ARC StraightWire.)ARC Straight Wire was fantastically effective in moving a person from “neurotic” to“normal” .But in running ARC Straight Wire one must use a meter and cease to audit the pc themoment the needle goes free. Don’t keep making the blunder of the ‘50s and early ‘60s.The pc released by ARC Straight Wire can now have secondaries run. When a needlegoes free on a secondary, one again must cease to audit secondaries.The Dianetic Secondary Release can be run on engrams. When the needle goes free whilerunning engrams, one ceases to audit the pc at once.Declares for these lower release grades can be confirmed by Qual and even declared byCerts and Awards by a small note from the Director of Certs and Awards.Thus you can possibly get a Release on the minus scale by assessment of the minus scale,a higher Release by running ARC Straight Wire, an even higher one by running DianeticSecondaries, and yet a higher one by running Dianetic Engrams.

They can be found in HCOB 5 July AD13 and others.There are FOUR WAYS TO USE these prepared lists.1. The auditor starts at the top and takes up each read until he gets one to F/N. In this casethe auditor does not do “Itsa earlier Itsa”. He just cleans each read.2. The auditor starts from the top and on each read cleans it and does Itsa earlier Itsa to F/Nor to a clean no-read and goes on.3. The auditor assesses the list down until he gets a heavy read and cleans that, using Itsaearlier Itsa. Then he can go on to the next heavy read, cleans that. Etc to F/N. In this casehe can get several F/Ns on the same list.4. The whole list is rapidly assessed over and over until one item stays in and that is given tothe pc.UPSET PCWhen a pc is very upset and misemotional the action in 4 above is the only one to use as itis the safest.

As onehas DONE the lists without F/Ning each item, one now has the mystery of what is wrong?The error is reading items from Ruds or prepared lists cleaned to no read but not carriedto F/N.This action (amongst many such refinements) is what makes Flag auditing so smooth andindeed makes it Flag Auditing.When an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible.Yet it is simplicity itself. If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find anearlier item if something does not release. What has been found as a read on a prepared listwould F/N if it were the basic lock. So if it doesn’t F/N, then there is an earlier (or an earlier oran earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/Ning.So the RULE:NEVER WALK OFF FROM A READING ITEM ON A RUDIMENT OR APREPARED REPAIR LIST BEFORE YOU CARRY IT DOWN (EARLIER SIMILAR) TOAN F/N.Example: ARC Brk reads. Pc says what it is, Auditor does ARCU CDEI. If no F/N,Auditor asks for an earlier similar ARC Brk, gets it, ARCU CDEI, etc until he gets an F/N.Example: PTP reads. Carry it E/S (earlier similar) until a PTP F/Ns.Example: L4B: Has an item been denied you? Reads. Answered. No F/N. Is there anearlier similar denied item? Answered. F/N. Go on to next reading item on the list.Example: GF assessed once through for reads. The next C/S must take every item on itthat read, by 2wc or other process, to an F/N.So there is a much more general rule:EVERY ITEM THAT READS MUST F/N.In Dianetics you get the F/N when you run E/S secondaries or engrams to an erasure,F/N, Cog, VGIs."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"In Rudiments, every out rud you get a read on is run E/S to F/N.On a prepared list you take each read to an F/N or E/S to F/N.On an LX list you run each flow chain to an F/N.On GF you get by whatever process an F/N.On Listing by the Laws of Listing and Nulling, your eventual item listed must F/N.So another rule:EVERY MAJOR AND MINOR ACTION MUST BE CARRIED TO AN F/N.There are NO exceptions.Any exception leaves by-passed charge on the pc.Also, every F/N is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained.You take too soon an F/N (first twitch) you cut the cognition and leave by-passed charge(a withheld cognition).I could take any folder and simply write out the ruds and prepared list reading items andthen audit the pc and carry each one to F/N and correct every list so disclosed and wind up witha very shining, cool calm pc.So “Have reading items been left charged?” would be a key question on a case.Using lists or ruds on high or low TAs that are not meant for high or low TAs will getyou reading items that won’t F/N.So, another rule:NEVER TRY TO FLY RUDS OR DO LIB ON A HIGH OR LOW TA.One can talk the TA down (see HCO B on Talking the TA Down).Or one can assess L4B.About the only prepared lists one can assess are the new Hi-Lo TA HCO B 13 Mar 71and possibly a GF+40 once through for biggest read. The biggest read will have a blowdownon it and can possibly be brought to F/N.

We do NOT tell the pc whatthe meter is doing. This changes “Auditing By Lists” in bothrespects. We do not say to the pc, “That’s clean” or “Thatreads”.)AUDITING BY LISTS(Reference: HCO B 14 Mar 71, “F/N Everything”)Use any authorized, published LIST. (Green Form for general review, L1C for ARCBrks, L4B for listed items list errors.)METHOD 3Use meter at a sensitivity so meter needle is loose but it is easy to keep needle at “Set”. Ifsensitivity is too high the needle will be in constant motion as one tries to set the TA. If toolow, the instant read will not be visible. 5 is usual for upper grade cases. 16 is usual for lowergrade or Dianetic cases.Have your meter in a position (line of sight) so you can see the list and the needle or youcan see the needle and the pc. The meter position is important.Hold the mimeoed list close beside the meter. Have your worksheet more to the right.Keep record on your worksheet. Mark the pc’s name and date on it. Mark what list it is on theW/S with Time. It remains in the folder stapled to the W/S.Read the question on the list, note if it reads. Do NOT read it while looking at the pc, doNOT read it to yourself and then say it while looking at the pc. These are the L10 actions andare called Method 6, not Method 3. It is more important to see the pc’s cans than his face as canfiddle can fake or upset reads.TR 1 must be good so the pc clearly hears it.You are looking for an INSTANT READ that occurs at the end of the exact last syllableof the question.If it does not read, mark the list X. If the list is being done through an F/N and the F/Njust continues, mark the Question F/N."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"If the question reads, do not say “That reads”. Mark the read at once (tick, SF, F, LF,LFBD, R/S), transfer the number of the Q to the W/S and look expectantly at the pc. You canrepeat the Q by just saying it again if pc doesn’t begin to talk. He has probably already begun toanswer as the Q was live in his bank as noted by the meter.Take down the pc’s remarks in shortened form on the W/S. Note any TA changes on theW/S.If the pc’s answer results in an F/N (Cog VGIs sometimes follow, GIs alwaysaccompany a real F/N), mark it rapidly on the W/S and say, “Thank you. I would like toindicate your needle is floating.”Do NOT wait endlessly for the pc to say more. If you do he will go into doubt and findmore, also do NOT chop what he is saying. Both are TR errors that are very bad.If there is no F/N, at the first pause that looks like the pc thinks he has said it, ask for anEarlier Similar_____whatever the question concerned. Do NOT change the Q. Do NOT fail torepeat what the Question is. “Was there an Earlier Similar Restimulation of ‘rejected affinity’?”This is the “E/S” part of it. You do not leave such a Question merely “clean”.It does not matter now if you look at the pc when you say it or not. But you can look atthe pc when you say it.The pc will answer. If he comes to a “looks like he thinks he said it” and no F/N, you askthe same Q as above.You ask this Q “Was there an earlier similar______” until you finally get an F/N and GIs.You indicate the F/N.That is the last of that particular question.You mark “F/N” on the list and call the next question on the list. You call this and otherquestions without looking at the pc.Those that do not read, you X as out.The next question that reads, you mark it on the list, transfer the question number to theW/S.Take the pc’s answer.Follow the above E/S procedure as needed until you get an F/N and GIs for the question.Ack. Indicate and return to the mimeoed list.You keep this up until you have done the whole list in this fashion.If you got no read on the list Question but the pc volunteers some answer to an unreadingquestion, do NOT take it up. Just ack and carry on with your mimeoed list.BELIEVE YOUR METER. Do not take up things that don’t read. Don’t get “hunches”.Don’t let the pc run his own case by answering non-reading items and then the auditor takingthem up. Also don’t let a pc “fiddle the cans” to get a false read or to obscure a real one. (Veryrare but these two actions have happened.)BIG WINIf half way down a prepared list (the last part not yet done) the pc on some question gets a"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"wide F/N, big Cog, VGIs, the auditor is justified in calling the list complete and going to thenext C/S action or ending the session.There are two reasons for this—one, the F/N will usually just persist and can’t be readthrough and further action will tend to invalidate the win.The auditor can also carry on to the end of the prepared list if he thinks there may besomething else on it.GF AND METHOD 3When a GF is taken up Method 3 (item by item, one at a time and F/Ned) it can occur thatthe TA will go suddenly high. The pc feels he is being repaired, that the clearing up of the firstitem on the GF handled it and protests. It is the protest that sends the TA up.This is not true of any other list.Thus a GF is best done by Method 5 (once through for reads, then the reads handled).L1C and L4B, L7 and other such lists are best done by Method 3.The above steps and actions are exactly how you do Auditing by List today. Any earlierdata contrary to this is cancelled. Only 2 points change—we F/N everything that reads by E/Sor a process to handle (L3B requires processes, not E/S to get an FIN) and we never tell the pcthat it read or didn’t read, thus putting his attention on the meter.We still indicate F/Ns to the pc as a form of completion.L1C and Method 3 are NOT used on high or very low TAs to get them down or up.The purpose of these lists is to clean up by-passed charge.________An auditor also indicates when he has finished with the list.An auditor should dummy drill this action both on a doll and bullbait.________The action is very successful when precisely done.

Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"HANDLING ARC BREAKSA Lecture given on28 May 1963Thank you.All right, this is what?Audience: 28th.LRH: 28th? 28th of May, A.D. 13.All right. Now, this lecture is not for people with weak hearts. If you can’t take it, why, Iadvise you to go over into the other building there, where they have a speaker, and turn it off.This auditing dissertation here actually is possibly passed by, by the student who is doing othertypes of auditing, but it applies to him very much.I’ve discovered the common denominator to ARC breaks. And that common denominator of allARC breaks, all ARC breaks—is bypassed charge. That’s the common denominator to all ARCbreaks. And that includes, therefore, all misemotion exhibited by the PC at the auditor.Now, we should define an ARC break as the PC’s transfer of attention from the bank to theauditor and a dramatization of the bank directed at the auditor. And that is an ARC break.Now, you can get the mechanics of an ARC break just by dropping your E-Meter, orsomething of the sort, and just calling the PC’s attention off of his bank on to the auditor. TheARC break might not take place, but you have approximated the mechanic of what happens.And the probability is that it will take place. See what I mean?So, we get down to this fundamental, which is not terribly important at first glimpse: butdragging the PC’s attention on to the auditor, you see, and on to the session is a precipitatingfactor even though the PC doesn’t dramatize. You see, that’s beside the point. You’ve draggedhis attention on to the session. Well, that’s an ARC break in sort of reverse.Let’s show you something; you go like this: [clicking switches and rattling noises] You’ve notlaid a fundamental for the ARC break, but you’ve approximated one of its mechanics, don’tyou see? You’ve dragged the PC’s attention on to the auditor.Well, very often when you do this—when you do that, you leave the charge of the session notheld back. See, the charge of the session now is not being as-ised, and therefore provides abackground booster, and the PC “row-rows” at the auditor, see, or becomes annoyed orsomething of the sort, don’t you see?Well, so not even that one falls outside this definition. It’s bypassed charge. See, PC’sattention is on his bank, the auditor does something weird, attracts the PC’s attention off thebank. Then, you see, you’ve bypassed some charge. You’ve left some charge there, the PC’sattention is not on the charge but the charge is restimulated. Do you get that as a simplemechanic?So that in normal course of human events you’re talking to this same PC out of session, youknow, and you drop an anvil on his toe or something of this sort, and he’ll argue with youabout it, but he won’t ARC break. You see? It is not, then, that a social faux pas has takenplace that causes the PC to ARC break. So an auditor very often feels terribly reserved andpreservative of the social amenities and all of this sort of thing, and walks around on tiptoe in asession being terribly polite and so forth. Well, you see, that isn’t necessary to prevent an ARC"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"break. You see?But this mystery is presented: In common course of human events, you make some crack atthis person, and they make a crack at you and you yap-yap, and that’s all there is to it, you see?And in a session, you make the tiniest inference about this person and all of a sudden he’ssplattering all over the walls with an ARC break.Well now, if you understand what you have done, you understand this matter of bypassedcharge and so forth, this most flagrant example (the easiest to observe, don’t you see; theeasiest to observe and actually not of any really very vast importance but I’ve just given as anexample to show you what this is): In the session he’s got his attention on charged areas. Andthen you take his attention off the charged area and put it on the auditor, you bypass charge andthat’s what causes the ARC break, see?He’s about to tell you “ . . . and then they drowned me in a well.” He’s saying, “And I—I—I’m standing here, and I’m looking down into the thing, and there’s somebody grabs me by thearm, I can feel his arm, and he’s about to throw me over . . . “And you say [switch clicks] “Just—just a minute. Let me see if I can get some charge on this.Let’s see, [click] I—I beg your pardon, my meter . . . I don’t know, I guess I forgot to chargethe thing,” or something like that. And the PC goes splatter!Oh, that’s very obvious, you see, what’s happened there. See, he’s got all this charge he’ssitting down on, and all of a sudden his attention comes off of it, and you in effect havebypassed the charge right there.Well, now, the other part of it is, is he is being cause over the charge, right? As long as he’srunning it he’s being cause over it, see? All right. Now, the moment that his attention is flickedoff of it he is now the effect of that charge. And any tone level or Know to Mystery Scale levelhigher than the chronic tone of the PC . . . Now, get this; you know what chronic tone is, theold Know to Mystery Scale? Boy, we’re back amongst the familiar tools here these days, youknow? The Know to Mystery Scale, the Expanded Tone Scale, you see—all of those thingsquite valid, see? And let’s say the PC is at apathy as a chronic tone, you see that’s pretty high,by the way. Very few PCs are there; they’re more or less kind of wood, you know? They’reway down below that.The other day I suddenly realized that I was feeling continuously apathetic, and I thoughtsomething is happening, my auditing is doing me in or something of the sort. I went aroundlike that for about twenty-four hours and then suddenly realized it was I, a free thetan, whowas feeling apathetic. All of a sudden, you know, any consequences of it blew, you see? And Irealized suddenly I was feeling much better than I had for a long time. See, I hadn’t felt likemyself, a free thetan, for some time. You know? You get the idea? I mean, gradually the ToneScale had come up, you see, not as Ron or human being, you see, but had gradually come up,up, up. See, I’d feel pretty good as Ron, you see? Fine, feel very high-toned. But I’d come up,up, up, and I didn’t get the sneaker of it. And the first emotional response you get to it isfeeling apathetic. You know, “Well, guess I’m not worth much. Look what they’re doing overin the States these days, you know? People talking about rerunning Kennedy. You know?”You know, I was kind of thinking about things that way, you know? And all of a sudden—”Hey, that’s me!” you know? “Me! That’s me I’m feeling about! “ And it felt wonderful. Was agreat feeling after that. I went around and enjoyed it, you know?Well, actually, a PC will come up through degradation as a chronic tone, and actually will comeup from unconsciousness as a chronic tone. We had a PC over in the States. I mean, it isn’tanything esoteric, you know; he just lies there conked out all the time. You try to audit him andhe—conk—you know? And audit him and—conk. And talk to him—conk—you know? Andhe’s actually existing above his chronic tone. His chronic tone is unconsciousness. And so thisboy, of course, you process him now to get rid of his unconsciousness—well, cut your throat;you’ll never get anyplace, you see? You just have to generally process his case with processes"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"which are real to him and bring up a general case advance, and the unconsciousness willdisappear. You see that as a different look?That doesn’t mean that there are chronic tone levels of maladies, you know? You don’t havemaladies as chronic tone levels, but anything above— anything above—the PC’s chronic tone,you see, being higher than the PC, can be cause over the PC and therefore become adramatization.There is nobody more amazed than the PC to find himself in raging anger in a session. He’sabsolutely flabbergasted! Well, some charge gets bypassed, and he doesn’t know where Solook, he doesn’t know what charge is bypassed, he doesn’t know where to look. He looks atthe auditor—the auditor doesn’t even have to fiddle with the E-Meter, see? He looks at theauditor and there is something, you see, and anger or something like that, being higher on theTone Scale and contained in the incident which has been missed, causes the PC to dramatize.And the PC is actually as helpless as a dish towel in a hurricane. He’s totally helpless. He says,“Ohh-aww, what’s going on?” And he’s shouting and screaming at the auditor, you know?Well, you can get somebody who is dramatizing effort. You know, he’s got to pick up thechair and break it in half, you know, something like that? That’s a pretty low-leveldramatization, that particular one. Anger is more common. Bored is something you very oftendon’t recognize as a dramatization. PC is getting along fine, and all of a sudden ARC breaksand feels very bored.Now, similarly, you could go further and find a PC ARC break into a total manic. I have neverseen this, but by extrapolation, you could say he would become very manic, you see terribly,wildly enthusiastic, with glaring eyeballs, you see? Be an ARC break.So an ARC break, then, comes about whenever charge is bypassed, which then puts the PC atits effect point. And the PC then dramatizes the charge that has been bypassed. This is actuallyfar simpler than it sounds. I’m just giving you all of the ramifications of it, giving you all of theramifications of it. These are the mechanics involved in the thing.Now, the remedy for an ARC break is to locate and indicate the bypassed charge, at whichmoment the ARC break ceases. Now, that could be interpreted by a Q-and-A artist as meaningyou have to go and run the bypassed charge right now. You see, he goes into a do. No, thatgets into impossibility. You find yourself fifth on the chain. You are running the fifth engramand the PC is ARC breaking on the chain. Well, then you would interpret it and say, “Well,you can’t possibly run the fifth engram because the PC will ARC break,” you see? Some Q-and-A artist would interpret it at once, you see, in that category. And you will find them doingso no matter if I’ve said so. And if you’ll just remember I’ve told you this and remember thisparticular mechanic, you can prevent this other consequence from taking place.And the consequence is this: Well, the PC is ARC breaking, running this engram, so thereforeyou have to at once go run the earlier engram. And that is not what I have told you. If that werethe case, then to prevent everybody from ARC breaking would require continuous auditing.See, that is not the remedy. The remedy is to find and indicate the bypassed charge. And theARC break ceases, right like that. Find and indicate the bypassed charge. It’s actually as simpleas that. Nothing to it.Now, you are, all of you, cognizant of the trick of turning off somebody’s anger at you bysaying “somebody’s missed your withholds.” Sometimes it doesn’t work. Sometimes itdoesn’t work. The person just gets more insulted. Well, that’s because a missed withhold isn’tthe source of the bypassed charge. You just indicated the wrong bypassed charge.But this fellow does have missed withholds, somebody has missed a withhold on him insession, he doesn’t even know this, and he’s ranting and raving at you, or something of thesort, and you say, “Boy, somebody missed a withhold on you, man.” He cools right down."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"It isn’t, as you might think, that it introverts him so that he immediately begins to look aroundinside of his skull, “I wonder what the missed withhold is,” and so pulls him off of your neck.That isn’t what’s happened there. You take a good, close look at it. Get some experience onthis and get some reality on it yourself, and this material will really be in your grasp.Now, sometimes you’ve said to somebody, “Well, somebody missed a withhold on you,man,” and the person has said, “Goddamn, don’t you pull that on me!”Well, it wasn’t a withhold that was missed, see? Somebody missed a goal. Get the ides? And ifyou were to pursue it right then and say “Well, let’s see, was it—it was probably a goal thatwas missed. Probably somebody missed a goal on you—missed a whole GPM. Somebodymissed a whole RI. Somebody’s missed some RIs on you.” And he’s just about to let out ofhis mouth a horrendous scream and follow this thing through, and he all of a sudden says, “Iwonder if it could have been a missed RI? Probably was.” See?So the trick of turning off an ARC break is to find and indicate the bypassed charge. But itmust be the charge that was bypassed. See, that’s where the accuracy comes in. And thatmakes you an artist.Now, it’s still within the realm of scientific approach still within the realm of scientificapproach—because there are only a few charges that can be missed. See? There’s engrams andGPMs and goals and RIs, an engram more basic on the chain or an incident more basic on thechain, or a failure to acknowledge, or a refutation of reality, or a rejection of affinity.This character is feeling you’re a pretty good auditor and you say, “Ah, nuts!” see? All right,he’s got a charge there of affinity, see, and that isn’t acknowledged and you bypass it. Yourejected it. So you get this thing firing back in your face. Don’t you see what that is?Now, these are not mechanisms which are totally relegated to session, but they relegatethemselves to life. Now, you’re a registrar and somebody is coming in, or you’re signing upPCs. (All of you have to wear a registrar’s hat at one time or another.) And you’re trying to getsomebody to get some auditing, you’re a registrar, see? And there you are one fine day with ayow-yow-yow and a scream-scream-scream standing in front of your face: Seventy-five hoursof auditing have been delivered—he feels terrible! He says, “Oh, I could kill everybody in theplace,” and he ought to go out and sue everybody, and he’s going to inform the governmentthat so on and so on and so on and so on—yap, yap, yap, you never hear such a thing. Don’tworry too much about the threats, because the person totally lacks direction. Person will gohalfway down the steps and change his mind and do something else, don’t you see? They’reincapable of carrying forward a program that has any cohesion or direction, see?Now, you actually are very foolish to engage this individual in any reasonable conversation,because it’s not a reasonable situation. That attitude is wholly the product of bypassed charge.And as registrar, you simply should hunt and punch around till you find the bypassed charge.That’s all, just hunt and punch around till you find the PC’s bypassed charge. All of a suddenthe thing expires. It just goes, because you’ve found and indicated it.Be perfectly all right to just grab a meter, and—trying somehow or another, to get him to holdthe cans—and just give him the standard sort of an assessment: “Did somebody run an engramtoo late on the chain?” you see? “There’s a more basic engram run? Oh, clang. That fired. Ah,yes. Well, somebody was running an engram on you and there’s an earlier engram.”“Oh, is there? Yes, you know, yeah.”Where’s all this rage? Well, you see, the rage is an automaticity. And I have told you often,often, often, often, often, the tenuous character, the extremely delicate, balanced character ofneurosis and psychosis (and such other nasty words) makes it almost impossible not to undo it.Because it is incapable of continuation. at is set up in such a delicate balance that almostanything can make it slip, if it’s effective. You understand that?"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"You see, some guy is down in a padded cell someplace, and he’s a “raving gamaniac” and he isscreaming away and throwing stools at the warders and so forth. And although I don’t blamehim for throwing stools at these blokes, this is the point: His condition is not a condition ofterrible, difficult, hard, mean, impossible-to-reach, go-on-forever dramatization, see? That isnot true. Actually, the difficulty of maintaining such a state—it’s almost impossibly difficult.You can make it go bzzzt! And all of a sudden it no longer hangs in balance and can’t go ondramatizing.You’ve heard me talk to you before about the slip: old ARC Straightwire, the way you canknock apart a neurosis—the difficulty of maintaining a neurosis. Old ARC Straightwire hasbroken up more neuroses than you can count. Its too difficult for the PC to go on beingneurotic on this particular point.And this, of course, is at wild variance to the commonly held belief. The commonly held beliefis a person is psychotic—well, that’s it, they’ve had it, you see, and they’re psychotic, andthat’s all you can do about it. You can’t do anything about it, you see, because it’s a verytough, vigorous, dangerous, enduring condition. See, that’s the commonly held belief. Theybelieve that a neurosis is a fantastically arduous thing.Read a funny story: People send me clippings all the time. I get lots of clippings (appreciatethem). And one of the clippings I got the other day was a yap-yap about a psychiatrist; it wasvery funny. It seems like he’d been treating this fellow—he’s telling his story, you see? Andhe’d been treating this fellow for four years at an hour a day. He’d had a tremendous success,the psychiatrist was saying, because when the fellow first came to him, why, he just feltterrible all the time, because—he just felt terrible all the time because he just had this urge to killsomebody. And so he gave him an hour’s treatment every day for four years, and at the end ofthat time, why, the fellow walked into the office, and the psychiatrist knew he’d had awonderful success because the fellow said he just felt wonderful, he just felt wonderful, he’dnever felt better, and so forth, and that neurosis that he had been working with, that alwaysused to make him feel terrible, now made him feel wonderful. And as the fellow pulled the ironbar out of his pocket, the psychiatrist said . . . And that was the end of the story.In other words, there are two things, you see, that argue in favor of a lie in this direction: One,the absence of technology and the absence of understanding of these states combines with theprofessional need of tough cases.You see, if psychosis wasn’t unsolvable and very tough and very enduring and very terrible,you wouldn’t find the U.S. (ha!) government shelling out sixteen billion quid (or bucks orwhatever they’re using these days) to build themselves up endless numbers of sanitariums, andten research centers. They’re going to build ten research centers and so forth. And they mighteven get up to prenatals in these things, you know, because they’ll probably use our work.Man, look at the kitty! Sixteen billion, see? And that’s just the initial appropriation. That’sgoing to cost five billion a year afterwards. The armed-forces construction program of theUnited States is only 1.6 or 1.8 billion. Give you some weird perspective? That is fantastic.Well, look at the vested interest in psychosis being incurable. These nuts that are in charge ofthe nuts will never do anything, of course. It’s worth too much to them not to. Somebodycomes along and said, “All you have to do is find and indicate the bypassed charge and theperson go OT! and he’s sane.”“Oh,” they’d say, “take that nut out and kill him, ha-ha-ha-ha! He’s about to cost us sixteenbillion hard-earned legislative bucks! Ha! Shoot him.”It’s not for nothing the FDA is mad at us. You see, they don’t for a moment believe any of theircharges. See, they have made a comprehensive, thorough investigation all up and down theland, and they haven’t found one single human being who ever was told that an E-Meter wouldcure anything. But they’ve invented the statements. Why? Well, we constitute a fantastic threatto a fantastic vested interest."},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"These are not men of good will. They’re caved-in dramatizers themselves. Never make thaterror. You can very easily make that error. These guys are dramatizing. I don’t know—muchcare what they’re dramatizing, but they themselves are doing a heavy, hard dramatization, bywhich they say, “We can do what we do without conscience, because man is after all an animaland is nothing.” See, so they spread the plea that man is an animal and is nothing as an effort toget over committing overts. So this hangs them with being an animal and being nothing.I imagine that if you took thirty psychiatrists—I know it’s unpopular to talk about these people,but if you took thirty psychiatrists at random, at least one of those thirty would be sitting therebarking. If you just called on thirty in a row.You think I’m kidding—try it sometime. I’m not kidding. These people need help probablyworse than their own patients. How would you like to be able—to be up against something thatyou advertisedly considered incurable, totally damaging, nothing could be done about it, andyou’re collecting money right and left to do something about it? Krrrrr! That’s a pretty nastyposition for anybody to work himself into.Now, we probably cut those blokes off by my continuous saying this and that, we probablydeny them help one way or the other. But every time I have ever tried to work with any groupof psychiatrists or anything of the sort, the only thing they’ll send me is one of their numberwho has already gone potty. This bird’s around the bend or something like that. And I’ve neverbeen able to teach them anything. And they actually have worn out their welcome with me,that’s all. But I would still help them today.That’s beside the point. The point I’m making on the thing is that you can work yourself into aposition where you consider an ARC break unremediable, terribly powerful andoverwhelmingly destructive, so that you will label certain PCs as ARC-breaky PCs. You canfear this ARC break, you see? You can become afraid of these ARC breaks occurring. And thatcan make you unwilling to audit, or if you don’t even go that far, will rough you up enough todo a stinking auditing job, which of course causes more ARC breaks. You got that?So unless you corral the ARC break unless you yourself get a good reality on handling theARC break, unless you understand this one and you develop the skill necessary to find andindicate the bypassed charge—that’s the only skill you’ve got to develop—you’ll Bet into aposition where you’ll audit for a while and then feel like it isn’t worth the candle and man is nogood, and go the route, man! Another half a century you’ll be telling Congress, “Well, we needsixteen billion dollars because—to handle the nuts.”You see, what you’ve got to break through with you is, one, a condemnation of ARC breaks.They don’t mean anything; they’re not diagnostic in any way, shape or form. They’re notdiagnostic, that’s all. They don’t tell you the ease with which a PC runs or the unease withwhich he runs. They tell you nothing. See, the PC who runs like a well-oiled player piano mayARC break all over the ceiling. And some PC that you couldn’t get a gain on with a buildingjack never APES breaks at all. So, you see, it’s no indication at all. There’s no index there.The PC who is very easy to audit very often is the PC that is very hardest to get a gain on. Andthe PC who is very difficult to audit very often gets the highest gains. So, you see, these arenot coordinated factors. So this is something that should tell you that temporary or permanentconditions of misemotional stress are something that you have to face up to as an auditor or justget out of the auditing chair. It’ll catch up with you sooner or later, man.I catch myself every once in a while in some kind of a session: PC says, “Row-row, row-row-row-row, row-row-row-row-row.” See? “You just ask me for one more of those suppresseson this RI and I’m going to blow! Because there aren’t any suppresses left on the RI!” You getthat kind of an approach?I say to myself, “This PC’s trying to convince me that I mustn’t take the charge off the RIs.This PC is in a big sell.” See?"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Well, actually that would be the inevitable effect of it. I eventually would say, “Well, all right.And all right, that rocket-read,” you know. “It rocket read,” and so on. Get the next one, thenext one, the next one, and so on. “All right. Yeah, you’ve finished the bank. To hell withyou,” you know? See?You’re doing the very thing you must have done in the first place that caused the ARC break.And you got to get some wins on this, auditor—you got to get some wins on this. This oneyou got to get wins on.I want you to get a confidence that when a PC goes row-row-row, that you can find thebypassed charge, either just by knowing what it must be or by glancing over—because itcouldn’t be anything else because you weren’t doing anything else, don’t you see?—andchecking on a meter, or going into a full-dress parade of assessment to get the bypassedcharge, however you get that bypassed charge, find it, and then by indicating it to this PC,realize the tool that is in your power. By the fact that the mere indication of it turns off the ARCbreak, right like that. You didn’t do a thing about it except indicate it.How do you indicate it? You say to the PC whatever you say to the PC that indicates it, that’sall. I mean it’s as elementary as that. There isn’t any hidden magic here. It’s not like that ifyou—if I can teach you now how to make gold. And the way to learn how to make gold, theway to make gold is to go up at twelve o’clock on a night of the full moon, and sit down on apunky stump with two pounds of lead and one pound of Arsenic. Rub these two together, andif you don’t think of the word hippopotamus you will find you have made gold.” See?Impossible completely impossible assignment.Now, this—this is not an impossible one. This lies well within your reality, your action, yourability and so forth. There isn’t anything else spotted here, see, that is esoteric or outside. Ididn’t mean to degrade your reality or anything like that; I’m saying, just, it’s something thatyou can have a reality on right now. The only times you’ll miss on this, you very often willpick it up a session or two later. You had an ARC break, bow! and you couldn’t find anythingto—and then nothing happened, and you couldn’t cure the thing, and blood! and you couldn’tdo anything about it. And two sessions later you find out—my God, you had passed a wholeGPM. You all of a sudden remember, “Hey! Two sessions ago when I jumped that bank, youknow, I got that next goal, and—ha-ha! And we just found out that in between there is the goal‘to spit.’ Hey, what do you know. Ho-ho!”And you say to the PC, “Hey, what do you know about that.” And the PC gets very calm all ofa sudden.You very often find out a couple of—some time afterwards what the bypassed charge was, andthat will make you very enthusiastic on what I’m saying just now. You’ll get more enthusiasticthan that, because you find out it’s an invariable fact. It doesn’t vary. Why didn’t you find thebypassed charge at the time the charge was bypassed?Now, the rest of it is, you actually shouldn’t let an ARC break endure more than two or threeminutes, because ARC breaks multiply by the square. See, they’re not a lineal development.You let an ARC break run one minute and it doubles. You let it run two minutes and itquadruples. You let it run three minutes . . . You get the idea? There it goes. This thing isdeveloping on a very steep curve. And you actually owe it to the PC—not because you’reafraid of it, but because you’ll have more trouble and waste more session time—you owe it tothe PC to get in and turn it off fast.Now, you see, a whole government can be intimidated by a riot. The United States governmentis actually being conducted today by riot. The only people who get any attention or get anythingpassed are those people who riot. See? The Japanese government went by the boards becausethere was a riot. Somebody went down and slipped a few yen to a few students and they wentup and went yow-yow-yow, and Eisenhower was unable to visit the country, and so forth(because, after all, students are pretty dangerous, you know?). And can’t have all that"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"shouting, you know, and so forth, and the government fell.This government—my hat’s off to this government. They “Ban the bomb,” you know, and thepolice go out and pick them up and put them away. And they “Ban the bomb,” and the policego out and pick them up and put them away. And I don’t think there’s been a ripple inParliament. I don’t think Parliament has even heard about it. It’s very, very remarkable.They’ve gotten used to that over here, see? So they’re not being run by riot. Get this as amethod of government: running a government by riot.There are many methods of government which I have studied from time to time and been calledto my attention, and so on, which aren’t in the civics textbooks. You know? You elect themayor, and the mayor does this and the aldermen do that and all that sort of [thing]. Thesearen’t in the civics textbook, but they are basic methods of government. Government byassassination: There are many texts on this subject. Texts!The government of Japan, for some vast, vast, vast period of time, was run by the BlackDragon Society.Some bird dramatizing the Helatrobus implants. I think they’re called the Sharif Mohammedansor something like that, they were at the time, from which you get the word assassin. OldHashshashin, the Old Man of the Mountain, used to kidnap young fellows and tell them thatwhen they got killed they could come back to paradise. He’d give them a few days in paradise,you know, and he’d get a lot of good-looking dolls and rivers of milk and honey and all thatsort of thing, and the guy up there—that’s where you get the word hashish too. They’d get thisyoung fellow in some cafe and feed him some hashish, take him up there, and these babeswould chuck him under She chin for a few days, and then the old man with the false halowould come around and say, “Now, son, the way you get back here and live forever in perfectenjoyment is to do exactly what we say.”“And what is that?”“Well, go get yourself killed, of course.”“Well, how am I going to let myself killed?”“Well, you have to assassinate the sultan of Persia.”Well, the young fellows look at these girls and all the curves, and he’d say, “Tsk, tsk! Whynot?” See? And the next drink of wine they slipped to him, why, it’d have some more hashishin it, and he’d wake up in the capital of the shah. Next time the shah walked through the streetsor rode through the streets or something like that, there he was and off went the shah’s head,see? Of course, the guards would kill the fellow, but that was exactly in the plans. And a lot ofyoung fellows got surprised by not being able to find the top of this mountain again, and therethey were.But that was government by assassination. And all the Old Man of the Mountain ever had to dowas just indicate to the Chinese head of state that he’d like a couple of camel loads of gold,please, and they would be on the way at once. Everybody was terrified of this person.Government by assassination. Any policy could be laid down, anything else, because of thisfear of assassination.This lasted a couple of hundred years, by the way, and it’s oddly enough, a directdramatization of the Helatrobus implants.The Helatrobus implants didn’t have that as a purpose. They just had a purpose as doing youin—it was far more elementary. That’s why they’re so easy to deal with. They’re somonomanic on the subject. You were supposed to be human, have a body, not By aroundanymore, not trouble anybody. And then you were supposed to have such diverse purposes"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"that you could never unite on a single cause. Easy to govern. Yes, I must say so. But, ofcourse, the Helatrobus government never got around to establishing the government they hadthen set up. Rest their bones, rest their bones.They must have had the whole galaxy laid out for a total conquest. And they were too covert toever take over. See, their conversion became the order of the day, you see? And they couldnever assert dominion of what they’d set up. Interesting. Interesting point. I see that thatsaddened you. Don’t worry about it, don’t worry about it. We can straighten that up.Anyhow, getting back on this other: You realize that if you governed all of your actions byreason of ARC breaks, you’ll get a government of Scientology by ARC break. And you as anauditor, in your auditing actions, will be governed by ARC breaks. Do you see that? Do yousee that? That’s why I was taking this political excursion, just to show you there that it ispossible to have your actions governed by that.You are never governed by that which you can handle with ease. So therefore the greater thefacility you develop in handling ARC breaks, the less you are governed by ARC breaks, untilyou’re not governed at all by ARC breaks. It just becomes another phenomenon. PC’s nose isrunning or he starts tears leaking out of his eyes, hand him a Kleenex. Has an ARC break,why, locate and indicate the bypassed charge. Bang-bang, you see? And keep on with whatyou’re doing. You got it?Now at first, at first in developing these activities, you will make mistakes as to what thebypassed charge [is] on, and your faith still quiver and grow faint. And you’ll say, “The ARCbreak must be caused by something else, because look, I found and indicated the charge andthe PC still has an ARC break. Therefore there must be something about this that Ron did nottell us.”No, there was something about it that you didn’t hear. You have to find and indicate the rightbypassed charge. There are only a few of them, but you have to find the right one. And theARC break vanishes at once. Therefore, there is no reason under the sun to have ARC-breakysessions. No reason to keep a PC ARC breaking.Now, those PCs who have continuously ARC-broken sessions can be run on a process whichis the three-way ARC break process. I’m not talking now about they have an ARC break, yourun this process. You get that one wrong way to and I’ll get cross, because we used to haveprocesses to handle the ARC break. But they won’t handle the immediate ARC break, youunderstand? We’re not interested in a process that handles the immediate ARC break. We gotthat technology and it’s much faster than a process.But somebody whose bank is mixed up because of ARC breaks has this other ARC breakprocess. And an auditor who has gotten himself stuck around and messed up because he hasjust run too many ARC-breaky PCs, with this run on him, finds it all stripped away. “Inauditing,” you know, “what attitude has been refused?” You know, the “In auditing, whatreality has been rejected?” “In auditing, what communication has not been acknowledged?” It’sthat trio. And they’ll straighten up, using “in auditing” as a prefix, more auditing than anyquantity of mid-rud buttons.I’ve gotten a repetitive process which upscales this. We needed a repetitive process at this timefor many reasons. But there is a doll, because this one even runs an implant. You see, we havegood history on this process, because this is old ARC Straightwire. Nineteen fifty-eight, theonly thing that’d go into implants and open them wide open was ARC Break Straightwire.Remember that process, 1958? All right, this is the immediate successor. And here’s one of themost worked-over areas of repetitive processes known. It’s based, of course, on the wholetechnology of the ARC triangle. Now I’m giving you the rest of the technology.Why does it work, you see? Because it does nothing but spot bypassed charge. That’s how Iredeveloped it and redeveloped it, you see? And I got it redeveloped along this line. And there’s"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"trick ways of clearing the auditing command and so forth I’ll put into your hands so that youcan do an assessment on certain words, so the PC has a complete understanding of what you’redoing. And this is a doll. It isn’t any too-little, two-bit process.Well, what I’m getting around to here is your attitude on the subject of ARC breaks must neverbe one whereby you’re driven by the ARC break. Because you’ll be driven, man, into notgetting the items clean. You’ll be driven into taking the PC’s orders, because a PC ARC breaksjust for so much time and then starts to issue orders because his duress is so great, and thoseorders are the direct result of dramatizations. So, the orders are the significance. See, he’sdramatizing the significance contained in what you just put him at the effect of. See, not only ishe capable of dramatizing the emotion of the bypassed charge, but he’s also capable ofdramatizing the significance contained in the bypassed charge. And therefore it’s a verydangerous thing to take the orders—it’s very dangerous to the PC to take the orders of a veryARC-broke PC. Very dangerous—to the PC, not to you.So what’s this add up to? This adds up to two things: that you should learn to handle bypassedcharge, and be good enough as an auditor not to ever bypass charge! Period! How do you dothat? Well, just get hot, man.How can you bypass charge? You can bypass charge by not finding any. You get a PC who ison suppress, suppress, suppress and is all upset and going sideways, and you try to find thenest goal. You’re pressing on with the session in the teeth of some kind of a weird, apatheticARC break or a low morale, see? So you do this list, only he never puts the goal on the list. Heputs some other goal three goals down the bank on this list. You take that goal, you see,because you can’t do anything else and so forth, and you just really can’t do a good job on it.So you take this goal and you bypass a couple of GPMs. Now, brother, you’re going to have apicnic.See, you were driven into auditing somewhat carelessly or apathetically or defensively orsomething of the sort, so you did a bad job of auditing and then you laid in more charge—bypassed, see? You didn’t lay in more charge, you bypassed more charge. See? The harderyou are driven into doing a bad job, then the more charge you bypass. So then you try to findthe top oppterm of this new one you found; it doesn’t fire. Got two GPMs ahead of it. Or youtry to find its terminal, and that takes you two sessions.What do you think the magnitude of built-up charge is by this time on the bypassed charge?The bypassed charge is always prior to the charge you were working, you see—always prior.What do you think this does? Well, it just confirms the bypassed charge.The reason you can’t get any place with what you are doing is because you have bypassedcharge. And therefore look on the ARC break as a blessing in disguise. It tells you, even moreaccurately than the meter, that you have bypassed some charge. Well, it tells you haven’t gotbasic on the chain of the engrams, regardless of the meter. Meter sometimes—”Is there a morebasic incident on this chain?” The meter doesn’t do a thing; it just sits there and does nothing. Ifthe PC ARC breaks, well, brother, there is a more basic incident on that chain. In other words,he can look deeper than the meter, see?You’ve said, “All right, now let’s pick up the first incident. Good. What are you looking at?”“Oh, I’m looking at the clouds going by here.”“All right. Good. Now, see anything else around you?”“Yeah, I see this black cord that seems to be coming down from the sky.”“All right. Now go to the moment just before that black cord reaches the ground or reachestoward you.”"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"PC ARC breaks. Well, you say, “Well, I’m—I was just sitting here trying to run the basicengram on the chain, and it said on the meter that it was the basic engram, and . . . and . . . hu-uh-mm-mm.”Don’t feel so damn pathetic. You ask him to go to the beginning, so that restimulated it. Andthen he didn’t get there, and he saw a picture that was the fifteenth incident. And you started torun the fifteenth incident; there were fourteen before it. So the PC ARC broke.Now, you say, “Well, I’ve got to run this incident, because I can’t get any trace of the earlierincidents unless I run through this one once. So therefore I don’t dare run through this oneonce because the PC will ARC break.” Not unless you haven’t heard a word I said in thislecture. See, you won’t be able to if you haven’t heard a word I’ve said. You will always haveto run the basic and, of course, it’s not available. It’s seldom available till you’ve peeled off acouple off the top Of it. Look at the trouble you’re having trying to get the first goal on the firstseries. Look at the trouble you’re having. Why are you having trouble? That’s because you’vegot to audit a few later ones to get the charge off enough to find the first one.Well, all right, isn’t that automatically bypassed charge? No. It’s bypassed charge, but you’vealready cured the ARC break. How? You told the PC, “I can’t find the first goal right now andit’s undoubtedly there; we’re going to run the one we’ve got our hands on.” So you’ve alreadyfound and indicated the charge. So the PC won’t ARC break, of course, because he knowsthere’s charge up ahead.All right. All you have to do is find and indicate the basic—the fact that there is a basic on thechain. Well, the PC ARC breaks start to run this chain.You just try it on for size. You say, “Well, you know, the engram that we’ve just started intohere, that’s evidently late on the chain, isn’t it?” And you look at your E-Meter and it’ll fireright about that time, because you said, “Now, we’re going to run the one we get through sowe can get back earlier.” “Oh, well—oh, yes? All right, fine.” And the PC’ll go right throughit.He’ll run the eighty-ninth on the chain, as long as he knows not even that it’s the eighty-ninthbut that there’s an earlier one on the chain. It’s that elementary. It’s that elementary.Now, why does a PC ARC break when you’re putting in rudiments? Well, the rudiment is outin the incident that you are running, and of course that’s prior to the session. You try to put therudiment in, in the session; it is out in the incident, so of course you’ve bypassed the charge,so therefore the PC ARC breaks and said, “All you’re doing is sitting there running mid rudsand mid ruds and mid ruds, and you’re mid-ruding me to death.” See, that’s just another caseof bypassed charge.PC ARC breaks in mid ruds, you don’t have to find it. In fact, you better hadn’t. There’sprobably a suppress in the incident. See, you’re running suppress and the PC ARC breaks.You say, “Well, in the incident we’ll probably run there’s probably a suppress.”And the PC—”Oh, yes!” That’s the end of the ARC break. You understand? You get howmany ways this cookie crumbles? See? It’s the number of ways this pie can be cut. It’s alwaysbypassed charge.And what’s that make you for chickening off on cleaning an RI? What’s that do, when becausethe PC is so ARC breaky and restive that you don’t get all the charge out of an RI? What doesthat set up? What does that set up for the next two or three RIs? Learn to think in those terms. Itsets up an ARC break, of course. Because you didn’t get the charge off the RI, the next RInow has bypassed charge behind it. Least that’ll happen is your PC’s morale goes down, andyou can’t get the charge off the next one. And you get a cumulative error. See? But, of course,you are so protective of your skill as an auditor you never say to the PC, “Hey, I don’t thinkI’ve gotten any of the charge off the earlier incidents in this bank.”"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"And the PC says, “Oh, no? Haven’t you? Well, careless of you.” And that’s the end of thatARC break.Look at the cumulative error. Item one: you got it to fire; it fired over a sixteenth of an inch,sensitivity 128 on the meter. “Well, that’s the end of that one. All right, what opposes it? ‘Nixscrambled eggishness.”’ You know? “All right, that fired a sixteenth of an inch.” So you say,“Good. All right, let’s take the next one, number two. ‘Absolutably scrambled eggishness.’You know? Well, that ticked. Well, that’s good enough. There probably wasn’t any charge onit. Probably the speaker was out that day. So let’s get the next one. ‘Nix scrambledeggishness.’ Hm-hm. That fell slightly.” (Tone arm went up so you got “tone arm action” onit!) “Oh,” you say, “well,-I better get industrious. ‘Perfectably scrambled eggishness.’ I betterget industrious and I’ll really clean this one. This item been suppressed? Anything in thesession been suppressed? protested? upset? Anything—anything been upset? Anythingprotested? upset? invalidated? ‘Perfectable scrambled eggishness’—anything beenperfectabled?”And you’re sitting there looking at the wildest ARC break you ever heard of. “Where did itcome from? Just because I’m trying to put in a couple of rudiments on ‘perfectable scrambledeggishness,’ this PC is ARC broke because he doesn’t want me to . . . “ Looks mysterious,doesn’t it? Well, it comes from nix absolutable, absolutable nix, and the top oppterm.Want to set up an ARC break? You can set it up perfectly mechanically. Just start going downthe list, just drop one just drop an RI. See? Notice the PC is a little abstracted and say, “Giveme number thirty-one.” Ticks. You say, “All right, that’s fine. Give me number thirty-two.”This PC will get a weird look in his eye. And certainly by thirty-three, thirty-four or thirty-five,you will have a God-awful ARC break on you. And then you say, “I didn’t take the charge offnumber thirty-two—number thirty-one. Didn’t take the charge of it off.”“Oh? Oh.”I wouldn’t say you’d do this to any PC, but you actually could. And it’s just as predictable asthat. One, two, three: You bypass the charge, keep it a secret, ARC break.Now, you start struggling around with a PC and ramming around of one kind or another andharassing the PC and chewing the PC up, after you’ve bypassed two and three-quarters banksfull of no blown charge, and what do you think you’re going to be able to do with this PC?Exactly nothing. You’re going to get nothing to discharge, you’re not going to be able to run asession and so forth. Well, what’s your remedy? Your remedy ordinarily is to find an earliergoal and run it well.What if the PC is so bogged down by this time that you can’t get up to an earlier goal? Well,run this ARC break recall process for half a session, your PC will be able to find some earliergoals. Yeah, well, that’s a crude remedy.Any trouble you have with Routine 3 today is caused by bypassed charge. Any ARC break thatyou’re- having is caused by bypassed charge which has neither been found nor indicated. It’sall under the heading of bypassed charge. bet a reality on it. How many ways can you bypasscharge? Then you’ll be able, not only to run a smooth session, but you’ll have everythingblowing, left and right, all the way on down.There are numbers of ways to run charge off of RIs—numbers of ways to do it. But don’t takethe charge off of a GPM, your next GPM isn’t going to fire. Don’t take the charge off of fouror five consecutive RIs, the sixth isn’t going to fire. That’s all.Now, don’t yammer at the PC on the seventh, trying to get it to discharge. Well, that’snonsense. How can it discharge? PC is all of a sudden—his morale’s down, he’s ARC brokenand so forth. The perfect way to keep these implants from running is to bypass charge. Thenyou’re not going to get anything to run."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"I’ve even given you a weapon that puts the PC back together again so you can bypass thecharge you’ve left on the bank. And that’s your ARC break process, and that’s marvelousanyway. The only thing known that’ll cut into an implant like a band saw. Good Straight wireprocess—sit there and run it for a while, PC’s that upset. But find out the charge reason first.Cure these ARC breaks before running a process.Now, there’s the trouble “you is having”—if you have any trouble—with PCs, and if you haveany trouble running banks; it all comes under that one heading of bypassed charge. You’regoing to have ARC breaks and no rocket reads. Everybody was sitting marveling at the bigrocket reads I was getting on that TV demonstration. Well, it might strike you as veryinteresting, that was one of the most difficult sessions I have given for a very long time andthose were the smallest rocket reads I have had for a long time, because it was very difficult.The PC was very restimulated by the amount of electronic hum on the television cameras,because he was going through an electronic implant that hummed. Therefore wasn’t firing verywell. And I fought that on down the line and there was a bypassed charge of a cognition, andwhich almost caused an ARC break, and finally gave you the cognition, only it had beenbypassed. And then you saw some rocket reads that were really rocket reads. Because you sawa lot of rocket reads; those things were clean.There’s many ways to blow RIs. This is not a lecture on how to blow RIs.But let me tell you that if you start bypassing charge early on, you’re going to find no chargelater. And let me tell you something else: Don’t buy an RI that doesn’t rocket read a full dial.Got it? Just don’t buy them. Lets see that thing fire man! Lets see them really fire. There is aPC made that won’t give you a dial rocket read per item. Now how much charge do you thinkyou’ve left on the bank? How long do you think your PC will remain ARC un-broken?All right. Now, I told you you would like this lecture, but there it is.Thankyou very much."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKS AND THE COMM CYCLEA lecture given on24 July 1963Thank you.Well, you’re going to get some demonstrations before we’re much older. And I’m grooving inModel Session a little bit better. Couple little bugs these days in Model Session.“Do you agree that’s clean?” can cause an ARC break. What you want to communicate to thePC is did the PC have anything to say about it? You, after all, have asked a question, and youinform him of the state of the needle and ask him if he’s got anything he wants to say about it.But I haven’t quite got the pat wording for that. But it’s interesting that there are two, three littlechanges—they’re just little refinements, make it easier on the auditor.We’re using mostly the 3N Model Session and in actual fact have not used the old, original,long-drawn-out beginning ruds-end ruds Model Session for some time. And it’s a goodtraining ground, maybe, but in actual fact, the since mid ruds are enormously better. Since midruds and pull missed withholds are enormously better than any beginning rudiments we everhad. And an ARC Break Assessment at the end of session, just whether there’s been an ARCbreak or not, is enormously superior to any end rudiments we ever had. Don’t you see? So youjust clean every line of it. You don’t do an assessment by elimination. If you got a tick, find outwhat it is. And just clean that up, and your PC comes up shining.So it actually makes Model Session pretty easy to do, but it’s still a very precise activity. We’venow got the body of the session, we end the body of the session, you know? Goals and gains,all that sort of thing. Everything is there—you know, we adjust the PC’s chair and ask if it’s allright to audit in the room and get a can squeeze and put in the R-factor and start the session,you know? Same thing. Get the goals and roll right on through. Get the PC’s goals, and [illPC’s needle is a bit agitated, your tone arm is higher than it was the last session, we put in oursince mid ruds and see if there’s any missed withholds, and carry right on through into thebody of the session, and do whatever we’ve got to do. Come right on up to the end of the bodyof the session and chatter with him a little bit before we tell him that’s the end of the body of thesession—that’s very informal but still there. Then we get the PC’s.. . ARC BreakAssessment—usually omitted, if the session’s quite happy and the PC has had a big win in thesession; we certainly don’t harass him with an ARC Break Assessment.And then we take our goals, and eve take up each goal. I notice some not quite doing that,maybe. And actually, those are written on the auditor’s report, diagonally across the goal. See,we just write “yes,” you know, or “maybe,” see, across each goal. We don’t write down another section here that says whetheror not he made his goal, see? “To have a good session”: Well, we give him that goal, youknow—did he make it? He says yes, we write “yes” diagonally across that top there, see? Sowe can see what his goals and gains were just by looking at that one block. And it’s easy toreview, see?If he’s got all that, we don’t keep pestering him, we just read it to him, did he make them ordidn’t he make them?—then we thank him for making his goals in this session, or if he onlymade part of them, why, “Thank you for making some of your goals in this session;-I’m sorryyou didn’t make all of them.” Then we ask him for his gains, and we take down the gains. Andwe don’t keep bleeding gains. We don’t keep asking the question “Did you make any gains forthe session?” We just take what he’s got, see? We make sure that he’s answered it to hissatisfaction—and remember he’s pretty foggy, so sometimes that’s a little difficult to get closedout. You’re still trying to end the session, he’s still trying to give you gains, you know?—longtime to answer the question or something like that. Well, let him answer it to his satisfaction,but don’t you keep pounding with the question about gains for the session. You understand?"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"You can over-ask him, see? And next thing you know, he’s giving imaginary gains that henever heard of.When he’s got those you say, “Thank you for making these gains in this session,” or, “Thankyou for making some gains in this session; I’m sorry you didn’t make all of them.” And(“Sorry you didn’t make more gains,” rather), and close that out.And then we just get a can-squeeze test, run any havingness that we have to run if the can-squeeze test was less than the beginning of the session, and simply ask him, “Is there anythingyou want to say before we end the session?” Let him say it. Then we say, “Is it all right withyou if I end the session now?” and get a yes on that and we just end the session. That’s it. And“Tell me I’m no longer auditing you.”All of these various lines we’ve had before—those little courtesy lines are in there. The onlyadditional ones: thanking him for his goals, then thanking him for his gains. And that is theform of a Model Session these days. But it still requires a precision, don’t you see? It is still aModel Session and its wording is very fixed for each one of these points.Before I gave you a demonstration of this Model Session brought up to date, however, Iwanted to get that business of what do you say to a PC? What is exactly the best thing to say,you know? “That didn’t read.” “Do you agree that that is clean?”—that type of approach cancause ARC breaks.I myself have felt like saying, “Well, I don’t have to agree that it’s clean. To hell with it! “ youknow? “What are you trying to do, force me to say there are no more answers on this question,‘In the last trillion trillion years is there anything you have suppressed?’ Hell, I know it can’t beclean. It’s clean for the purposes of the session, maybe, but sure isn’t clean!”That’s why, when you heard a demonstration I was giving on that tape a short time ago, I wasslipping that. You saw I wasn’t using it very much, and fumbling around with it. I was stilltrying to find a proper wording. Soon as I get that taped, why, I’ll give you this new one. It’salmost exactly the same one that you’re using now; I’m just giving you these little refinements.All refinements these days are just in the direction of causing less ARC breaks and getting moreauditing done.The reason you have rough needles, however, has nothing to do with your Model Session oryour rudiments or anything else. The reason you have rough needles is you miss on TR 2 orTR 4. You miss TR 2 and TR 4 and you got a rough needle. That’s it—bang. Just like that.Comes back to auditing cycle.If an auditor’s PC has a clean needle consistently, you know that this PC is either phenomenal or this auditor has very, very good TR 2 and TR Every good TR 2 and TR4, see? And if PC has a rough needle, not all the rudiments in the world will put it together ifthe auditor’s TR 2 and TR 4 are for the birds. See? That’s a big point. That’s a big point.Now, I invite you sometime to just watch this. Any auditor will have this happen to him. Ithappens about once a session. Sometime in the session you got a clean needle, it’s flowingalong here very neatly and very nicely and smoothly clean needle, everything going fine—andall of a sudden you got a dirty needle. You immediately assume PC has a missed withhold. Ifyou were to take a tape of your auditing session, you would find out very rapidly that your TR2 went out or the PC originated and you did something about it. Something happened therebetween TR 2 and TR 4, and immediately your needle was rough.Be very revelatory to you if you had a tape of the needle—we’re trying to accomplish thistechnically; a very hard problem—if you had a tape of your needle in your session and youcould play it back sometime, you’d learn a lot. And its quite intriguing. And you say, “Whatthe hell gets into me?” you know?"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"PC said, “I had an ache.”“Oh yes, where was it? Oh yeah, hm-mm? Have anything to do with the process we wererunning?” Dirty needle. Just like that. Bang-bang!“Uh . . . well, I feel better now.”“Well, you don’t have to worry about that. We’ll get you into another . . . [inaudible]”But you watch the coordination between auditing cycle and dirty and clean needles, and you’regoing to be fascinated. And whenever you look around and you see an awful lot of PCs havedirty needles, you look around, you’ll see an awful lot of auditors have dirty TR 2 and TR 4.You clean up the TR 2 and TR 4 and you’ll clean up more needles than you can shake a stickat. It isn’t the significance of it, you see; it’s the calm flow of the auditing cycle.Well, I didn’t come in here to give you a lecture on this today. I’m going to give you a lectureon the subject of ARC breaks, so I might as well start this lecture.This is what?Audience: July 24th.24 July, A.D. 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. And here is a lecture on the subject ofARC Break Assessments—one which you need. You need. You need this worse than youthink. ARC Break Assessments.Now, I’ve just been rattling along here and talking about sessioning in general, which is ofcourse a very applicable part of this lecture. But you normally consider a dirty needle, you see,as a withhold or something that the PC has done. And you seldom look at it as something thatthe auditor has done.Well, let me point out to you that there are two communication cycles in an auditing cycle—twocommunication cycles in an auditing cycle—and either one of those two communication cyclescan be active.Now, number one is auditor to PC. Number two is PC to auditor. Now, either of those canoperate independently. And one of those cycles goes this way: “Do fish swim?” see, and thePC hears it and understands it, see? And that is simply cause, distance, effect. So that’s acommunication cycle, see? Cause, distance, effect.Now, PC says, “Yes,” and auditor hears it and understands it. Now, that’s cause, distance,effect.Now, you’re used to all this, of course, but you probably haven’t looked at it in the degree Ofseparateness which it deserves, since either one of them can exist independent of the other one, and both of those communication cycles have to be perfector very acceptable before you have an auditing cycle. An auditing cycle is not made up, then, ofauditor command, PC’s reply, auditor’s acknowledgment, see? That is a very, very loose lookat an auditing cycle.An auditing cycle can exist, frankly, on either of these independently. The PC doesn’t have tosay a thing and yet be perfectly satisfied. Do you see—a communication can exist from theauditor to the PC.What’s your R-factor? That’s a communication from the auditor to the PC, isn’t it? PCunderstands it. You ever hear a PC say very much to an R-factor? He doesn’t even have tosignify he’s heard it: There’s nothing in the books that says he did. But he has to understand it.He doesn’t have to say anything. “Okay, all right. Well, I agree that is the R-factor”—you"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"don’t expect the PC to say that, see?Similarly, you’re going along in an auditing session, the PC suddenly says, “Hey! I justrealized that dirigibles aren’t airplanes, see? You know, it’s a fact!” And you haven’t even beenauditing dirigibles or airplanes or anything else. This very often takes you by surprise. It can beclose or far from the subject of the auditing session—that has nothing to do with it—but it’s anindependent communication cycle. An independent communication cycle.Now, you’re so cheerful on the subject of getting your TR 2 in, just right, in answer to the TR4 that you don’t sometimes look at the fact that TR 4 doesn’t depend on TR 2, not evenvaguely. That’s why it’s TR 4. It’s up—upnumbered. What is this?Do you know that some of the most successful origin handlings I’ve ever done had noacknowledgment connected with them. Although you can say the auditor is supposed tounderstand and acknowledge the thing—receive, understand and acknowledge thecommunication, all that sort of thing—you can go into that kind of thing and try to explain whatthis is; in actual fact, look at this in its most naked form. This is just simply a singlecommunication cycle, originated by the PC and received and understood by the auditor. And ifyou look at that, not with any tricks or gimmicks around it, all will suddenly make sense. Justas the auditor is emanating and originating his auditing cycle as a one-way communication in itsfirst step, and just as an auditor can originate things which the PC doesn’t have to respond to atall, so can you get the reverse thing going in a session—which is to say, the PC sayssomething. And that’s a communication cycle. And the only thing you’re trying to do is signifythat it exists. You’re not trying to do TR 2 or anything else. I mean, the PC originates: he says,“Dirigibles are not airplanes.” He’s had a cognition of some kind or another.One of the ways to knock him off his base is to give him a very artificial TR 2. Did you everhave an origin knocked off its base by having the auditor say “Very good. Thank you”?—get avery artificial piece of stuff back in your teeth. You’ve just said something that was importantto you.Very often in auditing I’ll handle an origin with a facial expression or a head nod, because it’s aone-way cycle. And only a ghost of the thing the other way needs go, and actually needn’treally go at all. If you’re really good at projecting your think tank, you could sit there with theface of a wooden Indian and do a perfect TR 4.I know that sounds utterly incredible. The way not to handle a TR 4 is to make it obvious thatyou haven’t understood and that you have received the communication. “Thank you.”“I suddenly . . . I suddenly realize,” the PC says, “I suddenly realize . . . I suddenly realize mymigraine headache’s gone! I had it for years! Gone! Hey, what do you know! Ha! It’s gone!Gone!”“Thank you.” What the auditor has done in that particular regard is make a mistake of thinking a PC runs areverse auditing cycle. See, he thinks the PC is now going to audit him. The point here is youaudit any little kid on “Touch that table” or “much that chair” for a little while, and nearly all ofthem will suddenly start diving the command to you. They get their flow going so far, andyou’re a fool if you don’t do them, too. And you touch the table and touch the chair, and thekid’s all satisfied and B0 forth. And they’re perfectly willing for your next command, see? It’squite a game they play. They go into a very complete duplication of the auditing session. Agood auditor of children and B0 on is quite well aware of this and doesn’t refuse to execute theauditing command. It throws a kid completely out of session. Kid is overwhelmed. That’s thekid’s effort to be right, don’t you see?All right. But in handling an origin, the PC has not started to audit the auditor. That’s adifferent kettle of fish. The PC doesn’t expect anything but a comprehension. That’s all the PCexpects."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Now, how do you signify a comprehension? Well, I know your telepather is kind of busted;it’s been busted for quite a while. I know mine has been, to the degree that it might be. Isometimes look back at what telepathy once was, and a guy is two thousand yards away andyou hear all of his thoughts with a crash, don’t you see? That’s OT stuff. You can also haveobsessive telepathy where you hear everybody all the time. This is sort of out of control. Butwe’re not asking for anything that is that marvelous. We’re asking for pure and simple, anordinary response to a communication.Now, how do you signify that you comprehended? Until you can answer that question well—till you can answer that question well and pleasantly . . . To yourself, see—l mean, notpleasantly but satisfactorily.Well, you’re sitting there right now. How are you “comprehending” to me that you heard whatI said and understand it? Yeah, I look at your faces and you’re all doing it beautifully. See?Perfect.Now, that is an origin, handling of. And that’s all there is to handling an origin. PC sayssomething and you understand it. Now, we say “and acknowledge it,” but we’ve gone too farbecause we’re tending to put it in a thing. We let the PC know we’ve understood it. Forinstance, once in a while I’ll just laugh like hell, see, you know? PC has said something that’svery funny to the PC, you know, and seems funny to me (I won’t laugh if I don’t think it’sfunny to me; l won’t corn up the emotions on it), and I’ll just laugh, you know. PC’s perfectlysatisfied. That’s because there’s no auditing cycle involved. That’s just a communication cycle.That’s all there is to it, see?Now, there are a bunch of processes which require no answer from the PC but do require aresponse from the PC of some kind or another. But they are concept processes—the oldconcept processes: “Get the idea of . . . “ Well, the PC can sit there and get the idea and neverreally say “Yes, I . . . “ No nothing to the auditor. You know he’s done it. Well, how did youknow he’s done it? Oh, you look at his breathing and that sort of thing, you take a look at himand so on.You get into this trouble in R3R. How do you know the PC has moved to the beginning of theincident? See, that’s an interesting little hole. Because you didn’t say “Move to the beginning ofthe incident at approximately . . . and tell me when you get there.”In the first place, that would be very sour, because it’s two auditing commands, they’re alreadycomplicated, he’s in too much trouble already; and once in a while, any auditor will get dopeyand have moved the PC to the beginning of the incident and then not move him through it. Youknow, forget. The PC will sit there for a while, finally look at you kind of hostilely and say,“Well, when are you going to move me through the rest of the incident, you knuckle head?” See, any auditor is liable to do this, because he’s all busy with his computationof where the beginning of the incident is and how many—time it was and so forth. And thePC’s been taking quite a while, let us say, to get to the beginning of the incident. And so hemoves him to the beginning of the incident and then all of a sudden wakes up to realize at lastthat he hasn’t moved him through the incident.This can happen—not to you just once or twice because you’re new at it; this will probablycontinue to happen to you, embarrassedly, now and then, from here on out. Because you’vegot an incident that’s a trillion years long, or something stupid like this. And the PC’s at theend of the thing and has had an awful time trying to find the beginning of it anyhow. And yousay, “Move to the beginning of the incident at approximately wumpty-wump-bump trillionyears ago.” And you decide, “Well, while he’s moving to the beginning of the incident I’ll justcatch up on my note of what he’s just told me, because I didn’t want to slow him down,” yousee? And you’re busy writing anal writing. You get interested in what you’re writing, youknow?Well, actually, the PC wouldn’t be upset with you if he didn’t notice that your attention was on"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"something else rather than following through the auditing command. PC usually forgives this;doesn’t cause any ARC break. But ordinarily, you—PC says, “Well, I’m there. So what?”And you say, “Oh! Uh-ho-hah-ho. Oh.” The exact auditing command that follows that, ofcourse, is “Move through the incident to a point (duration time) later.” That’s the exactcommand that should be given him at that moment. And he’ll go ahead and happily carry thisout.Well, this is a point where, if you’re on the ball, you say, “Move to the beginning of theincident”—and if you keep your eye on your meter it’ll Rick sooner or later. You don’t have toask him “Are you there?” That’s terribly bad form. You want to ask him “What are you lookingat?”“Well, so-and-so and so-and-so.” And I wouldn’t spend much time asking him what he waslooking at either. As soon as I had any inkling that he was at the beginning of the incident I’dmove him on through, because you can’t make any real mistakes there anyway.Point I’m making here is the PC doesn’t have to tell you he’s at the beginning of the incident;he simply executes the auditing command. Causes a little bit of embarrassment sometimes,when you don’t realize that he’s executed the auditing command. But it is a communicationcycle. It has taken place. The auditor said something, the PC’s done it. That’s all you expect.That’s it.All right. Now, the PC says something. It’s a communication cycle. He’s not auditing you. Itmust be, therefore, a communication cycle. He originates, see? And he originates something toyou, and you receive it and understand it: that is a communication cycle. Communication cyclecomplete, right there. Now, to make it an originated cycle, you should signify to him in sometiny fashion that you have received it and understood it.Now, if you try to phony this up and he says, “Lugulala blou-uboog,” and you say, “Hm-mm,hm-mm, hm-mm ‘ and you don’t know what the hell he’s talking about, there is some mysticinfluence sets in at this point which you will see go on the meter. He knows damn well youdidn’t understand that—half the time because he didn’t.Now, the auditor who specializes in this phrase should be stonewalled: “I just don’t understandwhat you said,” see? “I didn’t understand you.” “I don’t understand what you are saying.”“Don’t understand.” In the first place, that’s lousy—a lousy approach—from the basis that ituses a very, very powerful word. Understand is the crossroads of A, R and C. And you say“don’t understand,” you’re just asking at once for a complete ARC break. But more importantly, you have said to the PC to communicate the same thing again.If you’ll notice, he said, “I have a pain in my back.”And you say, “I just don’t understand what you said.”And the PC will only say, “I have a pain in my back.”And you say, “I don’t understand that.”And he will say, “I have a pain in my back!” See, we’re all of a sudden seeing the buildup ofthe ARC break, see?And you say, “I just don’t understand that.”“I Acre a pain U1 my back!!”You can build this up. But do you notice that the PC is saying the same words over and overand over? It’s a peculiarity of Homo sap. If you indicate that you don’t understand what he’s"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"talking about, he says the same thing again. He says the exact same thing again. He nevervaries it. What you want him to do is vary the explanation. What you’re asking him to do is tohelp you get this, if he’s got to say something more. What you want to indicate to him is heshould tell you a little more broadly what he is tallying about so that you can get a very goodgrasp of it. And if you are very clever—and there’s no substitute for cleverness; you can’t giveanybody a pat phrase with it because they vary all the time—if you’re very clever, he willexplain it to you in a half a dozen different ways. And then he understands it and so do you.But it’s mainly you that’s got to understand it.Now here, basically and elementarily, we get the basis of an ARC break. I don’t care what kindof charge is bypassed, the thing is a bunged-up communication cycle, whatever else it is, see?It’s affinity, reality, communication —these things are all out. It’s a bunged-up communicationcycle, but what in it is bunged up? Detected and understood—those are what’s bunged up in it.How can you have a communication cycle where the communication is not fully detected and isnot understood? How can you have one? It isn’t a communication cycle, became thecommunication cycle is cause, distance, effect, with duplication occurring at the effect point ofthe cause point. That’s a very pure, accurate definition. Not over all the years has there beenany shift of that.But look at this. Are you going to call this a communication cycle: cause, distance, alter-isedeffect, no comprehension? You said, “Good morning,” and she thought you insulted her. Howdid that come about? Well, it just came about by the nonexistence of a communication cycle. Itwas imperfectly detected and it was not understood.Now, of course, it’s not understood because it’s imperfectly detected. I mean, how much moreelementary can we get? Somebody rolls a lollipop in your direction, how can you detect what itis if you don’t receive it? Oh yes, it can arrive within four feet of you, and you can look outthere and see a lollipop. See? Then you could detect it without receiving it, which is anotherthing. This would also be an ARC-breaky situation. It’s detected, but you didn’t receive it.Usually you’ll find TR 4 breaks down at this point. It’s detected, but not received. PC says, “Idon’t—I . . . I . . . I don’t think you have to keep . . . keep the session going much longer; Ifeel fine.”You say, “Well, we’re going—we’re going to keep it going as long as is necessary to fill inthis particular period.” You detected he said something, but you didn’t receive it. You’ve saidyou didn’t receive it because you didn’t do anything about it. You said it should be somethingelse before it arrived at you, and you have therefore busted down the communication linebetween the PC and yourself.Now, that was a very pleasant origin, wasn’t it? Do you know that you could so work on thatorigin that you would have that PC—I don’t care what PC, or how calm this PC normally is orhow splendid and pleasant this PC is— you could get that PC into an absolute screaming fit, just on that, by just continuing that. Justcontinue it and continue it, and if you ever want to see an ARC break, man, just rig one ofthese things 90 that you don’t receive what the PC says. And that can be done to any PC.Some PCs are really a bit below spitting in your face, but you can just see them go blyaaahhh.And they just sort of pass out right where they sit. But it produces a fantastic effect. A fantasticeffect.Now, an auditor must realize that that is a primary effect, and that is a primary cause of ARCbreak. That is not one of the causes of ARC break. That is your textbook, perfect example.From the PC’s point of view, there is cause, and there’s distance; the distance is not covered,or the communication cycle does not complete. And that’s it. That’s it.I don’t care what PC you’ve got, you can reduce a PC to a screaming fit, no matter what this"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"PC has said. You can just get the PC gibbeting. A PC will just be shaking and exhausted in avery short space of time. And that’s an ARC break. Well, why is it an ARC break? That’sbecause both A, R and C are out. The combination of A, R and C equals understanding, andthe understanding is out.The intention is cause, distance, effect, and the progress of that cycle is prevented so that thecommunication is actually not fully detected. See? Not fully detected. This is a very, veryinteresting point in ARC breaks. That forms a woof and a warp of all ARC breaks. Not fullydetected—partially detected but not fully detected. Nobody’s going to ARC break going outhere and yelling at a rock. You could go out here and yell at a rock all morning. You can say,“Oh rock, I hate thee,” or, “Oh rock, whither dost thou comest?”—anything you want to say—and you will go out and yell at the rock and talk at the rock and speak at the rock and so forth,but your expectancy of what’s going to happen at the rock never does get quite up to expectingthe rock to give you a TR 2.So therefore, your estimate of the detection is not at fault. The rock isn’t going to detect thecommunication to it, so you then don’t expect anything to happen in the communication cycle,so therefore you do not ARC break. See?Ah, but the PC is under a very, very definite detection cycle. The PC expects the auditor todetect the communication from the PC and understand it. And when that is thrown sideways—because understanding has entered into it, because detection has entered into it, because onlypartial detection or no detection has entered into it, in spite of the expectancy of its beingdetected—you can reduce a PC to an absolute shaking mess of jelly.I’m not kidding you now. I see from your silence that you’re either accepting this as too grimto confront, or you think I may be exaggerating it. This is not so. This is not so.You can take the most common statement, such as “I feel pretty good now,” refuse to detectwhat the PC is saying, don’t duplicate it (don’t understand it, in other words), and keep givingthe PC evidence that you haven’t understood it, and have that PC—I don’t care how calm, cooland collected that PC has always suspected himself—in utter amazement at having been ashuddering mess of jelly, because he eventually will start screaming. “But I was just trying totell you I feel perfectly good now,” see? And it goes up, up, up, up, up, scream, scream,scream, and he’ll then break down scale. You can see him go down the scale. “I was just tryingto tell you . . . !” And he’ll be crying, you know?He gets on the same line—the stuck flow of his communication on the thing, and he can’t get itthrough, he tries everything under God’s green earth to get it through, and eventually he starkgiving up and you can see his whole emotional Tone Scale follow this, then.Well, that is a basic ARC break That’s fundamental. Now, you expect me to tell you there are many other kinds of ARC breaks, but there are no other kinds of ARCbreaks. These mechanisms are all based on the communication cycle.I don’t care what the devil happens with the rest of the bank, the whole definition of bypassedcharge is “partially detected.” Now, it wouldn’t become bypassed charge unless it were at leastslightly detected. You understand? Somebody had to drag a magnet within a few feet of it. Ithad to be stirred up one way or the other for the thing. But that is a communication line whichbegins.Going to restimulate an engram in the session. Let’s take this as a bypassed-charge source,see? The auditor does this, knuckle-headedly.You want to be careful in R3R, in selecting incidents, using things like “the first incident,” “theearliest incident.” Cut your throat, man! What are you talking about? You want “an earlier”incident, “the next” incident, not “first” and “earliest.”"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Why? What are you trying to do? Life’s so dull you have to have an ARC break? Well, how areyou going to get this ARC break? The PC can’t give you the earliest incident on the chain butcould give you the earlier incident than the one you just had. But you ask him for the earliestincident and you will kick in some earlier incident which he then doesn’t reach. So, he nowpartially detects. And you have partially detected. Both of you, now, are guilty of partialdetection of a started communication. And somewhere down deep it follows the same cycle as acommunication cycle, right there—bang-bang-bang. It’ll go all to flinders, just like that—bang-bang-bang. The more you scrape it up and the less you detect it, the more ARC break you’regoing to have. And that’s all there is to it.If you considered the time track a series of mines—nah, I shouldn’t do this; some of you girlsare timid enough when it comes to approaching some of these things. But let me give you thisanyway. Supposing we consider it a bunch of mines which were activated magnetically. Allyou had to do was drag a magnet somewhere near them and they’d explode, see? And youwant mine number four, and you’re all set to sit on it and pull its teeth and not let it explode,see? So you throw a magnet down to mine number eight and then start to prevent mine numberfour from exploding—and you wonder what that shattering roar is! Well, you see, you justmiscalculated on what one you were going to explode.Now, a time track isn’t quite that dramatic, but it gives you an example, see? You want minenumber four, 60 you activate mine number eight. Now, what in actual fact is that?Well, it’s a bum origin as far as the auditor is concerned, but actually, the communication cycleis reverse end to. Somebody has told mine number eight to speak, accidentally. And minenumber eight speaks, and nobody detects it, quite. See, it’s partially detected. But it is activatedand being partially detected now, will follow that same incomplete communication cycle.Nobody understands it, see? It isn’t that that has life in it which is capable of doing that at all.It’s just that a communication cycle, once begun, must go through. And if there is any type ofthing that you want . . .A big truism—a big truism: A communication cycle once begun must go through. If thatcommunication cycle isn’t permitted to go through, there will be upset somewhere, sometime,someplace.In fact, most of the difficulties of mankind, if you wanted to lay them out, are simply beguncommunication cycles which are not then detected. You know, they’re only partially detected,let us say. There it is, see?Let me give you an idea. The president of the United States says, “I want all Of you bums andall of the indigent and the poor and the pauperized characters—I want all of you to write me a letter and tell me exactly what I can do to help youpersonally, individually and personally.” Gluck! Nobody would see in this the eventualrevolution. Do you see what’s going to happen? The guy’s got no technology for handling thecommunication cycle at all. To say something like that would be weird. And yet the politician ina democratic country has always got this as his stock in trade. He’s a glad-hander tell-me Joe,you know—this kind of thing. Eventually it starts exploding in his face. We are veryadventurous in that I go ahead and do something like that.Remember, there’s a slight difference here. Slight difference here: You know how to catch theball. We can catch the ball, we know the mechanics of this sort of thing, and generally thecommunication cycle doesn’t have that as a source. I mean, it isn’t that communication cyclethat’s at fault. It will have been somebody audited somebody, and they got into an ARC breakand they bypassed some charge, and then the person wouldn’t admit that they had bypassedsome charge, you see, on the PC, and then the PC gets more and more disturbed. Andeventually they go to see somebody in the area, and eventually the HCO Sec. And then theHCO Sec tries to handle it one way or the other, but it misses there one way or the other. And itslides sideways and slips around and so forth, and I’ll eventually hear about it."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"And once in a while I drop a ball on these, and I only know of one case extant right now wherethe ball has been dropped forever, as far as I’m concerned, because he got into the hands of apsychiatrist. Incomplete communication cycle was the immediate and direct cause of thatparticular action. He already, let us say—we know this—had a tremendous number of overtson the organization and everything was gone to hell, and he’d been in a mess for a long time,see? But a communication cycle—I didn’t pay attention to it just as a communication cycle, justdirectly didn’t. And the character sprung sideways, and there wasn’t any way you could pickup the ball after that because there was a psychiatrist standing there. Haven’t done anything tothe guy— apparently some psychiatrist that doesn’t use icepicks in the morning, only theafternoon. I only know one that’s extant like that.Well, that’s a pretty good tribute to us, and it doesn’t say, then, that the situation isn’tdangerous merely because it’s being handled. But look at this: It is a situation which is prettydoggone violent if it is not handled.And if you’re unaware of this . . . You realize that gunners and that sort of thing are alwayschucking around live ammunition, and they’re not spooked about it at all. And you’ll seepeople that work in oil-well districts blowing out oil wells and so forth: They’re alwayswalking around with a pint flask of nitroglycerin in their hip pocket. They just couldn’t careless, don’t you see? Well, why? Those guys don’t die and get splattered all over the place allthe time. They’re handling very dangerous materials. They’re just familiar with their material.They know what that material is, see?Well, how would you like to be handling, on a totally unknowing basis, the way everybodyelse does in the community, see?Have you heard any conversations amongst meat bodies lately? Have you? Have you? I’ll giveyou an assignment some time: Go around to a tea break in a construction works and listen tothem. That isn’t so bad as a cocktail party. A cocktail party is armored, on this basis: Theydon’t expect anybody to hear them, so it’s never partially detected charge.But this becomes pretty idiotic, pretty idiotic. You just stand there and watch the number ofdropped communication cycles. And you don’t wonder at all after a while why these peopletear each other’s throats out all the time. They’re always partially detecting that somebody hasspoke. And of course they get a blowup.You see that you can handle the dynamite of the reactive mind . . . This stuff, you know, this stuff is not very dangerous. I don’t mean to minimize it, so on. Franklynot very dangerous. It requires understanding. It never has been very dangerous.But look how desperate it has made practitioners of the past. Look how desperate it has madepeople. Look how desperate a problem it is and look how frightened people can get if theUnited States—whatever you call it—is appropriating sixteen billion bucks to let psychiatryfigure out how to give quicker and faster prefrontal lobotomies to more people.Oh, I tell you, man, they must be worried! That worry must be proportional—at least one thirdas much worry invested in that as they have invested in the Russian situation, because that’sabout the proportionate amounts of appropriation. I think that’s fascinating. You mean, they’reso worried about this problem, they’re so worried about the mind, that they invest treasure tothis extent? They must be frantic to put it in the hands of the people they put icing too.I don’t exaggerate. If you’d talk to most psychiatrists yourself, or if you were head of acommittee or something like that and you called in two or three psychiatrists or something likethat to get testimony from them as to how to handle the community mental health—if you werejust an average citizen— you’d probably wind up with your eyes like saucers. Police listeningto these fellows testify in courts, and that sort of thing, have become confirmed in the fact thepsychiatrists are always crazier than the patients."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Well, look how desperate the situation must be if it’s put into the hands of PC who put upforward a mock-up of franticness to that degree, see? Let’s just look up these coordinativefactors, see?Well, a psychiatrist, of course, is himself frantic. And if we didn’t give him a hand tostraighten out, he’ll just never make it. And I don’t think we’ll ever help him.Any way, the point I’m making here is this factor of the ARC break. This factor of theexplosive character of interpersonal relationship, this factor of explosive nature of social or anyother type of personal contact, is looked upon in quite another way by other people thanyourselves. See, it’s looked upon as just “Huuhhrh! Well, everybody is dangerous,” and“Everything is dangerous,” and “Oh, my God,” and it’s all on an emergency basis, and“Huuuhh!” and figure-figure-figure, you know? It’s fantastic.Very few of you would say, “Well, you can’t talk to him about that.” Just show you thatyou’ve arrived someplace else, you see, than in that state of mind. Very few of you would beconvinced you couldn’t talk to anybody about anything. After you talk to them for a while youknow you can handle the situation to some degree or another and so on.Well, that’s not the general state of mind with regard to this sort of thing in the society. “Talk tosomebody about something? Huuuhhh!” See? “impossible! Hu-ooohh! Dangerous!” Well,what are these characters reacting to? They’re reacting to a communication cycle. So thecommunication cycle is itself the most deadly thing, if mishandled, that interpersonalrelationships has, and the most valuable if it can be handled. The reason you can’t fish the antsout and straighten them up is because you can’t talk to them.Desperation enters in only when communication goes out. Just remember that. You only getdesperate—you can look back on sessions you’ve given: the only times you’ve been worriedand desperate and that sort of thing is when you actually had the communication cycle go out,one way or the other. You want to say to this PC, “What the hell is the matter with you?” See?“What’s the matter with you? I mean, I’m asking you a perfectly simple question here, youknow? And you poor sod! If you can’t answer that question, get some tone arm action, you’vejust about had it, man!” You know? You know this, sitting there, you see, and you sit there and you get tied up in the situation.After a while you find yourself kind of peeved with the PC. PC isn’t responding correctly.Then you get all right when you do get the PC at some level that the PC is responding all rightwith communication; you find out that, much to your red face, that you had eight wrong dateson the case and that’s why the TA action wasn’t moving—something like this. You get thesethings straightened out, you notice the situation evaporates.In other words, your response to the PC ebbs and flows to the degree that you can put acommunication between yourself and the aberration that’s bothering him and straighten it outand see the evidence of its discharge. Don’t ever think you worry about a case for any otherreason. You don’t. It’s that basic thing. You’re having an effect on the case, the case isresponding and the case is coming along, and that is what you expect to have happen, andtherefore that’s happening and all is well. And when that ceases to happen, when yourbreakdown comes in, and you can’t seem to reach this PC with an auditing command, youcan’t seem to reach this bank with a communication of any kind whatsoever, you can’t seem tountangle this knot by speaking at it or into it, you start getting worried and you start gettingupset. And that’s when you as an auditor become upset, and that’s when you as an auditorbecome worried about your PC. And it’s off . . .There’s no reason for me to give you some pat answer, because there isn’t a broad, pat answerto it, because cases have these various bugs and complications of which you’re aware andwhich you get around eventually. But you look it over and try to find out what communicationyou’re not getting home to the PC, and you as an auditor will feel better."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Now, if the PC is feeling like the devil, PC’s feeling miserable about an auditing session orauditor, or something like that, you can just be sure that a—not his communication cycle; now,don’t get this one awry. His—as an auditor, it’s always your communication cycle that isawry, from your analysis of the thing. You want to improve something, you improve yourcommunication cycle. But from a PC’s point of view—a PC is very much the effect of veryheavy and strong processes—and from the PC’s point of view, a communication cycle is awry,but it can be awry in various ways.It’s awry. The communication cycle is awry. A communication has started, it hasn’t been fullydetected and it certainly hasn’t been understood. And where a PC is going awry as a PC—youwant happy PCs, you just listen to these little words and don’t bother about anything else, andyou just start figuring out exactly how you apply these to any case that you’re auditing that youwant to make a happier case one way or the other, and it’ll work. And that is, somecommunication cycle has begun, it hasn’t been detected—fully detected, you see; has to beslightly detected or it wouldn’t be active—and it hasn’t been understood. Now, if you put thatin a nutshell as to the basis of low ARC or ARC breaks in PCs that you are auditing, youactually never need another line of anything. You need the mechanics of how to detect thesethings, you need a list of how many things these can be and so forth, but I give you that as abasic principle.And you go at that as a basic principle, and you figure out the PC you’re auditing has that as abasic principle, even when the PC doesn’t have an ARC break. You know, there’s no reason tofigure this out. Now, get this: there’s no reason to figure this out at all. Go ahead and figure itout and you all of a sudden will understand something about your PC that you haven’tunderstood before. You’re going to find a communication cycle out. I mean, it doesn’t matterwhat PC, you see, where. You’re always going to find a communication cycle out. What’s theevidence? He’s not OT.For instance, he’s always missing the telepathic communication cycle; see, he’s always missing that one—that’s always out.Didn’t go out in a session I was in last night. The auditor and PC practically blew each othersbrains out by having exactly the same communication cycle on a telepathic wave hit midwayand almost blow up in the middle of the session. It was an incomplete communication cycle hadtaken place in the session. Both auditor and PC thought of it simultaneously and almost wentaround the bend trying to figure out which one had thought of it first so as to unbalance—so asto unbalance this sudden ridge that had appeared in the middle of the auditing session. Quite anamusing situation.Missed a goal, back in the session; you know, one of these skitter-scatter sorts of reviews ofputting things back together again, re-dating and that sort of thing, and just up and missed agoal. Didn’t realize any goal had been missed until the end of session, then all of a suddenthought of it. Either the auditor thought of it first or the PC thought of it first. The immediateresult was a telepath on the subject, and it . . . ! It was pretty weird. You watch some of thisstuff you haven’t seen for a long time, you know, you get tremendously intrigued. You say,“Huh! This stuff can exist,” you know?Anyway, we had quite a ball on that. But that’s just a communication cycle of some kind oranother which is completing. There are all kinds of communication cyclesNow, what do you think of a PC who isn’t receiving the auditing command? And what do youthink of the auditor that goes ahead and gives auditing commands the PC is only partiallydetecting? Hm? Now, does this explain why you can run a touch process on an unconsciousperson, particularly if you’re monitoring their hands? You say, “Touch the sheet. Touch thepillow.” You say, “Touch the pillow,” and then you have them touch the pillow, and now theyknow they’ve received the communication. You understand? You see that as a surety? So iteven works at the level of unconsciousness. It’s quite interesting."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"What do you think an auditor is going to walk into who keeps saying, “Squizzle-wig the ruddyrods. Thank you. Squizzle-wig the ruddy rods. Thankyou.”And the PC keeps saying, “Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.” What do you think the assessment at the endof session is going to look like? There’s going to be a communication cycle missing. It happensto be the auditory originated communication which is only partially detected by the PC andnever understood. Now, what do you think’s going to happen in that session? It’s going toblow in some weird direction and there isn’t going to be progress, and things are going to go tohell in a balloon one way or the other, and it’s all going to be very hard to detect. You see that?All right. Now, let’s look at another communication cycle. The PC is—I’m not trying to tellyou all ARC breaks are based on the communication cycle. You understand, thecommunication cycle is primary but goes awry at the point of detection and understanding.Understanding throws it into A and R. You understand? There are the affinity factors and thereality factors are what tend to make it not understood. This is why it’s ARC. But still you cananalyze it head-on on the basis of communication, you see, and it’ll fall into that category. It’sthe reasons why the communication cycle didn’t complete and was only partially detected whenit should have been really detected, see?Well, let’s say the auditor has never cleared the auditing command with the PC. The PC hasgone on answering this endlessly. Well, of course, you’re going to get into trouble. What’s theprimary source of trouble? The fact that a communication cycle existed and the communicationcycle was only partially detected, only the communication cycle didn’t cycle. It didn’t get all theway through. It was partially detected and it was not understood. So of course you’re going toget into trouble. All right. Let’s take another look at the situation. We try to get engram four and we triggerengram eight. Well, we’ve started a communication cycle, don’t you see, of engram eightwithout knowing we started engram eight, and we suddenly hear an explosion someplace andwe can’t quite detect where it came from. We look it over, and we find out the communicationcycle was that we accidentally got the response of engram eight, but then we abandoned thatsomehow or another and we got four. So actually the communication cycle was not completed.Was directed to eight, was not received at eight, don’t you see? It was received at four instead,90 therefore you’ve got a partial detection, and the PC didn’t find it out, really, and the auditordidn’t find it out, so there it remains as a sleeper, don’t you see?There was something that didn’t go through. That’s all you’ve got to figure on the thing, if youleft all of your lists home. Something didn’t go through. Well, it’s only a question of howmany things won’t go through.Well, the basic things that won’t go through are affinity, reality and communication. And thebasic things that those three things face are time. Time—matter, energy, space and time. It’sARC versus time. Don’t you see that the livingness of the individual consists of ARC and hefaces the material universe which consists of M-E; S-T. So you have the factors of M-E-S-Tand you have the factors of ARC. And these confront each other. But this basically takes up thecommunication cycle. The individual communicating with time, or time communicating withthe individual, goes awry. And as a result you get an incomplete and a partially detectedcommunication cycle.All of these things end up in what you call an ARC break. This ARC break results in all sortsof violent emotions which actually could not be exaggerated in their violence. Its just an ARCbreak amongst nations that causes wars. And yet here’s millions of people strewn out acrossthe battlefields causing all kinds of work up here at the between-lives area. (Poor fellows—Ibet they even have to work overtime. Let’s hope they don’t belong to the union or anything likethat. The boys must have an awful time.) Well, that’s an immediate, direct result of ARCbreak. Communication breakdown of some kind or another, with the affinity and realityattendant thereunto."},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"So don’t think that because these factors are very simple and very easy to handle and very easyto detect that the results of not detecting them are not severe, and that the severe results that yousee in life, interpersonally and in auditing sessions too, as well, are not catastrophic, or thinkthat these results do not stem from this very simple little factor. Because it always does. Anincomplete communication cycle results in bypassed charge—always.The common denominator of an ARC break is bypassed charge. There’s charge someplace.But what do we mean by charge? We mean—well, of course, ergs, dynes and all the rest of it.But we apply it to the communication cycle and we mean that a communication or a charge hasbeen excited and was channeled to go in a certain direction, and then was not detected and notunderstood, and that charge then explodes in a dispersal of some sort or another. It goesblooey. Don’t you see? This is elementary. Bypassed charge is something that originates as thebeginning of a communication cycle, and then not having been wholly detected or understood,remains then as bypassed charge. And it’s very often not detected by the auditor or the PC.And you have a session sort of running at a low gear.Now, don’t think these things are just explosive either. PC just isn’t feeling so well lately, soforth. Well, you’ve got some sleeping bypassed charge of some kind or another you didn’tpick up, that’s all. Bypassed charge, we mean we bypassed getting the completion of thecommunication cycle, or we carelessly started a communication cycle which didn’t getcompleted. That’s all.Accidentally did so. It’s very easy to do. We say, “Give me the earliest engram on this chain.”Little while later, PC has an ARC break. We say, “Let’s see, did I miss an origin, or what did Ido? What happened?” Then you hit, finally, “an earlier incident was restimulated.” This usuallysettles it away one way or the other, particularly if the PC spots what was restimulated. Bang!There goes your ARC break.It’s attended with great magic. But the magical look at it is the fact that we have the anatomy ofthis tremendously explosive stuff—the explosive stuff of interpersonal relations. We know themagic of that. We know how many different ways a communication can be begun and not bedetected and therefore become bypassed charge. It’s a lot of ways in which this thing can bedone.Well, knowing those things, you should be able to handle a session better. You should be ableto handle a session better. PC says, “Oh, I . . . I don’t think we ought to go on too long.”And you say, “Very good.” Just as your words By out the window, at least have the grace torealize that you are adding something into the communication cycle, if this then bears bad fruit.Just realize how come it came about. It’s a partially detected communication, wasn’tunderstood, far as the PC is concerned. You say, well, obviously that leaves you in a positionof always doing what the PC says. No, it doesn’t.“Well, good. I’m glad that’s the way you feel. All right. All right. Yeah, okay. Okay. Don’twant to carry on too long. All right. All right. Well, good thing that I’m perfectly fresh, and Ihope you are the same, because I intended to go for another two hours.” We find that one cycleisn’t the other cycle, don’t you Bet! You’ve originated a new series of communications on thesubject; you haven t slapped the old one in the head. You only get into trouble by slapping theold one in the head, don’t you see?PC said, “I think you ought to go all over the track and restimulate all these engrams, becauseactually the best thing to do is to get to basic-basic, which is tomorrow.”And you say, “All right.”You take a look at this, you understand what he said. You may not understand why he said it,but you sure understand what he said. And you say, “All right. Good enough,” and go on and"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"do what you’re doing. He still isn’t too upset about the situation. See, he only gets upset if youslap him in the face.Therefore, you’ve got to be an expert in the detection of a communication that has begun. Thebetter you are at detecting a begun communication—the better you are at this—the less ARCbreaks you’ll have. But actually you needn’t worry about ARC breaks, because you can handlethese things before they get catastrophic.Now, that’s an ARC break. That’s handling the ARC break. These are the basic fundamentalsstripped right down to rock bottom. Your ARC Break Assessment form is simply the numberof types of communications which can be started and only partially detected by the auditor andthe PC.Now, some of you are prone to this (now, this can be done; so you are led astray by somewins): You can say, “Well, an earlier incident was restimulated in the session. That’s what’swrong. That’s what the ARC break was about,” and the PC suddenly feels better. And if yougo on that way, and you get wins, and you say, “Boy, this is the cat’s . . . There’s nothing tothis. This is absolute magic,” right up to the point when you get the ARC break that you didn’tassess the right line for or you assessed the wrong list for or the PC didn’t quite know where togo to in order to look at and is still fubble-fubbled. You didn’t find it, even though it read on anassessment.So therefore, there are several actions undertaken in the detection of one of these things, andone is to assess it on the form where the ARC break reason lies. That sounds idiotic for me to say something like that, but if the ARC break is in thesession and you do an R3R ARC break form, you’re not going to find the ARC break, areyou? And so forth.So the right form, the right list—the right list comes as primary in this. And if you don’t find iton the right list, why, you better get another list. In other words, if you don’t find it, getanother list. Your commonest error on these things is not now that the lists are not complete,but that the lists are in several pieces to save you time, so your commonest error is wrong list.You actually didn’t find the ARC break. You didn’t find the communication cycle that beganand so left bypassed charge.Now, the main mistake you’re making or could make in this, if you do make any mistake on it,is not making sure that it’s all straightened out with the PC. That’s the biggest common error.You say, “Well, that was an earlier incident restimulated. That’s all right. Okay,” and go onwith the session. The PC’s sitting there frying. It wasn’t an earlier incident. Or he didn’t knowwhat incident it was, and he’s totally baffled. The ARC break charge has not been spotted andlaid to rest, see? It says right there in the bulletin on this that you better take it up with the PCand find out if that’s right.Well, you can go to the point of dating all of the things which you dated wrongly and findingand locating and dating all of the bypassed incidents. In fact, it could become a total productionwhich will go on for sessions, trying to clean up one ARC break. You understand? A goodstunt in this regard is to find the order of magnitude of the bypassed charge. That doesn’t letyou in for more trouble.“An earlier incident was restimulated.” Yeah, but what? What? Who? What? Where? What’s?Which? Which? What’s? Which? It’s all you can find, is an earlier incident was restimulated.You don’t know what earlier incident was restimulated, you don’t know what the hell, and allof a sudden the PC says, “Oh, yes. And, yes, it must have been,” and so on. And, “I wonderwhen that was. Can you date that? Yeah, there it is,” and so on. “Can you date it?”Good trick is just give it order of magnitude: “Is it hundreds of years ago, thousands of yearsago, millions of years ago, billions of years ago, trillions of years ago, trillions of trillions ofyear—? It’s trillions of trillions of years ago.”"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"“No kidding? All right, that’s fine.” That’s the end of it, see? That’s a way of parking onewithout getting yourself all solidified in a dating. You know that the PC’s attention is still stuckon this thing, and he’s still trying to sort out what incident it was, and that sort of thing. Well,one of the ways to get rid of it is find its order of magnitude—not go ahead and date it and findits duration and run it by R3R when you, in the first place, were doing 3N. You understand?You can go that far.But locating—locating it on the list—is where the semantic error turns up here. You don’tlocate it on the list. The list only locates the type—the type of charge bypassed. In other words,the type of communication cycle that began and was never completed, never detected, see?That’s all. That just locates its type.Now it’s up to you to take the additional steps of locate and indicate to the PC the charge. Inother words, doing the assessment is really not locating the charge. The charge is not on thelist, it’s in the PC. You get this? I’m not saying that just to be clever. The truth of the matter is,it’s only the type; the list will only give you the type of charge. And you haven’t accomplishedthe step of location. You’ve only found the type, see? People are saying “All right. Well, youlocate and indicate. That means you do an assessment. Bang—that is located now, and weindicate it to the PC.” Well, the funny part of it is, this is so good that even that works. See,there’s where you get tripped up. You can short-circuit it to that degree and still make it work.Well, recognize what you’re doing. That’s terribly short-circuited. You’ve only found the typeof charge. You haven’t done the location step at all. So in some ARC breaks you are totallybaffled as to why the ARC break doesn’t evaporate. You’re totally baffled. You say, “Whydoesn’t it go away?”Well, the primary reason is you haven’t done it on the right list. That, oddly enough, is themost Vagrant one. But you’ve never done the location step at all. The assessment is not thelocation. See? And an earlier incident was restimulated. You say, “All right, an earlier incidentwas restimulated.” Well, the magic of it is so great that occasionally. this works, and it givesyou a—gives you a bit of a win, so you say, “Well, this ARC Break Assessment stuff—prettygood. Ha-ha! That’s it. Yeah, fine.” And it’ll work like that, and it’ll always work if you’vegot the right list. And you’ve produced this minimal effect on the PC and PC isn’t all comingapart now at the edges.See, because that works, this whole system tends to get very short-circuited. You see, theassessment is not the location. That isn’t the way you locate the charge. That is the way youfind the type of charge that you now want to locate. You go down this—pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa-pocketa —and sometimes when you go over it you retrigger it, and your dirtyneedle turns off, and your next time down, why, it reads purely. See? You’ve had a dirtyneedle on the first assessment. Expect that as normal. Next time you go through and flick thoseoff that were still in—bang—one is standing out there clean. Now you can say, well, it saysso-and-so and so-and-so. “That’s an earlier incident was restimulated. Earlier incidentrestimulated—that’s what it says here. How do you feel about that?”The PC says, “I feel lots better. Yeah, it’s fine.”Well, let’s not plow up the field after it’s plowed, man. See, this is just handling ARC breaksas they occur in session. You know? No reason to go into this, stir it all up again, find somemore bypassed charge, bypass . . . No, you had it handled—let sleeping dogs lie. Yourassessment, location and indication all occurred in the same breath, see? Then you verified tofind out whether or not it was okay, and obviously it all occurred in the same breath, so whyare you going to go into any trouble from here on? Everybody’s satisfied, why are you goingto any trouble? You’re just going to stir up more trouble.But remember, you have done a very short-circuited, shorthand version of an ARC breakrundown. That is very short-circuited. If you got the right charge, it can happen. But, “Earlier"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"incident restimulated. Yeah, that’s what it says here. An earlier incident was restimulated in thissession.”PC says, “Ah, well. Okay now, that’s good,” and starts getting interested in something else,see? Ah-ah-ah, that’s all right. Nobody’s going to quarrel with him doing that.But you say, “Well now, how do you feel about this?”“Ah, maybe so, but . . . uh . . . Yeah, it was that earlier incident that was restimulated.Aorrwr-rahr! That earlier incident was restimulated!”You haven’t found the charge, man. And the first thing you should suspect is not yourassessment but that you had the wrong list. Reach for another list. Do you know that you cando 3N and inadvertently do some 3R—and be accidentally into 3R making ARC breaks of 3R?You can sometimes do R3R and get inadvertently into 3N, and your ARC break lies in 3N. Doyou realize that? And if you have an ARC break on R3R and 3N, it is never the session ARCbreak list. But sometimes after you’ve cleared them up you then have to get the session ARCbreak that resulted from having had those out. You get the stunt here?But remember that there is an assessment, a location and an indication, and it has to be all rightwith the PC. So there are four steps, always four. You could say five: Finding out that the PChas an ARC break would normally be the first one. But that is the score on your ARC BreakAssessments. And recognize—recognize those steps, in handling the existing ARC break,actually exist to that number, and that the assessment is not the location. The assessment is justfinding out the type of charge. You might have to go quite a bit further to find the location.You say, “Wrong date.” You’ve done nothing the whole session but date, you see? The ARCbreak’s caused by a wrong date. Well, it reads well and it is a wrong date, and that is the ARCbreak, but the PC says, “What date is wrong?”Well, you think that you now have to redate everything in the session, and so forth. Well, justcall off a few of the dates you found and ask if they’re right, that’s all. Bang, bang, bang,bang, bang, bang—do they read as wrong dates? That’s one way of doing it. Another way ofdoing it is “first half of the session, last half of the session.” There’s a dozen ways of doing it.I’m not going to try to teach you that trick. But you can go ahead and locate it right on down.Well, what as the right date for that thing? One of the ways of doing it is simply get order ofmagnitude. That makes the PC very happy. That causes it all to go back into place verysmoothly.You ran the goal “to spit.” You thought it was in the Helatrobus implants; you have a wrongdate on the thing all the way along the line. And you find the goal “to spit” had the order ofmagnitude of trillions of trillions of years ago. It’s good enough. Not to go on to run the goal“to spit,” you understand, but to find out that you’d found the goal “to spit” and you want toget it out of your road B0 you can keep on with the goal “to spat,” see? Well, you find theorder of magnitude for the goal “to spit” and it’ll move out of your road.These are all just shorthand methods of handling the thing. But you are dealing with anassessment for type. You are dealing with a location. You are dealing, then, with indicatingwhat that was, and then you are dealing with another factor here, is was it all right with the PC,does he feel okay now? And that’s what you were doing it for in the first place, so you’re aruddy fool not to find it out in the last place. Okay?All right. Well, because you can get away with it on the basis of do an assessment—bang—you say, “That was it,” and suddenly your location and indication take place just like that, see?You don’t, then, break them down and realize that there are that additional steps.If you wanted to know a complete list of all types of ARC breaks in this whole universe, youwould have to find all types of communication that could be partially detected when originated"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"and all the things, then, thereafter that could be misunderstood. And you would have a full listof all ARC breaks. Because we’re dealing with the mind, we know the ones that are important,and we know what really causes the explosions and we include those. Otherwise, 150 millionbooks printed, each one, to the size of the Encyclopedia Britannica, could not give you a partiallist of the number of communications that could leave bypassed charge by being incomplete.Okay?Audience: Yes.That’s the lot. Thank you."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"R2H FUNDAMENTALSA lecture given on7 August 1963What’s the date?Audience: August 7th.August the 7th, A.D. 13, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course.I’m going to give you a talk today which isn’t the official final rundown of R2H but which laysdown the fundamentals of the process itself.All right. R2H is one of the most satisfying processes that you ever cared to run. It is ARCbreaks taken apart by assessment. It has a tendency to succumb to inexpert handling, and aslong as you give a good thought to the fundamentals of the process, you won’t run a cropper.But here is one of the most interesting processes. This process is different than any processwe’ve ever had in Dianetics and Scientology. Don’t think that you understand this process,because it’s quite different.This process will run engrams and secondaries. It has tremendous power. And therefore it verywell may be senior to R3R, in spite of the fact that it’s an R2. It very well may be senior. Itmay run more bank than these.And the only thing it won’t run is a GPM. And to run a GPM you have R3M and R3N.Oh, you’d forgotten R3M, huh? You wait till one day you run into a wildcat GPM, man! Andyou’ll thank your stars for R3M, if you know how to do it. Because that’s how you got thepatterns in the first place, was R3M. That’s how you got 3N. That’s the Papa process.Out of R3M can be borne patterns. 3N presupposes that you’ve got the pattern. You sit thereand let the PC patty cake around and yap around and bark around and give you random itemsand you don’t see them rocket read, and you don’t know which end you’re going—standingon, and you let him hunt and punch, and keep sitting there at the E-Meter . . . I think thefashion is to sit there at the E-Meter as the auditor and just keep shaking your head, “No, itdidn’t rocket read. No, it didn’t rocket read,” until the PC blows his brain out. Of course, hedoesn’t need a brain. That’s . . . It’s a good thing.But R3M will do a wildcat GPM, by which we mean GPM for which you have no pattern. Andthey exist all over the track, and you’ll eventually run into one, inevitably. Don’t think you canjust go on running the pattern GPMs, because that’d mean your PC was never caught in a bindthat was an oddball bind, see? He never got out to Arcturus and fell in that particular area thatnobody else fell into, see? I mean, be very fortunate if he was normal and had only the normalimplants, but that is never true. He’s always got an oddball one.So you’ve got R3M, and that takes care of your offbeat implants. And the only change that Iwould make in it today—I wouldn’t ask the cross-question on oppose the way it’s asked. Iwouldn’t ask “Who or what would oppose . . . ?” to get your next pair. I would say “Whatdoes the next pair consist of? Give me the oppterm of the third pair.” That’s the one I woulduse. I would use something like that. And then “Who or what would oppose it?” Yeah. And I’duse that as phraseology.Now 3N, that’s a lead-pipe cinch. But 3N has this liability: On some PCs if you don’t randomlist—I don’t care if they had the item or not and if it rocket-read or not—you don’t get tone armaction. And if your tone arm action ceases, just up and random list. Just as easy as that. Thatgets all of your locks off. The RI with all of its locks—nothing has changed that, don’t you"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"see? Even though you’ve got the item “absolutably cantankerous,” why, make him random list.“Who or what would oppose it?” And he gives you all kinds of things, and that blows the lockand your TA action may restore.But the big thing that keeps 3N TA action down, of course, is having the wrong date and thewrong pattern. There’s nothing like having the wrong date for the GPM and the wrong patternfrom the GPM to freeze the tone arm. That’s almost certain.Now, if you add to that session a wrong or out itsa line—return line from the PC to theauditor—you of course have got it made. The TA simply goes up to the moon and sticks andwon’t go anyplace else. You understand that, don’t you?You’d be surprised how often you find a wrong date. And you’re running the Helatrobusimplants—BO you think—and you go right into the next goal for which you’ve listed. Andthen you try to get “absolutably” and you can’t get a rocket read, and you say, “What’shappened? TA’s up and stuck. I’ve got this nest goal ‘to be a goof.’ It’s obviously the nest goalin line, only it isn’t here.” Shucks, man, you’re probably running a Bear implant. It’s probablyshot back on the track Lord knows where, because the one thing a GPM won’t do is properlytime. You can duration a GPM and you can time a GPM and you can get the date of a GPMalmost endlessly.Why? Because its primary basis is lousing up time. Those two opposing items fire against eachother -sound like time to the PC, produces a no-change situation. So the GPM floats on thetrack and so it’s very difficult to time a GPM. So it’s just nothing to get the “next GPM in line”to run, and find out that it isn’t at forty-three trillion but at fifteen trillion trillion trillion trilliontrillion trillion trillion. Embarrassing. Eventually you go back and start looking for wrong dateson the case, and you finally locate that “to be a goof” is not the nest Helatrobus GPM but aGPM which exists in the early limbo’s of nowhere.Now, what’s very interesting is an exactly-the-same-looking hill with exactly-the-same-lookingparking meters with exactly the same railroad track existed about trillions-four ago, which laidin an entirely different pattern which was far more aberrative than the Helatrobus implants, andwhich is basic on the Helatrobus implants. And I told you one day the Helatrobus implants areon the screens they show you in the between-lives. No, that isn’t. I’ve been making thatmistake for about ten thousand years. Every time I put this thing up on the screen, why, it’s thewrong implant. They’re an early implant, and they had a hill there, unfortunately located in thesame geographical area as the Helatrobus implants. And it looks to the PC just like theHelatrobus implants, only it isn’t. You’ve got a date error, then, consisting of trillions-four—almost trillions-four, you see: trillion trillion trillion trillion. Your date error. Of course, yourTA action will cease.So there’s a lot of tricks in running GPMs. And GPMs are what require special techniques.They require special techniques.Now, nothing else that I know of requires a special technique, and you might even do awaywith R3R (this is a very adventurous statement) if you had a perfect R2H. R2H has thepotentiality of running engrams and secondaries on the whole track with greater avidity andspeed than R3R because it takes apart the restimulated and bypassed charges which exist in thesecondaries and engrams. It doesn’t run the engram so much as it takes out of it all thebypassed charges and causes, of course, that particular segment to snap back on to track.You probably have not looked at it this way, but you’re actually not trying to erase somebody’stime track. In the between-lives area they apparently are trying to wipe out your time track BOyou don’t know who you are. Well, we’re actually not doing that. You’re not in actual factworking with the time track to knock out all the pictures everybody has. That is really not whatyou’re doing. You’re trying to take out of the time track the things which prevent a person fromhaving his pictures. And after that, you can restore to him the right to have pictures or not tohave pictures, as the case may be. You’re trying to pull his knowingness high enough up to a"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"point where the individual does not have to have pictures to tell him who he is. Now, you gotthat?Your first target is not to erase somebody’s time track. You’re liable to think that, because thatis what a between-lives screen specializes in. It allegedly is trying to invalidate a person’s timetrack to a point where he doesn’t have any, and therefore can’t remember who he is because hehas no picture reference. I spoke to you this way about it yesterday.Well, you’re really not, then, trying to erase the whole time track, but there are certainunwanted pictures that he couldn’t handle and which he became the effect of. If you take thecharge off of those pictures, then pictures become available to the person and he can have themor not have them as the case may be.Now, the pictures which mostly louse up things are the GPMs. That’s the real mess-up.Because a between-lives implant has a target of invalidating all of your pictures and thereforewiping out your identity and memory. Because of this you might think—and I’m sure manypeople who are upset about auditing might think—that you’re trying to do this. You realize aScientologist may be looked at with askance by certain areas and interests and so forth asthough they were between-lives implanters, because they get some whiff of the idea that you’regoing to erase the whole time track. And they might think we’re between-lives implanters.I don’t know what would happen if we. . . I was toying with this this morning. (Let me giveyou a little bit of a laugh out of the side of this.) I was thinking of outer-space tactics andstrategy. This is an interesting and vast subject, and I have come to the conclusion that themissing factor in it is communication, and that lack of communication is what causes all thetrouble. All right, beside the point—that makes, then, very intricate and complicated tactics andstrategy, you see? I wondered if, impishly, you couldn’t rise above this factor with a fewcurves of one kind or another by entering societies from within where you did havecommunication, you see? Well, how would you go about it then?I was sitting there idly speculating about it over my scrambled eggs, and I suddenly realizedstill eating, I mean, I’m decadent—I suddenly realized that these between-lives blokes, theMarcabians, wouldn’t know what to do if they came down here and saw that they had a Marcabheadquarters here. We set up their headquarters for them, and you put up their flag, you see,and so forth.And look at the news story. I must have brought this news story on us, or had telepathicallyrealized that somebody was going to call on us. The Mirror group w as calling on us today: “Somany advances have happened in Dianetics and Scientology in the last three or four years thatthey had better be covered.”We agree with them perfectly, but how they will cover them, God knows. That’s one of thebiggest newspaper chains in England, but they also are the author of the death-lesson stories,and so we regard them with some suspicion.But there is this pressure all the time of . . . We are, you see; we’re putting out fantastic . . .The stories involved here would make what’s turned out in university labs and the psychiatricblokes and this sort of thing—would stagger them, man. You see? I mean, there’s more storyin any given week in Dianetics and Scientology, you see, than these birds. . . And thepressure— the pressure of this much data inevitably will produce some sort of a reaction on thesurroundings, you see? And you’d find these guys sooner or later are going to realize theymissed the boat. Instead of writing about “that cult,” they might write about “those people ‘ andyou’ll see them swinging around to this sooner or later.But look at the Marcabian press: “Here in this prison, in spite of all that has been done to them,they’re still loyal to their mother country.” God, you know, that’s touching, you know? That’sa tearjerker. And I sort of sat back and I said, “Well, Ronnie, you’re a dangerous man.”"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"But the reaction of earth population, all of which has come down through that channel, to thesesymbols might be something approaching the most fabulous thing you ever saw. It might beutter frothing, see? Might produce widespread riot and chaos. I don’t know. But it was aninteresting thought, anyway, as I think you will agree. Not that we’re going to do anythingdesperate like that—at least this afternoon.The point I’m making here the point I’m making here—is that if you tell the PC that you’regoing to erase his whole time track, why, he’s liable to go into a sort of an anaten propitiate,because this happens to him every sixty or seventy years to such a degree, you see, that hedoesn’t quite know whether he’s coming or going. But you tell him you’re going to give himback his pictures and you might entirely change your identity, as far as he’s concerned, as anauditor.See, he’s got certain pictures that make it impossible for him to get back his pictures. That’s thecondition he’s in. And you’re in actual fact trying to return him to Case Level 2. And oddlyenough you have to move him to Case Level 2 before you can move him to Case Level 1.That’s what’s very interesting about it. And your PC, in spite of all your erasure of pictures, isgoing to wind up with pictures. Man, he’s going to have pictures! He takes them all the time,they just aren’t available. Some of these pictures aren’t too pleasant, some of them aren’t toounpleasant, but the point is there is no dearth of pictures. What’s the matter with him is that heobsessively makes pictures of everything without discrimination. He’s something like agarbage collector, see? Any old picture is good enough, you see?But he gets some of these pictures, like GPMs and jails and things like this from between-livesimplants, and they then hit him every time he tries to see his own pictures, you see? And hesees these, and of course they’re his pictures, too, but he never realizes this. They’re so hostileto his future and his mental health that he disowns them.I’ve just gone through a phase of disowning my whole track—out of disgust, you know? Hada beautiful case resurgence for about—oh, I don’t know, must have lasted for an hour or two.Then of course it collapsed. But what I did was go through the consideration of track, and trackbecame artificially, you see—the artificiality of it became less and less real until the track itselfdisappeared. And now the track is appearing with total reality, you see, and goodknowingness. It’s an interesting, through-the-knothole experience. You know, “I wasn’t. Idon’t know who the hell I am. I . . . “ You at least got up to the point of where you didn’t needa picture to tell you who you if there were just other beings, it’d be a telepathic ball and thatwould be that. But when you talk to Joe, you’re actually talking through MEST to Joe, nomatter how you’re communicating with Joe, unless your ARC is so much on the ball that youcan telepathically communicate.And by the way, your ARC doesn’t have to be very high to telepathically communicate. That isquite interesting, that man is, at large, below this level of telepathy, but it is paid attention to insome civilizations to the degree that—oh, they set up—you’ve got a three-way communication.You got a conference with other departments or ship commanders or something—it wouldn’tmatter whether it’s a business or a unit of some kind or other—and you set up a box. You setup a box. And the thetan briefing them briefs them through a box which telepathicallyretranslates his thought onto an endless banner, and puts it out with sound also. In otherwords, telepathy sufficiently strong that it can be mechanically reconverted. A device no moredifficult than the vocotyper that the IBM keeps trying to make. You talk to the typewriter and ittypes, you know?Well, this is telepathic vocotyper. I’m not talking to you out of Popular Mechanics. In otherwords, the telepathy factor is strong. It is something you have to deal with.They have anti-noise campaigns in New York City. Well, I imagine in a boardinghouse, abunch of thetans would have an anti-telepathic campaign, you know? Can you stop shoutingtelepathically all night, you know? Telepathy is a very heavy, hard-hitting force."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Some of you will be going through an implant, or something like that, and you’ll pick up offthe track what you think is your postulate and then suddenly realize it isn’t your postulate, thatsomebody thought it in your vicinity. You sometimes can pick up the thoughts or fear of somethetan down the line who is also being implanted. This stuff will sometimes kick back into animplant. It’s quite valid. There’s nothing to worry about with that.Now, this isn’t any lecture about telepathy; it gives you an idea of how low ARC can gowithout disappearing and how high it can also go, because the birds I’m talking about that usetelepathy for communication aren’t even, by your chart estimates, in very good shape. See,they’ve had the Helatrobus implants, too, but they just aren’t getting their lives wiped out everysixty or seventy years, see? That factor is missing—the only factor of difference between yourcase and theirs. See, that’s the sole difference.Every once in a while, why, their empire gets wiped out, and somebody implants the lot, butthat’s life.So here’s your ARC. And your ARC can go up, then, to pretty high levels. And it dependsbelow a certain level on matter, energy, space and time as its communication media.ARC gets very important after you start dropping away from telepathic communication.Becomes very important because, you see, it’s so much present before then that nobody everthinks of it. Nobody ever thinks of it at all. You’re just not mad at people, and reality is terrificand you know all about it, and communication is good, and your understanding andknowingness are pretty well up, so it wouldn’t be something that you worried about at all.But the second you start introducing MEST into communication lines, living with greatdependence upon this universe in this universe, then ARC become very important and becomethe measure of life.Of course, they’re there all the way up. But you don’t measure them as going out. In fact, Ibelieve nobody would believe they could. Livingness: degree of livingness is measured byARC. How alive is somebody? It’s how much ARC is he capable of. That is the test.Now when you get over here . . . Let’s just rule out telepathy. I’m saying are you lot braveenough to say “Well, I just don’t know.” And from that point on you start getting your owntrack back.That’s an interesting point, that this occurs. And perhaps, perhaps, you haven’t given enoughattention to this, as nobody’s trying to wipe out your pictures; we’re just trying to pick outthose pictures which bar all other pictures and which the individual considers hostile. And thenyou’ve done that, why, the individual gets back all of his pictures. It’s very simple. The hostileones can no longer bite.Now you’ve got a Case Level 2. Now you go after the mechanism which makes it automaticfor him to make pictures, and you put this back on power of choice, and of course you’ve gotan OT. And that’s the whole scope of processing where it has to do with pictures and bank andknowingness and so forth; they’re all wrapped up in that.Well no v, you see, instead of erasing pictures, you could go at this another way. You couldbring up the individual’s confront with regard to pictures to such an extent that he could evenface the hostile ones. Ah, that’s an interesting approach, too, isn’t it?Now, this is comparable to the old exteriorization approach. Instead of erasing the guy’s bank,pull him out of it. That’s the old exteriorization approach.Well. this is a similar approach, but it’s different than either of those approaches, you see, oferasing the pictures or pulling the guy out of the picture. We’re pushing the guy up so that hecan disentangle and confront his pictures. In other words, we’re getting him so he can"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"understand his pictures. And X his one works, too, which actually gives you a third route toprocessing.So R2H is not just a method of erasing pictures or getting the PC away from his pictures, itactually raises the individuals potential in recognizing and owning his pictures and making thepictures better.Now, well-run R2H can make the pictures much better, much prettier, much solider, withoutthem being obsessively solid so that they intimidate the PC with their tremendous solidity.Now, that’s the important point of itSo, with R2H, you actually are embarked on another philosophy. If you understand this gripon it, it is its own philosophy. Doesn’t make the other philosophies invalid, but it embarks onits own private, personal railroad car and says this is a whole philosophy in itself. Of course, ituses the elements and mechanics and other things, but the individualism of R2H is based onthis. There have been some new discoveries about this, and they’ve been put to work in R2H.And let me show you what these things look like.Here is a thetan. Now, your first level of life and beingness, your first look at life andbeingness, what life and beingness are, exist as potentials or abilities, not as things. And thosepotentials and abilities consist of A, R and C.You know all about A, R and C: Affinity, Reality and Communication. But think of thosethings as potentials. Not affinity for anything special but the potential of having affinity. Inother words, you could say, “What is the potential of the A, R and C of an individual? What i5his potential?” You’d be asking the same thing as “How alive is he?” The more alive he is, themore ARC he’s capable of; the less alive he is the less ARC he’s capable of. That’s interesting,isn’t it?What do you think of a philosophy that thinks that man is mud? Well, let’s take a look at this.ARC. ARC—and probably this could be drawn in different ways. ARC goes out to . . . Andremember that communication with other beings is through matter, energy, space, time and soforth, see? This ARC potential, or ARC with what? What is this ARC with? Communicationwith, reality about, affinity for, see? What are these things connected up with? Well, it exists,but it isn’t necessary to our proposition at all, and it’s a highly individual and odd bit ofbusiness, see, that transcends matter, energy, space and time and goes straight to other beings.So, we would have thetans as a thing to be in ARC with, and then we would have matter,energy, space, time, form, location. Now, you could add to this, you could break these downfurther, but they are the principal things beyond which there is Do breakdown. Possibly inimportance it ought to be L and then F.Now, the ARC that this individual has expresses the degree that he can be cause over these.The potential of ARC of the individual gives you the degree that he can be at cause overthetans, matter, energy, space, time, form and location. The less life he has, the less he is.Now, as a thetan gets more and more solid, he is less and less capable of ARC. That’s fairlyobvious, isn’t it? Why? It isn’t that his solidity prevents him from communicating or feelingaffinity or that sort of thing, but it’s simply an indicator that he must have broken ARC withmatter, energy, space, time, form and location, or it wouldn’t be piled on him without hischoice. That’s an interesting point, isn’t it? He must have had ARC breaks, then, with matter,energy, space, time, form and location. Ah, but how could he have ARC breaks with matter,energy, space, time, form and location without having ARC breaks with other thetans? Well, Ithink it’s probable, and very possible, that he could have. But the truth of the matter is, it washaving ARC breed’s with other thetans that caused him to start to ARC break with matter,energy, space, time, form and location. Doesn’t necessarily follow that way, but essentiallythat would be it."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"So, as an individual rises up the line—as he rises up the line—he then rises back toward directcommunication, direct affinity, direct reality on other beings. The less ARC he has, the morematter, energy, space, time, form and location he has to go through in order to communicate toother beings.See you look a little bit dense on that one. Let me give you an idiot’s line. Here you have Bill,and here you have space, and here you have Joe. Now, Joe, in order to hear Bill, has toregister an air wave which is generated by Bill. So Bill generates an air wave—vibrations—thatare received by Joe and are reinterpreted into ARC. So ARC here are converted, and then areconverted from matter, energy, space, time to ARC. And you in actual fact have done thiscycle. This thetan here communicates to those thetans there by going up here, here, see? Andactually, they communicate back similarly. See? Get the idea?Once you drop away from telepathy, you enter MEST into the line, and ARC, then, becomessubordinate to MEST. And you eventually get a bunch of knuckle heads implanted up to theirears. Did you ever realize Einstein went through the between-lives area when he kicked thebucket? (Served him right. I wonder if he traveled faster than constant? These brutal, gruesomethoughts I have every once in a while.)Now, look at this: Man is not mud, but a fellow who isn’t alive at all would think only“mudly.” He’d have very muddy thinking. He’d come to mud-like conclusions. Therefore, hismental sciences are very mud-like.There are no mental studies which admit—today, that are currently being taught—that admit ofthe existence of a being. They only admit of the existence of biological combinations of mudresulting in a very muddy result. Psychology textbooks today begin by very carefully definingthe fact they do not know what a psyche is, and they do not even know if one exists—andthey’re pretty sure it doesn’t—”but we will now give you the parts of the brain.” See?What are you dealing with there? You’re dealing with somebody who is so far away from otherbeings that he is no longer talking through MEST, he’s talking to MEST. Ding, ding, ding,here comes the wagon!Every once in a while you see some poor little kid that’s been knocked in the dome too much,and he’ll be out there beating his red wagon. And you yourself in your dippier moments willstart talking to something on the mantelpiece. And when you’re particularly foggy in themorning and haven’t been awakened, you’re very often prone to curse your shoes.Well, you may be doing it on another harmonic, because a thetan is always capable of investingthings with life. And you’re probably doing it because you’ve “alived” the shoe. You see,you’re perfectly capable of mocking up a living being and making it talk and walk totallyindependent of you. Perfectly, perfectly capable of doing that. Used to do it as OTs all the time.So you’re capable of investing matter, energy, space and time, and so forth, with life. Andtheta other-determining it, saying it is no longer I, and having it walk around and talk.Now, that’s a potential that’s talked about in Dianetics: Evolution of a Science, that speaks of“Throgmagog.” You can always invest something with life, such as a shoe. And you canalways pretend that a shoe is alive. But how would you like to be in the kind of a conditionwhere you thought another living being was no more capable of life than a shoe? Let’s reversethat, see? Let’s get a total reverse on the situation. Let’s look at a living being and say that thisliving being has no life in it.Now, you got some kind of an estimate of how far down scale you can go, and somebody canstill sit there and eat breakfast. Got the idea? It’s pretty far south.Matter, energy, space, time, form and location—ARC breaks with, cause the dwindling spiralof. ARC breaks with other beings, matter, energy, space, time, form and location bring about adeterioration of one’s ARC."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"It never really deteriorates; one just believes it is deteriorated, you see? In other words, you canhave an ARC break with MEST, you can have an ARC break with form, you can have an ARCbreak with locations. It’s very common for an animal to have ARC break with locations. Aplace where an animal has been hurt will be avoided by that animal, very carefully.Now, what in essence does this forecast? That is the basic theory behind R2H. It forecasts thatby clearing up a person’s ARC breaks, one then returns to him his ARC potential. Clean up hisARC breaks with matter, he feels better about matter. Clean up his ARC breaks with energy,he’ll feel better about energy. Clean up his ARC breaks with space, he feels better about space.Clean up his ARC breaks with time and he will feel better about time. Clean up his ARC breakswith form and he will feel better about form. Clean up his ARC breaks with location, he feelsbetter about location. Clean up his ARC breaks with other beings and he feels better about otherbeings. And all the way up the line, of course, his bank—that reservoir of ARC breaks—isgetting plainer and plainer to him and more and more confrontable to him. Because all of hisARC breaks in terms of pictures have responded as the reactive-mind ARC breaks. Becausereactive mind is made, after all, out of images of other beings, matter, energy, space, time,form and location. It’s as easy as that. And that consists of the reactive mind.So by cleaning up his ARC breaks with these things, you tend to clean up his ARC breaks withthe things he’s got pictures of in the reactive mind that he can’t confront, and his reactive mindopens up and he can tolerate it and confront it.So R2H considers and conceives that the reactive mind is a reservoir of ARC breaks. That isthe basic assumption on which that process hops off. We know that the reactive mind containsimages or beliefs in other beings, and certainly their images in terms of thought, don’t you see?We might, by the way, have put a T under other beings for “thought,” you see, becausethought or significance could be included in that; but by just putting up other beings you alsohave the reflections of other beings, so that you could omit that.But you know that the reactive mind consists of images of other beings, thoughts of otherbeings, thoughts of oneself and so forth, plus matter (if you don’t believe it’s composed ofmatter, someday run into a ridge); energy (you hear and see the energy flitter-nattering aroundin the reactive mind all the time and that’s what registers on the tone arm); space every once in awhile a guy can’t see a thing, and then he suddenly realizes he’s looking across too much spaceto see it. In a picture, it always has space, and lack of space is the main thing that’s upsetting inthe reactive bank—you can’t get away from the lousy thing, see? You can’t put space betweenit and you. Space is the cure for no-confront, see? And time: good heavens! The thing is nottime. If there’s any time in the bank, that is remarkable. What you have in the bank is anabsence of time an apparent absence in time in the presence of a totality of time. You’ve got anothing where a something is and a something where a nothing is. And that’s what makes itreactive.Reactive—remember, that’s what the thing is called. That means instantaneous responseregardless of what time the response is laid in. A=A=A also equals twenty-nine years agoequals a billion years ago equals eight trillion years ago. Before you start inspecting it, they’reall the same time. So you got this terrific time identification; you also have space, energy andmatter identifications.Now, as far as form is concerned, that’s not h terribly upgraded thing. It comes-into the fieldof aesthetics and arts more than anything else. Some people like Picasso, some people don’t.Some people like blondes, some people like brunettes. Form: aesthetics, tastes, that sort ofthing. And the reactive bank—the things least confronted in the reactive bank are those formswhich one has disliked most. And Bo, of course, he’s got a wonderful close-up stockpile offorms he detests. We’re not talking now about income-tax forms; we’re talking aboutpleasanter things, like girls and things.Anyhow, as far as location is concerned, if there’s anything that is A=A=A in the reactivemind, its location. When I first collided with this early Helatrobus, I was absolutely sure that it"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"was in exactly the same location— that here, trillions of trillions of trillions of years before,some knuckle head had begun this thing and then somebody had walked back in the vicinityand said, “Well, this is what you do when you are here,” and proceeded to give the Helatrobusimplants. I was sure that was the case. In fact, I only know now intellectually that it is not thesame place, because it’s the same type of scenery. Given a little similarity of form, and boy,those locations were identical. But what you doing right now, packing around in your bank andyour head and your ridges planets which are light-years away? Looks to me like that’s a veryinteresting identification of location.In an auditing session this comes off all the time. It happens so often that you don’t even thinkabout it. This guy is sitting there, let us say he’s running something, and it’s something thathappened in Australia. Doesn’t seem either peculiar to the auditor or the PC that it is being runout in England. There’s a 12,500-mile error in location. And you very often see this kind of anodd thing happen: You get the thing all run, and it goes spang! and stays there. It goes to itsproper location. It seems to disappear or something.Of course, by moving in time you can make the thing disappear too. But I’ve had this oddexperience of not being able to run certain engrams because they were too well fixed in theirproper location. You practically have to go to Arizona to run it—that’s where it happened! Youcan spot the facsimile, but it’s over in Arizona. Well, it couldn’t be very aberrative if it fixes its location that smartly, see, because that’s the right location.Well now, if everything was on its proper time span, you’d have to move all over time in orderto connect with anything, wouldn’t you? So the thing must be in its improper time span if youcan reach it in present time without yourself moving back trillions of years in time. Well,there’s something wrong in the reactive mind with other beingness and other thoughts, withmatter, with energy, with space, with time, with form and location, and everything that is thematter is they’re identified one with another. Two times are identified, two forms are identified,two locations are identified, two spaces are identified, two energies identified, two massesidentified.Can also go the other way into what you call a disassociate. And you as Scientologists run lessinto this thing of disassociation. Someday you may read some Sigmund Freud, and you’ll hearall about disassociation because he specialized in this thing, disassociation. It’s not anythingwe’ve ever talked about to amount to anything, but two things which are the same thing,approximately, look entirely different. In other words, two pictures of the same person at twodifferent locations look like two different people, see? That is an inverse of identification.Things that should be seen to be similar are seen to be madly different.You don’t pay much attention to this because after a person’s done that he’s more or lessflipped his lid. But you’re now going to run into disassociation, and that’s why I’m making alittle side comment on it here as we go, because you’re going to run into it if you really put inthe itsa line. And you’re going to wonder what’s happening. Because the PC doesn’t at firstanswer the auditing question. You say, “Have you had any gains in this session?”And he says, “The . . . well, so on . . . The floor dropped out, and then I had a couple ofdrinks. And three or four years ago, why, I knew a girl named Mabel.”And now, in putting in your itsa line, by the rules of the game you shouldn’t interrupt him. Hemay sit there, but hex not finished with that communication. And he’ll keep on going and goingand going, and you’ll see all these disassociates come up. And then all of a sudden, if you lethim go on, he will eventually come up and tell you a gain he has made for the session.But you’re running such violent stuff, you see, on the whole track, that as he passes throughthe stuff, he’s actually going through the session trying to answer your question, and thesethings are getting in his road, so he says them to you, they tend to as-is, and after that he canfinally reach the material necessary to answer your question. Got the idea?"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"But now, if you’ve put in an itsa line all the way across the line you’re going to seedisassociation, so you better know what it is. It’s simply that two things which should be seento be similar are seen to be madly different. It’s the inverse of identification. It’s you ought tosee a similarity between the question and the answer.“Have you had a gain for the session?”“Yes, I’ve had a gain for the session. I can see better.”You get that? Now, that’s a similarity, you see? There’s the same communication line, and theanswer compares to the question that was asked. You get a disassociation this way:“Have you had a gain in the session?”“I had a beer three years ago.”That’s a disassociate. Well, it isn’t that the PC isn’t answering your question, he’s gettingaround to it. And if you’re very good at your itsa line, he will eventually wander torturouslythrough and eventually will come up and say, “Yes, I don’t feel like I’ll be so thirsty all thetime.” Of course, that is almost a sequitur statement. He will have uttered other statements lesssequitur. But as you search the thing out, you would see that he was coming closer and closerto answering your question as he talked.Try that sometime on a full itsa line, and you will be very, very, very pleased with the result.The guy was answering your auditing question. If you let him go on tanking he eventuallywould have answered your auditing question. He only didn’t answer your auditing question ifyou cut him off at the point he was disassociating. Then he didn’t seem to answer your auditingquestion.You’ll notice his eye is no longer on you again, you’ll notice he’s still groping, you’ll noticehe’s still fumbling with the bank, as he tells you these things. You’ll see this. Well, that’s adisassociate.All right. Guy comes up and slugs his mother, thinking that she is about to rob him. Well, he’sassociated his mother with a burglar. Well, you’d say he’s nuts. Well, yeah, true enough. Butthere are people who are nuts. But that is what that is.So identification isn’t the only crime. There’s one beyond identification. That’s, two things thatyou ought to recognize the similarity between, you see as vastly different.So this whole thing here goes on to an inversion. What you get is a restimulator factor. Weknew a girl who had pink hair, see? We knew n girl who had pink hair, so therefore girls whohave pink hair aren’t to be trusted; therefore nothing pink must be trusted. And we know afellow named “Pink,” who brushes his teeth, so we’d better not brush our teeth anymore. Doyou follow that torturous line of logic?Well, that is ARC as it goes down scale doesn’t just stay as ARC, it goes into an inverse,because it gets too many things identified, and then it gets things disassociated in some kind ofan effort to see some separateness in existence, and eventually starts going into a twisteroo. Sothat you will have people who consider good communication shooting people. High level ofcommunication.I had a husky one time that knew what communication was: chewing people up and beingbitten. There he was. He was quite a dog. It was very funny, I’ll never forget that dog; he wasthe toughest dog I think I ever saw. I’d walk into the yard after being gone for a long time—you know, a year or two or something like that—and this dog would suddenly see this“stranger,” and he would bare his teeth—he was one of these fantastic malamutes—and he’dbare his teeth, come tearing across the yard, fangs just shooting out of his face in all directions."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"And I’d pick him up on either side Of his jowl and, using his lunge, throw him twenty-fivefeet. You practice up a little bit with police dogs and things, you can get so you do—it’s likedog judo, you know? And he’d go through the air and he’d land. And he’d get up: “Oh, Ron!”He knew what communication was!So, there’s all kinds of wild levels of communication. You get people tell you what pleasureis—they describe agony. It’s very funny. So you get these various inversions. ARC, then,doesn’t just decline, it goes and inverts and inverts again and inverts again. And you get ahodgepodge down at the end that nobody can make anything out of. Go down and listen tothem in the spinbins and you’ll see how far ARC can go, because those people are still alive.They’re still alive.How far can ARC go south? All the way—there is no bottom at which one dies, but there’ssome mighty peculiar things happen on the way down.Beingnesses can die, but the individual—no. Forms can die, but the person actually—no.Memory can die, but not the person who is capable of remembering, you see? Not the personwho—who is, you see? He can forget everything. And he’s still in that kind of a state.Now, ARC never ceases, so you have no bottom to the process. There are no bottom limits tothe process. There is some method of communicating all the way down. It gets down intoweird versions of reach and withdraw, as I just described one to you—with the dog. That’s akind of a reach and withdraw. Want to make him happy all day Sunday? Why, chew him up allSaturday night, you know? Big case gain.This is your Tone Scale. As people go upscale, they go up through anger and so forth. It’svery funny.I remember one poor psycho in New York: Auditors would process her, get her up to anger,and she’d scold her family, and they’d promptly put her in restraints and put her back in thehospital. And then she’d get out, and then the auditors would process her, and she’d get backup to a point where she’d scold her family, and they put her back. And this nonsense just keptgoing, see? They’d never let her get up through anger. Of course, they’d been knocking her infor a long time, and she just never was able to say that she was mad about it. She was neverable to do that, so she never recovered.Now, here’s a case, then, of a process which if you can get any C in at all and get animprovement of the C or an improvement of the R or an improvement of the A, you get animprovement of the C, an improvement of the R. an improvement of the A, an improvement ofthe C, an improvement of the R. an improvement of the A—you get the idea? And you justkeep raising this triangle—all three corners of this triangle—up, up, up, by the process ofrunning ARC breaks. Now, the basic limit of the process is the communication of the auditingcommand itself. And you’ll be surprised how many interpretations there are of an ARC break.And one might make a criticism of the process by saying, “Well, look, it has such a specializedcommand: ‘Recall an ARC break.’ Only a Scientologist would know what that meant.”Well, actually, you’re really not asking for an upset, you’re not asking for a worry, you’re notasking for a time he was concerned, you’re not asking for this, you’re not asking for that;you’re asking for an ARC break. Now, I don’t think it’d take you any time to describe to thePC what an ARC break was, and he’d eventually settle in his own head what an ARC breakwas. He’d be better off if he could understand the communication of this phrase ARC break.But this is one of the weak spots of the process. But its not a very weak spot.It’s very funny how fast this communicates. You say, “Life is composed of affinity, reality andcommunication. When one of these breaks down, a person doesn’t feel so good aboutsomething. Now, an ARC break is a time when affinity, reality or communication have beencut down on a person, have been reduced. I hat’s what an ARC break is.”"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"It may take the individual three or four days to digest the definition. But the funny part of it is,having digested the definition, he will have made a case gain. I don’t really consider it aliability.Now, that process isn’t going to be used very broadly, and shotgunnish. You can’t use it in aco-audit; it’s too particularized.So there’s the anatomy, however, of what you are trying to do with the process. You are tryingto increase the individual’s affinity and reality and communication with other thetans andthought, matter, energy, space, time, form and location by picking up those points in timewhen the individual has suffered a cut or reduction of communication, has suffered from alowering of reality, or from a reduction of affinity level—period. You don’t care what he hadan ARC break with, because he has to come up quite a ways to recognize ARC breaks withMEST. This is a long way north—good, clean-cut ARC breaks with MEST.In that earlier GPM, about the only thing that was causing a great deal of difficulty in running itwas a supreme ARC break with MEST, that it would obey people who would do things likethis GPM implant—big ARC break with the fact that MEST obeyed that sort of thing—and anARC break with the people for debasing and degrading MEST to such a usage and end. Theitems— to hell with it. See, that wasn’t the important thing. The important thing was thatanybody who would attempt something like this using MEST, that MEST would obey them, soon. Big ARC break. So there’s one even wrapped up in a GPM.The thought that you’re trying to get across with your auditing command is you want a timewhen affinity, reality and communication have been reduced with other beings, matter, energy,space, time, form and locations. And you don’t direct what you’re going to get the ARC breakabout or with; that’ll all work out more or less automatically. You simply ask for an ARCbreak. You don’t ask “in this lifetime”; you don’t limit him in time; you hope he’ll give yousomething to at least let you get your teeth into the process and get the process grooved inbefore you’re handling a God-’elp-us engram, but you want from the PC a time of thatreduction. That is what you want. And that’s all you want. And then you want to find out fromthe PC what it was.This goes into your form, which is still being worked out, but which is more or less grooved innow. The formal steps of R2H done for good gain on the case are What, Where, When, andthen an assessment, and then cleaning up every line of the assessment when it reads—notgoing by it. That is a difference. And working the ARC break over until it no longer reads onthe meter and the PC feels all right about it, and so forth.Now, the exact way the assessment is done, I’ll go over that again . . . I’d better go a little bitearlier. The exact way What is done, is you take what the PC is willing to tell you withoutprobing. “What’s this ARC break about?” and he’ll give you a resume of it, very brief, usually.Where? Where: that’s to help him get the time. See, these are all development of the ARCbreaks so that he can more ably identify them. And then When. Now, this When gets veryimportant. He’ll have trouble with the Where, but nothing compared to the trouble he may getinto with the When.Now, the rule is, you use your meter on these three steps only when the last dog has beenhanged. And you don’t date nothing with the meter unless the PC is in despair and on the vergeof tears about the actual time. And then you chip in, at the last moment, and you say—so on.Something like this: This meter dating is terribly easy. You know, there’s a training version;that’s to train you to date on a meter. I’m giving you the therapeutic version; this is the way shereally rolls. You’ve been sitting there with the meter in front of you, and the PC’s been saying,“It’s 1937—no, it’s 1936, 1937; no, 1936; no, 1937; no, nineteen-thirty . . . ‘37, I think itwas; ‘38, ‘38, maybe it was ‘38, ‘39. No, it could have been nineteen thirty (sigh) just don’tknow, I just don’t know, I just don’t know where. I don’t know when it was. 1937, 19 . . .”"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"He’s already admitted he doesn’t know and your TA action has showed down to nothing, andso forth. And you’ve watched 1937 bang every time he said it. You say, “It’s 1937, accordingto the meter.” That’s your dating step. Got that?PC may get into a specialized case sometimes, when if it was in 1937 it would be a terribleARC break, whereas if it was in 1938 it wouldn’t have been a terrible ARC break becausesomething else had happened. So they keep saying it’s 1938 when it was 1937.Here’s the only other way you go about this: When your tone arm is hung up you’ve got awrong date, and you damn well better find it. Tone arm is hung up, you can’t get it moving,everything is going to the devil, and so forth, well, you just better do a scout for wrong dates.“Do we have a wrong date?”There is a number two that you scout for when the tone arm has stuck. (This is repairing it.)Number two is you get in your BMRs on the session or the process, because the PC hasrecalled ARC breaks which he has then suppressed and has not given the auditor. That causes atone arm hang-up. These are the three things that hang up a tone arm. And the PC ARC breaksin session because of an ARC break in the past. It isn’t because you’ve bypassed charge in thesession; he’s recalled an ARC break in the past, which has given him an ARC break in thesession. And when you find that—any one of those three (wrong date, suppressed ARC breaksor an ARC break in the session because of an ARC break in the past)—you’ve got to remedythe situation. Your tone arm will stick and the process becomes unworkable. But one of thosethree things exists if your tone arm ceases to move on this.The other one that can stop your tone arm from moving is just too corny. You’ve missed anassessment, you’ve missed a meter read, and you haven’t got the reason of the bypassedcharge. That’s just pretty corny. That’s under the heading of meter reading, and so forth.The ARC break is always cleaned up to the tremendous satisfaction of the PC, and you’relooking on this as something whereby you do an assessment, you say, “Well, that was thebypassed charge. That’s it, thank you. Recall another ARC break.” That isn’t the way it’sdone.Now, let’s go into the last end of this thing. You’re doing an assessment: You clear it line byline, just like you used to do old rudiments. If you get a read, you say, “That read.” You’ve gotyour pat assessment sheet. “That read.” You got a new one; there’ll probably even be newerones developed from time to time. I haven’t issued this latest sheet yet, but it’s very comparableto the L1 which you’ve got, it’s just a little better.You see that “an attitude refused” does so. That ticks. You didn’t go down the whole thing,see? You just said—right off the bat, you said, “All right. In that ARC break was an attituderefused?” Tick. You say, “All right. What attitude was refused?” And that’s the end of yourjob. It’s now up to the itsa. That’s your whatsa. And the PC is going to stem and fuss and stewand try to figure out what attitude was refused where. And the only time it won’t come off iswhen those three things I gave you are out: you’ve had a wrong date in the session; the PC hasrecalled some ARC breaks and suppressed them; or the PC has had an ARC break in thepresent time in the session. See? And this system doesn’t work if those three are present. Andif this system doesn’t work, those three are present.So you clean this line up, and it’s all up to the PC. “An attitude refused? I don’t think anyattitude was refused . . . attitude was refused . . .” and so forth and so on. Says, “Well, I don’t. . . I don’t think there was one.”What do you know! At this point do you shove it down his throat? You say, “No? All right,thank you,” and go to the next line. Well, he can’t remember it, so obviously the thing needsshaking up some more.But you leave that mark alongside of that thing, because you’re going to come back to it. It was"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"hot once; it’s going to be hot again. In other words, that just wasn’t ready to be answered;that’s the only thing you communicate on that. If he can’t find it, and he says he can’t, that’s it.Leave it marked. Don’t even say “We’ll come back to it later.” Say “All right” and go on to thenext line. Otherwise your needle’s going to get so dirty you can’t assess. It’s a highly practicalconsideration.And you say, “All right. Was that ARC break caused by a communication ignored?”—you getdown to that line, see?—and it goes ping! And you say, “All right. I have here that acommunication was ignored. What communication was ignored?”“Oh, well, let’s see. It was Bill and me and Pete, and there were three dogs. And a spaceshiplanded. And the dog barked, and we said to hell with it, but if we’d listened to the dog bark. . .Yeah. Yeah. We ignored the dog barking. Heh-heh! Yeah.” Down comes your tone arm.You run by blowdowns. Your whole meter action is by blowdowns; your whole determinationis by blowdowns. You find an ARC break for which you get no blowdowns, then you haven’tgot the cause of the ARC break and the PC hasn’t remembered anything about the ARC break.But just because you get one blowdown doesn’t mean that the ARC break is gone. At this pointyou say to the PC, “How do you feel about that ARC break?” and watch it on the meter.The question is asked of the PC and watched on the meter. If you get a rough-up of a needle—the slightest reaction of a needle—that ARC break isn’t gone. But usually the PC will tell you,“Well, I don’t feel as good about it as I want.” Then keep on with your assessments. Do youunderstand? But every time you find one, and you clear one up, then you ask the PC how befeels about it. PC feels all right and it doesn’t bang on the meter—to hell with it, get off of it,man. That’s it, that’s it.Don’t get into a situation where the PC feels perfectly all right about it and you haven’t donethree quarters of your assessment sheet, so you just go on doggedly doing the remaining threequarters of your assessment sheet. You’re now trying to find the bypassed charge for an ARCbreak that doesn’t exist. And I can guarantee that you’ve got the withhold of nothing. The PChasn’t got anything to tell you, so he’s going to ARC break.So the other frailty of R2H, much more important than the communication of its auditingcommand, is that an inexpert handling of R2H can bring about an ARC break. Very interesting.Every time you find a line, you go through the same song and dance. You find a line, you askhim the question, he answers the question, he’s got it all to his satisfaction no matter how longthe itsa line is. Don’t expect to do many of these a session, man. You probably won’t do morethan three, four, five a session. But boy, the tone arm action you can milk out of that thing—wham, wham, wham, wham, wham. You can get lots of tone arm actionWhy recall ten and get the same tone arm action as you get recalling four, and still leave the PCwith some missed withholds? You get the idea? So you just want tone arm action out of it, notthe number of ARC breaks handled. See, you’re not interested in the number of ARC breakshandled; just handle those you get well. Every time you find a reason for it, you’ll find a tick,and the PC will give you the answer, and you’ve now got that.Now, you don’t even necessarily test that line again. You can drive a PC berserk. He’s nowsatisfied. He’s found it, and so forth.Now, you may suspect, from the doubtful nature and the fact you haven’t got a blowdown,that there is another tick on She same line. Just say, “Well, I’ll check this line now. In thatARC break was a communication ignored? You know, that still reads. Do you suppose youhad—know any reason why that should still be reading?”“Well . . . no, I don’t see why it should be reading. Maybe I protested.”"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"“All right. You protested it, that’s all. That’s all I wanted to know.” Down to the next line.Leave it. You’re not going to get anyplace shoving it down the PC’s throat.But every now and then you say, “That line still reads.”“Oh, it does? Oh, well, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. The—ha-hs!—it wasn’t really the dog communication, I ignored their communication. They told me notto go anywhere near that place and I did and I ignored their c . Yeah, well, that caused the ARCbreak with them, because they should have told me more loudly.” And you’ll see your tone armblow down.You see how it’s done? Treat them like end rudiments that you don’t care whether they clean upor not, and don’t leave an ARC break unless the thing is reading smooth as glass. An ARCbreak is going to give you blowdowns. Just regard it as a source of getting some blowdowns.And if an ARC break doesn’t blow down, you’re now going to run into trouble with later ARCbreaks. That is the way to forecast trouble. We had ARC break, and then we had another ARCbreak, and we didn’t get any blowdown on either of these ARC breaks. Ohhh! Now, our thirdARC break—our chances of our getting a blowdown on that . . . The next thing you know,you’re getting in the mid ruds and the PC’s going into an automaticity of suppressing ARCbreaks, and we’ve got a sort of a mess on our hands. Why? Because we excited somebypassed charge by asking for the ARC break and then didn’t clean the bypassed charge.Now, the whole basic mechanism on which you are operating here is that incidents will blow ifthe misaligned or bypassed charge is knocked out, and that an ARC break is caused bybypassed charge. There is no ARC break without bypassed charge. So therefore you must findthe bypassed charge, and if you do, there won’t be any ARC break. And it straightens the bankout, and the guy gets oriented in the middle of his bank, and there you are.It’s a terribly permissive process. It depends on the itsa line and that accurate assessment, andthen, having found what the thing assesses, let the guy run on.And it also depends on not to keep slugging him with assessments for ARC breaks that havecleaned up. It has a frailty. You can get the whole ARC break cleaned up, it doesn’t seemhardly worthwhile. And there was a reality rejected, and you got a ping on that (it wasn’t a verybig ping), and he answered this thing, and we asked for the ARC break, and he didn’t havemuch of an ARC break, but now we went on and did the rest of the assessment. Oh, you’vegot an ARC break now. Why? You’ve invalidated the reason which he gave for the ARCbreak.Takes rather delicate, slippy auditing. But with those reservations, it’s absolutely terrific. It’s afabulous process. Terribly mild, terribly permissive.I see I’ve left you hanging on the ropes a little bit; there’s probably something you don’tunderstand about the process. But if you just did it like end mid ruds, which you didn’t botherto finish if your PC got bright, then you’ve got it made. You’ve got it made. And if youmonitor its success by the number of blowdowns which you get, you’ve also got it made. Andwhen it doesn’t blow down, start worrying. And if it is blowing down and the TA is movingand so forth, don’t worry. Just sit back and ride your luck. Look for trouble when it comes,not before it gets there, because it’ll carry you through all the way.PC wants to talk to you the whole session about one ARC break which is giving you tone armaction from 2.0 to 6.5, you are an absolute nut not to let him. See? It’s the amount of tone armaction you can get in the session, up and down, not the number of ARC breaks you cover.Because the PC you are auditing is in, after all, present time. He is here, all there is of him ishere. He isn’t barred out of existence by his bank. And if you discharge all of these crossedbypassed charges off of present time, theoretically you could run him all the way to OT withouthim ever going backtrack to amount to anyone [Anything]. He just picks up this item and thatitem and that incident and that incident and this one and straightens them out, and his pictures"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"are getting better and the track is straightening out.And the nest thing you know, he’s eight feet back of his head saying, “What do you want donewith these between-lives guys?”Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICESaint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, SussexHCO BULLETIN OF 3 MAY 1962FranchiseARC BREAKSMISSED WITHHOLDS(HOW TO USE THIS BULLETIN.WHEN AN AUDITOR OR STUDENT HAS TROUBLE WITH AN “ARCBREAKY PC” OR NO GAIN, OR WHEN AN AUDITOR IS FOUND TO BEUSING FREAK CONTROL METHODS OR PROCESSES TO “KEEP A PC INSESSION”, THE HCO SEC, D OF T OR D OF P SHOULD JUST HAND ACOPY OF THIS BULLETIN TO THE AUDITOR AND MAKE HIM OR HERSTUDY IT AND TAKE AN HCO EXAM ON IT.)After some months of careful observation and tests, I can state conclusively that:ALL ARC BREAKS STEM FROM MISSED WITHHOLDS.This is vital technology, vital to the auditor and to anyone who wants to live.Conversely:THERE ARE NO ARC BREAKS WHEN MISSED WITHHOLDS HAVE BEENCLEANED UP.By WITHHOLD is meant AN UNDISCLOSED CONTRA-SURVIVAL ACT.By MISSED WITHHOLD is meant AN UNDISCLOSED CONTRA-SURVIVALACT WHICH HAS BEEN RESTIMULATED BY ANOTHER BUT NOT DISCLOSED.This is FAR more important in an auditing session than most auditors have yet realized.Even when some auditors are told about this and shown it they still seem to miss its importanceand fail to use it. Instead they continue to use strange methods of controlling the pc and oddballprocesses on ARC Breaks.This is so bad that one auditor let a pc die rather than pick up the missed withholds! Soallergy to picking up missed withholds can be so great that an auditor has been known to failutterly rather than do so. Only constant hammering can drive this point home. When it is drivenhome, only then can auditing begin to happen across the world; the datum is that important.An auditing session is 50% technology and 50% application. I am responsible for thetechnology. The auditor is wholly responsible for the application. Only when an auditorrealizes this can he or she begin to obtain uniformly marvellous results everywhere.No auditor now needs “something else”, some odd mechanism to keep pcs in session.PICKING UP MISSED WITHHOLDS KEEPS PCS IN SESSION.There is no need for a rough, angry ARC Breaky session. If there is one it is not the faultof the pc. It is the fault of the auditor. The auditor has failed to pick up missed withholds."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"As of now it is not the pc that sets the tone of the session. It is the auditor. And theauditor who has a difficult session (providing he or she has used standard technology, modelsession, and can run an E-Meter), has one only because he or she failed to ask for missedwithholds.What is called a “dirty needle” (a pc’s needle pattern) is caused by missed withholds, notwithholds.Technology today is so powerful that it must be flawlessly applied. One does his CCHsin excellent 2 way comm with the pc. One has his TRs, Model Session and E-Meter operationcompletely perfect. And one follows exact technology. And one keeps the missed withholdspicked up.There is an exact and precise auditor action and response for every auditing situation, andfor every case. We are not today beset by variable approaches. The less variable the auditor’sactions and responses, the greater gain in the pc. It is terribly precise. There is no room forflubs.Further, every pc action has an exact auditor response. And each of these has its own drillby which it can be learned.Auditing today is not an art, either in technology or procedure. It is an exact science. Thisremoves Scientology from every one of the past practices of the mind.Medicine advanced only to the degree that its responses by the practitioner werestandardized and the practitioner had a professional attitude toward the public.Scientology is far ahead of that today.What a joy it is to a preclear to receive a completely standard session. To receive a textbook session. And what gains the pc makes! And how easy it is on the auditor!It isn’t how interesting or clever the auditor is that makes the session. It’s how standardthe auditor is. Therein lies pc confidence.Part of that standard technology is asking for missed withholds any time the pc starts togive any trouble. This is, to a pc, a totally acceptable control factor. And it totally smooths thesession.You have no need for and must not use any ARC Break process. Just ask for missedwithholds.Here are some of the manifestations cured by asking for missed withholds.1. Pc failing to make progress.2. Pc critical of or angry at auditor.3.

Dissemination failures.Now I think you will agree that in the above list we have every ill we suffer from in theactivities of auditing.Now PLEASE believe me when I tell you there is ONE CURE for the lot and ONLY thatone. There are no other cures.The cure is contained in the simple question or its variations “Have I missed a withholdon you ? “THE COMMANDSIn case of any of the conditions l. to 15. above ask the pc one of the following commandsand CLEAN THE NEEDLE OF ALL INSTANT READ. Ask the exact question you asked thefirst time as a final test. The needle must be clean of all instant reaction before you can go on toanything else. It helps the pc if each time the needle twitches, the auditor says, “That” or“There” quietly but only to help the pc see what is twitching. One doesn’t interrupt the pc if heor she is already giving it. This prompting is the only use of latent reads in Scientology—tohelp the pc spot what reacted in the first place.The commonest questions:“In this session, have I missed a withhold on you?”“In this session have I failed to find out something?”“In this session is there something I don’t know about you?”The best beginning rudiments withhold question:“Since the last session is there something you have done that I don’t know about?”Prepcheck Zero Questions follow:“Has somebody failed to find out about you who should have?”“Has anyone ever failed to find out something about you?”“Is there something I failed to find out about you?”“Have you ever successfully hidden something from an auditor?”“Have you ever done something somebody failed to discover?”“Have you ever evaded discovery in this lifetime?”“Have you ever hidden successfully?”“Has anyone ever failed to locate you?”(These Zeroes do not produce “What” questions until the auditor has located a specificovert.)When Prepchecking, when running any process but the CCHs, if any one of the auditing"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"circumstances in l to 15 above occurs, ask for missed withholds. Before leaving any chain ofoverts in Prepchecking, or during Prepchecking, ask frequently for missed withholds, “Have Imissed any withhold on you?” or as above.Do not conclude intensives on any process without cleaning up missed withholds.Asking for missed withholds does not upset the dictum of using no O/W processes inrudiments.Most missed withholds clean up at once on two way comm providing the auditor doesn’task leading questions about what the pc is saying. Two way comm consists of asking for whatthe meter showed, acknowledging what the pc said and checking the meter again with themissed withhold question. If pc says, “I was mad at my wife,” as an answer, just ack andcheck the meter with the missed withhold question. Don’t say, “What was she doing?”In cleaning missed withholds do not use the Prepcheck system unless you arePrepchecking. And even in Prepchecking, if the zero is not a missed withhold question and youare only checking for missed withholds amid other activities, do it simply as above, by twoway comm, not by the Prepcheck system.To get auditing into a state of perfection, to get clearing general, all we have to do is:1. Know our basics (Axioms, Scales, Codes, the fundamental theory about the thetanand the mind);2. Know our practical (TRs, Model Session, E-Meter, CCHs, Prepchecking andclearing routines).In actual fact this is not much to ask. For the return is smooth results and a far, far betterworld. An HPA/HCA can learn the data in l above and all but clearing routines in the material in2. An HPA/HCA should know these things to perfection. They are not hard to learn. Additivesand interpretations are hard to get around. Not the actual data and performance.Knowing these things, one also needs to know that all one has to do is clean the E-Meterof missed withholds to make any pc sit up and get audited smoothly, and all is as happy as asummer dream.We are making all our own trouble. Our trouble is lack of precise application ofScientology. We fail to apply it in our lives or sessions and try something bizarre and then wefail too. And with our TRs, Model Session and meters we are most of all failing to pick up andclean up MISSED WITHHOLDS.We don’t have to clean up all the withholds if we keep the Missed Withholds cleaned up.Give a new auditor the order to clean up “Missed Withholds” and he or she invariablywill start asking the pc for withholds. That’s a mistake. You ask the pc for Missed Withholds.Why stir up new ones to be missed when you haven’t cleaned up those already missed? Insteadof putting out the fire we pour on gunpowder. Why find more you can then miss when youhaven’t found those that have been missed.Don’t be so confounded reasonable about the pc’s complaints. Sure, they may all be trueBUT he’s complaining only because withholds have been missed. Only then does the pccomplain bitterly.Whatever else you learn, learn and understand this please. Your auditing future hangs onit. The fate of Scientology hangs on it. Ask for missed withholds when sessions go wrong.Get the missed withholds when life goes wrong.

Going later than basic on any chain without further search for basic.Example: Looking for the pc’s first automobile accident, finding the fifth insteadand trying to run the fifth accident as the first accident, which it isn’t. The By-Passed Charge here is the first accident and all succeeding accidents up to the oneselected by the auditor as the first one or the one to run. To a greater or lesserdegree depending on the amount the earlier material was restimulated, the pc willthen ARC Break (or feel low or in “low morale”). One can run a later incident on achain briefly but only to unburden earlier incidents, and the pc must know this.2. Unknowingly ignoring the possibility of a more basic or earlier incident of the samenature as that being run after the pc has been restimulated on it. Or bluntly refusingto admit the existence of or let the pc “at” an earlier incident.3. Cleanly missing a GPM, as one between two goals run consecutively in the beliefthey are consecutive.4. Missing an earlier GPM and settling down to the assertion there are no earlier ones.5. Cleanly missing one or more RIs, not even calling them.6. Failing to discharge an RI and going on past it.7. Accidentally missing a whole block of RIs, as in resuming session and not noticingpc has skipped (commoner than you’d think).8. Accepting a wrong goal, missing the right one similarly worded.9. Accepting a wrong RI, not getting the plot RI to fire.10. Misinterpreting or not understanding data given to you by the pc and/or acting onwrong data."},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"11. Misinforming the pc as to what has or has not fired and discharged.12. Locating the wrong By-Passed Charge and saying it is the source of the ARCBreak.13. Failing to follow the cycle of communication in auditing.These and any other way charge can be restimulated and left prior to where the auditor isworking can cause an ARC Break.Charge left after (later) (nearer pt) than where the auditor is working hardly ever causesan ARC Break.The burden of skilled auditing then, is to get RIs (and GPMs and incidents) discharged asclose to basic (first incident) as possible. And always be prowling for something earlier.In contradiction of this is that any GPM fairly well discharged by RRs unburdens thecase, ARC Break or no ARC Breaks. And any incident partially discharged lets one go earlier.The pc never knows why the ARC Break. He may think he does and disclaim about it.But the moment the actual reason is spotted (the real missed area) the ARC Break ceases.If you know you’ve missed a goal or RI, just saying so prevents any ARC Break.An ARC Breaky pc can always be told what has been missed and will almost alwayssettle down at once.Example: Pc refuses to come to session. Auditor on telephone says there’s a more basicincident or RI or GPM. Pc comes to session.The auditor who is most likely to develop ARC Breaks in the pc will have greaterdifficulty putting this HCO Bulletin into practice. Perhaps I can help this. Such an auditor Qsand As by action responses, not acknowledgments after understanding. Action can be on anautomaticity in the session. So this HCO Bulletin may erroneously be interpreted to mean, “Ifthe pc ARC Breaks DO something earlier.”If this were true then the only thing left to run would be Basic Basic—without the pcbeing unburdened enough to have any reality on it.A drill (and many drills can be compiled on this) would be to have a lineal picture of aTime Track. The coach indicates a late incident on it with a pointer and says, “Pc ARC Break.”The student must give a competent and informative statement that indicates the earlier chargewithout pointing (since you can’t point inside the reactive bank of a pc with a pointer).Drawn Time Tracks showing a GPM, a series of engrams along free track, a series ofGPMs, all plotted against time, would serve the purpose of the drill and give the studentgraphic ARC Break experience.The trick is TO FIND AND INDICATE the RIGHT By-Passed Charge to the pc and tohandle it when possible but never fail to indicate it.It is not DO that heals the ARC Break but pointing toward the correct charge.RULE: FINDING AND INDICATING AN INCORRECT BY-PASSED CHARGEWILL NOT TURN OFF AN ARC BREAK.An automaticity (as covered later in this HCO Bulletin) is rendered discharged byindicating the area of charge only."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"This is an elementary example: Pc says, “I suppressed that.” Auditor says, “On thisincident has anything been suppressed?” Pc ARC Breaks. Auditor indicates Charge by saying,“I’m sorry. A moment ago I didn’t acknowledge your suppression.” ARC Break ceases. Why?Because the source of its charge that triggered an automaticity of above the pc’s tone, was itselfdischarged by being indicated.Example: Auditor asks for a Joburg overt. Pc gives it. Auditor consults meter at onceasking question again, which is protested giving a new read. Pc ARC Breaks. Auditor says, “Idid not acknowledge the overt you gave me. I acknowledge it.” ARC Break ceases.Example: Auditor asks for RI No. 173 on First Series Line Plot. Pc ARC Breaks, givingvarious reasons why, such as auditor’s personality. Auditor asks meter, “Have I missed anItem on you?” Gets read. Says to pc, “I’ve missed an Item.” ARC Break ceases. Whether themissing item is looked for or not is immaterial to this HCO Bulletin which concerns handlingARC Breaks.If an auditor always does in response to an ARC Break, such as instantly looking forspecific earlier Items, that auditor has missed the point of this HCO Bulletin and will just pileup more ARC Breaks, not heal them.Don’t be driven by ARC Breaks into unwise actions, as all you have to do is find andindicate the missing charge that was By-Passed. That is what takes care of an ARC Break, nottaking the pc’s orders.If the ARC Break does not cease, the wrong By-Passed Charge has been indicated.The sweetest running pc in the world can be turned into a tiger by an auditor who alwaysQs and As, never indicates charge and goes on with the session plan.Some Qs and As would be a source of laughter if not so deadly.Here is a Q and A artist at work (and an ARC Breaky pc will soon develop) (and thisauditor will soon cease to audit because it’s “so unpleasant”).Example: Auditor: “Have you ever shot anyone?” Pc: “Yes, I shot a dog.” Auditor: “Whatabout a dog?” Pc: “It was my mother’s.” Auditor: “What about your mother?” Pc: “I hatedher.” Auditor: “What about hating people?” Pc: “I think I’m aberrated.” Auditor: “Have youworried about being aberrated?” Pc: @!!*?!!.Why did the pc ARC Break? Because the charge has never been permitted to come offshooting a dog, his mother, hating people, and being aberrated and that’s enough By-PassedCharge to blow a house apart.This pc will become, as this keeps up, unauditable by reason of charge missed insessions and his resulting session dramatizations as overts.Find and indicate the actual charge By-Passed. Sometimes you can’t miss it, it has justhappened. Sometimes you need a simple meter question since what you are doing is obvious.Sometimes you need a dress parade assessment from a list. But however you get it, find out theexact By-Passed Charge and then INDICATE IT TO THE PC.The violence of an ARC Break makes it seem incredible that a simple statement willvanquish it, but it will. You don’t have to run another earlier engram to cure an ARC Break.You merely have to say it is there—and if it is the By-Passed Charge, that ARC Break willvanish.Example: Pc: “I think there’s an incident earlier that turned off my emotion.” Auditor:“We’d better run this one again.” Pc ARC Breaks. Auditor: (Consults meter) “Is there an earlier"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"incident that turns off emotion? (Gets read) Say, what you just said is correct. Thank you.There is an earlier incident that turns off emotion. Thank you. Now let’s run this one a fewmore times.” Pc’s ARC Break ends at once.Don’t go around shivering in terror of ARC Breaks. That’s like the modern systems ofgovernment which tear up their whole constitution and honor just because some hireddemonstrators howl. Soon they won’t be a government at all. They bend to every ARC Break.ARC Breaks are inevitable. They will happen. The crime is not: to have a pc ARC Break.The crime is: not to be able to handle one fast when it happens. You must be able to handle anARC Break since they are inevitable. Which means you must know the mechanism of one asgiven here, how to find By-Passed Charge and how to smoothly indicate it.To leave a pc in an ARC Break more than two or three minutes, is just inept.And be well-drilled enough that your own responding rancor and surprise doesn’t takecharge. And you’ll have pleasant auditing.ARC BREAK PROCESSESWe had several ARC Break processes. These were repetitive processes.The most effective ARC Break process is locating and indicating the By-Passed Charge.That really cures ARC Breaks.A repetitive command ARC Break process based on this discovery I just made wouldpossibly be “What communication was not received?”Expanding this we get a new ARC Straight Wire:“What attitude was not received?”“What reality was not perceived (seen)?”“What communication was not acknowledged?”This process IS NOT USED to handle SESSION ARC BREAKS but only to clean upauditing or the track. If the pc ARC Breaks don’t use a process, find the missed charge.Indeed this process may be more valuable than at first believed, as one could put “Inauditing ......” on the front of each one and straighten up sessions. And perhaps you couldeven run an engram with it. (The last has not been tested. “In auditing” + the three questionswas wonderful on test. 2 div TA in each 10 mins on a very high TA case.)“ARC Break Straight Wire” of 1958 laid open implants like a band saw, which is whatattracted my attention to it again. Many routine prefixes such as “In an organization” or “Onengrams” or “On past lives” could be used to clear up past attitudes and overts.We need some repetitive processes today. Cases too queasy to face the past, casesmessed up by offbeat processes. Cases who have overts on Auditing or Scientology or orgs.Cases pinned by session overts. The BMRs run inside an engram tend to make it go mushy.And Class I Auditors are without an effective repetitive process on modern technology. This isit.A Repetitive Process, even though not looking for basic, implies that the process will berun until the charge is off and therefore creates no ARC Breaks unless left unflat. Therefore theprocess is safe if flattened."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"RUDIMENTSNothing is more detested by some pcs than rudiments on a session or GPM or RI. Why?The same rule about ARC Breaks applies.The Charge has been By-Passed. How?Consider the session is later than the incident (naturally). Ask for the suppress in thesession. You miss the suppress in the incident (earlier by far). Result: Pc ARC Breaks.That’s all there is to ARC Breaks caused by Session BMRs or Mid Ruds.Example: “Scrambleable Eggs” won’t RR. Auditor says, “On this Item has anything beensuppressed?” Pc eventually gets anxious or ARC Breaks. Why? Suppress read. Yes, but wherewas the suppress? It was in the Incident containing the RI, the pc looked for it in the sessionand thereby missed the suppress charge in the incident of the RI which, being By-PassedCharge unseen by pc and auditor, caused the ARC Break. Remedy? Get the suppress in theincident, not the session. The RI RRs.Also, the more ruds you use, the more you restimulate when doing Routine 3, becausethe suppress in the incident is not basic on Suppress, and if you clean just one clean, even totest, bang, there goes the charge being missed on Suppress and bang, bang, ARC Break.Lightly, auditor, lightly.Q AND A ARC BREAKSQ and A causes ARC Breaks by BY-PASSING CHARGE.How? The pc says something. The auditor does not understand or Acknowledge.Therefore the pc’s utterance becomes a By-Passed Charge generated by whatever he or she istrying to release. As the auditor ignores it and the pc re-asserts it, the original utterance’s chargeis built up and up.Finally the pc will start issuing orders in a frantic effort to get rid of the missed charge.This is the source of pc orders to the auditor.Understand and Acknowledge the pc. Take the pc’s data. Don’t pester the pc for moredata when the pc is offering data.When the pc goes to where the auditor commands, don’t say, “Are you there now?” ashis going is thereby not acknowledged and the going built up charge. Always assume the pcobeyed until it’s obvious the pc did not.ECHO METERINGThe pc says, “You missed a suppress. It’s ......” and the auditor reconsults the meterasking for a suppress. That leaves the pc’s offering an undischarged charge.NEVER ASK THE METER AFTER A PC VOLUNTEERS A BUTTON.Example: You’ve declared suppress clean, pc gives you another suppress. Take it anddon’t ask suppress again. That’s Echo Metering.If a pc puts his own ruds in, don’t at once jump to the meter to put his ruds in. Thatmakes all his offerings missed charge. Echo Metering is miserable auditing."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"MISSED WITHHOLDSNeedless to say, this matter of By-Passed Charge is the explanation for the violence ofmissed withholds.The auditor is capable of finding out. So the pc’s undisclosed overts react solely becausethe auditor doesn’t ask for them.This doesn’t wipe out all technology about missed withholds. It explains why they existand how they operate.Indication is almost as good as disclosure. Have you ever had somebody calm downwhen you said, “You’ve got missed withholds”? Well it’s crude but it has worked. Better is,“Some auditor failed to locate some charge on your case.” Or, “We must have missed yourgoal.” But only a meter assessment and a statement of what has been found would operateshort of actually pulling the missed withholds.APPARENT BAD MORALEThere is one other factor on “Bad Morale” that should be remarked.We know so much we often discard what we know in Scientology. But way back inBook One and several times after, notably 8-80, we had a tone scale up which the pc climbedas he was processed.We meet up with this again running the Helatrobus Implants as a whole track fact.The pc rises in tone up to the lower levels of the tone scale. He or she comes up todegradation, up to apathy.And it often feels horrible and, unlike an ARC Break and the Sad Effect, is not curedexcept by more of the same processing.People complain of their emotionlessness. Well, they come up a long ways before theyeven reach emotion.Then suddenly they realize that they have come up to being able to feel bad. They evencome up to feeling pain. And all that is a gain. They don’t confuse this too much with ARCBreaks but they blame processing. And then one day they realize that they can feel apathy! Andit’s a win amongst wins. Before it was just wood.And this has an important bearing on ARC Breaks.Everything on the whole Know to Mystery Scale that still lies above the pc finds the pc ateffect. These are all on Automatic.Therefore the pc in an ARC Break is in the grip of the reaction which was in the incident,now fully on automatic.The pc’s anger in the incident is not even seen or felt by the pc. But the momentsomething slips the pc is in the grip of that emotion as an automaticity and becomes furious orapathetic or whatever toward the auditor.None is more amazed at himself or herself than the pc in the grip of the ARC Breakemotion. The pc is a helpless rag, being shaken furiously by the emotions he or she felt in theincident."},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Therefore, never discipline or Q and A with an ARC Broken pc. Don’t join hands withhis bank to punish him. Just find the By-Passed Charge and the automaticity will shut off atonce to everyone’s relief.Running Routine 3 is only unpleasant and unhappy to the degree that the auditor fails toquickly spot and announce By-Passed Charge. If he fails to understand this and recognize this,his pcs will ARC Break as surely as a ball falls when dropped.If an auditor has ARC Breaky pcs only one thing is basically wrong—that auditorconsistently misses charge or consistently fails to anticipate missed charge.One doesn’t always have to run the earliest. But one had better not ignore theconsequences of not pointing it out. One doesn’t have to discharge every erg from an RIalways but one had better not hide the fact from the pc.The adroit auditor is one who can spot earlier charge or anticipate ARC Breaks by seeingwhere charge is getting missed and taking it up with the pc. That auditor’s pcs have only thediscomfort of the gradually rising tone and not the mess of ARC Breaks.It is possible to run almost wholly without ARC Breaks and possible to stop them in seconds,all by following the rule: DON’T BY-PASS CHARGE UNKNOWN TO THE PC.LRH :jw.rdL.

It is a very valuable unlimited process that undercutsRepetitive Processes and produces tone arm action on cases that have none on repetitiveprocesses.R2H, however, is a training must before an auditor is permitted to run engrams. It doesnot have to be run on a pc before engrams are run. Only when an auditor can produce resultswith R2H should he or she run engrams on any pc. For R2H combines the most difficult stepsof engram running, dating, assessing, locating and indicating by-passed charge. If an auditorcan date skillfully and quickly handle ARC Breaks (and handle the Time Track) he or she is asafe auditor on R3R. If not, that auditor will not produce results with R3R or make any OTs.In Academies and the SHSBC, R2H is placed after skill is attained in Model Session andrepetitive processes. In auditing programming R2H comes immediately after Reach andWithdraw and the CCHs.For sweetening a pc’s temper and life, R2H has had no equal for cases above but notincluding level 8.ARC stands for the Affinity—Reality—Communication triangle from which comes theTone Scale and is best covered by the booklet “Notes on Lectures”.By-passed charge is covered very fully in recent HCOBs on ARC Breaks.R2H BY STEPSThe auditing actions of Routine 2H are complex and must be done with great precision.The actions are done in Routine 3 Model Session. Mid Ruds and Missed Withholds maybe used.STEP ONE:Tell the pc, “Recall an ARC Break.”When pc has done so acknowledge that the pc has done so. Do not ask the pc what it is.If pc says what it is, simply acknowledge. It is no business of R2H to know what the ARCBreak consists of!STEP TWO:Date the ARC Break on the meter. If the pc volunteers the date do not verify it on themeter further. Accept it at once and write it down. The date is more important than the contentof the ARC Break.STEP THREE:"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Assess the ARC Break for by-passed charge, using the attached list.Find the greatest read.The assessment is seldom gone over more than once as a whole and those that read arethen read again until one remains.This is a rapid action on the meter. Look only for tiny ticks or falls or a small left to rightslash of the needle. Do not expect large reactions. The Mark V meter is indispensable.STEP FOUR:Indicate to the pc what charge was missed in that ARC Break he or she has recalled .The pc must be satisfied that that was the charge missed.The pc may try to recall what it was that was indicated. This is not a vital part of the drillbut THE PC MUST BE SATISFIED THAT THE LOCATED BY-PASSED CHARGE WASTHE SOURCE OF THE ARC BREAK.There is a danger here of a great deal of auditor ad-libbing and tanglefoot. If the pc is notsatisfied and happier about it, the wrong by-passed charge has been found and Step Three mustbe re-done.It is no part of this process to run an engram or secondary thus located.THE ASSESSMENT FORMThis is a sample form. It may be necessary to add to it. Some lines of it may eventually beomitted. However, this form does work. The auditor may add a few lines to it.In asking the questions preface the whole assessment with, “In the ARC Break yourecalled_____.” Do not preface each question so unless pc goes adrift.A dirty needle means pc has started to speculate. Ask, “Have you thought of anything?”and clean needle.Had an engram been missed? Had a withhold been missed’? Had some emotion beenrejected’? Had some affection been rejected? Had a reality been rejected? Had a communicationbeen ignored? Had a similar incident occurred before? Had a goal been disappointed? Hadsome help been rejected? Was an engram restimulated? Had an overt been committed? Had anovert been contemplated? Had an overt been prevented? Was there a secret?Routine 2H is a skilled operation. Practice gives the auditor a knack of doing it rapidly.An ARC Break should be disposed of about every fifteen minutes of auditingtime. Longer shows ineptitude.LRH:dr.cdenL.

Tech Dir: Check out onHCO Secs and Assn Org Secs.)The successful handling of an ARC Break Assessment is a skilled activity which requires:1. Skill in handling a Meter.2. Skill in handling the Itsa Line of the Auditing Cycle.3. Skill in Assessment.The lists given in HCO Bulletin of July 5, AD13 “ARC BREAK ASSESSMENTS”, areused, either from that HCO Bulletin or amended.There are several uses for ARC Break Assessments.1. Cleaning up a session ARC Break.2. Cleaning up auditing in general.3. Cleaning up a pc’s or student’s possible ARC Breaks.4. Cleaning up a member of the public’s possible or actual ARC Breaks.5. Regular use on a weekly basis on staff or organization members.There are others. Those above are the chief uses.For long time periods the standard 18 button prepcheck is faster, but an ARC BreakAssessment is still useful in conjunction with it.The drill is simple. If complicated by adding in R2H material, dating, and other additives,the ARC Break Assessment ceases to work well and may even create more ARC Breaks.If used every time a pc gets in a little trouble in R3N or R3R the ARC Break Assessmentis being used improperly. In R2H, R3N, R3R sessions it is used only when the pc showsdefinite signs of an ARC Break. To use it oftener constitutes no auditing.Unnecessary use of an ARC Break Assessment may ARC Break the pc with theAssessment.The ARC Break Assessment may be repaired by an 18 Button Prepcheck “On ARC BreakAssessments ......”.ARC BREAK ASSESSMENT BY STEPSSTEP ONE:Select the proper list. This is done by establishing what the pc has been audited on. Ifmore than one type of by-passed charge is suspected, do more than one list. If the ARC Breakis not completely cured by one list, do another kind of list. (All lists have been in HCOBs as“L”.)"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"STEP TWO:Inform the pc that you are about to assess for any charge that might have beenrestimulated or by-passed on his or her case. Do not heavily stress the ARC Break aspect.Right: “I am going to assess a list to see if any charge has been by-passed on your case.”Wrong: “I’m going to try to cure (or assess) your ARC Break.”STEP THREE:Without regard to pc’s natter, but with quick attention for any cognition the pc may haveduring assessment as to by-passed charge, assess the list.Phrase the question in regard to the reason for the Assessment—”In this session........”“During this week .......” “In Scientology ........” etc. Call each line once to see if it gives aninstant read.The moment a line gives a reaction, stop, and do Step Four.STEP FOUR:When a line reacts on the needle, say to the pc, “The line ........reacts. What can you tellme about this?”STEP FIVE:Keep Itsa Line in. Do not cut the pc’s line. Do not ask for more than pc has. Let pcflounder around until pc finds the charge asked for in Step Four or says there’s no such charge.(If a line reacted because the pc did not understand it, or by protest or decide, make it right withthe pc and continue assessing.)STEP SIX:In a session: If pc found the by-passed charge, ask pc “How do you feel now?” If pcsays he or she feels OK, cease assessing for ARC Breaks and go back to session actions. If pcsays there’s no such charge or gets misemotional at Auditor, keep on assessing on down thelist for another active line, or even on to another list until the charge is found which makes pcrelax.In a routine ARC Break check (not a session but for a longer period), don’t stopassessing but keep on going as in Step Five, unless pc’s cognition is huge.END OF STEPSPlease notice: This is not R2H. There is no dating. The auditor does not further assist thepc with the meter in any way.If the pc blows up in your face on being given a type of charge, keep going, as you havenot yet found the charge. Typical response to wrong charge found: Pc: “Well of course it’s acut communication! You’ve been cutting my communication the whole session. You ought tobe retreaded ..etc.” Note here that pc’s attention is still on auditor. Therefore thecorrect charge has not been found. If the by-passed charge has been found the pc will relax andlook for it, attention on own case.Several by-passed charges can exist and be found on one list. Therefore in cleaning up aweek or an intensive or a career (any long period) treat a list like rudiments, cleaning everythingthat reacts."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Blow down of the Tone Arm is the meter reaction of having found the correct by-passedcharge. Keep doing Steps One to Six until you get a blow down of the Tone Arm. The pcfeeling better and being happy about the ARC Break will coincide almost always with a ToneArm Blow Down.You can, however, undo a session ARC Break Assessment by continuing beyond thepc’s cognition of what it is. Continuing an assessment after the pc has cognited, invalidates thepc’s cognition and cuts the Itsa Line and may cause a new ARC Break.Rarely, but sometimes, the ARC Break is handled with no TA blow down.PURPOSE OF ASSESSMENTThe purpose of an ARC Break Assessment is to return the pc into session or intoScientology or into an Org or course. By-passed charge can cause the person to blow out ofsession, or out of an Org or a course or Scientology.WITH A SESSION (formerly “in”): Is defined as “INTERESTED IN OWN CASE ANDWILLING TO TALK TO THE AUDITOR”. AGAINST SESSION: Against session is definedas “ATTENTION OFF OWN CASE AND TALKING AT THE AUDITOR IN PROTEST OFAUDITOR, PT AUDITING, ENVIRONMENT OR SCIENTOLOGY”.WITH SCIENTOLOGY: With Scientology is defined as “INTERESTED IN SUBJECT ANDGETTING IT USED”. AGAINST SCIENTOLOGY: Against Scientology is defined as“ATTENTION OFF SCIENTOLOGY AND PROTESTING SCIENTOLOGY BEHAVIOUROR CONNECTIONS”.WITH ORGANIZATION: With organization can be defined as “INTERESTED IN ORG ORPOST AND WILLING TO COMMUNICATE WITH OR ABOUT ORG”. AGAINSTORGANIZATION: Against organizationness is defined as “AGAINST ORGANIZATION ORPOSTS AND PROTESTING AT ORG BEHAVIOUR OR EXISTENCE” .The data about ARC Breaks can be expanded to marriage, companies, jobs, etc. Indeed toall dynamics—With Dynamic, Against Dynamic.What it boils down to is this: There are only two conditions of living, but many shades ofgrey to each one.These conditions are:1. LIFE: NOT ARC BROKEN: Capable of some affinity for, some reality about andsome communication with the environment; and2. DEATH: ARC BROKEN: Incapable of affinity for, reality about andcommunication with the environment.Under One we have those who can disenturbulate themselves and make some progress inlife.Under Two we have those who are in such protest that they are stopped and can makelittle or no progress in life.One, we consider to be in some ARC with existence.Two, we consider to be broken in ARC with existence.In a session or handling the living lightning we handle, people can be hit by a forcefulcharge of which they are only minutely aware but which swamps them. Their affinity, reality"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"and communication (life force) is retarded or cut by this hidden charge and they react with whatwe call an ARC Break or have an ARC Broken aspect.If they know what charge it is they do not ARC Break or they cease to be ARC Broken.It is the unknown character of the charge that causes it to have such a violent effect on theperson.People do not ARC Break on known charge. It is always the hidden or the earlier chargethat causes the ARC Break.This makes life look different (and more understandable). People continuously explain soglibly why they are acting as badly as they are. Whereas, if they really knew, they would notact that way. When the true character of the charge (or many charges as in a full case) is knownto the person the ARC Break ceases.How much by-passed charge does it take to make a case? The whole sum of past by-passed charge.This fortunately for the pc is not all of it in constant restimulation. Therefore the personstays somewhat in one piece but prey to any restimulation.Auditing selectively restimulates, locates the charge and discharges it (as seen on theaction of a moving Tone Arm).However, accidental rekindlings of past charge unseen by pc or auditor occur and the pc“mysteriously” ARC Breaks.Similarly people in life get restimulated also, but with nobody to locate the charge. ThusScientologists are lucky.In heavily restimulated circumstances the person goes OUT OF. In such a conditionpeople want to stop things, cease to act, halt life, and failing this they try to run away.As soon as the actual by-passed charge is found and recognized as the charge by theperson, up goes Affinity and Reality and Communication and life can be lived.Therefore ARC Breaks are definite, their symptoms are known, their cure is very easywith this understanding and technology.An ARC Break Assessment seeks to locate the charge that served, being hidden, as awhip-hand force on the person. When it is located life returns. Locating the actual by-passedcharge is returning life to the person.Therefore, properly handling ARC Breaks can be called, with no exaggeration “ReturningLife to the person”.One further word of caution: As experience will quickly tell you, seeking to do anythingat all with an earlier by-passed charge incident which led to the ARC Break immediately theearlier incident is found will lead to a vast mess.Let the pc talk about it all the pc pleases. But don’t otherwise try to run it, date it or seekto find what by-passed charge caused the earlier incident. In assessing for ARC Breaks, keepthe Itsa Line in very well and keep the What’s It out in every respect except as contained in theabove Six Steps.SUMMARY"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"An ARC Break Assessment is simple stuff, so simple people are almost certain tocomplicate it. It only works when kept simple.Old auditors will see a similarity in an ARC Break Assessment List and old endrudiments. They can be handled much the same but only when one is covering a long timeperiod. Otherwise assess only to cognition and drop it.The trouble in ARC Break Assessments comes from additives by the auditor, failure tokeep on with additional lists if the type of charge causing the ARC Break isn’t found on thefirst list chosen, failure to read the meter, and failure to keep the Itsa Line in.Doing ARC Break Assessments to cure ARC Breaks is not the same drill as R2H andconfusing the two leads to trouble.Handled skillfully as above, ARC Break Assessing cures the great majority of woes ofauditing, registraring, training and handling organization. If you find you aren’t making ARCBreak Assessments work for you check yourself out on this HCO Bulletin carefully, reviewyour meter reading and examine your handling of the Itsa Line. If you want live people aroundyou, learn to handle ARC Break Assessments.Don’t worry about pcs getting ARC Breaks. Worry about being able to cure them withassessment until you have confidence you can. There’s nothing so uplifting as that confidence,except perhaps the ability to make any case get TA motion.Don’t ever be “reasonable” about an ARC Break and think the pc is perfectly right to behaving one “because ......”. If that ARC Break exists, the pc doesn’t know what’s causing itand neither do you until you and the pc find it! If you and the pc knew what was causing it,there would be no further ARC Break.LRH:dr.cden L. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1963by L.

Not to find something that will get futureTA. But just to get TA NOW.Many auditors are still measuring their successes by things found or accomplished in thesession. Though this is important too (mainly at Level IV), it is secondary to Tone Arm Action.l. Get good Tone Arm Action.2. Get things done in the session to increase Tone Arm Action.NEW DATA ON THE E-METERThe most elementary error in trying to get Tone Arm action is, of course, found under thefundamentals of auditing—reading an E-Meter.This point is so easily skipped over and seems so obvious that auditors routinely miss it.Until they understand this one point, an auditor will continue to get minimal TA and be contentwith 15 Divisions down per session—which in my book isn’t TA but a meter stuck most of thesession.There is something to know about meter reading and getting TA. Until this is knownnothing else can be known.TONE ARM ASSESSMENTThe Tone Arm provides assessment actions. Like the needle reacts on list items, so doesthe Tone Arm react on things that will give TA.You don’t usually needle assess in doing Levels I, II and III. You Tone Arm Assess.The Rule is: THAT WHICH MOVES THE TONE ARM DOWN WILL GIVE TONEARM ACTION.Conversely, another rule: THAT WHICH MOVES ONLY THE NEEDLE SELDOMGIVES GOOD TA.So for Levels I, II and III (and not LEVEL IV) you can actually paste a paper over theneedle dial, leaving only the bottom of the needle shaft visible so the TA can be set by it and doall assessments needed with the Tone Arm. If the TA moves on a subject then that subject willproduce TA if the pc is permitted to talk about it (Itsa it).Almost all auditors, when the Itsa Line first came out, tried only to find FUTURE TAACTION and never took any PRESENT TA ACTION. The result was continuous listing ofproblems and needle nulling in an endless search to find something that “would produce TAaction”. They looked frantically all around to find some subject that would produce TA action"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"and never looked at the Tone Arm of their meter or tried to find what was moving it NOW.This seems almost a foolish thing to stress—that what is producing TA will produce TA.But it is the first lesson to learn. And it takes a lot of learning.Auditors also went frantic trying to understand what an ITSA LINE was. They thought itwas a Comm Line. Or part of the CCHs or almost anything but what it is. It is too simple.There are two things of great importance in an auditing cycle. One is the Whatsit, theother is the Itsa. Confuse them and you get no TA.If the auditor puts in the Itsa and the preclear the Whatsit, the result is no TA. The auditorputs in the Whatsit and the pc the Itsa, always. It is so easy to reverse the role in auditing thatmost auditors do it at first. The preclear is very willing to talk about his difficulties, problemsand confusions. The auditor is so willing to Itsa (discover) what is troubling the preclear that anauditor, green in this, will then work, work, work to try to Itsa something “that will give the pcTA”, that he causes the pc to “Whatsit Whatsit Whatsit that’s wrong with me”. Listing is notreally good Itsa-ing; it’s Whatsit-ing as the pc is in the mood “Is it this? Is it that?” even when“solutions” are being listed for assessment. The result is poor TA.TA comes from the pc saying, “It IS” not “Is it?”Examples of Whatsit and Itsa: Auditor: “What’s here?” (Whatsit) Pc: “An auditor, apreclear, a meter.” (Itsa)Itsa really isn’t even a Comm Line. It’s what travels on a Comm Line from the pc to theauditor, if that which travels is saying with certainty “It IS”.I can sit down with a pc and meter, put in about three minutes “assessing” by Tone ArmAction and using only R1C get 35 Divisions of TA in 2% hours with no more work thanwriting down TA reads and my auditor’s report. Why? Because the pc is not being stoppedfrom Itsa-ing and because I don’t lead the pc into Whatsit-ing. And also because I don’t thinkauditing is complicated.Tone Arm Action has to have been prevented if it didn’t occur. Example: An auditor,noting a Whatsit moved the TA, every time, promptly changed the Whatsit to a differentWhatsit. Actually happened. Yet in being asked what he was doing in session said: “I ask thepc for a problem he has had and every time he comes up with one I ask for solutions to it.” Hedidn’t add that he frantically changed the Whatsit each time the TA started to move. Result—9Divisions of TA in 21/2 hours, pc laden with by-passed charge. If he had only done what hesaid he had he would have had TA.If it didn’t occur, Tone Arm Action has to have been prevented! It doesn’t just “notoccur”.In confirmation of auditors being too anxious to get in the Itsa Line themselves and not letthe pc is the fad of using the meter as a Ouija Board. The auditor asks it questions continuallyand never asks the pc. Up the spout go Divisions of TA. “Is this Item a terminal?” the auditorasks the meter. Why not ask the pc? If you ask the pc, you get an Itsa, “No, I think it’s anoppterm because .....” and the TA moves.Now to give you some idea of how crazy simple it is to get in an Itsa Line on the pc, trythis:Start the session and just sit back and look at the pc. Don’t say anything. Just sit therelooking at the pc. The pc will of course start talking. And if you just nod now and then andkeep your auditor’s report going unobtrusively so as not to cut the Itsa, you’ll have a talking pcand most of the time good TA. At the end of 21/2 hours, end the session. Add up the TA"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"you’ve gotten and you will usually find that it was far more than in previous sessions.TA action, if absent, had to be prevented! It doesn’t just fail to occur.But this is not just a stunt. It is a vital and valuable rule in getting TA.RULE: A SILENT AUDITOR INVITES ITSA.This is not all good, however. In doing R4 work or R3R or R4N the silent auditor letsthe pc Itsa all over the whole track and causes Over-Restimulation which locks up the TA. Butin lower levels of auditing, inviting an Itsa with silence is an ordinary action.In Scientology Levels I, II and III the auditor is usually silent much longer,proportionally, in the session, than he or she is talking—about 100 of silence to 1 of talking.As soon as you get into Level IV auditing however, on the pc’s actual GPMs, the auditor has tobe crisp and busy to get TA and a silent, idle auditor can mess up the pc and get very little TA.This is all under “controlling the pc’s attention”. Each level of auditing controls the pc’sattention a little more than the last and the leap from Level III to IV is huge.Level I hardly controls at all. The rule above about the silent auditor is employed to thefull.Level II takes the pc’s life and livingness goals (or session goals) for the pc to Itsa andlets the pc roll, the auditor intruding only to keep the pc giving solutions, attempts, dones,decisions about his life and livingness or session goals rather than difficulties, problems andnatter about them.Level III adds the rapid search (by TA assessment) for the service facsimile (maybe 20minutes out of 2l/2 hours) and then guides the preclear into it with R3SC processes. The rulehere is that if the thing found that moved the TA wouldn’t make others wrong but would makethe pc wrong, then it is an oppterm lock and one Prepchecks it. (The two top RIs of the pc’sPT GPM is the service facsimile. One is a terminal, the pc’s, and the other is an oppterm. Theyeach have thousands of lock RIs. Any pair of lock RIs counts as a service facsimile, givingTA.) A good slow Prepcheck but still a Prepcheck. Whether running Right-Wrong-Dominate-Survive, (R3SC) or Prepchecking (the only 2 processes used) one lets the pc really answerbefore acking. One question may get 50 answers! Which is One Whatsit from the auditor gets50 Itsas from the pc.Level IV auditing finds the auditor smoothly letting the pc Itsa RIs and lists but theauditor going at it like a small steam engine finding RIs, RIs, RIs, Goals, RIs, RIs, RIs. Forthe total TA in an R4 session only is proportional to the number of RIs found without goofs,wrong goals or other errors which rob TA action.So the higher the level the more control of the pc’s attention. But in the lower levels, asyou go back down, the processes used require less and less control, less auditor action to getTA. The Level is designed to give TA at that level of control. And if the auditor actions getbusier than called for in the lower levels the TA is cut down per session.OVER-RESTIMULATIONAs will be found in another HCO Bulletin and in the lectures of summer and autumn of1963, the thing that seizes a TA up is Over-Restimulation. THE RULE IS: THE LESSACTIVE THE TA THE MORE OVER-RESTIMULATION IS PRESENT. (THOUGHRESTIMULATION CAN ALSO BE ABSENT.)Therefore an auditor auditing a pc whose TA action is low (below 20 TA Divisions downfor a 2l/2 hour session) must be careful not to over-restimulate the pc (or to gently restimulate"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"the pc). This is true of all levels. At Level IV this becomes: don’t find that next goal, bleed theGPM you’re working of all possible charge. And at Level III this becomes: don’t find toomany new Service Facs before you’ve bled the TA out of what you already have. And at LevelII this becomes: don’t fool about with a new illness until the pc feels the Lumbosis you startedon is handled utterly. And at Level I this becomes: “Let the pc do the talking”.Over-Restimulation is the auditor’s most serious problem.Under-Restimulation is just an auditor not putting the pc’s attention on anything.The sources of Restimulation are:1. Life and Livingness Environment. This is the workaday world of the pc. The auditorhandles this with Itsa or “Since Big Mid Ruds’ and even by regulating or changing some of thepc’s life by just telling the pc to not do this or that during an intensive or even making the pcchange residence for a while if that’s a source. This is subdivided into Past and Present.2. The Session and its Environment. This is handled by Itsa-ing the subject of sessionenvironments and other ways. This is subdivided into Past and Present.3. The Subject Matter of Scientology. This is done by assessing (by TA motion) the oldScientology List One and then Itsa-ing or Prepchecking what’s found.4. The Auditor. This is handled by What would you be willing to tell me, Who would yoube willing to talk to. And other such things for the pc to Itsa. This is subdivided into Past andPresent.5. This Lifetime. This is handled by slow assessments and lots of Itsa on what’s foundwhenever it is found to be moving the TA during slow assessment. (You don’t null a list orclaw through ten hours of listing and nulling to find something to Itsa at Levels I to III. Yousee what moves the TA and bleed it of Itsa right now. )6. Pc’s Case. In Levels I to III this is only indirectly attacked as above.And in addition to the actions above, you can handle each one of these or what’s foundwith a slow Prepcheck.LIST FOR ASSESSMENTAssess for TA motion the following list:The surroundings in which you live.The surroundings you used to live in.Our surroundings here.Past surroundings for auditing or treatment.Things connected with Scientology (Scientology List One).Myself as your auditor.Past auditors or practitioners.Your personal history in this lifetime.Goals you have set for yourself."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"Your case.At Level II one gets the pc to simply set Life and Livingness goals and goals for thesession, or takes up these on old report forms and gets the decisions, actions, considerations,etc., on them as the Itsa, cleaning each one fairly well of TA. One usually takes the goal the pcseems most interested in (or has gone into apathy about) as it will be found to produce the mostTA.Whatever you assess by Tone Arm, once you have it, get the TA out of it before you dropit. And don’t cut the Itsa.MEASURE OF AUDITORSThe skill of an auditor is directly measured by the amount of TA he or she can get. Pcsare not more difficult one than another. Any pc can be made to produce TA. But some auditorscut TA more than others.Also, in passing, an auditor can’t falsify TA. It’s written all over the pc after a session.Lots of TA = Bright pc. Small TA = Dull pc.And Body Motion doesn’t count. Extreme Body Motion on some pcs can produce adivision of TA! Some pcs try to squirm their way to clear! A good way to cure a TA consciousbody-moving pc is to say, “I can’t record TA caused while you’re moving.”As you may suspect, the pc’s case doesn’t do a great deal until run on R4 processes. Butdestimulation of the case can produce some astonishing changes in beingness. Key-out is theprincipal function of Levels I to III. But charge off a case is charge off. Unless destimulated acase can’t get a rocket read or present the auditor with a valid goal. Levels I to III produce aBook One clear. Level R4 produces an O.T. But case conditioning (clearing) is necessarybefore R4 can be run. And an auditor who can’t handle Levels I to III surely won’t be able tohandle the one-man band processes at Level IV. So get good on Levels I to III before you evenstudy IV.THE FIRST THING TO LEARNBy slow assessment is meant letting the pc Itsa while assessing. This consists of rapidauditor action, very crisp, to get something that moves the TA and then immediate shift intoletting the pc Itsa during which be quiet! The slowness is overall action. It takes hours andhours to do an old preclear assessment form this way but the TA flies.The actual auditing in Level III looks like this—auditor going like mad over a list or formwith an eye cocked on the TA. The first movement of the TA (not caused by body motion) theauditor goes a tiny bit further if that and then sits back and just looks at the pc. The pc comesout of it, sees the auditor waiting and starts talking. The auditor unobtrusively records the TA,sometimes nods. TA action dies down in a couple minutes or an hour. As soon as the TA lookslike it hasn’t got much more action in it the auditor sits up, lets the pc finish what he or she wassaying and then gets busy busy again. But no action taken by the auditor cuts into the TAaction. In Levels I to III no assessment list is continued beyond seeing a TA move until that TAmotion is handled.In doing a Scientology List One assessment one goes down the list until the TA moves(not because of body motion). Then, because a TA is not very pinpointed, the auditor coversthe one or two above where he first saw TA and, watching the pc for interest and the TA,circles around that area until he is sure he has what made the TA move and then bleeds that forTA. by Itsa or Prepcheck.Yes, you say, but doesn’t the auditor do TRs on the pc? One question—one answer ratio?NO!"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Let the pc finish what the pc was saying. And let the pc be satisfied the pc has said itwithout a lot of chatter about it.TA NOT MOVING SIGNALS AUDITOR TO ACT.TA MOVING SIGNALS AUDITOR NOT TO ACT.Only the auditor can kill the TA motion. So when the TA starts to move, stop acting andstart listening. When the TA stops moving or seems about to, stop listening and start actingagain.Only act when the TA is relatively motionless. And then act just enough to start it again.Now if you can learn just this, as given here, to act when there’s no TA and not act whenthere is TA, you can make your own start on getting good TA on your preclear.With this you buy leisure to look over what’s happening. With half a hundred rules andyour own confusion to worry about also, you’ll never get a beginning. So, to begin to get TAon your pc, first learn the trick of silent invitation. Just start the session and sit thereexpectantly. You’ll get some TA.When you’ve mastered this (and what a fight it is not to act, act, act and talk ten times ashard as the pc) then move to the next step.Cover the primary sources of over-restimulation listed above by asking for solutions tothem.Learn to spot TA action when it occurs and note what the pc was saying just then. Co-ordinate these two facts—pc talking about something and TA moving. That’s AssessmentLevels I to III. Just that. You see the TA move and relate it to what the pc is saying just thatmoment. Now you know that if the pc talks about “Bugs” he gets TA action. Note that downon your report. BUT don’t otherwise call it to pc’s attention as pc is already getting TA onanother subject. This pc also gets TA on Bugs. Store up 5 or ten of these odd bits, withoutdoing anything to the pc but letting him talk about things.Now a few sessions later, the pc will have told all concerning the prime source of over-restimulation I hope you were covering with him or her by only getting the pc started when heor she ran down. But you will now have a list of several other things that get TA. THEHOTTEST TA PRODUCER ON THIS LIST WILL GET A PC’S GOAL AS IT IS HISSERVICE FAC. You can now get TA on this pc at will. All you have to do is get an Itsa goingon one of these things.ANY TA is the sole target of Levels I to III. It doesn’t matter a continental what generatesit. Only Level IV (R4 processes) are vital on what you get TA on (for if you’re not accurate youwill get no TA at Level IV).From Levels I to III the pc’s happiness or recovery depends only on that waving TAArm. How much does it wave? That’s how much the case advances. Only at Level IV do youcare what it waves on.You’re as good an auditor in Levels I to III as you can get TA on the pc and that’s all.And in Level IV you’ll get only as much TA as you’re dead on with the right goals and RIs inthe right places and those you don’t want lying there inert and undisturbed.Your enemy is Over-Restimulation of the pc. As soon as the pc goes into more chargethan he or she can Itsa easily the TA slows down! And as soon as the pc drowns in the over-restimulation the TA stops clank! Now your problem is correcting the case. And that’s harderthan just getting TA in the first place."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Yes, you say, but how do you start “getting in an Itsa Line?” “What is an Itsa?”All right—small child comes in room. You say, “What’s troubling you?” The child says,“I’m worried about Mummy and I can’t get Daddy to talk to me and ....” NO TA.This child is not saying anything is it. This child is saying, “Confusion, chaos, worry.”No TA. The child is speaking in Oppterms.Small child comes in room. You say, “What’s in this room?” Child says, “You and couchand rug ....” That’s Itsa. That’s TA.Only in R4 where you’re dead on the pc’s GPMs and the pc is allowed to say it is or isn’tcan you get TA good action out of listing and nulling. And even then a failure to let the pc say itis it can cut the TA down enormously.Auditor says, “You’ve been getting TA movement whenever you mention houses.In this lifetime what solutions have you had about houses?” And there’s the next twosessions all laid out with plenty of TA and nothing to do but record it and nod now and then.THE THEORY OF TONE ARM ACTIONTA motion is caused by the energy contained in confusions blowing off the case. Theconfusion is held in place by aberrated stable data.The aberrated (non-factual) stable datum is there to hold back a confusion but in actualfact the confusion gathered there only because of an aberrated consideration or postulate in thefirst place. So when you get the pc to as-is these aberrated stable data, the confusion blows offand you get TA.So long as the aberrated stable datum is in place the confusion (and its energy) won’tflow.Ask for confusions (worries, problems, difficulties) and you just over-restimulate the pcbecause his attention is on the mass of energy, not the aberrated stable datum holding it inplace. Ask for the aberrated stable datum (considerations, postulates, even attempts or actions orany button) and the pc as-ises it, the confusion starts flowing off as energy (not as confusion),and you get TA.Just restimulate old confusions without touching the actual stable data holding them backand the pc gets the mass but no release of it and so no TA.The pc has to say, “It’s a “ (some consideration or postulate) to release the pent-up energyheld back by it.Thus an auditor’s worst fault that prevents TA is permitting the dwelling on confusionswithout getting the pc to give up with certainty the considerations and postulates that hold theconfusions in place.And that’s “Itsa”. It’s letting the pc say what’s there that was put there to hold back aconfusion or problem.If the pc is unwilling to talk to the auditor, that’s What to Itsa—”decisions you’ve madeabout auditors” for one example. If the pc can’t seem to be audited in that environment, get oldenvironments Itsa’ed. If the pc has lots of PTPs at session start, get the pc’s solutions to"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"similar problems in the past.Or just Prepcheck, slow, the zone of upset or interest of the pc.And you’ll get TA. Lots of it.Unless you stop it.There’s no reason at all why a truly expert auditor can’t get plenty of TA Divisions Downper 2 1/2 hour session running any old thing that crops up on a pc.But a truly expert auditor isn’t trying to Itsa the pc. He’s trying to get the pc to Itsa. Andthat’s the difference.Honest, it’s simpler than you think.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH :gw.cdenCopyright © 1963by L.

There will be no rise on apersonality test graph. There will be little if any TA action. There will be no gain in the session.The pc will not make his session goals. Etc. Etc. So you don’t audit pcs who have PTPs onanything but the PTPs the pc has.And you don’t audit PTPs slowly and forever. There are numerous ways of handling PTPs.One of them is “What communication have you left incomplete about that problem?” A fewanswers and poof! no PTP. Another is “What doesn’t (that person or thing pc is having PTP with)know about you?” Other versions of overts and withholds can be used. These are all fast PTPhandling methods and they get rid of the PTP and you can audit what you started to audit.The mark of a ruddy amateur in auditing is somebody who can always do successful assistsbut can’t do a real session. The secret is: in an assist you are handling the PTP, aren’t you? Soyou never audit over the top of (in the presence of) a PTP!Another circumstance is “can’t get down to real auditing because the pc always has somany PTPs”. This is only a confession that one can’t handle a PTP and then get on with thesession. One fumbles with the PTPs so badly as an auditor one never really handles the pc’s PTPsso of course one never gets on with the job at hand—auditing the pc.The pro, in a real session, just handles the PTPs quickly, gets the pc into session and gets onwith whatever should be run.OVERTSOverts are the other principal source of getting no gain.Here we really can tell the goony birds from the eagles professionally.No pro would think of auditing a pc on other processes in the presence of overts.1. The Pro would recognize by the pc’s natter, or lack of previous gain, that the pc hadoverts;2. The Pro would know that if he tried to do something else besides pull these overts, thepc would eventually get critical of the auditor; and3. The Pro wouldn’t (a) fail to pull the real overts or (b) ARC Break the pc in getting theoverts off.If one gets “reasonable” about the pc’s condition and starts agreeing with the motivators"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"(“look at all the bad things they did to me”), thus ignoring the overts, that’s the end of gains forthat pc with that auditor.If one is clumsy in recognizing overts, if one fails to get the pc to give them up, if one failsto properly acknowledge the overt when given, or if one demands overts that aren’t there, overtpulling becomes a howling mess.Because, then, getting the pc overts off is a tricky business auditors sometimes become shyof doing it. And fail as auditors.Sometimes pcs who have big overts become highly critical of the auditor and get in a lot ofsnide comments about the auditor. If the overt causing it is not pulled the pc will get no gains andmay even get ARC broken. If the auditor doesn’t realize that such natter always indicates a realovert, when pcs do it, eventually over the years it makes an auditor shy of auditing.Auditors buy “critical thoughts” the pc “has had” as real overts, whereas a critical thoughtis a symptom of an overt, not the overt itself. Under these critical thoughts a real overt liesundetected.Also, I love these pcs who “have to get off a withhold about you. Last night Jim said youwere awful ........” An experienced auditor closes the right eye slightly, cocks his head a bit to theleft and says, “What have you been doing to me I haven’t known about?” “I thought .....”begins the pc. “The question is”, says the old pro, “What have you been doing to me that Idon’t know about. The word is doing. “ And off comes the overt like “I’ve been getting auditedby Bessy Squirrel between sessions in the Coffee Shop.”Well, some auditors are so “reasonable” they never really learn the mechanism and go ongetting criticized and getting no gains on pcs and all that. I once heard an auditor say “Of coursehe was critical of me. What he said was true. I’d been doing a terrible job.” The moral of thisstory is contained in the fact that this auditor’s pc died. A rare thing but a true one. The pc hadterrible overts on Scientology and the auditor, yet this auditor was so “reasonable” those overtswere never cleaned up. And that was the end of those auditing sessions.It’s almost never that drastic, but if an auditor won’t pull overts, well auditing gets prettyunpleasant and pretty pointless too.A lack of grasp of the overt-motivator sequence (when somebody has committed an overt,he or she has to claim the existence of motivators—the Ded-Dedex version of Dianetics—orsimply when one has a motivator he is liable to hang himself by committing an overt) puts anauditor at a very bad disadvantage. Howling pcs and no pc wins.ARC BREAKSYou can’t audit an ARC Break. In fact you must never audit in the presence of one.Auditing below Level III, the best thing to do is find an auditor who can do ARC BreakAssessments.At Level III and above, do an ARC Break Assessment on the pc. An ARC Break Assessmentconsists of reading an ARC Break list appropriate to the activity to the pc on a meter and doingnothing but locate and then indicate the charges found by telling the pc what registered on theneedle.That isn’t auditing because it doesn’t use the auditing comm cycle. You don’t ack what thepc says, you don’t ask the pc what it is. You don’t comm. You assess the list between you and themeter, same as no pc there. Then you find what reads and-you tell the pc. And that’s all.A by-passed charge assessment is auditing because you clean every tick of the needle on thelist being assessed. The pc is acked, the pc is permitted to Itsa and give his opinions. But younever do a by-passed charge assessment on an ARC Broken pc. You do an ARC BreakAssessment as per the paragraph above this one.These two different activities unfortunately have the word “assessment” in common andthey use the same list. Therefore some students confuse them. To do so is sudden death."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"You can really clobber a pc by doing a by-passed charge assessment on an ARC Broken pc.And also you can ARC Break a pc by doing an ARC Break Assessment on a pc who isn’t (or hasceased to be) ARC Broken.So unless you have these two separate and different actions—the ARC Break Assessmentand the by-passed charge assessment—clearly understood and can do both of them well andnever get too rattled to know which one to use, you can get into plenty of trouble as an auditor.Only auditing over the top of an ARC Break can reduce a graph, hang the pc up in sessionsor worsen his case. So it’s the next to the most serious blunder that an auditor can make. (Themost serious error is to deny assistance either by not trying to get the pc into session or not usingScientology at all.)Auditing an ARC Broken pc and never realizing it can lead to very serious trouble for theauditor and will worsen the pc’s case—the only thing that will.SUMMARYIt is elementary auditing knowledge that no gains occur in the presence of PTPs or overtsand that cases worsen when audited over the top of an ARC Break.There aren’t “lots more conditions that can exist”. Given an auditing session there are onlythese three barriers to auditing.When you do Clay Table auditing or any other kind of auditing the rules all still apply. Achange of process or routine doesn’t change the rules.In doing Clay Table auditing off a meter one still handles the elements of a session. Oneputs the pc on the meter to start off and checks for PTPs, overts, withholds, even ARC Breaks,handles them quickly and then goes into the body of the session. Much the same as the oldestmodel session rudiments. One doesn’t use Mid Ruds or buttons to get started. One just knows thethings that mustn’t be there (PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks) and checks for them, handles if foundand goes on with the main session activity. If a PTP or an overt or an ARC Break shows up onehandles them, putting the pc back on the meter if necessary. When they are handled, the pc is putback into the main activity of the session.It’s true of any auditing that gets done. It isn’t likely to alter and actually no new data islikely to be found that controverts any of this. The phenomena will still be the same phenomenaas long as there are pcs. Ways of handling may change but not these basic principles.They’re with the auditor in every session ever to be run. So one might as well stay alert tothem and be continuously expert in handling them.They are the only big reefs on which an auditing session can go up high and dry, so theirexistence, causes and cures are of the greatest possible importance to the skilled auditor.L.

Therefore the Anatomy of an ARC Break is more vital to know,as it can worsen, than the anatomy of a PTP. But both are very important and with the overt actand misunderstood words in study form the vital four things anyone should know in auditingPcs.The average student has a hard time getting rid of ARC Breaks in others, mostly becausehe never really finds the ARC Break. One Auditor was sure a Pc had been ARC Broken by “thelast few inches of a lecture tape” and was madly calling Washington to borrow the tape so thepoor Pc could “listen to it again to cure his ARC Break” ! Well I don’t mind being cause, butmy tape never ARC Broke the Pc. The Auditor just didn’t locate the Charge.The whole trick is to keep cleaning up the ARC Break until the Pc is happy again and thenquit. When you find it, that’s it. You don’t find it and still have an ARC Broken Pc! No, theterribly simple truth is that1. The Pc is ARC Broken because something happened.2. The Pc will continue to be ARC Broken until the thing is found.3. The ARC Break will vanish magically when the source is found.Finding the ARC Break and indicating it clears the ARC Break. If it doesn’t clear on whatyou find, then you haven’t found it !You must not continue to run a Pc on some process when the Pc is ARC Broken. Youmust find the ARC Break and clear it.The Pc will go into a sad effect if you don’t find the ARC Break but instead, continue theprocess. If you think you have found the ARC Break (and haven’t) and then go on auditing,the Pc will go into a sad effect.ARC Broken Pcs are easy to identify. They gloom and mis-emote. They criticise andsnarl. Sometimes they scream. They blow, they refuse auditing.If you can read a lighted neon sign at 10 feet on a dark night, you can detect a Pc who hasan ARC Break. Some Auditors can detect them sooner than others. I can see one coming in aPc 11/2 hours of auditing before the Pc starts to get misemotional in earnest. Some newcomerin the business might not detect one until the Pc wraps a chair around the auditor’s head. As Isay, the ability to perceive one varies. The better you are the sooner you see one. If an auditor’sPc isn’t bright and happy, there’s an ARC Break there with life or the bank or the session.The thing to do is find it and clean it up.And now all is revealed: This is what makes an ARC Break occur:"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"AN ARC BREAK OCCURS ON A GENERALITY OR A NOT THERE.The GeneralityExample of a Generality“They say you are cold-hearted.” “Everybody thinks you are too young.” “The PeopleVersus Sam Jones.” “The will of the masses.”Case ManifestationExample: Little boy screaming in rage when he makes a mistake in drawing. Auditorobserves little boy is upset. Auditor: “What are you upset about?” Little Boy: (howling) “Mydrawing is no good!” Auditor: “Who said your drawing is no good?” Little Boy: (crying) “Theteachers at school (plural).” Auditor: “What teacher (singular)?” Little Boy: (sobbing) “Not theteachers, the other children (plural)!” Auditor: “Which one of the other children?” Little Boy:(suddenly quiet) “Sammy.” Auditor: “How do you feel now?” Little Boy: (cheerfully) “Can Ihave some ice cream?”The Formula1. Ask what the Pc is upset about.2. Ask who thought so.3. Repeat the generality the Pc used and4. Ask for the singular.5. Keep 3 and 4 going until the Pc is happy.As it’s a near Q and A it should be awfully easy. They name prunes, you say what pruneis prunes.ResultIt’s quite magical done barehanded or on a meter.ErrorsYou can miss in English sometimes on YOU. The Pc says YOU are mean. We have noplural or singular signal in the word YOU. Therefore a statement that “YOU are ARC Breakingme” or “YOU ARE MEAN” may not mean, as an egocentric auditor may take it, the auditor butYOU may be being used as THE WHOLE WORLD. The above formula holds 1 to 5. Just findout “Which person is meant by the word you?”Our old “Look at me, who am I?” was not too wrong.So next time your Pc says, “The Instructors are mean,” don’t be goofy enough to indicatethe charge with “OK, you are ARC Broken because the Instructors are mean.” And then beamazed when the ARC Break continues. You didn’t find out “What Instructor is Instructors?”If you ask a bit further you’ll find it probably wasn’t “the Instructors” but somebody else. Andthat somebody will be a unit, not a group.A less workable but interesting approach is “Who uses the word ‘everybody’"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"frequently?” It’s of interest only because “everybody” makes a dispersal which the Pc can’t seethrough. It will take quite a while sometimes for a Pc to spot such a person!How many people have died heartbroken because “they” were mean to him. And it wasjust one vicious being who had been blown up to “they”.The Not There is also a generality because it can be anywhere. But it is a special case.When something becomes unlocatable it can cause an ARC Break.The cure for this one is to find out what’s gone.If you see somebody with a cold, ask “Who’s gone?” and you’ll be amazed at therecovery if you pursue the matter.One concludes it’s less the loss than not knowing where something has gotten to, makinga one into a generality.The common response to sudden loss is to feel everything is gone or going.This is the state of anxiety explained.The beaten and downtrodden respond well on this (when brought up through normallevels to the Level of Remedies).A very sneaky question is “Who (or what) was everything to you?”But use it sparingly. The Pc will go whole track like a flash if overworked.Remarkably (at this late date to find it!) that’s why he rather fancies his pictures! At leasthe has a picture of it!Dreams follow a sudden loss. It’s an effort to orient oneself and get something back.Level VI ARC BreaksOf course, there’s nothing wrong really with a thetan but his reactive bank. He canrecover from the rest. And his reactive bank is full of generalities which explains the hard ARCBreaks of Level VI. But don’t tamper with Level VI if the Pc belongs at II. You can get enoughlocks off any day from normal life to cure the ARC Breaks you’ll encounter getting up to VI.Main thing to know is: AN ARC BREAK OCCURS BECAUSE OF A GENERALITYOR A NOT THERE.Fortunately it doesn’t always occur. Only sometimes. And when it does: Find thesingular form of the generality.In Admin particularly you save more executives that way. And in auditing you just don’thave failed cases or blows if you know it.  LRH:wmc.aj.cden L. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1965by L. Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICESaint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, SussexHCO BULLETIN OF 4 APRIL AD15RemimeoFranchiseARC BREAKS AND MISSED WITHHOLDSThe primary error one can make in ARC Break handling is to handle the pc with ARCBreak procedure when the pc really has a missed withhold.As some auditors dislike pulling withholds (because they run into pcs who use it to carvethe auditor up such as “I have a withhold that everybody thinks you are awful ——”) it iseasier to confront the idea that a pc has an ARC Break than the idea that the pc has a withhold.In case of doubt one meter checks on a withhold to see if it is non-existent (“Am Idemanding a withhold you haven’t got?”). If this is the case the TA will blow down. If it isn’tthe case the needle and TA remain unchanged. If the pc’s nattery or ARC Breaky conditioncontinues despite finding by-passed charge, then of course it is obviously a withhold.ARC Break finding does work. When the pc doesn’t change despite skillful ARC Breakhandling, locating and indicating, it was a withhold in the first place.The hardest pc to handle is the missed withhold pc. They ARC Break but you can’t getthe pc out of it. The answer is, the pc had a withhold all the time that is at the bottom of allthese ARC Breaks.Scientology auditing does not leave the pc in poor condition unless one goofs on ARCBreaks.ARC Breaks occur most frequently on people with missed withholds. \\-Therefore if a pc can’t be patched up easily or won’t stay patched up on ARC Breaks,there must be basic withholds on the case. One then works hard on withholds with any and allthe tools that we’ve got.ARC Breaks don’t cause blows. Missed withholds do. When you won’t hear what the pcis saying, then you have made him have a withhold and it responds as a missed withhold.In short, the bottom of ARC Breaks is a missed withhold.But an anti-social act done and then withheld sets the pc up to become “an ARC Breakypc”. It isn’t an accurate remark really since one has a pc with withholds who on being auditedARC Breaks easily. So the accurate statement is “the pc is a withholdy type pc that ARCBreaks a lot”. Now that type exists. And they sure have lots of subsequent ARC Breaks andare regularly being patched up.If you have a pc, then, who seems to have a lot of ARC Breaks, the pc is a “withholdypc” not an “ARC Breaky pc”. Any auditor miss causes a pc blow-up. The auditor by callingthis pc an “ARC Breaky pc” is not using a description which leads to a resolution of the case asthousands of ARC Break assessments leave the case still liable to ARC Break. If you call sucha case that ARC Breaks a lot a “withholdy pc that ARC Breaks a lot” then you can solve thecase. For all you have to do is work on withholds.The actual way to handle a “withholdy pc that ARC Breaks a lot” after you’ve cooled offthe last of his many ARC Breaks is:"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"1. Get the pc to look at what’s going on with his sessions.2. Get the pc in comm.3. Get the pc to look at what’s really bugging him.4. Get the pc’s willingness to give withholds up on a gradient.5. Bring the pc to an understanding of what he’s doing.6. Get the pc’s purpose in being audited in plain view to him or her.Those are of course the names of the first six grades. However, low down, these sixthings are all crushed together and you could really pursue that cycle in one session just to getthe pc up a bit without even touching the next grade up.Whenever I see a sour-faced person who has been “trained” or is being “trained” I knowone thing—there goes a pc with lots of withholds. I also know, there is a pc who ARC Breaksa lot in session. And I also know his co-auditor is weak and flabby as an auditor. And I alsoknow his auditing supervisor doesn’t shove the student auditor into doing the processcorrectly.One sour-faced student, one glance and I know all the above things, bang!So why can’t somebody else notice it?Auditing is a pleasure. But not when an auditor can’t tell a withhold from an ARC Breakand doesn’t know that continual ARC Breaks are caused by missed withholds on the bottom ofthe chain.I never miss on this. Why should you?The only case that will really “bug you” is the CONTINUOUS OVERT case. Here’s onethat commits anti-social acts daily during auditing. He’s a nut. He’ll never get better, casealways hangs up.Unless you treat his continual overts as a solution to a PTP. And find what PTP he’strying to solve with these crazy overt acts.You see, we can even solve that case.BUT, don’t go believing Scientology doesn’t work when it meets an unchanging orcontinually misemotional pc. Both of these people are foul balls who are loaded withwithholds.We’ve cracked them for years and years now.But not by playing patty-cake or “slap my wrist”.Takes an auditor, not a lady finger.“Mister, you’ve been wasting my time for three sessions. You have withholds. Give!”“Mister, you refuse just once more to answer my question and you’re for it. I’ve checked thismeter. It’s not a withhold of nothing. You have withholds. Give!” “Mister, that’s it. I amasking the D of P to ask the Tech Sec for a Comm Ev on you from HCO for no report.”If skill couldn’t do it, demand may. If demand couldn’t do it, a Comm Ev sure will.For it’s a no report!"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"How can you make a man well when he’s got a sewer full of slimy acts.Show me any person who is critical of us and I’ll show you crimes and intended crimesthat would stand a magistrate’s hair on end.Why not try it?

Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"R2-50: CHANGING MINDSExerpted from the Book: Creation of Human AbilityThe basic process of a thetan is simply getting him to change his mind. Most thetans fallbelow the level of mechanics. They have to be brought up to a point where they are not beinghandled by mechanics before they can simply change their considerations. If changing mindsworked on any thetan it would then be the only process in Scientology, but it does not work onthetans who are interiorized since they are being other things than themselves, and when theystart to change their minds they are simply changing something else.When you have a thetan exteriorized, all you have to do is ask him to change his mind,and, unless he is still very badly burdened by mechanical considerations with which he has sothoroughly agreed that he cannot immediately change his mind, he will do so.This process can be used on a non-exteriorized thetan, however, and on those who areuneasily exteriorized, by having them stand in one place with an idea that they have to appearthere, and then change their minds, and disappear there. Or simply have them stand in oneplace until they change their mind, and then go to another place and change their mind, and goto another place and change their mind. This is done, actually, by moving the body around, asmost auditing these days is done.The auditing commands for this would be ‘Walk over to this spot’ (indicating a spot tothe preclear), ‘Now decide you have to appear there’, ‘Now change your mind and decide youhave to disappear there’, ‘Now change your mind and decide you have to appear there’, and soon.This can also be worked into opening procedures by having a preclear select a spot,then change his mind about the spot, select another spot, change his mind about that spot andselect another spot, until he knows that he, himself, is changing his mind.When exteriorized, the thetan can change his mind very easily on any subject simplywhen told to do so. Very often he does not realize that he can change the factors of his lifearound simply by changing his mind, and so has to be asked to do so by the auditor.A note of warning: this does not work on interiorized preclears with any great value."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"R2-63: ACCEPT - REJECTExerpted from the Book: Creation of Human AbilityFrom acceptance we get a ten-star process. Whatever else you may do with a Preclear,he must be brought to accept the physical universe and his own and other bodies, all in everykind of condition. The way out is the way through. In Eastern practices, the goal wasabandonment, desertion. Scientology’s main difference from Eastern practices is this: itaccepts to free. And it frees. That which one cannot accept chains one. For instance, revulsionto sex inclines at last to slavery to sex. A ruler’s motto could be ‘make them resist’, and hispeople would become enslaved.In 1870 we find capitalists resisting Marx. In 1933 we find Marx the basic text of U.S.government. Resistance and restraint are the barbed-wire of this concentration camp. Accept thebarbed-wire and there is no camp.On test this process exteriorizes the worst case if run long enough.This process is important because it is one of the few (like R2-16) which does not havealter-isness as its operative factor. This is not, then, an altering practice, confirming somaticsand aberrations, it is a freeing process.That which one cannot accept he cannot as-is.The commands of this process are as follows: ‘Find something about yourself whichyou can accept’, ‘Something else’, ‘Find something else you can accept’, etc., etc., until thereis no comm-lag. Then: ‘Find something about yourself you can reject’, ‘Find something elseabout yourself you can reject’, etc., etc., until there is no comm-lag.

Then: ‘Find something in this universe you can reject’.Remember, this is not an altering process. It is a high value escape process.

What’s the year?Audience: 1962. A.D. 12.A.D. 12. All right, thank you.What I’m going to talk to you about is technically just listing. Listing: How to list.In the beginning, there was the Model Session.Now, what do you do in listing that is different than any other auditing?Well, you prepcheck the object of and the lines of the auditing command every sessionbeginning with a fast check. Got it? And I think if you do that, your number of items that youneed to list out a goal will materially diminish. I think you’ll find it saves its time over and overand over and over.So let’s put in the rudiments—the beginning rudiments—bangetybangety-bang, and say thePC’s goal, and to-be-a-tiger it. In other words, get the middle ruds in on it fast. Get it to firingif we can. Of course, we go just so far, this thing is going to start firing latent, and it’s going toexpire one way or the other. But after all, it is our target. And to run somebody endlessly withhis goal suppressed and invalidated and all that sort of thing is liable to require a large numberof additional items and all kinds of other things in the session, don’t you see? Other thingsmight go wrong. You might even waste a whole session and not even recognize that you havewasted one.All right. Now, the auditing command, of course, is the who-what lines, of which there arefour.Now, I’m not going to try to give you a wording of the who-what lines and say that it willforever and always be true.First you have finding the goal, in 3GA, and proving it out, and then you get to listing. And inactual fact, the first step of listing is to find lines that fit the goal.Now, you’ve got a picture that you must comply with. And the picture is an outflow arrow andan inflow arrow—arrows pointing at one another. Draw a circle for the PC and then draw a linegoing out from him and then the arrow-ends, and then draw another line extending that one,but its arrow-ends are in toward the first arrow.And then you have the retarding arrow of the first line, and then you have the retarding arrowof the second line, and they’re just arrows alongside the other two arrows—going the oppositedirection. In other words, you got four arrows here: One is going out from the PC and one isgoing in toward the PC.And then you’ve got the other pair of arrows further out; the first one is in toward the PC andthe other one is out away from the PC.Now, the auditing command that you want simply matches up the four basic flows. Now, yousee, there could be 16 flows listed, there could be 32 flows listed, there could be 128 flows"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"listed. Don’t you see? You could list and list—oh, wow! But staying with four is the mosteconomical, as far as we know at this particular time. But those four must be meaningful to thePC; they’ve got to make sense to the PC.Now, we want to know—the first line is. “Who or what would have it?” “Want it,” “have it”—I don’t care which one you use. That’s as far as the goal is concerned. Then “Who or whatwould oppose it?” See, that’s your outer arrow pointing in toward the first arrow. “Who orwhat would oppose it?”Now we’ve got to have specifically “Who or what would keep you from performing it?” or“doing it?” You see? And then we’ve got to find out “Who or what would oppose its beingopposed?”Now, how you get these words to go together is remarkable, and so forth, but they must fire.Now, the goal has a rocket read, and then so must the lines. You’ve got to have a read on thoselines. And the read on these lines must exist not because you’ve made a mistake on the line.You recognize that you could write the wrong line, and so forth.Do you know, to date we have had three people, one of whose clearing was held up and twothat was loused up, right here at Saint Hill, because nobody paid enough attention to thewording and value of the wording of lines? So this is not a light subject. This is a veryimportant subject. And it is the auditor’s responsibility, not the Training Director or somebodyelse’s responsibility. This is the auditor’s responsibility. Those lines are there and they’ve gotto fire.In other words, when you read this line, “Who or what would want to catch catfish?” that thinghas got to fire on that, not because the goal is on the end, but the line as a major thought has gotto fire. That’s got to fire.Now, remember that the whole rash of free needles that we got out earlier this summer were alllisted on this simplicity. (I’ll show you how simple it can be.) Line one: “Who or what wouldwant to catch catfish?” (Let’s say this is the goal.) Line two: “Who or what would opposecatching catfish?” Line three: “Who or what would not oppose catching catfish?” Line four:“Who or what would not want to catch catfish?”Now, those are the exact lines—the verb form changing on two of the lines to an -ing. Andlook, even though they were reaching madly and having an awful time on line four, andscrambling around on it most horribly, they still made it, see? Now, it was only when, on one(and I’m not saying this just to be mean, although the person who is going to hear it in amoment will swear that I said it just to be mean)—the introduction of “your” into the line(unreported by the auditor)—into one of the lines prevented that line from ever going to freeneedle. Till one day I caught the thing up and found out that this extra word existed in the line,knocked the extra word out, had it prepchecked a little bit, and wham, all four lines went to freeneedle.See, there was one line in there—I’ve forgotten which line it was, but it was something on theorder of “Who or what would oppose your catching catfish?” Not “Who or what would opposecatching catfish?” See? Just the introduction of that “your” on one of the four lines. See, itwasn’t on the other three. And yet this was listed this way by three auditors, see? And the firstauditor was completely exonerated on the matter because nobody had formulated the lines atthat time to amount to anything and we were just at the beginning of this level, and this auditorput them together as kind of what the PC thought they might be, you see? And there was a“your” in it. And that prevented those things from going to free needle. So, in other words, thewording Of the line can prevent or achieve a free needle for that line. It is the wording of theline.Now, our more modern version seems to hit people much closer. And we have had at least one"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"goal not go clear on the old four lines, but be much easier to run, and is running much moreeasily—and actually on the original four lines just went up to 6.0 as the TA, and stuck. Rightgoal, but it just went up and stuck because these lines were not adequate to describe thesituation, you see, and started moving again the moment the wording was changed to theselines which we are now using.Line one: “Who or what would want to catch catfish?” Line two: “Who or what would opposecatching catfish?” Line three: “Who or what would retard” (or “pull back”) “opposition tocatching catfish?” And line four: “Who or what would pull back” (what is it?) “ . . . fromcatching catfish?”Audience: “Someone or something.”Oh, “someone or something from catching catfish?” Now, “someone or something” could ofcourse be on at least two of the lines, or on more of the lines, you understand. But there is thepattern which we are using now. It’s “pull back” and “pull back,” or “retard” and “pull back,”on lines three and four.But the point is, the line has got to fire. You read the goal, “To catch catfish,” bang! “To catchcatfish,” bang! “To catch catfish,” bang!All right. That read transfers over onto all four lines. And it is not true that it transfers onto justthree of the lines and the other one isn’t hot just now. See, it’s because that line that is notfiring is not quite right. See? You should be able to put these four lines together and get themall to fire. You say, “To catch catfish,” bang! “To catch catfish,” bang! “To catch catfish,”bang! “Who or what would want to catch catfish?” Bang! See? They’ve all got to fire that way.Now, there are various oddball wordings which haven’t worked. We run into the problem ofthe negative goal. Let’s take the goal “not to talk.” “Who or what would want not to talk?”That’s perfectly fine, isn’t it? “Who or what would oppose not to talk?” That’s good, isn’t it?That’s fine. We’re just going along fine there. Now let’s get to line three on the old wording.“Who or what would not oppose not to talk?” Double negative. Enterprising auditor, shift thedouble negative, of course, change it around so you don’t have a double negative, that’d makeit “much better”—she never goes clear. And line four, “Who or what would not want not totalk?” That’s really becoming garbage as far as the auditor can see. Pretty gruesome.But what do you know! Interestingly enough, it’s perfectly comprehensible to the PC. Doublenegative—so what? Doesn’t mean anything to the PC. The line means something to the PC, butthat it isn’t grammatically something or other was not a thing. So that first wording wasperfectly okay and was all right to remain just as it was, if you had a negative goal.But this wording didn’t work, see—double negative, that’s all right, doesn’t matter. But thiswording didn’t work: “Who or what would want the goal ‘not to talk’?” “Who or what wouldoppose the goal ‘not to tally’?” “Who or what would not oppose the goal ‘not to talk’?” Forsome cockeyed reason it ceases to make sense very soon, see? “The goal...” “the goal...” “thegoal . . .” Makes it grammatical, but apparently makes it unworkable.Now we’ll get another one: Let’s take the wing out of it. “Who or what would oppose catchingcatfish?” See? “Who or what would oppose the goal ‘to catch catfish’?” Now, this one isimportant for you to know about, because PCs will try to steer you into it. It hasn’t the leastbearing on the situation. It doesn’t go clear. Apparently this one lays an egg. But a PC tells youthat’s real hot. The PC will tell you “That’s real good.” And apparently it is for the birds. Seethe difference? It’s a different meaning. “Who or what would oppose the goal ‘to catchcatfish’?” of course is just dandy. That sounds good, doesn’t it? Well, it isn’t the samemeaning that you want on your list line.We don’t care about opposing the goal. To hell with the goal—why keep it in that realm? Wewant to know who would oppose catching catfish, not oppose the goal “to catch catfish.” It’s"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"“Who or what would oppose catching catfish?” that clears the PC. See, that’s the opposition.It’s the opposition to action. Because remember, these are flow lines. When anybody tries tosteer you away from a wording which you think is proper and so forth, in arguing it out with aPC, or figuring it out yourself or something, just remember this: These are actions. These areactions.Now, of course, we get “want the goal”: that’s a kind of an inflow, isn’t it? And that hasalways kind of loused me up. I don’t know quite why an inflow word like want works as anoutflow action of the goal. But it apparently keeps the goal in the item’s head that has got it.See? But hale, as far as I know— although I don’t have too much data on this—haveapparently works equally well. Apparently.But it’s what fires that counts. But what fires has got to be actions of the goal. It’s got to beaction. Because you’re listing flow lines.So this would be dead wrong: “Who or what would oppose people who had the goal to catchcatfish?” That’s dead wrong. You want to know who or what would oppose people. Well,that’s not the goal.All right. Let’s go a little bit further afield here. It’s after all catfish, isn’t it? All right, so “Whoor what would oppose catfish?” You’re practically listing two lines at once. That’s what messesup there. Because anybody who’s trying to catch catfish is opposing catfish too. And anybodywho’s opposing catfish is also opposing catfish, and you’ve got no opposition anyplace. Soyou might as well just do the one line for the two; don’t you see?And there we come into the liability of listing lines. Now, believe me, this is quite a problem,because you’re liable to make this horrible mistake, unless forewarned: The PC is given fourcommands but actually only lists three lines. Now, look at the mess this gets him into. He liststwice as many items on one line and he lists no items on another line, and an equal number onthe remaining two lines.In other words, he overlists one line and doesn’t list another line at all. And the PC is going togo round the bend. See, he’s really going to get cooked with this one. Next thing you know,your tone arm is stuck, and you’ll be saying it’s the wrong goal, and everything is all upset.Well, the PC, through his own interpretation, can do this just fine. So the best way to handlethis is have PCs draw you pictures.Now, you want to draw the PC a picture of the one I just gave you and present this as aproblem to the PC of how you’re going to word this thing. Of course, you’re going to wordthis thing with current wording. If absolutely impossible, you’re going to change it. But you’regoing to try to word it with current wording. But you want to show the PC this thing. And it’sthis arrow that comes in toward him, and this arrow that goes out that faces the other arrow,and then this arrow that pulls back and then this arrow that goes out parallel to the other one.You want to show him those four arrows, and you’re going to say, “That’s oppose. That’sopposed to doing your goal, and this is doing your goal, see, and this is keeping you fromdoing your goal, don’t you see, and that’s retarding the other Tom being opposed. But at thesame time, we don’t want this fourth line here to be the second line up here. Do you see howthat could be? See, who would oppose you doing your goal? And who would not want you todo your goal?” Ooooh, those things are getting awful ghostly close together, aren’t they?You got to have wording here that means these four flows, with regard to the action of thisgoal.Now, goals Are action situations. Even “being a hound dog,” as a goal— “to be a hound dog,”see—requires an action. The action is at least to be. That’s not much action, but it’s still enoughaction to be action and it causes a Dow. You say, “Who would want to be a hound dog?” andof course now you’ve got it pretty well made. Of course, there’s some action a little bit addedin there. And “not want to be a hound dog,” see? You could get these things, you see, but"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"they’re still actions. “Oppose being a hound dog,” that’s guaranteeing action, you see? And“retard opposition to being a hound dog.”These are very hard for PCs to wrap their wits around very often. Particularly when they’relying at the bottom of the GPM. There they lie, nobody has disturbed them on this subject formillennia, you see, or triennia. Nobody’s even breathed it at them or mentioned it to them, andyou all of a sudden come along and propound the philosophic principle of whether or notthey’re going to oppose or not oppose being a hound dog, you know? They’ve just neverconsidered it. They’ll be in this kind of a state: They know that everybody opposes being ahound dog. And that is the “truth.” That isn’t a fact, you see; that’s the “truth.” The truth oflife: Life opposes being a hound dog.Now, you introduce a brand-new idea: You say, “Who would want to be a hound dog?”“Want to be a hound dog?” Good heavens, nobody’s thought of that, you see !Well, factually they haven’t thought of it for ages. See? And these other actions, the other threeactions . . . So they very readily steer themselves over onto one groove, if they possibly can,and it’ll be the flow they happen to be stuck on at the moment you get them to figure it out.So their advice is worse than useless. But you want to find out whether or not they can answerit. That’s what you want to know. That’s why you consult them. You don’t take their wording,but you want to find out if they can answer it. And then you juggle the wording around or doanything you have to do to the wording so that you can clear, you know, invalidation, mistake,wrong word, anything like that that you want to clear on this thing. And after this line iscleaned up with a fast check on the mid ruds, like to-be-a-tiger drill— after this line is cleanedup, brrrrp, see—you say that line and you get pow! You get a read, see? You say the line, youget a read. You say the line, you get a read. Dandy. Here we go. That’s fine, see?Now you want to get the next one, so that when you say that line you get a read. Say the line,get a read. Prepcheck it out. In other words, you mid-rud the thing. You see, you get those midruds in on the line, and then test it. You’d be surprised how busy they are sometimes ininvalidating lines, and all that straighten-out.So frankly, I’ve opened up a subject to you, you possibly haven’t looked at very intimately,and that is the wording of a line to be listed. But that, second to the goal, is the most importantsource from which all clearing flows—is that line. And now, keeping an even balance amongstthose lines as they list.All right. Now, so much for this wording of the line. Your next step is to make sure that as youlist, you list in Model Session, your rudiments are in without antagonizing the PC unduly—because, you see, you can put the rudiments in so often that it amounts to no auditing, and thenthe rudiments go out, see?So your basic action is don’t list too long on one line. How long is too long? I’ll tell youexactly how long you should list a line, exactly how long: as long as the flow in that directionpersists.Yeah, how are you going to know that? Well, short of an oscilloscope, you’re not. Anoscilloscope will show you the flow line. So you just pays your money and you takes yourchance.But I’ll give you an indicator. This would be slightly overlisting a line, but would be safe. Thisis slightly overlisting the line by an item or two, but it’s very safe: As soon as the PC says “Uh. . . and uhhhh . . . ,” change your lines. Go to the next line. Why? You’ve hit the null point.You see, don’t be under the delusion that the PC is thinking up these items. Don’t make thatmistake. He thinks he’s thinking; he thinks he’s talking; he thinks it’s all going off, but actually"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"he’s just a wound-up doll. See, he’s just firing off . . . He couldn’t help it. He practicallycouldn’t help but give you the items, because they’re being dealt. See? Because they’re stackedin the GPM in that way. He doesn’t think of any of them.Now, if a PC is groping for the right wording, you’ve overlisted. “I mean a . . . uh . . . I meana . . . uh . . . uh . . . mm . . . Oh, no, that isn’t the right word. Uh . . . uh . . . a uh . . . a big .. . a big . . . uh . . . no, a big, big . . . a huge . . . uh . . . uh . . . a gargantuan . . . Uh . . . atr—tr—uh, let’s see, a tremendously . . . no, that isn’t . . . uh, tremendously large . . .” Oh,man, you overlisted a long way back. You should have quit, see?Now, that item will spew onto the paper, bang! Just without any trouble from the PC. Andlong times in listing sessions without many items coming onto the page is all caused by theauditor not judging the flows right. Comm lag of the PC eats up session. And if you keep thePC out of that comm lag—you just list in rotation: one, two, three, four; one, two, three, four;one, two, three, four; and don’t let the PC comm lag, or shut off an automaticity.Isn’t that neat? You mustn’t shut off a PC’s automaticity. He’s saying, “Tiger, waterbuck,water buffalo, uh . . . big snakes, pythons, uh . . . Mindoro uh ... natives, pygmies, uh ...pygmies, pygmies, uh ... uh....”Well, the funny part of it is, is you mustn’t have shut him off at “water buffalo,” because it’dsuppress the nest two items. He can’t help but say them, don’t you see? They’re just beingdealt off the top of the deck, one-two-three-four, see? They’re just coming right on up, one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight-nine-ten-eleven, tr-tra-nun-nun, and then “a . . . a . . . uh .. .” Shift lines.Now, I’ll tell you when you’ve listed too long, slightly, but not to the other degree “I can’t getthe right word for it. I don’t know what . . .” Oh, you’re way overdue, man! You missed the5:15, you missed the 6:20, see, you missed the midnight express. No, here’s the one: The PCsays, “No, that’s not it.” You’ve gone over. You’ve gone over, right now.He’s invalidating the item he is giving you. Why is he invalidating the item he has given you?Because the other flow line is now meeting the direction of his attention and is overwhelminghis attention so that any item he thinks up is of course being overwhelmed by the other flowline coming to him. Just like that, heh! It’s very neat.And you just listen to him, as he goes along on listing, and he says, “A water buffalo, a tiger, aMindoro native, a pygmy, a uh . . . uh . . . uh . . . uh.. .ap-python, auh...um.. .uh. ..uh...a...a deer. No. No. No, that’s not it. Um . . . a uh . . . buck. A buck . . . uh—no, no, um . . . abuck, uh . . . No. No, not a—not—not—not a—not a buck deer. Uh . . . um . . . let’s see,now. Um . . . Well, I c-ca-can’t really think of the name of the thing. Uh . . . uh . . . a big . . .uh . . . a buck, uh . . . uh . . . uh . . . a v . . . a very lar— uh . . . It’s a certain kind of a deerthey have down in Mindoro, a uh . . . a dak, or u . . . u . . .” Oh man, you missed the 6:15,the 8:30, the 10:25 they’ve all gone by. See? That’s the whole gamut. You have run the lotnow, see?Your first indicator was “and a uh....” Well, out of courtesy, you could let him give it to you.He’ll say, “ . . . a uh . . . buck.”And you say, “All right. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Now, all right, we’regoing to start on the next line. And here we go.” We’ve shifted gears, and we’re now listing onsomething else.That’s really the way to get away from the pin fast, and your PC doesn’t get suppressions, andyou don’t have to put in the mid ruds all the time and all that sort of thing. Just catch it on thatfirst “ahh . . .” And it’s just handed to you on a silver platter.He tells you. “This line has run as far as it’s going to go, and is now in an eddy area, and is"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"about to turn around and go the opposite direction.” That’s what he tells you with that “ahh....”With the invalidation, he tells you, “It has already turned around and is going in the oppositedirection, and anything I think of is being overwhelmed and invalidated by the line which isnow coming the other way.” See? And when he can’t think of it at all, he’s just totallyoverwhumped. Now the line is really racing at him.But similarly—let me make this point again—it is a high crime to shut off an automaticitybecause he won’t be able to get it again. This thing is firing off and you put a suppression righton the middle of the thing. He’s going to tell you all of a sudden thirty items—brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.And you say, “Well, that’s enough.”He says, “Bu-bu brrr-b-brr—brrrr. . .” And you put in the mid ruds at that point, you find itwas all suppressed. The PC feels kind of loused up. He feels kind of betrayed and so on.So there are the basic tricks of listing: (1) At the beginning of the session get in your rudiments.(2) Get your goal fast-checked. (3) Now, there’s two ways you could go about this: One issimply to fast-check the first line you do, and then when you get to the next line give it a fastcheck; when you get to the nest line give it a fast check—first time you ask it, you see? You getto the fourth line, give it a fast check and then don’t check them anymore. Just see if it fires,that’s the only thing you want. It’s very fast. See? That could be done that way, or you couldtake all five of these things—the goal and the lines—and just read them all off to see if they allfire, see if there are any suppressions on them, you know. And clean them up, bang-bang, getthem all firing, bong, and then go on to your session. Two ways you could go about this. Findout which one is best for you.Now, you center his attention on the lines, of course, too solidly, in prepchecking the things,and he’ll start giving you answers, then you’re already in session. So that has some liabilityconnected with it.Now, your next action is to get the PC to list the first line down to a point where he says “Anda ... uh ... uh ... let me see....” Let him see by all means. But if he sees for more than a fewseconds you say, “Well, all right. That’s fine. We’ll get that one the next time we come around.Now, let’s start on this next line,” see? Let’s not leave him in thin air. And just list to the commlag. Go straight along down the line. List to the comm lag. List to the comm lag. List to thecomm lag.Now, you’re going to get in trouble sooner or later because your lines are going to get ragged ifyou list to the comm lag. And that’s liable to upset you. So you take one of those times whenhe’s feeling very, very easy, and catch up a few items. And it’s a nice balance which you do.But if it’s straining him to think of any more items just to make you catch up, you abandoncatching up. You got it? Because it’s not a quantitative process, after all. It’s the amount ofnow, see? It’s the amount of now that we’re interested in, not the number of items. Andnumber of items is merely an approximation of keeping them level. That is a sloppy index ofhow much flow has been gotten off any one of these lines.As far as checking the mid ruds is concerned, every time you turn around, you won’t have todo it if you list this way, which makes for very fast listing. But if you make yourself a bunchof mistakes—this is really when to use the mid ruds, a fast check of the mid ruds, not arepetitive check. If you make a big mistake, and this PC is going brrrrrr, and you say “Thankyou. Thank you. Thank you very much! Yeah, thank you! Yeah, thank you! Yeah, well I gotthat! Now, is there any other item that—a person or being there that would want to catchcatfish?” And the PC is sitting there looking blanched, you know? He’s been struck dead. He’shalfway through an automaticity, and he can’t get it out.Actually, recognize what’s happened to him. You’ve suppressed thirty or forty items, just likethat. Bang! You didn’t quite see what you were doing, you know? You didn’t realize he was"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"running off an automaticity and it was just tearing right on down the line, and you all of asudden gave him a nice Tone 40 acknowledgment, see? Brought him into present time, put himinto the session, crash, you see, all that sort of thing, and you just smell the rubber burning.You make a goof like that, don’t let him yap or get upset about it, just get in your mid ruds.Suppress—man, that is really going to be hot. You made him suppress the lot. Get the idea?Or, if you were kind of sleepy and it was a summer afternoon, and you suddenly wake up torealize that the PC for five minutes has been sitting there saying various things like this: “Is it alarge . . . a . . . a large tiger, a . . . a . . . a very—no, no, a tiger, a stri . . . a striped . . . Ican’t quite get the word for this. A tiger with horns. No, that would not be right,” and so forth.And you wake up suddenly, the PC has been going on like this for about five minutes—be anawfully good thing to get in the mid ruds. In other words, the mid ruds are something withwhich you pick up goofs. And if you’re really a smooth auditor you don’t goof.Now, how many items does it take per line to list a goal out? How many items? What aninteresting question. It’s almost philosophic in its impulse. It has a lot to do with how smoothlyit was done, oddly enough. And the less smoothness it was done, the less in-sessionness itwas done with, the more items you are going to have. So therefore you can’t say how manyitems should appear on a list as just a fait accompli. How many items, bang! You see? Youcan’t say that. But you sure can say that it isn’t going to be ten or fifteen. Ten or fifteenhundred? Now we’re getting more into the zone and order of magnitude.But speaking, then, we’re only speaking for the first goal. How many is it for a second goal?How many is it for a third goal? How many is it for a fourth goal? Well, these things becomeshorter and shorter, these lines do.So, how many clears the goal? Well, as many as you write down well and expertly to a pointwhere the needle goes free. That’s how many it is. And it certainly is not going to be less than athousand, I don’t think. We’ve got the third goal, I think you’re still within that order ofmagnitude. But I’m just guessing there.The first goal, seven thousand items on each line I wouldn’t worry too much about it unless theTA has gone up and stuck and has been stuck for a long time, or something like this, you see? Iwouldn’t worry about the number of items. I’ll tell you what to worry about in a minute. Butthe number of items isn’t something to worry about, you understand? Too few—God help us.That, no.Now, of course you don’t ever null these items, and the PC is going to ask you, “Why are wewriting them down?” It would be an interesting question: Why are we writing the items down?Well, my answer to that is writing them down is a better acknowledgment and it’s a muchbetter way to keep tabs on your lists, and there’s various reasons for writing them down. Butamongst them isn’t nulling. We don’t ever do anything with these items. I don’t know anythingto do with them.Your PC at first will be rather puzzled as to which one it is. Well, of course, that’s the joke. Itisn’t a Which one?”He’s been going a long piece of track on that goals problem mass, man. He’s had anopportunity to collect an awful lot of identities. And the identities which he personally haspicked up has had the opportunity to collect an awful lot of enemies. And he himself hascollected an awful lot of things which oppose enemies. And he himself has had a veryinteresting taste for things which prevented him from doing his goal. He’ll begin to wonderafter a while what possessed him. And all of these things combined make quantity. And thequantity is large."},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"All right. Now, let’s talk about how long a line is listed. It is listed exactly to free needle. It isnot listed one item beyond free needle. Hear me now: not one item beyond the free needle. Noteven one! Needle was free.Now, the proper conduct of an auditor, when observing a free needle on a line, should beprofessional. He should not suddenly get hold of one of his favorite valences of a rodeoperformer, start bucking about in the chair and trying to put a quirt to the E-Meter.“A free needle! Ha-ha! Hey-hey! Ha-ha! Ha—that’s enough, it’s a free needle. Hey, do youwant to come around and see this?” That is not optimum auditor conduct. It’s all right, becausewe can run the suppressions off.But you’ll feel like that when you first see one. You go to the next line and list it to free needleor, if it doesn’t go to free needle, until the flow runs out as usual.Sometimes one of them goes free, and three of them will stick for a while. Some of them thenyou’ve got two free, and the other two are sticking. And then sometimes you’ve got three free,and one is all hung up. And then eventually it goes free.Well, the way to do that is you keep going one, two, three, four, see? This thing is stuck. Thisline is sticky; it’s not free. Come back here to your next line in sequence, see, and put one,two, three, free needle, see?Now your needle is free when you go to your next line; your next line doesn’t upset it at all.Now, I can’t lay down a rule absolutely here, because it may not make the least bit ofdifference. But if you said the line to the PC and you get no needle reaction of any kindwhatsoever and nothing happens to the needle, it might be very foolish to list it. So we go tothe next line and we read the thing off and there’s no needle reaction of any kind to it, you see,and the needle is still free. And we come to the line we had that was sticky in the first place andit’s still sticky, now we list that thing on down until we get to a comm lag, and it’s still stuck.Well now, which line do we come back to next? Because nothing is cooling this thing down.Well, you’d better check them, hadn’t you?Now, it won’t upset anybody if you put one item on each one of these lines. Now, we’re into acompletely questionable area of what is the right thing to do? Experience will tell what is theright thing to do. I can’t give you a packaged answer, but I can tell you this: is don’t listbeyond a free needle! Because it’s quite upsetting. It’s something like asking for a rudimentanswer when there isn’t one, see?And if I were to lay down an operating rule for myself on this, as something I would now beguided by, I would wade myself through this. I would read these other lines and see if I couldget a stick, or a fall, see? Something.And I’d get an item. And then I’d walk back to the line that was stuck, and I would list it till Igot a comm lag. You get the idea? And I’d walk myself through this. And if I had three lines,all of which were giving a free needle, I wouldn’t test all three in rotation every time. I’d testone after the other. In other words, I’d take the sticky line, I’d list on it to a comm lag, and thenI’d choose another one of these lines—not the one in rotation; I’d skip a rotation, see?—andthen I’d list some more sticky needle and then I’d choose the third one that was free and test itnow. You know, I’d just walk my way through this, sort of like on eggs. You get the idea?And I wouldn’t list those lines. My instinct would be agin’ it. If I couldn’t get a fall or stick orany needle misbehavior on it, I don’t think I would touch them. I’d ask the PC if he had anyitems on these lines, but my auditing command would not be “Who-or-what-would-want-to-catch-catfish?” “Can you think of anything right now that—anything, anybody, want to catchcatfish? No, you can’t. All right. Thank you. Huh-huh, that is—that’s fine. Thank you verymuch.” Get off of there, see?"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"PC said, “Yeah, I just thought . . . uh game wardens catch catfish every now and then.” Andthen you’ve set it down, see? All right. He just gave you that gratuitously; that’s to keep frommissing withholds.You’re at a touchy end of the case. And obviously to you it isn’t a touchy end of the case at all,because the PC is now practically Clear and a Clear can stand anything. That might be yourreason. If the needle is this free, why, doesn’t matter how we treat the PC, does it?Well, that’s the wrong kind of thinking. Because right at that stage of the game it is ratheredgy, because you could take one of these free-needle lines and you could list it right on into ahole. In other words, you could stick it all up again. It’s already happened here, don’t thinkI’m just dealing on theory only. Overlisting has occurred.All right. That’s enough for that. You can certainly list through to free needle on four lines.Now, if one line consistently and continually hangs up, and you can’t make it go free, then youinvestigate the living daylights out of what is wrong with that particular line and see if you canfind anything wrong with it at all. And see if you can get any variation of wording of that lineto fire nicely and neatly, and continue listing on that new wording, and that line will go clean.Okay? That’s in case of emergency. Because there might have been, throughout, somethingwrong with that one line. See, you might have missed it. Already been done here, so it canhappen. Three lines went free, one didn’t.Well, when that happened before, your was in the fourth line. That your was enough to keepthat line from going free. And an examination of it—only took a couple, three sessions oflisting after that, and all four lines were free, just like that, see? So, suspect that if you get toomuch an inequality of this, and it’s hanging on too long, don’t let it go for months; look into it.Okay?All right. Now, what are the dangers of listing? Number one, listing is auditing. It is auditingand must be treated as such. It is the only therapeutic action undertaken to free a goal—ismerely listing. The pi: does not give out these answers analytically, no matter how bright andalert the PC might act. They’re all being dealt off the bottom of the deck, all out of the reactivemind, and you must not worry as to whether the PC is inventing answers or dreaming them upor thinking of them analytically or anything else. Just be calm about this. Look, there areenough things to worry about in auditing without inventing things.No, just take what the PC gives you, man. Keep the session going and relax. See? All right.Now, as you are starting in with the goal, you have a period of danger. And this period ofdanger begins at the moment of finding the goal and is over when you have proved beyonddoubt that this goal, while being listed on all four lines, turns on pain on line one, sensation online two, a little more sensation than pain on line three, and a little more pain than sensation online four. And when you’ve proven that to your own complete satisfaction . . .Well, look, you’re looking at me as though I should detail this more, but figure it out foryourself, man. Figure it out for yourself. Lines one and three belong to the PC. And lines twoand four belong to the enemy. And the enemy is sensation and the PC is pain. That’s easy. Andunless you get that optimum condition of affairs, that goal is wrong. And you better get off ofthat, hotter than hot and faster than fast.Line one—here’s what makes a goal wrong: Line one turns on sensation. “Who or what wouldwant to catch catfish?”Dizzy, misemotional, groggy, “Uh-u-uhhh-ohhh,” see? Pressures.“Who or what would oppose catching catfish?”"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"“Ouch! Oh, what a terrible pain went through my head. Oh, what an awful pain in my back.Oh, dear, dear, dear. Ohrrarr. Ohh, my—ouch!” See? It’s the wrong line! That should beturning on sensation; it’s turning on pain.And we get to line three, which is the PC’s own line again, since it’s an allied line, and theperson says, “Nyoom-m! Oh dear, still very dizzy and so on, so on and so on and so on and soon . . . Very dizzy, and there’s this little tiny pain in my ear, but that doesn’t amount to much.Sure makes you dizzy, doesn’t it?”And he gets to line four, “Who or what would pull back your goal?”—you see, that’s theenemy, man—and, “Ouch! Urp! Pain went through the back there. What was that?”Now look, that condition as a purity seldom exists. It won’t exist for very long. If youcontinue to list this it all becomes sen. Everything gets to be sen. But if you go too far on this,everything goes sen. The bank starts to become hard, beefy, lumpy. The person wakes up inthe morning and the ridges he usually had are now really ridges. We’re getting an exaggerationof the situation. That bank is becoming heavy. It’s like running Creative Processing withouthaving the goal “to create.”And the PC will wake up in the morning, actually, and he’ll feel like there’s a board goingthrough his head, see? Something like this. And he’s . . . And it all turns into sensation. It’s alldizzy, groggy, pressures, nausea, misemotion. Starts to feel like after a while he didn’t doanything to high blood pressure, probably, but he starts to feel like high blood pressure wouldbe much more comfortable. You see, all four lines go to sen. That’s an interesting item, isn’t it?Now, if all four lines went to pn, I wouldn’t worry. But if they all went to sen, to hell with it.Get out of there. You’re wrong. I don’t care what you think, you’re wrong! You got it? I don’tcare what the PC says. That’s the wrong goal! Yeah, it read! Yeah, it’s fine. Yeah, it checkedout. Yo. Yo, we had three instructors and the governor of Australia check it out! I don’t careabout all those arguments! The line is wrong! because that is the final proof of a goal. You gotit?You haven’t got a goal until you have listed it two or three hundred items on each line, as theauditor. And that will save your bacon. Of course, if it checks out beautifully, PC got pain onit, bang, and so forth, you’re pretty sure, aren’t you? But the final test of any pudding is thelisting. You go two, three hundred items deep on this thing; if it’s turning on pain in the rightplaces and sen on the right places, and that sort of thing, oh boy, you’re in. Go for broke.Now the only thing could happen wrong is you start listing with the rudiments out. Somethingcrazy goes on in the PC’s life, he’s got PTPs like mad or rudiments are wildly out, orsomething of the sort, you see? And in a minor way—you see, checking the goal out everytime is just a way of speeding this up. It won’t prevent clearing, and checking the lines outwon’t prevent clearing by listing. They just blow it down.But a wrong line will. A wrong line will prevent clearing. “Who or what would try awfullyhard to oppose catching catfish?” And the next line to it is “Who or what would not want tocatch catfish?” you see? And the next line down the line—all out of position, see, allmisworded.It would be too cruel an experiment—I have seen this in actual action— but you can take fourlines, check them out, and then throw one. Now it will fire on a suggestion and an invalidation,see, and a mistake. You can get it to fire, of course, just like you can get a goal to fire. Andnow insist on listing that line. “Who or what would know he had to have to catch catfish?” Andthen put all the other ones down correctly.The action of doing something like that is to bring the TA up to a stick. It’s almost exactly 4.5to 6.0. Almost always. I haven’t ever seen a tone arm on a misworded line, or mislisting, orARC-broke sessions, or overlisting in sessions—the errors you can make, in other words—"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"that on goals listing didn’t go up to 4.5 and 5.0. I’m quite prepared to see one go up to 6.0, orto 7.0, or 3.75. I’m quite prepared to, you understand. But it just happens that every one I’veseen have gone from 4.5 to 5.0 and then stick. They’ll stick at 4.5 or they’ll stick at 5.0. Andmore have stuck at 5.0 than at 4.5.So when your tone arm starts lingering around 5.0 for a session, and next session lingersaround 5.0, don’t be surprised if the third session your PC all of a sudden says, “Well, I wasawfully dizzy. I was walking down the street, and I saw the buildings sort of reel.” You’redoing something weird. Something wild is going on here. Something’s happened. You got tostraighten it out.Now, what straightens out? How do you straighten one of these things out? Well, you locatewhat’s wrong. You better check out the goal and get it to fire again if you possibly can. Checkout the lines, one after the other; see if there’s any disagreement from the PC on these lines orthese wordings. That’s quite important. You’re not going to change them around just becausehe disagrees with them, but you’re going to sure make it’s answerable, if you can. Check outyour sessioning in general (which isn’t really enough to keep it all hung up) and just straightenthis thing out and get it to rolling again. That’s what you’re going to do.Now, look: If you can’t straighten the goal out after you’ve listed a couple of hundred, if itceases to fire after two or three hundred items on each one of four lists, it’s sort of “Which waydid they go? What happened?” You got to get it back to firing again. Of course, if you can’t getit back to firing again, it was probably the wrong goal in the first place.The method we’re using to find goals right now rather makes it very difficult to get a wronggoal. That makes it pretty difficult for you to get a wrong goal or run a wrong goal. That’s thebeauty of it, and why I love that method. Ease of auditing and positiveness of finding the goalwere enough to have this. And that’s not why I’m happy about it. It used to be that only aninstructor or somebody who was specially trained in that little tiny technique of checkout—wecould absolutely rely on the fact that it was the right goal.Now, any of you guys, if you’re good enough to do nulling by mid ruds down to a pointwhere you find a goal, you’re so used to checking them out that checking out a goal doesn’tphase you anymore. You’ll be able to actually look at a goal and say “Well, boom, let’s check itout.” Brrr, brrr. “To be a tiger”— tzal-tup-ub, bang, thud, bang. “Yeah, it doesn’t fire.” See,that’d be all there was to it, you know? “Let’s see, is there a suppression on there? That goal been suppressed? That isn’t a goal.” See? Positiveness enters into the picture. And that’s goingto save an awful lot of bacons.So, preventing the wrong goal from being found has been quite a campaign I’ve had to engageon here for quite a while, and actually what was marvelous is that this new nulling by midruds, not just for its value for the auditor, but to prevent wrong goals from being found, isworth its weight in planets, man, and it’s pretty heavy.Now, this idea of finding a goal, finding it firing, and saying that is the person’s goal oragreeing that it as the person’s goal—that’s perfectly all right, because it can be run out. It’s anassertion, see? That’s all right. But when the PC keeps saying “No, it isn’t my goal” and theauditor keeps saying “Yes, it is your goal,” a ridge is built up which is pretty hard to take apart.And it will keep a goal firing. So don’t argue over somebody’s goal or you’ll make it fire andfire and fire, and its not his goal. You get the suppressions, invalidation’s off it, he’ll agreewith it if it’s his goal, and if it isn’t his goal, he won’t.You could find an opposition goal. This is the other thing that could be wrong. You could findan opposition goal. Now, I don’t know that by nulling by mid ruds you will find an oppositiongoal. I don’t know too much about finding opposition goals, as distinct from finding goals. Ican’t give you much data on this, actually, because I’ve never seen an opposition goal thatwould fire after it has been prepchecked and nulled by mid ruds. You understand? So there’salways the possibility that opposition goals actually only fired because they were invalidation’s"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"of the goal or something. You get the idea? And they might not have had rocket reads on themat all, you see?And somebody the other day came up with a reverse rocket read on a goal, and immediatelyproposed it was probably an opposition goal, which I thought was very interesting. So if yousee that sort of thing, let me know. But I don’t know that you can get a rocket read on anopposition goal. I don’t know that it isn’t just the invalidation of the goal that makes theopposition goal fire.Well, you’re fairly secure if you have found the goal and checked it out. But don’t be too cockyuntil you’ve got two hundred on a line. And if you found a goal and then turned it over tosomebody to list, remember to reach out, by the time they got three hundred on each line orsomething like that, and say to the PC, “How are you doing? How do you feel? All right.When they ask you so-and-so and so-and-so, where does the somatic come?”And the person says, “Well, it’s so and so on.”“Now, what kind of a somatic is it? Is it a sensation, or is it painful or what is it? And what lineis it on?” And check it all out yourself, you got the idea? You know, don’t read the auditor’sreport. That’s a good prevention.Otherwise than that, you realize that somebody who is trained to HCA level could be quitecompetent in listing. And listing is the longest part of clearing. So if you had somebody helpingyou in auditing and you kept your eye on the situation, a person with less training than isnecessary to find goals could list goals, and because he was doing this sort of thing and doingsome Prepchecking and so forth as he went along, he would actually get up to a point where hecould locate goals. So it’s a good training school, listing is. See?Now, that lengthens the number of people you could clear by three or four times. See?Now, you got to know all about listing and you should list somebody to Clear just to see howit looks and get the experience and that sort of thing, but I don’t expect you to list every goal toClear that you find. It’d be a much more economic situation for you to find the goal and thenkeep your eagle eye beagled on the somebody who is listing it out.Now, how about auto-listing? Well, there is no telling. I won’t say that auto-listing isimpossible. I don’t believe that it is possible or impossible, at this particular stage of the game.I believe that it would be better than nothing. Let me put it that way. But to tell somebody to gohome and list on four lists and you will look into it in a couple of weeks, it seems to me like it’ssort of taking his life in your hands! You know? I wouldn’t be sure about this at all. But Iwould say this—I would say this: that if you were on a desert island and you knew your goal,and you knew exactly what the goal is and it’d been expertly checked out, and there wasabsolutely no way under the sun for you to get Clear any other way, I would say that youshould pick up a pencil and a piece of palm bark. But we would know more about that in duecourse.Now, these are the various ramifications to listing. Clearing itself consists of the cycle offinding a goal and then listing it until you have a free needle on each of four lines, findinganother goal and listing it on each of four lines, Ending another goal and listing it on each offour lines. And the state of case is regulated by the number of goals the person has which havenot been found and listed. Those are damping factors.Now, here at Saint Hill it’s fairly simple to make a first-goal Clear—not simple, but with heroicactivities (let us put it that way), we can make a first-goal Clear.Now, to find a second goal on a PC, and list that one out, this is getting much more difficult.We have just now found and checked out a second goal on Jean, and that was very, very goodnews, that I was very happy about. And at least it was stated to me in so many words that it"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"was checked out today. Was it?Female Voice: Hm-hm.Yeah. All right, that’s a second goal. Okay, now she’s got a little time to list on this secondgoal. And I think they possibly even may list it out because the listing, very possibly, is muchshorter than a first goal. But we know more about that in due course.She’s already starting to depart from the standard state of Clear, or such a person is alreadystarting to depart from what we have considered Clear. They’re starting to move up into ThetaClear or something like that, and it’s an adventure from there on out, because these variousstates, now, of course are not regulated in any way by different processes to differentconditions. It’s a gradient scale of the same condition all the way, of course.Now, I can’t even tell you how many goals it is to OT. See? Or how long it’d take you to findand list each one of these goals. I was very happy to find today that the second goal would fireso nicely. Nice. I was told they had good rocket reads on the thing. See? I was very happyabout that.Somewhere up the line, why, the goals are not going to stay in. They’re going to start blowing.But how far do you have to keep the goals not blowing to get OT? See?But that is the road that we are on, basically. And it’s a repetition of the same action.The only improvement which I see in auditing which is coming immediately up, and so on, is amechanical improvement. That is to say, a persistency of read—devices to make a read morepersistent and therefore more observable by an auditor.I don’t see any changes to amount to anything on clearing as such. I do see some dodges onecould do to probably shorten up finding a goal. And I see some frills one could add onto listingthat would possibly shorten the thing up one way or the other. But I don’t look for anyfabulous advance from along that line. I don’t. Because there are certain limitations that you hit,and the limitation is that the person has got just that much case, and they have to sit there justthat long, and they can talk just that fast. Get the idea? All right.And maybe when we’re all OT, why, maybe we’ll look back over the whole thing again, andwe’ll say it would have been much easier had we done it this way. And I hope that we’re in thatcondition and don’t have to do it some other way.Those are the improvements I look for in clearing. I really don’t look for many otherimprovements. But I do look for improvements that’ll take little shortcuts—little faster,something that is more valuable to do this than to do that, you know, little things along the line.And we may carve it down, we may carve it down considerably. We may use various systemsOf auditing. Just given you one tonight: You find the goal, let am HPA list it, see, under youreye. Therefore you’ve lost two hundred hours Of auditing, just like that. Various othermechanisms of this character can be fine, and we can step it up into quantitative clearing. Ourproblem now is quantitative clearing.My immediate problem is to get some of you to read an E-Meter better. Well, I’m solving thatwith drills and attention and various things, and I’m also double-solving it by making sure thata persistent-read E-Meter comes into existence in the very near future that can be hooked up to aMark IV and red lights go on and pinball’s dials go around when you hit a read, see, and itstays on until you do something about it or something like that.But I have actually no quarrel—no real quarrel with your drills, no real quarrel with yourauditing presence, no real quarrel with these things. I see just this metering that’s being aproblem. And we’ll get that licked."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"I have a problem of how many of you can I push on through to first-goal Clears in a space oftime, when the fellow alongside of you can’t read an E-Meter and neither can you.

I’m not even worrying aboutwhat’s in the guts of this meter. I just told them, well, what we need is an idiot meter. Youhave an on-and-off switch and a red light.

These things we’ll have.I can undoubtedly find where we can best expect the goal to appear on a list, and therefore cutdown the number of goals we have to null in order to find the goal, you know?

Don’t force the pc to list more items than he has, and2. Don’t prevent the pc from giving items.The number of ways an auditor can dream up, or overlook, to violate 1 and 2 above arecountless.Example:If pc can’t answer the line easily skip, omit or change it, DON’T Tiger Drill it to force ananswer.LISTING IS NOT PREPCHECKING. You don’t wait for the pc to say he has no morebefore you stop asking a line. THE AUDITOR REGULATES HIS QUESTION BY THEPC’S COMM LAG. When the pc first comm lags (without asking for a repeat of the Linewording) the auditor comes off the line. The auditor doesn’t ask the line again just “to makesure” or ask the pc “do you have any more”. Asking it again when the pc has comm laggedleaves, amongst other things, an unanswered auditing question.The line is asked. The pc answers until he or she comm lags. The auditor then acks andgoes instantly to next line. If the pc says he has more on the old line, the auditor says “sorry”and takes them.A LINE IS RUN TO FIRST COMM LAG. How long is a comm lag? It is the pausebefore the strained grope.A pc’s decline in answering goes as follows:1. Bright rapid giving.2. Comm lag while looking.3. Groping for more.4. Comm lag while groping.5. Can’t quite say it.6. Starts picking up and rejecting.From 3 above onward the auditor is at fault. Right at the end of 2 the auditor acks andgives the pc the next line.The auditor takes only the bright, easily gotten flows."},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"If the pc goes fumbling and groggy the auditor is at fault and is doing wrong.Listing is a rapid action. The way to keep it rapid is to deftly see that the pc has given alland then get out of there!Auditors whose pcs dope and grope will soon have pcs that mope.The auditor avoids Q and A. The auditor never repeats an item back to the pc or asks if itfits on the line. The auditor’s role is permissive with good presence.If the auditor does not understand an item he or she says so but does not include anyrepeat of the item in saying so. That’s evaluation.Listing is slightly contrary to early auditing philosophy. Then, if the pc protested, theauditor forced the pc to answer. In listing this is never done.Then, if the pc comm lagged, the auditor flattened it. In listing one never flattens a commlag. One shifts the moment the first comm lag appears, but without startling the pc.Listing auditing is different. The pc is always right. In listing if you trick a pc into moreitems and prevent the pc from giving those items he has readily to hand, the whole case mayhave to be patched up before it will clear.It is so easy to list right as an auditor that many will fumble all over the place before theyget the knack. And almost all errors will be additive errors.Listing is the biggest barrier to clear now that we can find goals.Other listing methods may appear, but these will only alter What lines. Nothing is goingto alter the above, so you better learn it.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH: gl.rdCopyright © 1962by L.

No attestationsallowed, clay and demos required)The following laws are the ONLY important rules of listing and nulling. If an auditordoesn’t know these he will mess up pcs thoroughly and awfully. An auditor who doesn’t knowand can’t apply these is not a Level III auditor.LAWS1. The definition of a complete list is a list which has only one reading item on list.2. A TA rising means the list is being overlisted (too long).3. A list can be underlisted in which case nothing can be found on nulling.4. If after a session the TA is still high or goes up, a wrong item has been found.5. If pc says it is a wrong item it is a wrong item.6. The question must be checked and must read as a question before it is listed. An itemlisted from a non-reading question will give you a “Dead Horse” (no item).7. If the item is on the list and nothing read on nulling, the item is suppressed or invalidated.8. On a suppressed list, it must be nulled with suppressed. “On ....has anything beensuppressed.”9. On an item that is suppressed or invalidated the read will transfer exactly from the item tothe button and when the button is gotten in the item will again read.10. An item from an overlisted list is often suppressed.11. On occasion when you pass the item in nulling, all subsequent items will read to a pointwhere everything on list will then read. In this case take the first which read on firstnulling."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"12. An underlisted and overlisted list will ARC break the pc and he may refuse to be auditeduntil list is corrected, and may become furious with auditor and will remain so till it iscorrected.13. Listing and nulling or any auditing at all beyond an ARC Br without handling the ARCBreak first such as correcting the list or otherwise locating it will put a pc into a “sadeffect”. 14. A pc whose attention is on something else won’t list easily. (List and null only with therudiments in on the pc.)15. An auditor whose TRs are out has difficulty in listing and nulling and in finding items.16. Listing and nulling errors in presence of Auditor’s Code violations can unstabilize a pc.17. The lack of a specific listing question or an incorrect non-standard listing question whichdoesn’t really call for item will give you more than one item reading on a list.18. You cease listing and nulling actions when a floating needle appears.19. Always give a pc his item and circle it plainly on the list.20. Listing and nulling are highly precise auditing actions and if not done exactly by the lawsmay bring about a down tone and slow case gain, but if done correctly exactly by thelaws and with good auditing in general will produce the highest gains attainable.NOTE: There are no variations or exceptions to the above. (Does not alter 5A Powerprocedure.)A failure to know and apply this bulletin will result in the assignment of very lowconditions as these laws, if not known or followed, can halt case gain.  L.

Listing and Nulling is listed by the preclear. This is doneprecisely per the Laws of Listing and Nulling. (HCOB 1 August 1968).There is no Listing and Nulling drill in the Book of E-Meter Drills.The Auditor asks the listing question, if it reads he asks the PC the question, the PCanswers, item, item, item, item. The Auditor writes the items down as the PC gives themnoting the read or no read as the PC gives the item. The Auditor then nulls the list per the Lawsof Listing and Nulling.In Listing and Nulling, there should be ONLY ONE reading item on the list after nulling.You don’t go over and over the reading items by a process of elimination. You mayextend the list if more than one item is reading on nulling.In its finest form, Listing and Nulling is done to LFBD F/N.The Auditor says the listing question to the PC, checks whether it read and notes thereads per Number 6 of the Laws of Listing and Nulling.Ideally, the following would happens.The Auditor checks the question “Who got shot?” It gets a long fall, so it is reading well.Auditor writes the read beside the question. Then the Auditor gives the PC the question withgood TR 8, and PC gives items. The Auditor writes the PC’s items down, noting whether theitem read and the read as the PC gives it. The first reads therefore is always the read the itemgave as the PC said it.“Who got shot?” LFMe XJoe XBearersElephants XTigersThe Buffalo XIND.The White Hunter LFBD F/NBearers F XElephants F XTigers F XThe Buffalo X XEXTThe Dog X X"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"INDThe White Hunter LFBD LFBD F/N“The White Hunter will BD F/N because it is the item. The Auditor gives the item to thePC. The PC will have Cogs and VGIs. It might happen that the PC tells the Auditor that this isthe item, at which point the Auditor would pleasantly say “thank you. ‘The White Hunter’ isyour item.” of he could just smile and say “Thank you”, in acknowledgment. But the point isthat he would never chop the PC’s Cog or enforce his presence on the PC while this ishappening.GOOD TRs ARE VITAL.And this is the way you do Listing and Nulling.You get an LFBD F/N while Listing or while Nulling, if you’re a flubless Auditor. It isthe finest hand that gets it while Listing and never has to get to the Nulling stage. However,both are excellent. A list that has to be nulled to cm LFBD item is acceptable, but not worthy ofpraise.There is of course one other place where you could get an LFBD F/N in Listing andNulling - which is while checking the listing question for read before listing. You could get anF/N on checking the question, and the PC could start cogging and blow the whole subject.When that happens, the subject has blown. Don’t do anything more with it. Indicate the F/Nand let the PC have his Cog and VGIs.Listing and Nulling is so simple. Have perfect TRs, know the Laws of Listing andNulling, and do it as shown above.Any Auditor who consistently cannot get an LFBD F/N while Listing and Nulling shouldretrain on Listing and Nulling. It is more than likely he’ll find he has bought some one else’smisunderstoods or considerations on the subject.As a matter of fact, Listing and Nulling is a breeze and don’t let anyone try to tell youotherwise.Prepared from LRH lectures,C/Ses and HCOBsby CS-4Revised & Reissued as BTBby Flag Mission 1234I/C: CPO Andrea Lewis2nd: Molly HarlowAuthorized by AVUfor theBOARDS OF DIRECTORSof theCHURCHES OF SCIENTOLOGYBDCS:SW:AL:MH:JR:mhCopyright © 1970, 1974by L.

Reads are small falls or falls or long falls or long fallblowdown (of TA).A preclear’s case can be gotten into serious trouble by listing a list that doesn’t read orprepchecking or running an item that doesn’t read.On a list, this is the sort of thing that happens:The List is “Who or what would fly kites?” The C/S has said to “List this to a BD F/NItem”. So the auditor does list it without checking the read at all. The list can go on 99 pageswith the pc protesting, getting upset. This is called a “Dead horse list” because it gave no item.The reason it didn’t was that the list question itself didn’t read. One does an L4 on the pc tocorrect the situation and gets “Unnecessary action”.On a list that is getting no item you don’t extend. You correctly use L4 or any subsequentissue of it. If you extend a “dead horse list” you just make things worse. Use an L4 and it willset it right.This weird thing can also happen. C/S says to list “Who or what would kill buffaloes?”The auditor does, gets a BD F/N Item “A Hunter”. The C/S also says to list as a second action“Who or what would feel tough?” The auditor fails to test the Question for read and lists it. Hadhe tested it, the list would not have read. But the list comes up with an item, “A mean hunter”.It has stirred up charge from the first question and the item “A mean hunter” is a wrong item asit is a misworded variation of the first list’s item! Now we have an unnecessary action and awrong item. We do an L4 and the pc is still upset as maybe only one or the other of the twoerrors read.____________In a Dianetic “list” one is not doing a listing action. One is only trying to find a somatic orsensation, etc that will run. The item must read well. Or it won’t produce a chain to run. Inactual fact the Dn list Q does usually read but one doesn’t bother to test it.But an item that doesn’t read will produce no chain, no basic and the pc will jump aroundthe track trying but just jamming up his bank.The moral of this story is:"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"ALWAYS TEST A LISTING QUESTION BEFORE LETTING THE PC LIST.ALWAYS MARK THE READ IT GAVE (sF, F, LF, LFBD) ON THE WORKSHEET.ALWAYS TEST AN ITEM FOR READ BEFORE PREPCHECKING OR RUNNINGRECALL OR ENGRAMS.ALWAYS MARK THE READ AN ITEM GAVE (sF, F, LF, LFBD) ON THEWORKSHEET.CHARGEThe whole subject of “charge” is based on this. “Charge” is the electrical impulse on thecase that activates the meter.“Charge” shows not only that an area has something in it. It also shows that the pc haspossible reality on it.A pc can have a broken leg, yet it might not read on a meter. It would be charged butbelow the pc’s reality. So it won’t read.THINGS THAT DON’T READ WON’T RUN.The Case Supervisor always counts on the AUDITOR to test Questions and Items forread before running them.The auditor, when a Question or Item doesn’t read, can and should always put in“Suppress” and “Invalidate”. “On this (Question) (Item), has anything been Suppressed?” “Onthis (Question) (Item), has anything been Invalidated?” If either one read, the question or itemwill also read. The Case Supervisor also counts on the AUDITOR to use Suppress andInvalidate on a Question or Item. If after this there is still no read on the Question or Item,that’s it. Don’t use it, don’t list it. Go to the next action on the C/S or end off.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:dz.ka.rdCopyright © 1970by L.

This can hang up a pc badly if the item was in fact a reading itemor question. It does not get handled and exists in records as “No read” when in fact it DID read.THEREFORE ALL DIANETIC AUDITORS WHOSE ITEMS OCCASIONALLY “DON’TREAD” AND ALL SCIENTOLOGY AUDITORS WHO GET LIST QUESTIONS THAT DON’TREAD MUST BE CHECKED OUT ON THIS HCO B IN QUAL OR BY THE C/S ORSUPERVISOR.These errors come under the heading of Gross Auditing Errors as they affect metering.1. An Item or Question is said to “Read” when the needle falls. Not when it stops or slows ona rise. A tick is always noted and in some cases becomes a wide read.2. The read is taken when the pc first says it or when the question is cleared. THIS is the validtime of read. It is duly marked (plus any blow down). THIS reading defines what is areading item or question. CALLING IT BACK TO SEE IF IT READ IS NOT A VALIDTEST as the surface charge may be gone but the item or question will still run or list.3. Regardless of any earlier statements or material on READING ITEMS, an item does nothave to read when the auditor calls it to be a valid item for running engrams or listing. Thetest is did it read when the pc first said it on originating it or in Clearing it?4. That an item or question is marked as having read is sufficient reason to run it or use it orlist it. Pc Interest, in Dianetics, is also necessary to run it, but that it did not read again is noreason to not use it.5. When listing items the auditor must have an eye on the meter NOT necessarily the pc andmust note on the list he is making the extent of read and any BD and how much. THIS isenough to make it a “reading item” or “reading question”.6. In Clearing a listing Question the auditor watches the meter, NOT necessarily the pc andnotes any read while clearing the question.7. An additional calling of the item or question to see if it read is unnecessary and not a validaction if the item or question read on origination or Clearing.8. That an item is marked as having read on an earlier Dianetic list is enough (also checkinginterest) to run it with no further read test.9. To miss seeing a read on an origin or clearing is a Gross Auditing Error.10. Failing to mark on the list or worksheet the read and any BD seen during pc origination orclearing the question is a Gross Auditing Error."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"EYESIGHTAuditors who miss reads or have poor eyesight should be tested and should wear the properglasses while auditing.GLASSESThe rims of some glasses could obstruct seeing the meter while the auditor is looking at theworksheet or pc.If this is the case the glasses should be changed to another type with broader vision.WIDE VISIONA good auditor is expected to see his meter, pc and worksheet all at one time. No matterwhat he is doing he should always notice any meter movement if the meter needle moves.If he cannot do this he should use an Azimuth Meter and not put paper over its glass butshould do his worksheet looking through the glass at his pen and the paper—the original designpurpose of the Azimuth Meter. Then even while writing he sees the meter needle move as it is inhis line of vision.CONFUSIONSAny and all confusions as to what is a “reading item” or “reading question” should befully cleaned up on any auditor as such omissions or confusions can be responsible for casehang-ups and needless repairs.NO READAny comment that an item or question “did not read” should be at once suspected by aC/S and checked with this HCO B on the auditor.Actually non-Reads, a non-reading item or question means one that did not read whenoriginated or cleared and also did not read when called.One can still call an item or question to get a read. That it now reads is fine. But if it hasnever read at all, the item will not run and such a list will produce no item on it.It is not forbidden to call an item or question to test it for read. But it is a useless action ifthe item or question read on origination by the pc or clearing it with him.IMPORTANTThe data in this HCO B, if not known, can cost case failures.
