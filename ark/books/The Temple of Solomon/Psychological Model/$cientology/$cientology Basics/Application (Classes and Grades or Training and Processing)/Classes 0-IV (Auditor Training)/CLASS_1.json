Within5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. “Quickie grades”entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this PolicyLetter are HIGH CRIMES resulting in Comm Evs on ADMINISTRATORS and EXECUTIVES. It is not“entirely a tech matter” as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a 2 year slump. IT IS THE BUSINESS OFEVERY STAFF MEMBER to enforce it.ALL LEVELSKEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKINGHCO Sec or Communicator Hat Checkon all personnel and new personnelas taken on.We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology.The only thing now is getting the technology applied.If you can’t get the technology applied then you can’t deliver what’s promised. It’s assimple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what’s promised.The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is “no results”. Troublespots occur only where there are “no results”. Attacks from governments or monopolies occuronly where there are “no results” or “bad results”.Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if thetechnology is applied.So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P,the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied.Getting the correct technology applied consists of:One: Having the correct technology.Two: Knowing the technology.Three: Knowing it is correct.Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology.Five: Applying the technology."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied.Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology.Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications.Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology.Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application.One above has been done.Two has been achieved by many.Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper mannerand observing that it works that way.Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world.Five is consistently accomplished daily.Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently.Seven is done by a few but is a weak point.Eight is not worked on hard enough.Nine is impeded by the “reasonable” attitude of the not quite bright.Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity.Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area.The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Threeabove can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too-bright havea bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shutoff from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselvesagainst anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks toknock out the good and perpetuate the bad.Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight,Nine and Ten.In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide openfor research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of Century hasthoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only ahandful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long run value and none were major or basic; andwhen I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I repented andeventually had to “eat crow”.On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions andwritings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction ofall our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and howinsane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology”. By actual record the percentages areabout twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroygood technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had better steelourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attackedas “unpopular” “egotistical” and “undemocratic”. It very well may be. But it is also a survival"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"point And I don’t see that popular measures, self- abnegation and democracy have doneanything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorse degradednovels, self- abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses,and democracy has given us inflation and income tax.Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had nosupported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that in itsformative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume,will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done.There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which willbe valuable-only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications.The contributions that were worth while in this period of forming the technology werehelp in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, ofadvices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are,appreciated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discoverycontribution was not however part of the broad picture.We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank.We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact-the group left to its own devices would nothave evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called “new ideas” wouldhave wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workablemental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve-psychiatry,psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infinitum.So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense,and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlesslyfollowed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish.So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I havenot failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’s not goodenough for just myself and a few others to work at this.Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight. Nine and Ten has been relaxed the wholeorganizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.l., Wichita, the early organizations andgroups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, whenthey were all messed up you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. But ahead of that theyceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons.The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks havedifferent responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bankprinciples. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual andseldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid cravingfor agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement hasbeen what has made Earth a Hell-and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it wouldcertainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the greatgovernments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on theplanet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasantthings on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by theGroup Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by “public opinion” media.Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves.Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group offreed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that isdestructive.When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bankdominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it,"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and(d) encourage incorrect application.It’s the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the Bank thatsays we must fail.So just don’t play that tune. Do Seven. Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out ofyour road all the future thorns.Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pcspin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C.Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak on Threeabove and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the CaseSupervisor “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly at each of One toSix above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door tothe introduction of “new technology” and to failure.What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s all thathappened. This is what he should have done: Grabbed the Auditor’s report and looked it over,When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the restmissed: that. Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but thatnear session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while itstill gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B’s own manufacture, which nearlyspun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A wasfound to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The CaseSupervisor was found to be “too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases”.All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven,Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That process X didn’twork.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s your auditor’sreport for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stoppedProcess X. What did you do?” Then the Pc wouldn’t have come close to a spin and all four ofthese would have retained certainty.In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct processrecommended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one had (a)increased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable.Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process crackedthe case. Yet they were reported as not having worked!Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every timeinstruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the auditor,is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten areeven more important in a course than in supervision of cases.Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “because hegets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisions asession are reported. “Of course his model session is poor but it’s just knack he has” is alsoincluded in the recommendation. A careful review is undertake because nobody at levels O toIV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read anE-Meter dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered thathe “overcompensated” nervously swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed togo to place the needle at “set”. So everyone was about to throw away standard processes andmodel session because this one student “got such remarkable TA”. They only read the reportsand listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were makingslightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes.Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hidden under a lot of departuresand errors."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot ofoff-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The academy students were in a stateof electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought under control andthe student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck.Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wifedied of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough instructor at that moment couldhave salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to dowhatever they pleased.Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes aboutfrom non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but someearlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood.When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can becounted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came fromorgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology under instruction inScientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And theorgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened outeasily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. hence, adebacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So properinstruction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must bemerciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student,dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be thecause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology gothome to him.With what we know now, there is no student we enrol who cannot be properly trained.As an instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards insideout personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeve rolled up can crack theback of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole classonly. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don’t wait untilnext week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him. If you can’t graduate them with theirgood sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll havenightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three inthem and they’ll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing.When somebody enrols, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of theuniverse- never permit an “open-minded” approach. If they’re going to quit let then quit fast. Ifthey enroled, they’re aboard, and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the same terms as the restof us- win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. Thefinest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pambybunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It’s a tough universe. The socialveneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive-and even they have a hard time. We’llsurvive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly hebecomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scaredto enforce, we don’t make students into good Scientologists and that let’s everybody down.When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in he eye into afixed, dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. Theproper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist Now we’re going to makeyou into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you dead that incapable.”Fitting that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the crosswe have to bear.But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and timewe will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fastare areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow. Fast. And as wegrow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s ourpossible failure to retain and practise our technology.An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of“unworkability”. They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or notdone.If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all therest.We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to do forlack of something better.The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and yourown destiny for the next endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now withand in Scientology.This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we maynever again have another chance.Remember, this is a our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of thepast. Don’t muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine andTen.Do them and we’ll win.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1965, 1970by L.

The pressureexerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered byjust not delivering.The correct way to speed up a student’s progress is by using 2 way comm and applyingthe study materials to students.The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going onto the next and repairing them when they do not.The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirelyanswered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materialsand actions.Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to anyrecovery.The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs. When theproduct vanishes, so does the org. The orgs must survive for the sake of this planet.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1970by L.

Not to find something that will get futureTA. But just to get TA NOW.Many auditors are still measuring their successes by things found or accomplished in thesession. Though this is important too (mainly at Level IV), it is secondary to Tone Arm Action.l. Get good Tone Arm Action.2. Get things done in the session to increase Tone Arm Action.NEW DATA ON THE E-METERThe most elementary error in trying to get Tone Arm action is, of course, found under thefundamentals of auditing—reading an E-Meter.This point is so easily skipped over and seems so obvious that auditors routinely miss it.Until they understand this one point, an auditor will continue to get minimal TA and be contentwith 15 Divisions down per session—which in my book isn’t TA but a meter stuck most of thesession.There is something to know about meter reading and getting TA. Until this is knownnothing else can be known.TONE ARM ASSESSMENTThe Tone Arm provides assessment actions. Like the needle reacts on list items, so doesthe Tone Arm react on things that will give TA.You don’t usually needle assess in doing Levels I, II and III. You Tone Arm Assess.The Rule is: THAT WHICH MOVES THE TONE ARM DOWN WILL GIVE TONEARM ACTION.Conversely, another rule: THAT WHICH MOVES ONLY THE NEEDLE SELDOMGIVES GOOD TA.So for Levels I, II and III (and not LEVEL IV) you can actually paste a paper over theneedle dial, leaving only the bottom of the needle shaft visible so the TA can be set by it and doall assessments needed with the Tone Arm. If the TA moves on a subject then that subject willproduce TA if the pc is permitted to talk about it (Itsa it).Almost all auditors, when the Itsa Line first came out, tried only to find FUTURE TAACTION and never took any PRESENT TA ACTION. The result was continuous listing ofproblems and needle nulling in an endless search to find something that “would produce TAaction”. They looked frantically all around to find some subject that would produce TA action"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"and never looked at the Tone Arm of their meter or tried to find what was moving it NOW.This seems almost a foolish thing to stress—that what is producing TA will produce TA.But it is the first lesson to learn. And it takes a lot of learning.Auditors also went frantic trying to understand what an ITSA LINE was. They thought itwas a Comm Line. Or part of the CCHs or almost anything but what it is. It is too simple.There are two things of great importance in an auditing cycle. One is the Whatsit, theother is the Itsa. Confuse them and you get no TA.If the auditor puts in the Itsa and the preclear the Whatsit, the result is no TA. The auditorputs in the Whatsit and the pc the Itsa, always. It is so easy to reverse the role in auditing thatmost auditors do it at first. The preclear is very willing to talk about his difficulties, problemsand confusions. The auditor is so willing to Itsa (discover) what is troubling the preclear that anauditor, green in this, will then work, work, work to try to Itsa something “that will give the pcTA”, that he causes the pc to “Whatsit Whatsit Whatsit that’s wrong with me”. Listing is notreally good Itsa-ing; it’s Whatsit-ing as the pc is in the mood “Is it this? Is it that?” even when“solutions” are being listed for assessment. The result is poor TA.TA comes from the pc saying, “It IS” not “Is it?”Examples of Whatsit and Itsa: Auditor: “What’s here?” (Whatsit) Pc: “An auditor, apreclear, a meter.” (Itsa)Itsa really isn’t even a Comm Line. It’s what travels on a Comm Line from the pc to theauditor, if that which travels is saying with certainty “It IS”.I can sit down with a pc and meter, put in about three minutes “assessing” by Tone ArmAction and using only R1C get 35 Divisions of TA in 2% hours with no more work thanwriting down TA reads and my auditor’s report. Why? Because the pc is not being stoppedfrom Itsa-ing and because I don’t lead the pc into Whatsit-ing. And also because I don’t thinkauditing is complicated.Tone Arm Action has to have been prevented if it didn’t occur. Example: An auditor,noting a Whatsit moved the TA, every time, promptly changed the Whatsit to a differentWhatsit. Actually happened. Yet in being asked what he was doing in session said: “I ask thepc for a problem he has had and every time he comes up with one I ask for solutions to it.” Hedidn’t add that he frantically changed the Whatsit each time the TA started to move. Result—9Divisions of TA in 21/2 hours, pc laden with by-passed charge. If he had only done what hesaid he had he would have had TA.If it didn’t occur, Tone Arm Action has to have been prevented! It doesn’t just “notoccur”.In confirmation of auditors being too anxious to get in the Itsa Line themselves and not letthe pc is the fad of using the meter as a Ouija Board. The auditor asks it questions continuallyand never asks the pc. Up the spout go Divisions of TA. “Is this Item a terminal?” the auditorasks the meter. Why not ask the pc? If you ask the pc, you get an Itsa, “No, I think it’s anoppterm because .....” and the TA moves.Now to give you some idea of how crazy simple it is to get in an Itsa Line on the pc, trythis:Start the session and just sit back and look at the pc. Don’t say anything. Just sit therelooking at the pc. The pc will of course start talking. And if you just nod now and then andkeep your auditor’s report going unobtrusively so as not to cut the Itsa, you’ll have a talking pcand most of the time good TA. At the end of 21/2 hours, end the session. Add up the TA"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"you’ve gotten and you will usually find that it was far more than in previous sessions.TA action, if absent, had to be prevented! It doesn’t just fail to occur.But this is not just a stunt. It is a vital and valuable rule in getting TA.RULE: A SILENT AUDITOR INVITES ITSA.This is not all good, however. In doing R4 work or R3R or R4N the silent auditor letsthe pc Itsa all over the whole track and causes Over-Restimulation which locks up the TA. Butin lower levels of auditing, inviting an Itsa with silence is an ordinary action.In Scientology Levels I, II and III the auditor is usually silent much longer,proportionally, in the session, than he or she is talking—about 100 of silence to 1 of talking.As soon as you get into Level IV auditing however, on the pc’s actual GPMs, the auditor has tobe crisp and busy to get TA and a silent, idle auditor can mess up the pc and get very little TA.This is all under “controlling the pc’s attention”. Each level of auditing controls the pc’sattention a little more than the last and the leap from Level III to IV is huge.Level I hardly controls at all. The rule above about the silent auditor is employed to thefull.Level II takes the pc’s life and livingness goals (or session goals) for the pc to Itsa andlets the pc roll, the auditor intruding only to keep the pc giving solutions, attempts, dones,decisions about his life and livingness or session goals rather than difficulties, problems andnatter about them.Level III adds the rapid search (by TA assessment) for the service facsimile (maybe 20minutes out of 2l/2 hours) and then guides the preclear into it with R3SC processes. The rulehere is that if the thing found that moved the TA wouldn’t make others wrong but would makethe pc wrong, then it is an oppterm lock and one Prepchecks it. (The two top RIs of the pc’sPT GPM is the service facsimile. One is a terminal, the pc’s, and the other is an oppterm. Theyeach have thousands of lock RIs. Any pair of lock RIs counts as a service facsimile, givingTA.) A good slow Prepcheck but still a Prepcheck. Whether running Right-Wrong-Dominate-Survive, (R3SC) or Prepchecking (the only 2 processes used) one lets the pc really answerbefore acking. One question may get 50 answers! Which is One Whatsit from the auditor gets50 Itsas from the pc.Level IV auditing finds the auditor smoothly letting the pc Itsa RIs and lists but theauditor going at it like a small steam engine finding RIs, RIs, RIs, Goals, RIs, RIs, RIs. Forthe total TA in an R4 session only is proportional to the number of RIs found without goofs,wrong goals or other errors which rob TA action.So the higher the level the more control of the pc’s attention. But in the lower levels, asyou go back down, the processes used require less and less control, less auditor action to getTA. The Level is designed to give TA at that level of control. And if the auditor actions getbusier than called for in the lower levels the TA is cut down per session.OVER-RESTIMULATIONAs will be found in another HCO Bulletin and in the lectures of summer and autumn of1963, the thing that seizes a TA up is Over-Restimulation. THE RULE IS: THE LESSACTIVE THE TA THE MORE OVER-RESTIMULATION IS PRESENT. (THOUGHRESTIMULATION CAN ALSO BE ABSENT.)Therefore an auditor auditing a pc whose TA action is low (below 20 TA Divisions downfor a 2l/2 hour session) must be careful not to over-restimulate the pc (or to gently restimulate"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"the pc). This is true of all levels. At Level IV this becomes: don’t find that next goal, bleed theGPM you’re working of all possible charge. And at Level III this becomes: don’t find toomany new Service Facs before you’ve bled the TA out of what you already have. And at LevelII this becomes: don’t fool about with a new illness until the pc feels the Lumbosis you startedon is handled utterly. And at Level I this becomes: “Let the pc do the talking”.Over-Restimulation is the auditor’s most serious problem.Under-Restimulation is just an auditor not putting the pc’s attention on anything.The sources of Restimulation are:1. Life and Livingness Environment. This is the workaday world of the pc. The auditorhandles this with Itsa or “Since Big Mid Ruds’ and even by regulating or changing some of thepc’s life by just telling the pc to not do this or that during an intensive or even making the pcchange residence for a while if that’s a source. This is subdivided into Past and Present.2. The Session and its Environment. This is handled by Itsa-ing the subject of sessionenvironments and other ways. This is subdivided into Past and Present.3. The Subject Matter of Scientology. This is done by assessing (by TA motion) the oldScientology List One and then Itsa-ing or Prepchecking what’s found.4. The Auditor. This is handled by What would you be willing to tell me, Who would yoube willing to talk to. And other such things for the pc to Itsa. This is subdivided into Past andPresent.5. This Lifetime. This is handled by slow assessments and lots of Itsa on what’s foundwhenever it is found to be moving the TA during slow assessment. (You don’t null a list orclaw through ten hours of listing and nulling to find something to Itsa at Levels I to III. Yousee what moves the TA and bleed it of Itsa right now. )6. Pc’s Case. In Levels I to III this is only indirectly attacked as above.And in addition to the actions above, you can handle each one of these or what’s foundwith a slow Prepcheck.LIST FOR ASSESSMENTAssess for TA motion the following list:The surroundings in which you live.The surroundings you used to live in.Our surroundings here.Past surroundings for auditing or treatment.Things connected with Scientology (Scientology List One).Myself as your auditor.Past auditors or practitioners.Your personal history in this lifetime.Goals you have set for yourself."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Your case.At Level II one gets the pc to simply set Life and Livingness goals and goals for thesession, or takes up these on old report forms and gets the decisions, actions, considerations,etc., on them as the Itsa, cleaning each one fairly well of TA. One usually takes the goal the pcseems most interested in (or has gone into apathy about) as it will be found to produce the mostTA.Whatever you assess by Tone Arm, once you have it, get the TA out of it before you dropit. And don’t cut the Itsa.MEASURE OF AUDITORSThe skill of an auditor is directly measured by the amount of TA he or she can get. Pcsare not more difficult one than another. Any pc can be made to produce TA. But some auditorscut TA more than others.Also, in passing, an auditor can’t falsify TA. It’s written all over the pc after a session.Lots of TA = Bright pc. Small TA = Dull pc.And Body Motion doesn’t count. Extreme Body Motion on some pcs can produce adivision of TA! Some pcs try to squirm their way to clear! A good way to cure a TA consciousbody-moving pc is to say, “I can’t record TA caused while you’re moving.”As you may suspect, the pc’s case doesn’t do a great deal until run on R4 processes. Butdestimulation of the case can produce some astonishing changes in beingness. Key-out is theprincipal function of Levels I to III. But charge off a case is charge off. Unless destimulated acase can’t get a rocket read or present the auditor with a valid goal. Levels I to III produce aBook One clear. Level R4 produces an O.T. But case conditioning (clearing) is necessarybefore R4 can be run. And an auditor who can’t handle Levels I to III surely won’t be able tohandle the one-man band processes at Level IV. So get good on Levels I to III before you evenstudy IV.THE FIRST THING TO LEARNBy slow assessment is meant letting the pc Itsa while assessing. This consists of rapidauditor action, very crisp, to get something that moves the TA and then immediate shift intoletting the pc Itsa during which be quiet! The slowness is overall action. It takes hours andhours to do an old preclear assessment form this way but the TA flies.The actual auditing in Level III looks like this—auditor going like mad over a list or formwith an eye cocked on the TA. The first movement of the TA (not caused by body motion) theauditor goes a tiny bit further if that and then sits back and just looks at the pc. The pc comesout of it, sees the auditor waiting and starts talking. The auditor unobtrusively records the TA,sometimes nods. TA action dies down in a couple minutes or an hour. As soon as the TA lookslike it hasn’t got much more action in it the auditor sits up, lets the pc finish what he or she wassaying and then gets busy busy again. But no action taken by the auditor cuts into the TAaction. In Levels I to III no assessment list is continued beyond seeing a TA move until that TAmotion is handled.In doing a Scientology List One assessment one goes down the list until the TA moves(not because of body motion). Then, because a TA is not very pinpointed, the auditor coversthe one or two above where he first saw TA and, watching the pc for interest and the TA,circles around that area until he is sure he has what made the TA move and then bleeds that forTA. by Itsa or Prepcheck.Yes, you say, but doesn’t the auditor do TRs on the pc? One question—one answer ratio?NO!"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Let the pc finish what the pc was saying. And let the pc be satisfied the pc has said itwithout a lot of chatter about it.TA NOT MOVING SIGNALS AUDITOR TO ACT.TA MOVING SIGNALS AUDITOR NOT TO ACT.Only the auditor can kill the TA motion. So when the TA starts to move, stop acting andstart listening. When the TA stops moving or seems about to, stop listening and start actingagain.Only act when the TA is relatively motionless. And then act just enough to start it again.Now if you can learn just this, as given here, to act when there’s no TA and not act whenthere is TA, you can make your own start on getting good TA on your preclear.With this you buy leisure to look over what’s happening. With half a hundred rules andyour own confusion to worry about also, you’ll never get a beginning. So, to begin to get TAon your pc, first learn the trick of silent invitation. Just start the session and sit thereexpectantly. You’ll get some TA.When you’ve mastered this (and what a fight it is not to act, act, act and talk ten times ashard as the pc) then move to the next step.Cover the primary sources of over-restimulation listed above by asking for solutions tothem.Learn to spot TA action when it occurs and note what the pc was saying just then. Co-ordinate these two facts—pc talking about something and TA moving. That’s AssessmentLevels I to III. Just that. You see the TA move and relate it to what the pc is saying just thatmoment. Now you know that if the pc talks about “Bugs” he gets TA action. Note that downon your report. BUT don’t otherwise call it to pc’s attention as pc is already getting TA onanother subject. This pc also gets TA on Bugs. Store up 5 or ten of these odd bits, withoutdoing anything to the pc but letting him talk about things.Now a few sessions later, the pc will have told all concerning the prime source of over-restimulation I hope you were covering with him or her by only getting the pc started when heor she ran down. But you will now have a list of several other things that get TA. THEHOTTEST TA PRODUCER ON THIS LIST WILL GET A PC’S GOAL AS IT IS HISSERVICE FAC. You can now get TA on this pc at will. All you have to do is get an Itsa goingon one of these things.ANY TA is the sole target of Levels I to III. It doesn’t matter a continental what generatesit. Only Level IV (R4 processes) are vital on what you get TA on (for if you’re not accurate youwill get no TA at Level IV).From Levels I to III the pc’s happiness or recovery depends only on that waving TAArm. How much does it wave? That’s how much the case advances. Only at Level IV do youcare what it waves on.You’re as good an auditor in Levels I to III as you can get TA on the pc and that’s all.And in Level IV you’ll get only as much TA as you’re dead on with the right goals and RIs inthe right places and those you don’t want lying there inert and undisturbed.Your enemy is Over-Restimulation of the pc. As soon as the pc goes into more chargethan he or she can Itsa easily the TA slows down! And as soon as the pc drowns in the over-restimulation the TA stops clank! Now your problem is correcting the case. And that’s harderthan just getting TA in the first place."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Yes, you say, but how do you start “getting in an Itsa Line?” “What is an Itsa?”All right—small child comes in room. You say, “What’s troubling you?” The child says,“I’m worried about Mummy and I can’t get Daddy to talk to me and ....” NO TA.This child is not saying anything is it. This child is saying, “Confusion, chaos, worry.”No TA. The child is speaking in Oppterms.Small child comes in room. You say, “What’s in this room?” Child says, “You and couchand rug ....” That’s Itsa. That’s TA.Only in R4 where you’re dead on the pc’s GPMs and the pc is allowed to say it is or isn’tcan you get TA good action out of listing and nulling. And even then a failure to let the pc say itis it can cut the TA down enormously.Auditor says, “You’ve been getting TA movement whenever you mention houses.In this lifetime what solutions have you had about houses?” And there’s the next twosessions all laid out with plenty of TA and nothing to do but record it and nod now and then.THE THEORY OF TONE ARM ACTIONTA motion is caused by the energy contained in confusions blowing off the case. Theconfusion is held in place by aberrated stable data.The aberrated (non-factual) stable datum is there to hold back a confusion but in actualfact the confusion gathered there only because of an aberrated consideration or postulate in thefirst place. So when you get the pc to as-is these aberrated stable data, the confusion blows offand you get TA.So long as the aberrated stable datum is in place the confusion (and its energy) won’tflow.Ask for confusions (worries, problems, difficulties) and you just over-restimulate the pcbecause his attention is on the mass of energy, not the aberrated stable datum holding it inplace. Ask for the aberrated stable datum (considerations, postulates, even attempts or actions orany button) and the pc as-ises it, the confusion starts flowing off as energy (not as confusion),and you get TA.Just restimulate old confusions without touching the actual stable data holding them backand the pc gets the mass but no release of it and so no TA.The pc has to say, “It’s a “ (some consideration or postulate) to release the pent-up energyheld back by it.Thus an auditor’s worst fault that prevents TA is permitting the dwelling on confusionswithout getting the pc to give up with certainty the considerations and postulates that hold theconfusions in place.And that’s “Itsa”. It’s letting the pc say what’s there that was put there to hold back aconfusion or problem.If the pc is unwilling to talk to the auditor, that’s What to Itsa—”decisions you’ve madeabout auditors” for one example.

He would have tobe run at Sens 3-32 two cans to keep him on a dial or detect F/Ns.This is a very important matter as the auditor will miss F/Ns, think beginning F/Ns arereads and as the Pre-OT is off the dial, miss reads.Thus uncharged areas are run and charged ones are missed.The result is very chaotic to repair.Some lower level pcs also have a need for lower Sensitivity settings.SUMMARYSometimes an easy pc looks very difficult just because of wrong Sensitivity settings."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"Set the Sensitivity for the pc for a half dial F/N maximum or minimum.Don’t get repairs.Get wins.LRH:ntm.rdL.

It shows in Dianetics that basic on that chain and flow has beenerased, and in Scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run. A new flowor a new process can be embarked upon, of course, when the END PHENOMENA of theprevious process is attained.DIANETICSFloating needles are only ONE FOURTH OF THE END PHENOMENA in all Dianeticauditing.Any Dianetic auditing below Power has FOUR DEFINITE REACTIONS IN THE PCWHICH SHOW THE PROCESS IS ENDED.1. Floating needle.2. Cognition.3. Very good indicators (pc happy).4. Erasure of the final picture audited.Auditors get panicky about overrun. If you go past the End Phenomena the F/N will packup (cease) and the TA will rise.BUT that’s if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena, not past a floating needle.If you watch a needle with care and say nothing but your R3R commands, as it begins tofloat you will find:1. It starts to float narrowly.2. The pc cognites (What do you know—so that’s . . .) and the float widens.3. Very good indicators come in. And the float gets almost full dial, and4. The picture, if you inquired, has erased and the needle goes full dial.That is the full End Phenomena of Dianetics.If the auditor sees a float start, as in 1, and says, “I would like to indicate to you your"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"needle is floating,” he can upset the pc’s bank.There is still charge. The pc has not been permitted to cognite. VGIs surely won’t appearand a piece of the picture is left.By being impetuous and fearful of overrun, or just being in a hurry, the auditor’spremature (too soon) indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pc’s end phenomena.SCIENTOLOGYAll this also applies to Scientology auditing.And all Scientology processes below Power have the same end phenomena.The 0 to IV Scientology End Phenomena are:A. Floating needle.B. Cognition.C. Very good indicators.D. Release.The pc goes through these four steps without fail IF PERMITTED TO DO SO.As Scientology auditing is more delicate than Dianetic auditing, an overrun (F/N vanishedand TA rising, requiring “rehab”) can occur more rapidly. Thus the auditor has to be morealert. But this is no excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena.The same cycle of F/N will occur if the pc is given a chance. On A you get a beginningF/N, on B slightly wider, on C wider still and on D the needle really is floating and widely.“I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating” can be a chop. Also it’s a falsereport if it isn’t widely floating and will keep floating.Pcs who leave session F/N and arrive at Examiner without F/N, or who eventually do notcome to session with an F/N have been misaudited. The least visible way is the F/N chop, asdescribed in this session. The most obvious way is to overrun the process. (Running a pc afterhe has exteriorized will also give a high TA at Examiner.)In Dianetics, one more pass through is often required to get 1, 2, 3, 4 End Phenomenaabove.I know it said in the Auditor’s Code not to by-pass an F/N. Perhaps it should be changedto read “A real wide F/N”. Here it’s a question of how wide is an F/N? However, the problemis NOT difficult.I follow this rule—I never jolt or interrupt a pc who is still looking inward. In otherwords, I don’t ever yank his attention over to the auditor. After all, it’s his case we arehandling, not my actions as an auditor.When I see an F/N begin I listen for the pc’s cognition. If it isn’t there, I give the nextcommand due. If it still isn’t there, I give the 2nd command, etc. Then I get the cognition andshut up. The needle floats more widely, VGIs come in, the F/N goes dial wide. The real skill isinvolved in knowing when to say nothing more.Then with the pc all bright, all end phenomena in sight (F/N, Cog, VGIs, Erasure orRelease, depending on whether it’s Dn or Scn), I say, as though agreeing with the pc, “Yourneedle is floating.”"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"DIANETIC ODDITYDid you know that you could go through a picture half a dozen times, the F/N gettingwider and wider without the pc cogniting? This is rare but it can happen once in a hundred. Thepicture hasn’t been erased yet. Bits of it seem to keep popping in. Then it erases fully andwow, 2, 3 and 4 occur. This isn’t grinding. It’s waiting for the F/N to broaden to cognition.The pc who complains about F/Ns is really stating the wrong problem. The actualproblem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and themeter a moment too soon.The pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward.Charge is then left in the area. A pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often willbegin to refuse auditing.Despite all this, one still must not overrun and get the TA up. But in Dianetics an erasureleaves nothing to get the TA up with!The Scientology auditor has a harder problem with this, as he can overrun more easily.There is a chance of pulling the bank back in. So the problem is more applicable to Scientologyas a problem than to Dianetics.But ALL auditors must realize that the END PHENOMENA of successful auditing is notjust an F/N but has 3 more requisites. And an auditor can chop these off.The mark of the real VIRTUOSO (master) in auditing is his skilled handling of thefloating needle.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH.jz.ei.rdCopyright © 1970by L.

As onehas DONE the lists without F/Ning each item, one now has the mystery of what is wrong?The error is reading items from Ruds or prepared lists cleaned to no read but not carriedto F/N.This action (amongst many such refinements) is what makes Flag auditing so smooth andindeed makes it Flag Auditing.When an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible.Yet it is simplicity itself. If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find anearlier item if something does not release. What has been found as a read on a prepared listwould F/N if it were the basic lock. So if it doesn’t F/N, then there is an earlier (or an earlier oran earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/Ning.So the RULE:NEVER WALK OFF FROM A READING ITEM ON A RUDIMENT OR APREPARED REPAIR LIST BEFORE YOU CARRY IT DOWN (EARLIER SIMILAR) TOAN F/N.Example: ARC Brk reads. Pc says what it is, Auditor does ARCU CDEI. If no F/N,Auditor asks for an earlier similar ARC Brk, gets it, ARCU CDEI, etc until he gets an F/N.Example: PTP reads. Carry it E/S (earlier similar) until a PTP F/Ns.Example: L4B: Has an item been denied you? Reads. Answered. No F/N. Is there anearlier similar denied item? Answered. F/N. Go on to next reading item on the list.Example: GF assessed once through for reads. The next C/S must take every item on itthat read, by 2wc or other process, to an F/N.So there is a much more general rule:EVERY ITEM THAT READS MUST F/N.In Dianetics you get the F/N when you run E/S secondaries or engrams to an erasure,F/N, Cog, VGIs."},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"In Rudiments, every out rud you get a read on is run E/S to F/N.On a prepared list you take each read to an F/N or E/S to F/N.On an LX list you run each flow chain to an F/N.On GF you get by whatever process an F/N.On Listing by the Laws of Listing and Nulling, your eventual item listed must F/N.So another rule:EVERY MAJOR AND MINOR ACTION MUST BE CARRIED TO AN F/N.There are NO exceptions.Any exception leaves by-passed charge on the pc.Also, every F/N is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained.You take too soon an F/N (first twitch) you cut the cognition and leave by-passed charge(a withheld cognition).I could take any folder and simply write out the ruds and prepared list reading items andthen audit the pc and carry each one to F/N and correct every list so disclosed and wind up witha very shining, cool calm pc.So “Have reading items been left charged?” would be a key question on a case.Using lists or ruds on high or low TAs that are not meant for high or low TAs will getyou reading items that won’t F/N.So, another rule:NEVER TRY TO FLY RUDS OR DO LIB ON A HIGH OR LOW TA.One can talk the TA down (see HCO B on Talking the TA Down).Or one can assess L4B.About the only prepared lists one can assess are the new Hi-Lo TA HCO B 13 Mar 71and possibly a GF+40 once through for biggest read. The biggest read will have a blowdownon it and can possibly be brought to F/N. If this occurs then one also handles all other itemsthat read.The most frequent errors in all this are:Not taking a read earlier similar but just checking it and leaving it as “clean”.Not using suppress and false on items.And of course leaving a pc thinking things are still charged by failing to indicate the F/N.Indicating an F/N before Cog.Not going back through the folder to handle ruds and items that read but were called“clean” or were simply abandoned."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"A pc audited under tension of poor TRs has a hard time and does not F/N sometimes,inviting overrun.The rules then to happy pcs are:GOOD TRs.F/N EVERYTHING FOUND ON RUDS AND LISTS.AUDIT WITH TA IN NORMAL RANGE OR REPAIR IT SO IT IS IN NORMALRANGE.L.

Misapplication of this definition can result in underrunand overrun processes or actions and the pc snarled up with BPC.TYPES OF EPsIn Power Processing the auditor waits for a specific EP and does not indicate an F/Nuntil he has gotten the specific EP for the process. To miss on this in Power is disastrous, thusPower auditors are drilled and drilled on the handling of Power EPs.In Dianetics, the EP of a chain is erasure, accompanied by an F/N, cognition and goodindicators. You wouldn’t necessarily expect rave indicators on a pc in the middle of an assist,under emotional or physical stress until the full assist was completed though. What you wouldexpect is the chain blown with an F/N. Those two things themselves are good indicators. Thecognition could simply be “the chain blew”.In Scientology, End Phenomena vary with what you’re auditing. An ARC Broken pc onan L-1C will peel off charge and come uptone gradually as each reading line is handled.Sometimes it comes in a spectacular huge cog and VVGIs and dial F/N, but that’s usually aftercharge has been taken off on a gradient. What’s expected is an F/N as that charge beinghandled moves off.In Ruds it’s the same idea. When you’ve got your F/N and that charge has moved off,indicate it. Don’t push the pc on and on for some “EP”. You’ve got it.Now a major grade process will run to F/N, Cog, VGIs and release. You’ll have anability regained. But that’s a grade process on a set up flying pc.F/N ABUSEMistakenly applying the Power EP rule to Ruds will have the pc messed up by overrun. Itinvalidates the pc’s wins and keys the charge back in. The pc will start thinking he hasn’tblown the charge and can’t do anything about it.In 1970 I had to write the HCO B “F/Ns and End Phenomena” to cure auditors ofchopping pc EPs on major actions by indicating F/Ns too soon. This is one type of F/N abusewhich has largely been handled.That bulletin and Power EP handling have been in some instances misapplied in thedirection of overrun. “The pc isn’t getting EP on these chains as there’s no cognition, just ‘it"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"erased’,” is one example. Obviously the C/S didn’t understand the definition of cognition orwhat an EP is. Another example is the pc spots what it is and F/Ns and the auditor carries on,expecting an “EP”.OTs and EPsAn OT is particularly subject to F/N abuse as he can blow things quite rapidly. If theauditor misses the F/N due to too high a sensitivity setting or doesn’t call it as he’s waiting foran “EP”, overrun occurs. It invalidates an OT’s ability to as-is and causes severe upsets.This error can also stem from auditor speed. The auditor, used to auditing lower level pcsor never trained to audit OTs, can’t keep up with the OT and misses his F/Ns or reads.Thus overruns occur and charged areas are bypassed.This could account for those cases who were flying then fell on their heads with the sameproblems that blew back again.REMEDYThe remedy of this problem begins with thoroughly clearing all terms connected withEPs. This is basically Word Clearing Method 6, Key Words.The next action is to get my HCO Bs on the subject of EPs and also related meteringHCO Bs fully understood and starrated. This would be followed by clay demos of various EPsof processes and actions showing the mechanics of the bank and what happens with the pc andmeter.TRs and meter drills on spotting F/Ns would follow, including any needed obnosis drillsand correction of meter position so that the auditor could see the pc, meter and his admin at aglance.Then, the auditor would be gradiently drilled on handling the pc, meter and admin atincreasing rates of speed including recognizing and indicating EPs when they occurred. Whenthe auditor could do all of this smoothly at the high rate of speed of an OT blowing things byinspection without fumbling, the last action would be bullbaited drills like TRs 103 and 104, ona gradient to a level of competence whereby the auditor could handle anything that came up atspeed and do so smoothly.Then you’d really have an OT auditor. And that’s what you’ll have to do to make them.SUMMARYOverrun and underrun alike mess up cases.Both stem from an auditor inability to recognize and handle different types of EPs andinexpertness in handling the tools of auditing at speed.Don’t overrun pcs and have to repair them.Let the pc have his wins.LRH:ams.rd L.

Coachanswers but now and then makes startling comments from a prepared list given by Supervisor.Student must handle originations to satisfaction of coach.POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other at a comfortable distance apart.TRAINING STRESS: The student is taught to hear origination and do three things. 1.Understand it; 2. Acknowledge it; and 3. Return preclear to session. If the coach feelsabruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he corrects the student intobetter handling.PATTER: All originations concern the coach, his ideas, reactions or difficulties, none concernthe auditor. Otherwise the patter is the same as in earlier TRs. The student’s patter is governedby: 1 . Clarifying and understanding the origin. 2. Acknowledging the origin. 3. Giving therepeat statement “I’ll repeat the auditing command,” and then giving it. Anything else is aflunk.The auditor must be taught to prevent ARC breaks and differentiate between a vital problem thatconcerns the pc and a mere effort to blow session. (TR 3 Revised.) Flunks are given if thestudent does more than 1. Understand; 2. Acknowledge; 3. Return pc to session.Coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on TR 3. Student’s failure to differentiatebetween these (by trying to handle them) and coach’s remarks about self as “pc” is a flunk.Student’s failure to persist is always a flunk in any TR but here more so. Coach should notalways read from list to originate, and not always look at student when about to comment. ByOriginate is meant a statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case. ByComment is meant a statement or remark aimed only at student or room. Originations arehandled, Comments are disregarded by the student.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to teach auditors to stayin session when preclear dives out. Revised by L. Ron Hubbard in 1961 to teach an auditormore about handling origins and preventing ARC breaks.As TR 5 is also part of the CCHs it can be disregarded in the Comm Course TRs despite itsappearance on earlier lists for students and staff auditors.TRAINING NOTEIt is better to go through these TRs several times getting tougher each time than to hang on oneTR forever or to be so tough at start student goes into a decline.L.

Coach with a purpose.(a) Have for your goal when you are coaching that the student is going to get thetraining drill correct; be purposeful in working toward obtaining this goal.Whenever you correct the student as a coach just don’t do it with no reason,with no purpose. Have the purpose in mind for the student to get a betterunderstanding of the training drill and to do it to the best of his ability.2. Coach with reality.(a) Be realistic in your coaching. When you give an origination to a student reallymake it an origination, not just something that the sheet said you should say;so that it is as if the student was having to handle it exactly as you say underreal conditions and circumstances. This does not mean, however, that youreally feel the things that you are giving the student, such as saying to him,“My leg hurts.” This does not mean that your leg should hurt, but you shouldsay it in such a manner as to convey to the student that your leg hurts. Anotherthing about this is do not use any experiences from your past to coach with.Be inventive in present time.3. Coach with an intention.(a) Behind all your coaching should be your intention that by the end of thesession your student will be aware that he is doing better at the end of it thanhe did at the beginning. The student must have a feeling that he hasaccomplished something in the training step, no matter how small it is. It isyour intention and always should be while coaching that the student you arecoaching be a more able person and have a greater understanding of that onwhich he is being coached.4. In coaching take up only one thing at a time.(a) For example: Using TR 4, if the student arrives at the goal set up for TR 4then check over, one at a time, the earlier TRs. Is he confronting you? Doeshe originate the question to you each time as his own and did he really intendfor you to receive it? Are his acknowledgements ending the cycles ofcommunication, etc. But only coach these things one at a time; never two ormore at a time. Make sure that the student does each thing you coach him oncorrectly before going on to the next training step. The better a student gets ata particular drill or a particular part of a drill you should demand, as a coach, ahigher standard of ability. This does not mean that you should be “neversatisfied”. It does mean that a person can always get better and once you havereached a certain plateau of ability then work toward a new plateau."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"As a coach you should always work in the direction of better and more precise coaching.Never allow yourself to do a sloppy job of coaching because you would be doing your studenta disservice and we doubt that you would like the same disservice. If you are ever in doubtabout the correctness of what he is doing or of what you are doing, then the best thing is to askthe supervisor. He will be very glad to assist you by referring you to the correct materials.In coaching never give an opinion, as such, but always give your directions as a directstatement, rather than saying “I think” or “Well, maybe it might be this way,” etc.As a coach you are primarily responsible for the session and the results that are obtainedon the student. This does not mean, of course, that you are totally responsible but that you dohave a responsibility toward the student and the session. Make sure you always run goodcontrol on the student and give him good directions.Once in a while the student will start to rationalise and justify what he is doing if he isdoing something wrong. He will give you reasons why and becauses. Talking about suchthings at great length does not accomplish very much. The only thing that does accomplish thegoals of the TR and resolves any differences is doing the training drill. You will get further bydoing it than by talking about it.In the training drills the coach should coach with the material given under “TrainingStress” and “Purpose” on the training sheet.These training drills occasionally have a tendency to upset the student. There is apossibility that during a drill a student may become angry or extremely upset or experiencesome misemotion. Should this occur the coach must not “back off”. He should continue thetraining drill until he can do it without stress or duress and he feels “good about it”. So, don’t“back off” but push the student through whatever difficulty he may be having.There is a small thing that most people forget to do and that is telling the student when hehas gotten the drill right or he has done a good job on a particular step. Besides correctingwrongnesses there is also complimenting rightness.You very definitely “flunk” the student for anything that amounts to “self-coaching”. Thereason for this is that the student will tend to introvert and will look too much at how he isdoing and what he is doing rather than just doing it.As a coach keep your attention on the student and how he is doing and don’t become sointerested in what you yourself are doing that you neglect the student and are unaware of hisability or inability to do the drill correctly. It is easy to become “interesting” to a student; tomake him laugh and act up a bit. But your main job as a coach is to see how good he can get ineach training drill and that is what you should have your attention on; that, and how well he isdoing.To a large degree the progress of the student is determined by the standard of coaching.Being a good coach produces auditors who will in turn produce good results on their preclears.Good results produce better people.

First half of coaching session, thestudent silently steers the coach’s body around the room, not touching the walls, quietlystarting, changing and stopping the coach’s body. When the student has fully mastered non-verbal 8—C, the student may commence verbal 8—C.The commands to be used for 8—C are:“Look at that wall.” “Thank you.”“Walk over to that wall.” “Thank you.”“Touch that wall.” “Thank you.”“Turn around.” “Thank you.”Position: Student and coach walking side by side; student always on coach’s right, exceptwhen turning.Purpose: First part: To accustom student to moving another body than his own without verbalcommunication. Second part: To accustom student to moving another body, by and whilegiving commands, only, and to accustom student to proper commands of 8—C.Training Stress: Complete, crisp precision of movement and commands. Student, as in anyother TR, is flunked for current and preceding TRs. Thus, in this case, the coach flunks thestudent for every hesitation or nervousness in moving body, for every flub of command, forpoor confronting, for bad communication of command, for poor acknowledgement, for poorrepetition of command, and for failing to handle origination by coach. Stress that student learnsto lead slightly in all the motions of walking around the room or across the room. This will befound to have a great deal to do with confronting. In the first part of the session student is notallowed to walk coach into walls, as walls then become automatic stops and the student is thennot stopping the coach’s body but allowing the wall to do it for him.History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Camden, New Jersey in October 1953, modified inJuly 1957 in Washington, D.C., and the commands were modified in HCO Bulletin of 16November 1965, Issue II.Number: TR 7Name: High School Indoc.Commands: Same as 8—C (control) but with student in physical contact with coach. Studentenforcing commands by manual guiding. Coach has only three statements to which studentmust listen: “Start” to begin coaching session, “Flunk” to call attention to student error, and“That’s it” to end the coaching session. No other remarks by the coach are valid on student.Coach tries in all possible ways, verbal, covert and physical, to stop student from runningcontrol on him.

Coach falldown is not allowed.Position: Student and coach ambulant. Student handling coach physically.Purpose: To train student never to be stopped by a person when he gives a command. To trainhim to run fine control in any circumstances. To teach him to handle rebellious people. Tobring about his willingness to handle other people.Training Stress: Stress is on accuracy of student performance and persistence by student. Startgradually to toughen up resistance of student on a gradient. Don’t kill him off all at once.History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, England, in 1956.Number: TR 8Name: Tone 40 on an Object.Commands: “Stand up.” “Thank you.” “Sit down on that chair.” “Thank you.” These are theonly commands used.Position: Student sitting in chair facing chair which has on it an ashtray. Coach sitting in chairfacing chair occupied by student and chair occupied by ashtray.Purpose: To make student clearly achieve Tone 40 commands. To clarify intentions as differentfrom words. To start student on road to handling objects and people with postulates. To obtainobedience not wholly based on spoken commands.Training Stress: TR 8 is begun with student holding the ashtray which he manually makesexecute the commands he gives. Under the heading of training stress is included the variousways and means of getting the student to achieve the goals of this training step. During theearly part of this drill, say in the first coaching session, the student should be coached in thebasic parts of the drill, one at a time. First, locate the space which includes himself and theashtray but not more than that much. Second, have him locate the object in that space. Third,have him command the object in the loudest possible voice he can muster. This is calledshouting. The coach’s patter would run something like this: “Locate the space.” “Locate theobject in that space.” “Command it as loudly as you can.” “Acknowledge it as loudly as youcan.” “Command it as loudly as you can.” “Acknowledge it as loudly as you can.” That wouldcomplete two cycles of action. When shouting is completed, then have student use a normaltone of voice with a lot of coach attention on the student getting the intention into the object.Next, have the student do the drill while using the wrong commands—i.e., saying “Thankyou” while placing in the object the intention to stand up, etc. Next, have the student do thedrill silently, putting the intention in the object without even thinking the words of thecommand or the acknowledgement. The final step in this would be for the coach to say “Start”then anything else he said would not be valid on student with the exception of “Flunk” and“That’s it”. Here, the coach would attempt to distract the student, using any verbal means hecould to knock the student off Tone 40. Physical heckling would not be greater than tapping thestudent on the knee or shoulder to get his attention. When the student can maintain Tone 40 andget a clean intention on the object for each command and for each acknowledgement, the drill isflat.There are other ways to help the student along. The coach occasionally asks, “Are youwilling to be in that ashtray?” When the student has answered, then, “Are you willing for athought to be there instead of you?” Then continue the drill. The answers are not so importanton these two questions as is the fact that the idea is brought to the student’s attention. Anotherquestion the coach asks the student is, “Did you really expect that ashtray to comply with thatcommand?”"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"There is a drill which will greatly increase the student’s reality on what an intention is. Thecoach can use this drill three or four times during the training on Tone 40 on an Object. Asfollows: “Think the thought—I am a wild flower.” “Good.” “Think the thought that you aresitting in a chair.” “Good.” “Imagine that thought being in that ashtray.” “Good.” “Imagine thatashtray containing that thought in its substance.” “Good.” “Now get the ashtray thinking that itis an ashtray.” “Good.” “Get the ashtray intending to go on being an ashtray.” “Good.” “Getthe ashtray intending to remain where it is.” “Good.” “Have the ashtray end that cycle.”“Good.” “Put in the ashtray the intention to remain where it is.” “Good.” This also helps thestudent get a reality on placing an intention in something apart from himself. Stress that anintention has nothing to do with words and has nothing to do with the voice, nor is it dependentupon thinking certain words. An intention must be clear and have no counter-intention in it.This training drill, Tone 40 on an Object, usually takes the most time of any drill in UpperIndoc, and time on it is well spent. Objects to be used are ashtrays, preferably heavy, colouredglass ashtrays.History: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., in 1957 to train students to useintention when auditing.Number: TR 9Name: Tone 40 on a Person.Commands: Same as 8—C (Control). Student runs fine, clear-cut intention and verbal orderson coach. Coach tries to break down Tone 40 of student. Coach commands that are valid are:“Start” to begin, “Flunk” to call attention to student error and that they must return to beginningof cycle, and “That’s it” to take a break or to end the training session. No other statement bycoach is valid on student and is only an effort to make student come off Tone 40 or in generalbe stopped.Position: Student and coach ambulant. Student in manual contact with coach as needed.Purpose: To make student able to maintain Tone 40 under any stress or duress.Training Stress: The exact amount of physical effort must be used by student plus acompelling, unspoken intention. No jerky struggles are allowed, since each jerk is a stop.Student must learn to smoothly increase effort quickly to amount needed to make coachexecute. Stress is on exact intention, exact strength needed, exact force necessary, exact Tone40. Even a slight smile by student can be a flunk. Too much force can be a flunk. Too littleforce definitely is a flunk. Anything not Tone 40 is a flunk. Here the coach should check verycarefully on student’s ability to place an intention in the coach. This can be checked by thecoach since the coach will find himself doing the command almost whether or not he wants to ifthe student is really getting the intention across. After the coach is satisfied with the student’sability to get the intention across, the coach should then do all he can to break the student offTone 40, mainly on the basis of surprise and change of pace. Thus the student will be broughtto have a greater tolerance of surprise and a quick recovery from surprise.History: Developed in Washington, D.C., in 1957 by L. Ron Hubbard.Purpose of these four training drills, TR 6, 7, 8 and 9, is to bring about in the student thewillingness and ability to handle and control other people’s bodies, and to cheerfully confrontanother person while giving that person commands. Also, to maintain a high level of control inany circumstances.LRH:js.cden L. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1968 Founderby L.

You’re very lucky. The 13th fell on Tuesday thisweek, didn’t fall on Friday.All right. Today’s lecture is about cycles of action. Cycles of action. And you’ll find this veryfundamental material. And it’s quite good for man and beast. You can put it in tea or coffee,take it without taste; doesn’t leave any aftereffects in an auditing session, can be rubbed onhorses, dogs, is only sixpence the bottle. And you ought to buy some. I think it’d be a terriblygood idea.It’s not that I am particularly cross on this particular subject of cycles of action. Nobody hasbeen throwing their hands up in horror over the idea of completing one. And it’s a relaxedmoment when it doesn’t happen to be a crisis. So this is one lecture which is given when thereis no crisis to prompt it. That makes it peculiar in the field of lectures.The crisis, by the way, is getting your auditing question answered. And then some of the—some of the wildest goofs I’ve heard in a long time.“Well, how are you today?”“Uh . . . I just got my car back.”“Thank you.”But this, of course, does too apply to some degree to a cycle of action. A cycle of action cannotgo on unless all the elements of the cycle of action being used are common to the cycle ofaction. Do you follow me?In other words, you can’t have a cycle of action that goes from white to black, you see, to grayto black. Do you get the idea? A cycle of action would rather have to go from, let us say, blackto grad to less gray, to less gray, to less gray, to less gray, to more white, to more white, tomore white, to white, don’t you see? Then, possibly, if you wanted a complete cycle of action,less white, less white, less white, less white, slightly gray, grayer, grayer, grayer, black.Now, what do we mean by a cycle of action? This is probably one of the things that would bethe most puzzling word here to collide with: cycle. Because cycle is applied in many differentdirections. There is one you ride. Also, there’s types that have motors in them. There arewheels that go round so that the cycle of a wheel is the point that the point of a wheel returnsto.In other words, you’ve got a wheel and you’ve got a point at the top; the wheel goes all theway around, and when it has returned to the top, why, it has completed a cycle. Do you see?I’m just showing you there’s various confusions about this word. You didn’t laugh at the rightjoke, so that’s all right . . . But the upshot of this cycle of action is that it has many odd andpeculiar connotations and is therefore rather difficult to understand or collide with. You followthat? You could have a wheel that turns all the way around and comes back to the same place,see?"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"Now, a story cycle of action that began in the field of modern story writing, and so on, wouldbe a story something like this (this is a very modern story, you see): And there’s a bumstanding on a corner and he is totally degraded and he has just lost his job, you see? And hiswife that he wasn’t married to has run off with another man, you see? And he’s standing thereand he gets an idea that he might be able to pick himself up out of it and go have a cup ofcoffee, you see?So he goes and has the cup of coffee, and it’s cold and it’s very bad coffee. And he reaches inhis pocket and he finds out there’s a hole in his pocket and the nickel he had, you see, has—lost. And so he is ejected from the place, but not even dramatically. He’s simply told to go withconsiderable contempt, don’t you see?And we find him back on the same corner, in the same position, in the same mood, worryingabout the same thing. That is modern story writing.If anybody wants to steal that plot and sell it with their writing, they’re perfectly welcome to doso.Now, I remember when this modern school first started up. By the wad the modern school hasnow become very antique. It’s so old now that a lot of people have heard about it. When it firststarted up, they had a story, “Big Brother,” and it wasn’t even in English.But they had a tremendous fixation on the idea that a story had to start and end at the same placein the same situation. And they were trying to give an appearance of no change. So that waswhat they understood by a cycle that nothing changed. And you’ll find now and then, you goto some arty movie made by somebody down in France who didn’t have any money and didn’thave any film either. (And frankly, they’d have been much better off if they’d shot it with anempty camera!) But you’ll occasionally see these things; you’ll pick them up at foreign theaterstands, you know, and it’ll be something like this. And it’ll always begin and end at the exactsame place.So cycle has gotten into the field of art. And cycle is in the field of mechanics—as differentfrom engineering—as a completed revolution. Cycle in the field of art, meaning no change oftime, or everything came back the same way, don’t you see? And in mechanics, it is a totalrevolution.Now, in engineering and physics, it means something else again. It means the motion betweenthe ending of one wave and the beginning of the new wave. And I think you’ll find out that thatis probably a better expressed definition than the usual engineering definition, but that is it. Youtake the end of the last wave, which is the beginning of the next wave, and it goes on throughthen to the end of that wave, which is the beginning of the next wave. And that would be acycle.And you have that expressed in radio, you see? Radio. All discussions of wavelengths. Youhave it in discussions of color, and so on. And that’s really what they’re talking about; they’retalking about a sweep.Now, there is an old, old, old, old definition on this which, by the way, we are indebted to inScientology, because there’s a philosophic aspect to the word cycle. And they didn’t directlycall it a cycle, and pardon me if I seem to be a bit lyrical on the subject, but it is in the Hymn tothe Dawn Child, in the unwritten Veda (which has been written and then, therefore, called atype of Veda). But it’s in the oral tradition, you might say (to borrow a musical term), of India.And it’s the Hymn to the Dawn Child. I've forgotten whether it’s the fourth or the tenth Vedichymn. But it expresses that there is a nothingness, and then there is a form gradually takesplace, and then this grows and this ages and then this decays; and then this goes into anebulosity and winds up in a new nothingness. Now, that is not a quote; it’s just an effort tointerpret that particular action for you. It’s a very short hymn, by the way, and it’s quite"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"interesting. And it is really part of your technology in Scientology.You see, there have been billions of statements by philosophers and more of them are wrongthan right, but in sorting out the field of philosophy—this is sometimes what confuses people.I remember explaining Krishnamurti to somebody or other, a very dear old friend, who said,“But—but Krishnamurti said many of the things that you’re saying in Scientology.”I said, “Give me a book by Krishnamurti.”So she handed me a book by Krishnamurti and I went down the line and there, there was oneabout time that was a direct statement, that same statement that we use in Scientology. See, itwas right there, and she showed me that, and she says, “Look it there; Krishnamurti said that.”I said, “Well, where is the bold face?”And she said, “What?”“The bold, the italics, the underscore.”And she said, “Well, there isn’t any.”And I said, “All right. Let’s count the number of statements on this page, also about time,which aren’t true—none of which have any emphasis, any different emphasis than this one.”And we counted them up, and there were 132 incorrect statements about time and one correctstatement about time. So I don’t think Krishnamurti said anything we said.See? And I taught her the lesson of the evaluation of importance: Importance assigned to adatum is as important as the datum. And you’ll find that in our Logic’s. In other words, therecan be many truths.Not comparing poor old Krishnamurti. Krishnamurti is mad at us; by the way, because one ofour boys went out to India one time or another and next confounded thing you know, he had allof Krishnamurti’s group out in India studying Scientology, and I don’t think Krishnamurti hasever forgiven us. But that’s—happens to be the truth.Anyway, you get the evaluation of importance here, see? The evaluation of importance of adatum can be as important as the datum, and sometimes more important.You could have fifty thousand monkeys writing on fifty thousand typewriters for a long time,and sooner or later one of them is going to write E = mc2, see? And then somebody couldcome along and point out, “Look, those monkeys are as smart as Einstein.” No, they couldn’tbe as smart as Einstein, for the excellent reason that when this was written, it was not assigneda relative importance to anything, you see? So its value was not estimated, so therefore itwasn’t peaked up.And although there are a great many truths in Scientology, some of these are peaked, you see?They’re in bold face, you know, and they’ve got big underscores underneath them. Cycle ofaction is one of them. And it goes back to the early Vedic hymns.Now, out of this—out of this we get a great deal of workable, or applied, or applicablewisdom. In other words, we can get very, very full application out of this thing. This thing willwork all day and all night. And the cycle of action is, of course, a plot of incident againsttime—if you wanted to get a definition here—the way we are using it, you see? It’s a plot ofconsecutive incident against time, a plot against time.Now, of course we’re in the advantageous position of knowing the source of time, andknowing what time is. Since we got R6, we have known a lot more things than we knewbefore. And we know that time is a commonly held consideration which is a great, big,"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"cracking, enormous, GPM which has got a lot of root words with an end word connected to itcalled time.Therefore, it’s an agreed-upon progress and we’re all making this time and moving it forward.And as a result, from person to person, although the incidents plot against time, you see, at—Ibetter say, plot against time: at zero seconds, the door is opened, see; at zero plus two seconds,the door stands open; at zero plus three seconds, somebody enters the door; at zero plus fiveseconds, somebody is walking; at zero plus six seconds, somebody sees a chair; at zero plusseven seconds, a motion is made toward the chair; at zero plus eight seconds, the person sitsdown.

You see? Everybody wonders “How do we move along forward intime?” Puzzled me for a long time. Well, of course, it’s very simple to move along forward intime, because nobody is going anyplace, you see? That’s the whole trick back of time, see?But the incident, don’t you see, which is plotted forward appears to be a plot against time.

They just no more than get up in the morning and they go to bed atnight, you know? And it’s just bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz!This is a commonly held consideration. You go around and talk to some of them and they willtell you, “Well, you know, there used to be a lot of time in a day, but there isn’t anymore, youknow?”In other words, the incident, or interest, or future, you see, is gone to lead them forward intime—so therefore, you see, they have no consideration of time. The incident plots very bang!you see? Well, there’s only a couple of things happen in the day, you know?All right. Now, we take a little kid, maybe five, six years old, and the day to him is absolutelyinterminable! Like little Arthur, the other day, was telling me he didn’t have anything to do andthat he wasn’t doing anything. And this was just for fun (I think it was the other evening), Irattled off to him what he was doing, and what had happened in the last five minutes in his life.And he didn’t consider this very much. You see, his tolerance of incident was very high. Buthe sort of laughed about it, and then he still complained that he just didn’t have anything to do;I didn’t make much of an impression on him.But he had run in and out of the room three times, the dog had taken off one of his shoes andhe’d put it back on again, he’d stolen the dog’s bone, the dog had gotten the bone back, he hadfound one of his toys and thrown it down, and then he’d gone in the other room and inspectedhis rocks, and . . . In other words, it was all this incident. My Lord, man, the incident whichhad taken place, you see, in those last few minutes. And he still didn’t think he was doinganything; he was doing nothing, you see?What he meant to say was he was doing nothing in which he was interested in doing, sotherefore time was passing interminably to him. you see, under a very heavy incident impact.You could be more philosophic about it and reduce it down to tolerance of incident—nottolerance of motion but just tolerance of incident. How much incident does somebody want?You find out after the war—World War II, amongst my friends and so forth—I found out thatlife was suddenly moving very slowly for all of them. Life was very dull, see? They couldn’tpick themselves up at all, and so forth. Change of pace was so fantastic, you see? From hurry-scurry, hurry-scurry, bang, thud, crash, bing, gop, bow, dzz, zrrp, woo, bee, theet, tha, outbung, bang, incident, rut, row, boom, bow, crash, all of a sudden, why, they settled down towhat had been, just before the war, a normal existence to them, you see? And this normal"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"existence of just this short span of years, regardless of their own considerations, seemedawfully slow. See, it just seemed like nothing was happening at all.And therefore, what had happened? Well, their tolerance of incident had increased. Eventhough it was bad for them in numerous cases, they still had gotten up to confronting r-r-r-r-r-r-r type of incident, don’t you see? And then all of a sudden, they don’t have that muchincident. So time, oddly enough, started to do funny things for them. It either went terriblyslowly or it went by very rapidly. You see, because if you’d learned to plot your incident andtime together, in other words, if you measured your time by the amount of incident occurring,and then you didn’t have any incident—see, figure it out—why, you obviously wouldn’t haveany time. You follow that?That’s really what happens to old people. They had the house full of people, and they’re thisand that, and their responsibility to so-and-so; and there was Jackie coming back from school,and there was this and that and then the other thing; and all of a sudden, everybody goes offand gets married or does something, and there isn’t enough incident, you see? So therefore theday is going whsht, whsht, whsht, whsht! You got the idea? Amount of incident.You can’t say, you see, that the more incident there is—you see, it doesn’t come down to anengineering proposition of the more incident there is, the more time there is, or the less incidentthere is, the less time there is; nor can you say in reverse, you see, that the more incident thereis, the less time there is. You see, these things don’t add up.Well, why don’t they just exactly add up and equate? Well, you’re dealing with a falsecommodity in the first place, see, so it’s never going to add up. But it’s the consideration of it;it’s a consideration.Now, we did a lot of this with randomity and that sort of thing, but that is not as full anexplanation as I’m giving you here today. But it’s the consideration: Does a lot of incidentmake a lot of time or does a lot of incident make no time?Now, you’re going to have somebody around with a lot of incident happening in his vicinity,and he just suddenly starts saying—like I do occasionally, you know—”There isn’t enoughtime for this incident to happen in,” see? I start getting an emergency on five or six frontssimultaneously while I am doing my research, while somebody is calling on me for a newbulletin, don’t you see? And this is too much incident. So I say, “Well, there isn’t enoughtime.” You got the idea?So I grab myself by the scruff of the neck, you see, and—you could get the consideration youare manufacturing the time. All you have to do is “Well, I could confront being that busy.”That’s all you actually have to do. My consideration for this: “Well, all right. I can dosomething about it,” see? And instantly, you’ve suddenly got enough time! If you say, “No, Ican’t do anything about these incidents because of the time,” of course you haven’t got enoughtime. You got the idea?And you can actually practically monitor the amount of time you had by simply changing anyconsideration you have about how busy you want to be, or how much you can handle.Sometimes you can play tricks on yourself this way, see? You can say, “Well, I wanted to bebusy, busier than I was, and I sure got my wish!” And the next thing you know, why, you’vegot enough time, you see?So it’s the consideration of how much incident makes how much time that gives or subtractstime from one’s existence. And that’s pretty deep and pretty profound, and I’m afraid thatnobody has ever said it before in the field of philosophy, but it’s quite shaking, if you reallytake a look at it. It’s how much you decide you can tolerate, see? How much you decide youcan confront, or whether or not you are deciding the other way to.Now, this is all compounded by, also, the very difficult situation that you can get up to a point"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"of where you can consider time long or short without measuring it against incident. Then, yousee, by gradient, higher tone, you could get up to a point and you say, “Well, this is going tobe a long day,” and it’ll be a long day, see? “Well, night will be here in no time,” and it’ll bethere in no time. You practically just turn around and blink and somebody is calling you tosupper. But we’re now talking of—in a fairly high-toned action.Normally, you’re in a position where incident is, to a marked degree, monitoring yourconsideration of time. But actually, it’s quite the reverse; as you get up, it’s your considerationof incident which is monitoring time. And then as you get up above that, it’s simply aconsideration of how much time there is or isn’t.I don’t know, I think you could get high enough toned as a thetan to consider that a millionyears was no time, and find yourself a million years up the line. You follow this, see? Orconsider that evening was a couple of years away and just sort of almost live a couple of yearsbefore evening. You get the idea, see?So there are three points here that we could consider, three different attitudes: Where the personis the total effect of time and he’s habituated to the incident monitoring his time. But it’s acertain speed of incident monitoring his time, don’t you see, that he’s just gotten used to—justhabit, you know? He’s always led a busy life and therefore his time is—he’s the effect of thatmuch time. He’s always led an easy and rather wasteful life, so that’s his consideration of time,don’t you see? And when that pace changes, and so forth, he’ll get a reverse consideration ofthe situation, see? But that’s all in the field of being the effect of time, you see? One is just totaleffect: one never does anything about the incidents, one never lessens or increases the amountof incident, one never changes his opinion about the incident, one doesn’t even know thatincident has anything to do with time, don’t you see? You got Homo sap; there he is.All right. Now, let’s go upstairs a little bit, and let’s get into a level of release, or somethinglike this, and one recognizes in some way or another that—well, two different considerationstake place. One, “If I get busy, time will go by faster.” And the other, reverse consideration canalso be held, “Well, if I don’t do anything, why, time will go by faster.” You can also hold thatreverse consideration just as easily as the other, but the first one I mentioned is the commonest.And you sort of get the idea that you could monitor the amount of doingness, and you can getinto a point of how much incident you can confront. And you can monitor your time bywillingness to confront incident, willingness to confront the amount of action in your vicinity.You’ve been living in South Peoria amongst the growing sycamores, or whatever they have inPeoria, and life has been drifting by at an 1890 horse-and-carriage pace, and you all of asudden get on a train or a plane; you go to New York City. The taxicab drivers alone aresufficient to change your ideas of time, you see? Well, you see, that’s a change of pace.Now, Homo sap would regard that, you see, as simply shocking. You know, he’d justprobably voice the fact that he had been affected. That would be his total handling of thesituation, you see?Somebody who’s upscale a bit higher could make the consideration, you see, well, he’s willingto confront New York. And when he goes back to Peoria, well, he’s willing to confrontPeoria, see? (South Peoria. I won’t malign Peoria itself.) You see? He’s willing to confrontthat amount of incident. Well, I’m back home again here, and this is the space in which I live,”and so forth. And he’d find his time would stay in much better balance.Now let’s take him upstairs above—the state I just mentioned would be someplace betweenRelease and Clear. Now, let’s take him up someplace to where he’s moving into R6 orsomething like that, and he’ll start getting the spooky notion that he doesn’t have to dependupon the exterior incident to measure his consideration of time, see? So he’s simply up into apoint where he’s saying, “There’s lots of time,” see, or “There isn’t any time,” see? He’swaiting for a train: no time, see? No time is elapsing, so of course the train arrives almost atonce, you see? And . . . as far as his consideration is concerned, you see?"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"And he’s at a big party and everybody is having a marvelous time and he’s having a marveloustime, and so forth, so he just changes his consideration to the fact that it’s a long party. And itis. Do you see?So there are actually these three stages of reaction. Of course, there is a reaction below that Ishould mention, which is just unconscious. But of course, unconsciousness is not a reaction;it’s an isn’t.Now we could probably go above that and we get up into OT and so forth, and we probablycould get a pan-determined attitude toward time, which would monitor the time of others. Nowwe’re talking pretty—we’re talking pretty, pretty swami. See, I mean, this is a little bit out ofthe range of reality, so forth. But it would be by—instead of self-determinism, we’re movingover into pan-determinism, and moving over to separately other-determining, see? Doing another-determinism, see? And you get up into that zone, why, no telling what you could do,see?You have an example of it in fairy tales, of the bloke that comes along and waves the magicwand over the sleeping princess, and everybody sleeps for a hundred years. No little child everthinks to ask, “What happened to the armor and so forth of the guards and the other peoplearound in the castle?” Don’t you see? That one, Sleeping Beauty, is almost a perfect example ofpan-determined time, see?He said, “There’s going to be no incident in this joint for a hundred years,” see? There wasn’t.When you get up that high, you don’t even have to give your postulates in correct English, youknow?So then there is a zone above that, but of course that’s done on the basis of communication.And I don’t care whether the communication has much distance in it or not; you’re nowspeaking in the realms of telepathy. And you’re speaking in the realms of a telepathy powerfulenough so that your consideration is able to induce a reality in the other person, and that’spretty high voltage telepathy.You can see this, however; you can see this in lower experimental phenomena in the field ofhypnotism, in the field of mesmerism, early stuff back there when they were still experimentingwith it, a hundred years or more ago. They knew more about it than they do now; they’veforgotten most of that technology.But you could tell somebody, you see, you can tell an hypnotized subject that this has been thespan of time, don’t you see, or not been the span of time. Although I don’t know that theseblokes ever thought of doing that, particularly. But they’ll get a lot of incident, and they willthink a lot of incident has happened and a lot of things have gone by, and that they’ve been outa long time, and their considerations with regard to this would be entirely shifted, don’t yousee?But that, of course, is making somebody the total effect of a direct communication; it isn’t pan-determined up on the upper stages. I’m just showing you that it can be representedexperimentally down in the very, very low gutters of the scale.You can cause incident to occur on a projected basis, in ways that the modern hypnotist hasentirely forgotten. I was quite appalled to find out how little is known in the West, really, abouthypnotism. I think Charcot must have studied in India, and Mesmer, and so forth.But this experiment is a fascinating experiment: You put another being into a rapport, which isa total bing-bang, you see, with regard to it. And it isn’t just a physical rapport, because thatother being feels and thinks the thought and feeling of the body of the person who has himmesmerized."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"Mesmerism is quite different than hypnotism. Later boys have mixed these two terms, you see?You can do this fantastic thing. Somebody can be put into a mesmerized state, and then putyour hand behind your back (when you really get out the bottom, why, people will say, “Well,do you believe in hypnotism?” you know? It isn’t anything you believe in—I mean, it’s just anexperimental activity) and you can pinch yourself in the back, and the person who’smesmerized, even though their eyes are closed and so forth, will leap convulsively. And if theirback is examined, your fingernail marks will appear on their back. Quite interesting.In other words, you can produce a physical pan-determinism, you see? See, you’ve determinedtheir determinism. And that is also in an experimental zone.This, of course, is quite unethical to play around with amongst the poor bloke Homo sap,walking already up to his neck in muck and trouble, don’t you see? And somebody mesmerizeshim or hypnotizes him and upsets what little sense of value he has left, because the only thingthe poor bloke has got is his own self-determinism, don’t you see? The only thing he’s got leftis that tiny, tiny spark of power of choice, don’t you see? Well, when you overcome that, youjust throw him into a total effect; then that mud just goes down right up over his head, see? ButI’m just giving you an example, just to communicate the idea that that is a low harmonic on anupper state with regard to the telepathy of time and incident, see?So at a very, very high level—at a very, very high level, not making anybody pushed into themud or something like this, you get somebody thinking it’s a long day, and everybody in thecity begins to agree that it’s a long day, you see? You get the idea?You could also have this sort of thing going on; it doesn’t even have to do totally with time.It’d be “the actions we’re engaged in are happiness producing actions,” see? That considerationcould be added to the cycle of action, you see; it’s a happiness-producing action. Andeverybody working around there, they’d think they were doing time, you see?Well, you could produce the opposite effect of “the actions in which we are engaged aremisery-producing actions,” you see, and everybody would feel miserable and feel like theywere forming overts by doing any action at all. And we’ve got a lot of that in this society inwhich we live, which is changing people’s attitude toward time.And the prime criminal in this is the newspaper—the press of Fleet Street. It’s all scandal andit’s all bad and all the employers are bad, and everybody is bad, and there is nobody good, andnothing happy has happened at all, and your actions are not producing any happiness, and theworker is totally walked on and stepped on and ought to shoot everybody in his tracks, don’tyou see, because he’s being made to work, you see? You get the idea?You’re spreading, then, on a pan-determinism basis—but on very finite, low-gradecommunication lines, you see the idea of a worthless series of incidents. So therefore, this willdo something to people’s time. And the amount of doingness of a society is tremendouslydependent on whether or not they are being told that their cycle of action—or whether theybelieve or agree—that their cycle of action should proceed or shouldn’t proceed.And 80 we move over into the field of the word action, now. Action. We’ve got cycle ofaction. All right. We got cycle. You know what that is—all right, let’s take up action.So an action is simply a motion through space having a certain speed. Its speed could be fast orit could be slow, it could move across a lot of space, it could move across a sixteen-millionth ofa millimeter, see? But it would be an action.Now, there’s a lot of bad connotation to the word action in the field of literature. Action storiesare supposed to be bad stories, you see? This word in the field of psychology has gotten to be anasty, spit-in-the-spittoon sort of word.All these civil-defense blokes in the United States are carefully trained that if anybody gets"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"active during an atomic bombing, they should instantly be incarcerated. I know that soundspsychotic; and it is.And the psychological (ha!) assistance of civil defense (ha!) which has been organized in theUnited States at this particular time has been carefully trained to take any individual who is inaction and put him out of action fast, with a cop or a straitjacket or something, see? And that’swhat he’s trained to do.I asked the embarrassing question, “Well, what if the fellow was engaged in trying to put out afire?”“Well,” they say, “that would all be done by the local authorities, so that doesn’t come into theproblem.”And I found out that a local authority, a local authority (you’ll have to cut that off the tape)—alocal authority is not a being which was quite interesting to me. But a being is anybody whoisn’t a local authority. And if a person isn’t a local authority and he is active, or in action or isproposing action, or any of these other things, then the job of the psychological assistant, ofwhich they’re breeding lots of them, and the psychiatrist and anybody else (and the cop on thebeat is supposed to turn over this person, also)—he’s supposed to be instantly gotten out of theway and strapped down and bang! See, there must be Do action.It’s sort of interesting to me that this word action, which is primarily and purely simplysomething which denotes motion and could be said to be, perhaps, volitional motion orintended motion, could become a bad thing, you see? So there’s all sorts of conflict going onabout this. Of course, if a fellow, you know, on a soccer team, or something like that, who issupposed to stop the ball from going in some particular direction, just stood there and didn’tmove over in front of the ball, why, he’d be terribly booed, don’t you see? But in some otherpart of the society, you see that’s inaction; inaction, there, is bad, you see? But in some otherpart of the society, action is bad, you know?And psychiatry has this so bad that they think a person is cured when they become inactive,and that’s one thing which you, as a Scientologist, have never been able to understand aboutpsychiatry. You think I’m kidding you, or something like that, you know? But that’s merely amisalignment of their intention; there’s something wrong there, see?If this fellow is active and he’s got something wrong with him—he’s had a label hung on hischest or something like that, and he’s active—then he is unwell and must be restrained, and thatis the real action behind an electric shock and a prefrontal lobotomy. It’s the action in which theperson is engaged which is the criteria of what treatment he gets. : So a well person is then acatatonic schizophrenic (a very fancy word which means somebody just lies still, stiff, andnever moves).So in the field—in the mental field, this word action is a very bad word; very, very bad word.It fits along with agitated, frenzied, disturbed, see? These are all the same—same thing. See?So, we’ve gotten this word pulled down here amongst a bunch of brothers it doesn’t go with.And this has thrown the whole field of mental healing, so-called, in the Western world at thisparticular time, for a loop. You get the idea? It’s not whether or not he went back to his job anddid his job. It’s whether or not he was active. And you, talking to a psychiatrist, wouldn’tmake any sense at all, because he’d say “active,” meaning crazy, and you’d say “active,”meaning constructive. See, so you wouldn’t be talking the same vocabulary, because of theirabuse of this word action, see?So, you must realize—you must realize—that the prevention of motion is fairly prevalent,particularly in mental-healing circles. The prevention of motion. And therefore, there issomething marvelous about the state of inaction."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Now, we are not the only people to comment on the subject of action or inaction, butcertainly—although we follow far more traditional areas, such as “man is a spirit, he’s not adog,” that sort of thing—realize that in the field of mysticism, one of your main complaintsabout mysticism and one of the bad bugs that there is in mysticism is the image of the wise ortotally elevated individual or the finely refined individual as a totally inactive one. See? That’syour little point of argument. You say, “Hey, wait a minute.”You see, a fireman putting out a fire could be totally calm and collected. He could go about itwith a completely apparent effortless efficiency, you see? Well, that’s very high toned. But afireman who would sit and regard his navel would be crazy! You see the difference?So, you as Scientologists have seen this for a long time. Now, you’ve even coined a word; Ididn’t coin this word. You’ve coined quite a lot of words, you know? Amongst you, I hearyou say them, I see them in auditors’ reports; they become prevalent, and so forth. So veryoften, I start to use them. And you’ve got one called a mystic mystic, you know? A mysticalmystic. I’ve heard this word bang around inside organizations and so forth, the mysticalmystic. And it’s a case; it’s a case type. It’s a commonly Scientology agreed-upon case type.“This person is a mystical mystic.”And they’ll process that person in accordance. And by that they mean that the person will betotally reasonable about anything that happens in their vicinity, but not do anything about it; andsee nothing but good in anything, including murdering babies. You see? It’s thisunreasonableness which you’re protesting—the mystical mystic.But that’s borne out of the fact that running alongside of a great deal of wise wisdom, someawfully bad wisdom has been carrying forward on the basis that all you would do, if you werereally elevated, is you would sit on a mountain top and regard your navel and not look at theworld, or not look at anything, engage in nothing, participate nowhere, be effective nowhere atall, engage in no action of any kind, be totally detached, nothing to do with you, be completelyaloof, and so forth. And you ask a lot of people what an OT is and they’ll describe that. See?An OT is much more likely to be a ball of fire.But, of course, this is a self-protective mechanism. People would like to believe this. We havesomebody in England who is absolutely frantic every time you mention the idea of OT, and haseven come up to me and said, ‘Please, Ron, don’t release these techniques. Please, please,please don’t go in that direction. My God, it’d be worse than the invention of the atom bomb.You realize what is liable to happen if you set these people loose!” and so forth. And he’s reallyworried! Or he was; maybe somebody got to him, because it’s been a few months ago andthere have been a lot of Scientologists around. You can’t ever tell what will happen tosomebody’s character in that case. But they probably got him talked out of it.But there, his fear is that somebody would become powerful or strong, which is fear ofsomebody causing a lot of action, or somebody getting very active, see, which almost fits backagainst the psychiatrist’s definition. His fear of action.“Well, what’s somebody liable to do? Uhh-uhh-uh!” Of course, your best answer to that was“Well, the best solution to that is for you to become OT, too.” There’s no reasoning with sucha person; just give them . . . “If everybody’s gonna become wolves, you better not remain arabbit!” It’s a very good sales campaign.But it has very little to do with the facts of the case, because the level of responsibility rises andrises and rises, don’t you see, along with it. They lose sight of this sort of thing.Now, the idea of action, then, is all sullied up and messed up: whether or not things should goforward or not go forward, you see; whether or not time should advance or not advance;whether or not incidents should take place or not take place—just as a general principle, not“should some incidents take place and some incidents not take place?” Well, that’s a saneconsideration. But you get this insane attitude toward it which is simply “no incidents should"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"take place” or “all kinds of incidents should take place.”And then a person eventually pulls out of that into a lower grade of “Well, it’s all going on andit has nothing to do with me.” And I’m afraid Homo Sapiens is walking into that particularcategory right now at a very, very fast rate of speed. “It’s all going on and it has nothing to dowith me. I can do nothing about it,” and so forth. You see a declining society normally holdsthis. And a society which has a bit of zip left in it, a society which is still rising and so forth,well, everything has to do with everybody. You know, they’ll say, “Ho, ho, ho,” and theytake a lot of responsibility for that sort of thing.Well, you take early nineteenth-century America. I imagine somebody would have walkedmiles to convince Joe down at Dog Hollow that he was dead wrong to vote for PresidentFillmore. You know, just really work at it, you know? It had to do with him and it had to dowith them. Well, the modern think “Well, what can I do about it?” don’t you see? “It’s life,can’t do very much about it.”You get a hot, roaring campaign issue whereby a people really does feel challenged or attackedand so forth, they’ll get up and start saying, “Well, it does have something to do with me.”They have to be pushed pretty far back before they begin to say that. Something like that isoccurring right at the present moment in the United States.And a lot of people are just going to go along with the tide; a lot of people are starting to fight.The end product of that, Lord knows what that will be. It might not be in 1964, but certainlyyou will see the end product of it by 1968. Driven too far, see? So even the fellow who says “Ithas nothing to do with me” at last has to admit that it has something to do with him.I remember, I was trying to convince somebody that the atomic bomb had something to do withhim. I think I’ve told you this joke before, but I finally moved it on down, I got on down to hiswallet and his social security card. And all of a sudden, realized that that would be affected if abomb went off in his vicinity, and he became per) concerned about atomic fission, see? I justkept cutting the gradients doves, getting closer and closer to him, until he finally got associatedwith it.But even killing his children didn’t have anything to do with him. “Well, your children areliable to be killed off, don’t you see?”“Oh, I don’t . . .” Nothing to do with him!So, you can approach a person closely enough with action, and he’ll retreat, retreat, retreat; andwhen he can’t retreat any further, you get the cornered-rat effect, you know? He’ll turn aroundand go the other way.Politicians are always making this mistake; they always misestimate the moment. And they’llsee this supine population that is taking everything that is shoveled out to it. It’s being charged110 percent of all of its income; it’s being made to stand and bow every time a policeman goesby, you see? All this. And they see this totally docile population, and they say, “Well, we cando anything we please,” you see? And they do the “anything you please.” And all of a suddenthey do one too many “anything’s,” you see, and all of a sudden they get the cornered-rateffect, see?All of a sudden it does have something to do with the population, and then there’s nocontrolling it at all, because these people are rather irresponsible, and their control of action isso foreign to them—they’ve forgotten how to control action, don’t you see?—that their actionsjust go brow! It’s like a barroom brawl. You really, in a barroom brawl, you never really canidentify who started the fight or who’s against you or who’s for you, don’t you see? Justeverybody starts slugging everybody.It’s very interesting to be in the middle of a barroom brawl. I have been, in some of the less"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"seemly places of the world, and emerged with a whole skin. But it’s very interesting to see oneblow up. Well, this is amidst a bunch of drunks, and they’re all happy and cheerful, “Who’dcare less” and “Have another drink, Bill,” you see?And all of a sudden one says, “There’s two heads on a dime,” or something.And the other one says, “There ain’t two heads on a dime.”And “Yes, there is two heads on a dime; I’ll show you, you see?”“Well, you can’t show me,” and all of a sudden, wham! See?All these people that have been sitting there supine, and so forth—bottles are flying through theair. These two fellows start to fight, these two, these, these, these fellows fight those—you’dnever know who’s friends of whose, or anything of the sort.You’d say the best thing to do in a case like that is to back up into a corner and barricadeyourself with a table, but let me assure you that that is very unsafe tactics, because somebodyelse will have the same idea, and he’ll fight with you for the table.So action also gets the bad connotation, and a thoroughly bad connotation it can get, because itcan produce pain! It can produce destructiveness, pain and so forth. So when somebody isoverly concerned about being hurt, they’re pretty nuts, you know; they think you only liveonce and they think they’ve got to preserve the body to the ultimate degree. They think pain issomething that nobody can confront, and they certainly can’t confront it because they got somany overts on it, something like that.When people cannot confront pain of any kind, and so forth, you will find that they also arerefusing to confront action. And when they cease to confront action they cease to confrontincident and they won’t advance a cycle of action, and their sense of time goes completely bad.I didn’t say that psychiatry and psychology and so forth had backed themselves—andmedicine—had backed themselves into this exact position, because I didn’t have to. I think youcould understand that clearly. The only thing a doctor can ever tell you is “Be quiet,” youknow, “Take it easy.” Don’t you see? It’s rather bad advice! He’s given the patient a longertime of illness; whether the patient is in bed more weeks or not, illness is now going to movealong longer for the patient, don’t you see? What if he said “Well, you can lie there in bed ifyou want to, but let’s get some things that interest you and let’s get some of this and that, andso forth, and you better have some people come in to see you ‘ and so forth and so on. The guywould have an idea that time is passing very quickly, and this has a remarkable effect uponhealing. See? It takes so long to heal, and if you’ve got a lot of time passed, then you’d healquickly, wouldn’t you? You get the various considerations, how they entangle here.So there’s these various upsets, then, on the subject of action, the avoidance of action, and thenthere is, of course, a pugnacity will set in where it’s all got to be action, or it’s 811 got to bedestructive action. For instance, Hitler should have had some processing. He had it all won upto the point where he had to have more action. We’re not quite sure why he had to have moreaction, but of course he went into a faster level of action than he could confront or anybody elsecould confront, and that was destruction.So when you get more action than you can confront, you normally get destruction. And thisalso gives the cycle of action a bad name, because people think that a cycle of action inevitablyends in decay and death. And it’s at that point that we depart from the Vedic hymn of the DawnChild. They assumed that it was all going to decay and die. Do you see how that doesn’tnecessarily represent a cycle of action at all—that it’s all going to go on newly, newly, newlyand then peel off and then die, don’t you see?But we’re taught this on every hand. Every flower apparently is designed this way; buildings"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"are designed this way, and so forth. And you have so many examples of a cycle of actionending in disaster and the completeness of disaster being the total end of the cycle of action,that it makes people quite unwilling to complete a cycle of action.They say, “Well, if I completed a cycle . . .” I'll show . . . give you a very direct application ofthis: “If I completed a cycle of action on the preclear why he’d be an old, decayed corpse.” Doyou see what he’s cross-associated here? See?So a cycle of action, philosophically, and in the physical universe, is very often looked on assomething which goes from birth through growth to a momentary stability, through decay todeath. And that is so built into the physical universe that it is a barrier to people completing acycle of action.And somebody is worried about this sort of thing when they never seem to be able to completea cycle of action on a PC. Never flatten a process, never really go through the auditing cycleand so forth. They are up against something there which prevents their arrival; they mustn’tarrive; they mustn’t get to that final point. They’re afraid to get to that final point, so they willgo bzoodle!So something could be wrong with their concept of the idea of a cycle and something could bewrong with their concept of the idea of action. But certainly, the cycle of action is not beingcompleted with regard to what they are trying to do. And you, in supervising the case or intrying to handle this situation and so forth, can actually beat your brain to a fine feathered froth,trying desperately to figure out “How do I get this guy to complete this cycle of action?”You call in Joe and you say, “Now, look. On auditing this PC—auditing this PC—get yourauditing question answered! Your auditing question answered! I mean, you got that now?Now, what have I just said to you?”“Auditing question answered. Oh, yes, of course. I know that. Yes, yes. Uh-huh-uh.” Ofcourse he also is saying back there, “It has nothing to do with me,” see?Oh, yes. So you see this session the next time and you see, “Well, Pete, how have you beentoday?” “Uh . . . the trees are pretty, aren’t they?”“Thank you very much.”You say, “Look, look, even on two-way comm, for God’s sakes, get the PC to answersomething that has some relation . . .”“No, ha . . . Oh, of course. Yes, I know that. Yes, I know that.”But you see this cycle of action: cycle out maybe, action out maybe, destruction and deathbeing the end of all cycles of action—we mustn’t arrive. So the best way not to arrive is neverfollow a cycle of action. See? Always just follow a random action that has nothing to do withcompleting any cycle of action.And when you run into that too much, those are the things which you will find wrong with theauditor: something wrong with cycle, something wrong with action, and the other thing whichI mentioned earlier, that the individual —confrontation of incident.Well, for instance, you know, an easy-running PC can very often upset some auditors becausethey change so rapidly, and the auditor, he no more than gets grooved down into auditingwhatever the command was, and the process goes and gets flat, and here’s a new incident, see?You’ve got two conditions, then: either the tone arm action has been run out of a process and itis continued, see, because one can’t confront the incident, see, of a change in the PC to thisdegree; or on the other hand, one stops running the process when there is still a lot of tone armaction going on, because “We know what’ll happen if we complete the cycle of action: we’ll"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"kill the PC. Obviously, so we better not kill any PCs. Ron says not to kill PCs, so . . .”Anyway, you see that very often you are trying, in trying to get auditing accomplished, and soforth, you very often are trying to get it accomplished against this thing called a cycle of action;and we mustn’t have a cycle of action on the part of the person, and yet auditing depends on thecycle of action.So it’s all this rather long series of considerations which I have been giving you whichcomplicate the auditing cycle. And it can be avoided by not getting the auditing questionanswered; it can be avoided by not acknowledging the PC, see? It can be avoided by, well, notasking any question at all—that’s also a solution, you see? It can be avoided by never reallygetting the PC in session so that you start auditing the PC, don’t you see?One could go to the extreme and decide that it’s all over anyway, so that it doesn’t matter whatone does now. You see? A whole bunch of considerations can occur around it using thesevarious elements of which I’ve been talking to you: considerations of cycle, considerations ofaction and considerations of the whole cycle of action, which is the fact that it’s liable to end upin death and destruction. So, all of these things will compound and will show up in an auditingsession.Now, where you’ve got somebody with these points very astray and adrift, and who either hasgot to have too much motion from the PC, or has got to have too little motion for the PC,because his confrontation of the amount of incident, see, is off—when these things are awry,then you have trouble with this thing called the auditing cycle. And the auditing cycle is simplynothing but the broad auditing cycle of a session: we sit down and we start a session and youget the PC in session, and we run the session, and then we run it on through and we end thesession. And we continue a series of sessions until we finally have the process that we’rerunning flat, don’t you see?Or this PC has come to us to be audited for his lumbosis and we cure his lumbosis, and that’sthe end of the situation. See, that’s the broad—the big one.But that really isn’t an auditing cycle, technically; that’s a session cycle, or an intensive cycle,don’t you see? That’s the cycle of the case, and so forth. What we mean, very precisely, whenwe say auditing cycle, is simply your TR O to 4. That is very severely, precisely, an auditingcycle, in the finest, purest meaning of the word. It is simply the Pete-Bill, “Hello,” “Okay,”you know? I mean, he says, “Do birds fly?”“No.”“Thank you.” See?And the auditing cycle which goes on the bigger perimeter of “Do birds fly?”“Uh . . . hm! You know, I used to watch flying birds when I was a boy. Tsh! Yeah, I used tohave a lot of fun watching flying birds . . . a boy.”“Oh, yeah? All right, all right. Now, do birds fly?”“Uh . . . yeah. Yeah, they sure do.”“Thank you.”See? See, that’s really all there is to it. But when you get to throw in the number of cognitions aPC can get, the number of changes a PC can experience, the complexities of various processesright up to R6 - what you’ve got to do in order to do this — this auditing cycle is still verydominant. But it is so overwhelmed and surrounded by the tremendous complications of theauditor’s action that if he hasn’t got it down right he can’t audit. Do you see that? He just going"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"to be all thumbs!What’s missing is the auditing cycle. And if he hasn’t gotten an auditing cycle in by the timehe’s studied up the line pretty fair, well, there’s just something wrong with these points I’vetaken up with you today in this lecture. He’s got some wild considerations with regard to this.He can’t confront incidents, or he’s got to confront too much incident, or, you know, hisconcept of time is out, or his cycle is out, or his concept of the death and destruction of thesituation is out; he’s got the wrong idea of action, you see? It’ll lie somewhere in that direction.And if you then cleaned that up with the individual, you’d find all of a sudden that he foundthese other processes very easy.He’s always having trouble, let us say, with a complicated process: He’s saying he has troublewith a complicated process, whereas he’s not having trouble with a complicated process at all.I’ve seen you use the most complicated processes anybody ever dreamed of, don’t you see?And the only thing I’ve ever seen you have any trouble with is the cycle of action. See, that isthe cornerstone on which all such actions take place. It’ll be those various elements, and it’ll bethose various things.Now, I haven’t answered one question in this lecture—is, although cycle means various thingsin various departments and so forth, what does it mean in Scientology? And I haven’t said whatit meant in Scientology. And it just means “from the beginning to the conclusion of anintentional action”; that’s what cycle means, in Scientology. As far as we’re concerned, it’s thebeginning to the conclusion of an intended action. Intended, see?Has to be a higher-toned definition than your other definitions. And you can consider it in theseother departments, too, at the same time. You see, it’s perfectly all right. But it has somethingto do with the tone of the person who is using the definition.“A cycle of action is the moment when my mother looks at me to the moment she whips me.”See? That’s an other-determined definition, see? As we move the definition on up. it’s from thebeginning to the end of the intended action. That’s a very loose, wide definition, but it could bethat.The only other thing I’d leave up in the air is how could possibly one go about straightening upthese various things with somebody? Well, I’ll give you a very complicated process, and soforth, that I would thoroughly recommend, to take care of this, and that’s just itsa on thesesubjects. And you’ll find out that, within the limits of all levels, would be the most embraciveof these. Okay?Audience: Mm-hm.Thank you very much."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"BASICS OF AUDITINGA lecture given on29 August 1961All right. This is the 29th of August 1961. And I’m often gagging about using notes inlectures. But this particular lecture I have some notes for, believe it or not. That’s because thisis a very, very tricky subject. And I’m going to talk to you about something that is going tomake you more auditing gains in less time as an auditor and make us more Clears than anyother single subject we have opened up on in recent times.Now, this is quite an important lecture. This lecture should be a basic on HPA and an absolutenecessity at the level of HCS/B.Scn. And if a D.Scn. is missing these points, we ought torevoke his thetan! But this is quite important, this material—not to give it an overstress of somekind or another, because I don’t think it could be overstressed.Now, you see, earlier this summer I was confronted with the fact that with all the materials inhand as to how to clear people, very few Clears were being made. Interesting, huh? But everytime we have borne down on the subject of auditing and accuracy of auditing, all of a suddenwe have people finding their goals and terminals, you see, finding goals and terminals on PCsand we have more Clears being made.This is very direct. We have had this experience here. We are all, I’m sure, agreed that it was amatter of the rudiments were out. And just as soon as I said “Well, we’ve got some kind of agames condition going here, and the rudiments are out, and you’ll find it in the first 150,” it’sproven true. I think maybe we got, maybe, something on the order of one or two goals out offifteen cases that are still not found since that was released just a few days ago, right?Female voice: Yes, two cases.Just two cases, see? Interesting.And in every case, the goal was within the first 150, and yet they had assessed for weeks andweeks and weeks after that first 150. See, they’d added it up to a thousand and all gone up andon and on and more and more goals, and longer and longer assessment. And I said, “Well, goback to the first 150 I think that’s where you found them, isn’t it? Interesting, isn’t it?So that all the time after the first 150, certainly, goals were taken, then the rudiments were outduring auditing. Obviously the rudiments were out. The goal was buried. And as soon as therules were put right, the goal came back in, perked up and pangity-pangity-pang, andeverything was going along gorgeously. As my friend Paul said the other day, we were all offat a smart trot.Now, here’s a point, then. Here’s a point of some interest: that by improving auditingtechnology and the skill of individual auditors, we then come closer to very broad clearing. It isnot case difficulties that are restraining the PC, now, from getting Clear. All the evidence is in,and that’s what it adds up to. All right.Therefore, the stress must be on auditor technology, the handling of technical aspects ofScientology. Now, the better that is, the more Clears you’re going to make. We’ve got theweapons with which to make Clears. There aren’t any bugs in it. I haven’t written up your lastPrehav Scale, but you mostly have it right now. There’s no missing items of any importancethat would restrain this from happening. So therefore we come back on auditor technology.Now, I don’t want you to accept anything I am saying as accusative, casewise, or anything likethat. I’m simply going to give you data here, and this data is very well worth having. This datawas arrived at the hard way. It would be a withhold from you to tell you otherwise than that it"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"was arrived at, at a hard way, on the hard line. I’ve been getting some auditing. Sessions havebeen going out. We sat down and analyzed, and we have analyzed, now, all the points wheresessions were going out and so forth. I got a good reality on that, and Suzie got a good realityon it, and we were straightening out these points. Because, frankly, we weren’t doing itparticularly to find out more about auditing, but it’s just stuff that came up and we analyzedaccordingly. And apparently, what it boils down to is not auditing attitude or anything asnebulous as this. It boils down to very concrete data, which you’ll be happy to find out.Now, as an auditor, perhaps, you say, “Well, there are so many rules of auditing, and whichone of these rules of auditing should I be following, and how much memorizing of rules and allof this sort of thing should I do?” Well, basically, first and foremost, if you are worried aboutthe rules of auditing, there is something wrong with your auditing approach.We can count on that, then, as a stable datum: that if somebody is worried about the rules aboutauditing and the zigs and the zags and so forth about auditing, and terribly concerned with thesethings and so forth, then there’s something basically wrong. Because auditing, fundamentally,is simply this—it goes back to the Original Thesis: The auditor plus the PC is greater than thePC’s bank. And the auditor is there to direct the PC’s attention and to keep the PC in sessionand to remain in control of the session and get auditing done.Aside from saying what auditing is therapeutically—supposed to be doing this and that, andmaking Clears and freeing up attention and the various theoretical and technical aspects ofScientology—when you’ve talked about auditing, you’ve said it when you have said that.Auditor plus the PC is greater than the PC’s reactive bank. And the auditor is there to direct theattention of the PC and get the PC in there and get these objects confronted and straightened outand the unknowns off and the bank straightened out and the track straightened out, and soforth, and he winds up at the other end with a Clear. That is what it amounts to with thetechnical knowledge of what you do with a PC. It all boils down to that. You are there to getauditing done. The less auditing you do which is effective auditing, the more upset your PC isgoing to be.Now, let’s take the first object lesson here: The auditor sits down in the auditing chair; the PCsits down in the PC’s chair. What is the contract? What is the understood contract as of thatinstant? That understood contract is a very simple contract: The PC sat down to be audited.What does the PC understand by being audited? He basically understands it as getting ontoward Clear. What he means “toward Clear,” we’re not sure a lot of the time, but even that: hesenses it is there, he senses he’s got a direction to go, he senses that he can arrive at a certaindestination, and he’s there to get that done. Now, he’s not there to have ARC breaks run,present time problems handled; he’s not there to straighten out the auditing room; he’s not thereto have any of these things done at all that we call rudiments. He is there to get audited towardClear.Well, the first observation we can make: that rudiments go out to the degree that auditingdoesn’t get done. That’s a direct ratio. Rudiments go out to the degree that auditing does not getdone.Now, this poses you a problem. If you are using no session to put rudiments in—if you use upno time at all to put rudiments in—of course, you’re apparently around the bend as far ashandling the PC, because the rudiments are out. You see, here’s a puzzle that we face at once.If you’re not spending any time putting the rudiments in, of course the rudiments are going togo out. But the more time you spend putting the rudiments in, the more rudiments you’ve gotto put in. Have you got that?So, somewhere here there’s an optimum amount of rudiments putting-in, and it’s not verymuch. It’s on the order of five minutes. You know, five minutes and the rudiments are in: ThePC will bear with that, but not much more. And when it goes to a half an hour, his present timeproblem is actually, basically, the fundamental problem of getting auditing."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Now, he’ll say the present time problem is something else, is something else, is somethingelse, is something else; but his basic problem: is he going to get any auditing? And after he’shad half, three-quarters of a session thrown away on a bunch of things that he didn’t careabout, why, of course, now he has a new present time problem called “getting auditing.” In thenext session, he comes in with this new present time problem: “Am I ever going to getaudited?” because he doesn’t consider any of these other things auditing.Now, that’s quite fascinating: He doesn’t consider them auditing. So therefore, of course he’sout of session. From a PC’s viewpoint, auditing is a direct press forward, getting himselfstraightened out so he can get a good Goals Assessment, and finding his terminal—if he knowsanything about it at all, this is what he demands—and getting auditing straight along on theroad to Clear, and knowing he’s getting someplace and all of that sort of thing. This is what hereally settles for. This is by experience. Because if you want to keep somebody in session—they will even hang on for months, as we know now, getting assessed for goals; even thoughthe goals are all invalidated and everything else, they’re still interested and they’ll still go tosession, don’t you see? Even though the thing is being run completely crosswise, you see,they’ll still go to session and still be assessed. You got that?Well, they won’t be run endlessly on general processes that don’t approach them any closer toClear. They’ll only go for maybe seventy-five or a hundred hours and they’ll leave the HGC.And they take a lot of persuading to get back and they won’t want to be audited by youanymore, you know, in private practice, and so forth and . . . What are all these things from?From the basic present time problem of not getting auditing. So actually your main chance issimply to audit the PC.If it comes to a question of whether to audit the PC or go through some arduous flipperoo onstraightening out some kind of a super relationship, or something, audit the PC first. See?Now, you’ve got to find out what the PC’s attention is on and what he considers auditing, andhe very often considers it a chronic present time problem of some kind or another—a long-duration problem. And he judges everything as to whether or not he’s making process bywhether or not this problem is getting stronger, getting weaker—the hidden standard sort ofthing; he’s got all that sort of thing. Well, he’ll be interested in that. Why? ‘Cause his attentionis on it. So that’s auditing.So auditing could be defined, to the PC, as anything which is handling the things his attentionis fixed on. See? That’s what he considers auditing. If his attention is super fixed on it and it’sbeing handled, he considers that auditing. And of course his attention is super fixed on goals,so you can get away with assessing practically forever. He will stay in there being assessedlonger than he will stay in there being run on oddball, bit-and-piece general processes that don’tlead toward Clear. Isn’t that fascinating? That’s an observation that I think you’ll find is quitevalid.Now, if it came to a choice as to whether or not we went about it endlessly, endlessly,endlessly running rudiments to get them in, or auditing the PC, you would always choose whatthe PC considered auditing. You would always choose what the PC considered auditing, andlet the rudiments go to hell. And the next thing you know, they’ll disappear in importance.Remember, what you validate becomes important. You start handling too many present timeproblems and ARC breaks too arduously and too long and, believe me, you’ll get more ARCbreaks. Why do you get more ARC breaks? You get them simply because auditing itself is apresent time problem, because he isn’t getting auditing. In his viewpoint, he is not gettingauditing he is not sure he will get auditing; therefore, his contract is violated so he is indisagreement with what is happening in the session. Do you follow that?Now, a PC will sit there and endlessly run 1A. Why? Well, his attention is stuck on it. Hisattention is stuck on all these problem points, you see? He considers it auditing as long as youare auditing in the direction of his problems, of course. So he will settle for 1A. It’s amazing"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"how long he will run how many versions of 1A. See? This is amazing, too. If you were toflatten 1A, then, as we already have talked about, and gotten problems and Security Checkstotally out of the road, you would find your PC would stay in session and think he was goingsomeplace, and of course he is going someplace. And if you were to flatten 1A, giving therudiments a lick and a promise, before you did a Goals Assessment, you’d find out yourrudiments were in when you were doing the Goals Assessment, because, you see, the PC nowcan confront problems. You’ve already brought him up to the point of being able to confrontthe rudiments before you started fooling with the rudiments. You got the idea?Although you run rudiments every session, although you try to find out what they are,although you try to knock them out, although you do run some havingness on the room andyou keep the rudiments in . . . Nobody is saying just forget rudiments, but don’t considerrudiments anything like a session. Don’t ever make the mistake that the PC will think he isgetting a session when rudiments are being run.You’ll find PC after PC, when you ask him, “Do you have a present time problem?” willgroan, because he knows now that his session is going to be endlessly chewed up with the“John and Mary” of life, and he doesn’t consider he’s getting anyplace. Why doesn’t heconsider he’s getting anyplace? Because he knows he’s getting no place with his wife, and soforth. Well, you say, “Well, that’s a problem,” but he doesn’t consider this the general problemof his case, by any means.You have found a problem: He is worried about having to write Blitz & Company. And yousay, “Well, we’ll have . . .” and you just start to make the motion toward handling this problemof having his attention on Blitz & Company and the letter he's got to write to them, and youget, “Oh, no! My God! (sigh)” You’ve heard him, huh?Well, why do you get this? He doesn’t consider Blitz & Company auditing. He doesn’tconsider Blitz & Company as any difficulty. But he does consider that not getting auditing willproduce an enormous difficulty.The value which a PC assigns to auditing should be appreciated by you. It is terribly highlyvalued—very highly valued by the PC. And this is a great oddity, because actually,psychoanalysis was never highly valued; hypnotism is not highly valued; psychiatry they spiton. They go back for their electric shocks like wound-up dolls, but you say, “Well, what doyou think would happen to you if you didn’t have any psychiatric treatment?”“Oh, I’d probably be just the same as before. What’s the difference?”You say, “Well, would you walk across the street for psychiatric treatment?”“Hell, no.”Well, that’s an oddity in itself. See? This is an oddity, that you’re dealing with a commoditywhich is very highly valued and which the society has been trying to put into the field ofpsychotherapy, but psychotherapy is not highly valued. So what you’re doing, basically, isvery highly valued by the PC. So the more you don’t give him of it, the more difficulty you’regoing to have with him.If there’s ever a crossroads of decision as to whether or not we’re going to endlessly get onwith this, even a crude remark of this character: “Well, 1 see you’ve got a present timeproblem, yeah, and you got a little bit of an ARC break. All right. Well, okay. To hell withthose. We’re just going to run now . . .” and you give him the process and you go on and runit.And you’ll be amazed how often the PC will say, “Hey, you know, he’s right in therepitching.” He might grump for a minute, you know, and say, “Well, it’s not according toHoyle, you know?” But you’ll just be amazed how many times teat will win where the endless"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"handling of rudiments won’t win.The endless handling of rudiments is a limiting factor in auditing, because it produceseventually the ARC break of obtaining no auditing. So the decision is, audit. You’ll have lessARC breaks the more auditing you do. And of course, if your auditing is flawless from astandpoint of Model Session and if some of these other things I’m bringing up are also present,smoothly, in the session, your days of having ARC-breaky PCs end as soon as you recognizethat point: that he is there to be audited, and his basic contract is the basic contract of beingaudited. And the more you audit him on the things his attention is fixedly on—I mean fixedlyon, on the long track basis, you see— and the more attention you give to that and the more youhandle that, the more he knows he’s being audited, the less ARC breaks you’re going to get.It’s amazing what a PC will put up with to get auditing, quite amazing what they will put upwith to get auditing. Why make them put up with anything? But, at the same time, go on andaudit. So the best, hottest message I can give you on that exact subject is audit! Don’t fool withit; audit! See?What a PC responds to best: “Oh, well. All right. You’re here to be audited. Good enough.Fine. Now, we’re going to go over the rudiments. All right,” and you rip on down therudiments line. You notice there’s a bad flick of some kind or another. You say, “What’s that?”He says, “Well, that’s so-and-so.”You say, “Good,” and you ask it again. “All right. That’s good, good. It’s still flicking. Is itstill worrying you? Anything else about it worrying you?”“Well, so-and-so’s worrying . . .”You say, “All right. Good.” Get the next one, bang! The next one, bang! You say, “All right.Now, now let’s get down to business. Now, this is the process I’m going to run, and here itis.”And he says, “Well, I don’t much care for that process.” (I’ll take this up in a moment.)And you say, “I don’t care.” You say, “I care for it. Do it.” You know, that kind of an aspect.And he says, “But so-and-so technically, and it said in bulletin so-andso . . .’ You say, “Well, all right. I read it, too. Do it.”And you find the guy doesn’t go into apathy; quite the contrary. He goes spark, spark, spark,spark, spark, and you’ll get good gains.All right. There are some more aspects in that. But that whole first section of what I want totalk to you about is, for God’s sakes, just audit the PC. Don’t fool with it, just audit. You see?Just go right in there and saw it up and chew it up and push his attention around and get himthrough to the other end and . . . Well, get 1A all straight and handle whatever you want tohandle. I don’t care what you handle, because this would hold, possibly, if 1A ever becameancient history—this would still hold. Run the PC toward Clear, and have minimal chopbehind your back, you see, minimal unkind thoughts, minimal ARC breaks, minimaldifficulties in sessions. These all just tend to disappear.Because he might say, “Well, that auditor of mine is a cross son of a bitch, but, jeez, he sureaudits!” You know, this would be kind of the idea. You got the idea? “He sure audits.” It mightbe terribly profane, the opinion, you see? “Well, you don’t do right in a session, she’s a realbitch, that auditor, you know?”—you know, that kind of an aspect and that kind ofconversation— “but I’d rather have her audit me than anybody else I know.” You know, thatkind, and so on?"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The HGC, as soon as an HGC auditor—as soon as that became prevalent in an HGC and assoon as HGC auditors—you just try and change the auditor on the PC. They had this auditorlast year, or something like that, and they just—well, they just don’t want to be processedunless they can be processed by the same auditor, because they’re very sure that auditor canaudit. But it’s not “can audit,” although they always use “can audit.” The secret is “will audit.”And the auditor who kind of won’t audit, they don’t want. That’s the secret of “being wantedby” as an auditor, is how much you get down to business and how much business you getdone.All right. Now let’s take up something a little more esoteric, here, under the heading of“escape” as a philosophy. This is a very complicated subject.This is the orientation of an auditor—has to do with his orientation. This is the only pointwhere an auditor’s orientation can seriously get in his road. As long as he follows Scientologyand goes on auditing and using the principles of Scientology, this one can get in his road. Allthose levels of the Prehav Scale that have to do with escape that is, abandon, leave, anythinglike that—if these are in any way, shape or form hot or if they’re not thoroughly flat on anauditor, you’ll get two aspects. You’ll get the auditor letting the PC escape; he wants the PC toescape, because this is the auditor’s modus operandi of handling situations. And this is aswrong-headed as you could get, because the only way a PC will ever get Clear is by turningaround and fighting down the devils that pursue him. And if the auditor’s philosophy is “theonly thing the PC should be permitted to do is escape,” the auditor will never control thesession. And this is why an auditor doesn’t control a session when the auditor doesn’t control asession. He thinks he’s being good. He thinks he’s being nice to the PC.Now, let’s go about this on a little wider basis. And oddly enough, under that same headingcomes case reality necessary in an auditor. And we’ve got the same heading: It’s escape as aphilosophy. Case reality is necessary in an auditor.Exactly what is this that we are looking at when we find that a Scientologist has never seen orgone through an engram, when we find that a Scientologist has never collided with a ridge,when a Scientologist is not aware of the thenness of incidents? If the Scientologist is not awareof those things, he will continue to make mistakes, and no amount of training will overcome it.Knowing this—just knowing this—will overcome it, because it all of a sudden sees lots oflight. Lights begin to Rash in all directions.If a Scientologist has never been through an engram, if a Scientologist has never been stuck onthe track, if a Scientologist has never seen ridges or any of the other mental phenomena, it isbecause his basic philosophy in life is escape. Now, there is all the wisdom there is in it. I willB° ahead and tell you all about it, but there is all the wisdom there is in it.Of course, if he’s never seen an engram, what is he trying to do? He’s trying to escape fromengrams. So he escapes so hard from engrams that he sees a little flick of a picture and he’ssway, man, he’s away. He’s off like a rocket. He’s off like the Russian never went. See, he’sover the hills and past Arcturus. There’s a little twitch of a somatic and pshew! he’s gone.Why?His basic philosophy is that if you can run fast enough you never get bit. So, of course, hedoesn’t have what we call case reality, because of course he’s running from his case. His basicphilosophy is “The best way to handle a case is get out of it,” so that’s all he ever does with thePC: takes the PC out of his case. So therefore a PC will never be in session with him.Oh, lights begin to dawn, huh?It is pure kindness. This auditor will find the PC getting interiorized a little bit and he’ll knowthat this is the wrong thing to do. So he will take the pigs attention out of session. Some ofthem do it very flagrantly and some of them do it very pleasantly. It is nevertheless true. One of"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"the ways of doing it is to change the process. Another way of doing it is Q and A.PC says, “I don’t want to be here.”The auditor says, “Of course, you dear fellow; you do not want to be there. Let’s besomewhere else at once.”PC shows the slightest inkling of digging into it in the bank and the auditor pulls him out. Theauditor is selling him freedom. At what cost? The cost of never getting Clear. But the auditorsells him freedom, and it’s a good thing. It’s kindly meant.This same auditor well might have a penchant—doesn’t necessarily, but might have a penchantfor going around opening all the canary-bird cages in the world. But then, by George, neverfollows up the fact that the canary birds are inevitably eaten by cats or killed by hawks,promptly and at once. Don’t you see?The auditor is saying, “Escape, escape, escape.” The auditor is actually saying, “Don’tconfront it, don’t confront it, don’t confront it, don’t confront it, don’t confront it.” Theprocesses he’s running are saying, “Confront it, confront it, confront it,” don’t you see? Butthe auditor, with his auditing technology, prevents the PC from confronting it, and so thereforeruns rudiments forever, does other things, doesn’t quite let the PC go into session, “makesmistakes,” “changes the process often,” “ends the session irregularly,” does something odd.And all of these oddities could be said to be backed up by this one philosophy, the philosophyof escape: The kind thing to do is to let him out.The guy is settling down on the track in some fashion or another and he’s going out of presenttime—oh, let’s not let him do that, because that’s the wrong thing to do.Now, this is compounded; this is a complex subject, which is why 1 said this—earlier in thelecture, it was. The auditor who has no case reality of course dramatizes this point. You cannotsee engrams while you’re running from them.Let’s take a model engram that this person is in, and let’s take some of the things that thisperson has happen to them. The model engram he is in—he’s being whipped. The Jesuitfathers, or something of the sort, have decided to really lay it into him on the backtrack, yousee, at some time or another. And they’ve got him tied to a post, and he’s being whipped. Sohe cannot leave that post, so he fixes his attention on a section of sky and says, “It isn’thappening.” That’s escape, isn’t it? So what does he find when he gets into that engram? Hefinds an invisibility called sky. He doesn’t find any whiplashes, he doesn’t find any post, hedoesn’t find anything—he finds a section of sky. That is the final mechanism: escape.Now, he escapes mentally. He doesn’t just run away; he escapes mentally. Don’t you see? Allright. So that worked; he didn’t feel them after that. So it was a workable philosophy, perfectlyworkable philosophy. Unconsciousness is also a workable philosophy.So he’s being tortured on the rack—ah! he fools them all: He goes unconscious; he can’t feel itanymore. We don’t have, then, an engram of the rack; we have a period of unconsciousness.You see that? He’s actually in the incident, but he’s only unconscious.All right. Now, let’s go a little bit further here, and let’s take a look at this—a little bit further—and we’ll find this person has odd somatics and odd difficulties that he cannot account for. Andif he never sees any engrams or sees them very rarely, of course he can’t account for thesedifficulties at all. In Book One, it says they’re all contained in pictures, and he doesn’t see anypictures, and yet here are the somatics, and there’s no pictures. Of course there’s no pictures,because his attention on any given point is the solution “escape.” Escape mentally: escapementally by forgetting it; escape mentally by looking at nothing; escape mentally by saying itisn’t there, you know?—the various mechanisms of not-is."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Yet the somatics have not been not-ised. And this person, every time he “contacted an engram,”actually contacted a nothingness and then was left with a nagging somatic or a sensation that hecould not then account for and which seemed to be very mysterious to him, and therefore didn’tconnect any of these sensations much with his bank—don’t you see?—and knows he feelsuncomfortable, but can’t really connect it with any given engram. Got it?All right. Let’s take an actual case in point. Person does, in running on the track, contact anengram, and there it is, all 3-D and so forth: people standing on the bank throwing a spear. Allright. Spear comes across the river, goes through the PC’s ribs, and the PC has a hell of asomatic and that is the end of the picture as a PC.This person, now, auditing, says, “Well, why doesn’t this PC handle incidents like that? Well,nothing to it. Spear went through you and of course phssst—momentary, you know? Tsk! Flatand gone and you’re out of it, and that’s it. Now don’t get this idea of being stuck on thetrack,” you see? “Hooh! Nobody should be stuck on the track. Why doesn’t this PC just flickhis attention out, you know? Well, I’ll fix this PC up so he can flick his attention out. I’ll pullthis PC’s attention out.” Don’t you see? This is the best mechanism.You ask this same person (this is an actual case) . . . You ask this same person—you say, “Doyou ever have a somatic in that area you just indicated that the spear went through during thatincident?”“Oh, yes, all the time.”“Well, does it have anything to do with that spear?”(Person didn’t say “all the time”; person said, “Yes, very occasionally.”)But, “Does it have anything to do with the spear?”“No, uh . . . well, uh . . . or does it?”“Well, do you have a lot of odds and ends of somatics of this particular character?”“Well, yes, I do.”“Are they connected with pictures?”“No.” (Actual conversation that took place.) “But I thought all that went out with Dianetics, andin Scientology you no longer had to confront all of these things.”Well, here immediately, of course, you have the tag end of every engram that the person hascontacted—is just stuck, stuck, stuck, and where are they all? They’re all in PT. So what is PTto this person? PT is certainly just PT, but actually it’s a jam of engrams; so therefore the PCshould be in PT all the time—because the auditor is. The auditor is never out of PT, sotherefore the PC is never out of PT.And this auditor will not actually guide the PC’s attention through an engram, because there’sno reality on it. The best thing to do is to yank the attention out of the engram. So the auditorwill not control the PC’s attention, because escape is the better philosophy. Don’t you see whythis is? So there’s reality.Now, there’s a direct cure for this, and if you wanted to get anybody who didn’t have “anyreality on the past track,” “no reality on engrams,” no reality on this and that as far as thesethings are concerned. and was thinking people are being unreasonable who go into engramsand get stuck and whose attention are not in present time—this person, then, is not operatingon a reality. They can’t quite tell what the PC is doing, don’t you see? So they’re alwaysworried about what the PC is doing because they themselves have never been in this identical"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"situation; they get a little bit impatient with the PC, don’t you see? So they’re not actually doinga guided tour of a bank; they’re doing a guided yank of a bank.And if you were to run this process on that unreal case—it’s just one process, a one-shotprocess—you would suddenly find that they would have an enormous shift of reality on whatwe’ve been talking about all these years. And the process is “What unknown might you betrying to escape from?”That’s the process. And at first glance, that’ll become a very brutal process, of course, becauseit’ll just start unstacking this. And one of the first things this PC would see, who had thisbrilliant reality on the people on the bank who threw the spear, would be to find out the waterwas cold. And the PC, I happen to know, has cold feet all the time. Of course. There’s thatpiece of that engram, see? So that piece of that engram would be contacted.And you just keep contacting these pieces of the engram, because of course you’re running thereverse mechanism now, not the philosophy of escape. But the only philosophy that works inScientology is “confront it.”It isn’t that you have to erase it; it is only that you have to become familiar with it. All you haveto establish is familiarity with the bank; you don’t have to establish an erasure of the wholebank. It would take endless time to do that.And all of a sudden, this auditor who’s been having trouble guiding a PC’s attention will nothave that trouble anymore. They will recognize at once, “Oooh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, I’ve beentrying to get the PC—oh! Hm! My—my— pardon my red face! Oh, boy, is this what it’s likedown here!” You know? “Huh!”Now, what happens is every time this auditor yanks the PC’s attention, the auditor is not awareof the fact that he has got the PC in one time stratum, called engram time, and is pulling thePC’s attention to present time, and locks the incident the PC was in, in present time, by anattention shift. Any kind of a mechanism, whether you call it faulty technology, changing theprocess, changing one’s mind, doing something of the sort—whatever you want to define it orwhatever rationale went with it, this is actually occurring. And, of course, it is painful to thePC to have this happen, so the PC of course protests and this is a basic difficulty with ARCbreaks. You get a basic difficulty at once, because the PC was there and now he’s here, onlyhe’s not here and he’s not there and where the hell is he?It isn’t that a PC should be regressed on the track and totally impressed by this past-timeincident to a total point of overwhelm; but the PC is in another time stratum, usually, when he’sbeing audited, even on a conceptual or permissive process. PC appears to be sitting in presenttime, and the PC is not in present time. So of course the PC can neither be talked to norhandled as a person would be handled in present time. It is not a social tea party, auditing isn’t.The PC is not there, really; the PC is in another time stratum. And if you practice thephilosophy of escape on somebody who doesn’t have to escape but is trying to do the bank, theauditor’s goal is different than the PC’s goal. And the PC is saying, “Well, I’m confronting itand I’m getting familiar with it, and here it all is.”And the auditor is saying, “Come away, come away, come away; it’s dangerous.” Reactively,this is what is happening.So the auditor is saying, “Come away,” and the PC is saying, “Let’s stay here,” and betweenthe two you get ARC breaks and arguments. You would inevitably, wouldn’t you? And assoon as the auditor takes a guided tour of this thing called an engram bank, you see, with thespears whizzing from both banks of the river... This auditor has never—this particular personhas probably never noticed that not only were there spears coming from one side of the river,but that probably there were whole volleys of arrows coming, too. Those somatics haven’tappeared yet. You got the idea? There’s other things missing in all this, and of course it alllooks very mysterious. But the person gets down there, they’re trying to escape from it; that"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"would be their first action. Spear goes through them: they say, “Escape.” Boom, “Let’s go.”Well, it’s one of the basic thetan mechanisms. It’s why he never as-ises much track; it’s whyhe doesn’t become familiar with his bank. So look how prevalent this thing is. Very prevalent.A thetan would be in a bad way if, when you killed his body, he couldn’t exteriorize, see? Soit’s an absolute survival mechanism for a thetan. So, you see, it’s not a bad thing to haveescape philosophy or to be able to escape. But let me tell you, when a person is compulsivelyescaping, he of course never escapes. And when you get a PC that you’re getting to escape allthe time, of course he never escapes, and his case just winds up in a little black ball. You gotthe idea?So therefore we can say that escape as a philosophy very much gets in the road of auditingwhen the auditor has this as a total philosophy, you see? And we can say also, then, that a casereality is very necessary in the auditor. But, of course, what do we mean by a case reality?Well, a case reality is willing to stay there and take a look, you see, instead of running out onthe incident when it comes up.These two things, then, are under the same heading and they are the same subject. A personwho doesn’t have a reality on the bank has consistently escaped from the bank, and then thatperson of course does odd things in auditing. And then we say, “Well, that person is a badauditor,” “That person is not so good,” or “That person doesn’t get results,” or something likethat.Well, we can say that much more succinctly and much more kindly now, much moreeffectively. We can simply say, “Well, this auditor has escape as a philosophy and hasn’t gotmuch reality on the bank. So therefore, when he audits a PC, he doesn’t know what the PC isdoing.” And when the auditor doesn’t know what the PC is doing and can’t fathom what thePC is doing and the auditor thinks that the PC shouldn’t be looking at all that stuff, too, ofcourse we don’t get any clearing, because clearing depends on a familiarity with the bank. I’mnot telling you, you all stick on the track; I’m merely saying that it’s necessary to have afamiliarity of what can happen. You know, there you are in the middle of the river and the stuffis coming from all directions, and you’re confronting it and you’ve got it and you’ve got asensation of fear or something, or confusion, already that’s going with it, and all of a suddenthe auditor says, “Well, that’s the end of that process. Let’s run something else.” God, youdon’t know whether you’re on the track or in present time or something like that. You’ve beenbetrayed, in other words.But you could educate this auditor endlessly—just endlessly—without producing a singlechange in that philosophy, unless you hit the philosophy itself. Got it? You cannot educate anauditor who has that as a philosophy into giving what you would consider a smooth session ofkeeping the PC in session and his attention on his bank. Do you follow that?So that’s exactly where that button sits, and that’s exactly what button you press. And when anauditor makes consistent mistakes, when an auditor yanks the PC’s attention or the auditor isdoing a lot of Q and Aing—there’s more about Qing and Aing—but when he does a lot of this,a lot of shift, we just assume that: that the auditor has a total philosophy and fixation of escape,and therefore is letting the PC escape.And he isn’t being vicious, he isn’t trying to cut the PC to pieces. He knows what’s best forthe PC: Get out of there, man! Not even “Get rid of it,” just “Get out of there.” PC starts tolook a little bit indrawn, go into session, the auditor will pull him out every time.You probably couldn’t even list the number of mechanisms auditors use to effect this, sothere’s just no sense in putting up counter-laws to each one of these mechanisms that’s used, isthere? There’s no sense in doing that, because we have the basic mechanism for it.All right. Now, let’s go a little bit further here. Here’s another subject on this. Responsibility"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"for the session: in the Original Thesis, way, way back when, you had the rules, the laws, thebasic laws, of auditor plus PC greater than the PC’s bank; PC less than PC’s bank. Obvious—a PC must be less than a PC’s bank or the PC would never be troubled by the bank, don’t yousee?So that’s why self-auditing doesn’t work, by the way: the PC is less than his own bank. Also,he never can get in session, because a bank won’t go in session. You can audit valences andthat sort of thing. Oh, don’t mistake me; I mean, you can’t say that self-auditing does notproduce a result. It does produce a result but the result is quite minor.And actually all self-auditing is, is remedying havingness on auditing. Self-auditing always,always, always begins on scarcity of auditing. A PC would always rather be audited than self-audited, but they could get to a point finally where it is—auditing is so scarce... You know,people have been “auditing them” without auditing them, and auditing thereby gets scarce; soPC starts auditing and can come up to a point where the scarcity becomes so great that theybegin to assume virtues, like the fox who loses his tail, you see? The great virtues of having notail: the great virtues of self-auditing. Simply the lack of havingness of auditing can result to thefact where self-auditing can become quite a virtue.Occasionally, you’ll find—once in a while, rarely, you’ll have somebody say, “Well, I want todo it myself,” as far as self-auditing is concerned; “I . . . I really want to make the grademyself.” And you look back over the history of the case and you’d find out they didn’t feel thatway a year before. They just didn’t have auditing.So you can actually have somebody sitting there, and an “auditor” there, and the person gettingno auditing, don’t you see? And this denial of auditing, denial of auditing—by being yankedoff the track, by endless rudiments, by never getting anything on the road, by never reallygetting in there and pitching, you see, one way or the other, the person is being deniedauditing. And the person will be denied auditing to a point where they self-audit. That’s whatself-auditing is.You find a PC self-auditing, you can be sure that the PC has such a scarcity of auditing thatyour auditing is having considerable difficulty arriving. You don’t have to do anything about itexcept just reestablish the PC’s confidence in the fact that he is being audited and will beaudited. That’s basically what you do, is just audit, and the PC will come out of this. But itrequires auditing.But the PC less than the PC’s bank—otherwise the bank would never be giving him anytrouble. Yes, I know he’s creating the bank, on how many vias and that sort of thing. But he’screated a Frankenstein monster—and it’s about to eat up Frankenstein, you see—called a bank.And the Frankenstein’s monster inevitably will eat up Frankenstein. He’s created a bank. He’screated all these various valences and that sort of thing. He’s denied full responsibility forhaving done these things, and so on, and the result is that he’s having difficulties with a bank.This is not self-auditing, now; I’m just talking about PCs in general. I’m talking about Homosap, I’m talking about the farmer that’s walking down the road and I’m talking about this guyand that guy and the other fellow, you see? And these chaps are all in this sort of a state of lessthan the bank. When we say a man is aberrated, we say he’s less than the bank. And when wesay somebody is psychotic, of course this person is not just less than the bank; this person isnonextant and s the bank. You see, there’s a total overwhelm, and that’s all psychosis is: totaloverwhelm by own bank.Now, the gradients of cases is the degree to which a person is overwhelmed by the bank.Now, recognizing this, that you’re auditing somebody who is a bit overwhelmed by his ownbank, and recognizing these laws in Original Thesis (simple and elementary as they are,nevertheless they’re very sweeping in their truth in auditing), we get this kind of a condition,here: The auditor has got to be cooperating and running the PC’s bank, you see, and runningthe PC at the bank in order to get auditing done, inevitably. When the auditor withdraws from"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"doing this, he collapses the PC’s bank on him. You see?When an auditor is auditing and suddenly stops auditing—like, you know, a shift of attention,spills the water glass, tips over the ashtray, something of this sort—he of course has to somedegree withdrawn his control of the PC’s bank, and you get a minor collapse.But there is a way to get a major one, and this has never been articulated before in Scientology,and it’s terribly important: When ever you take a direction from a PC and follow it, youcollapse the PC’s bank on him.These poor guys—I know two or three fellows who will only let some very, very weak auditoraudit them, you see, and give the auditor all sorts of directions as to how to audit them. And ofcourse this is just a self-audit. They don’t make much progress. They make some, but theydon’t make very much progress. They’re usually in misery. They’ve set up a booby-trapsituation here, because of course the auditor is taking directions from the bank and followingthem. That’s part of it. And the other part of it is, you see, the auditor subtracted himself fromthe basic equation of auditor plus PC is greater than the bank. You see?So, when the auditor takes the PC’s directions, then it looks to the PC at once as though onlythe PC is confronting the bank; and he loses the illusion of the auditor’s confronting the bank,and of course the bank then collapses on the PC. Do you follow this carefully? It’s one of thesesimple arithmetical propositions. It’s one plus one is greater than one and a half, but one is notgreater than one and a half. And what you’ve done is subtract a one from the one plus one, andof course you get immediately the one and a half greater than the one. You’ve only got one left,you see?You haven’t got a PC sitting in the PC’s chair; you’ve got an auditor sitting in the PC’s chair.So the PC is now both the auditor and the PC, only it doesn’t add any ones. So instantly andimmediately you of course get the bank greater than the PC, and so therefore the PC ispromptly and instantly overwhelmed.PC says, “I think you really ought to ask about that present time problem another time.” Oh,yes, PCs can do anything they like and they will say things like this, you see, in a perfectlygood situation. They have sort of taken over—because of anxiety for auditing and otherthings—they’ve taken over the idea of auditing and they’re afraid some auditing is not going tooccur. And so they sort of merge up and something in the bank is this and that and they sort ofsay, “Well, I think you ought to ask about that one more, because I think there is one . . .” andthe auditor does ask that one more. And instantly, pshew!The bank collapses promptly and instantly on the PC.Got an ARC break. You never notice it, because it takes an hour or so to swell up, but the PCthereafter is running on auto. All you’ve got to do is take one direction from a PC and youcollapse his bank on him. You must understand exactly how that occurs, you see?Here’s the PC and the auditor and the PC’s bank, and the auditor plus the PC are greater thanthe bank. Now, of course, the moment that the PC becomes the auditor, even to any tinydegree, you no longer have the equation of auditor plus PC: You have the equation of PC plusPC-being-auditor, which of course still adds up only to one person—the PC—and of coursethis is not greater than the bank. So you get a collapse of the bank. And I do mean a collapse ofthe bank. You can make the bank go pshew!—just hit him in the face. Blango!Now, just look this over, because it’s the first time we’ve ever examined this mechanism, inspite of the fact the laws are some of the oldest laws we have. I think the only two laws earlierthan that is Survival is the dynamic principle of existence, and the purpose of the reactive mind,purpose of the analytical mind; those are the only laws that are earlier than these laws—I mean,in terms of time and development."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"So, let’s take another example: Auditor says, “Do you feel all right now, and uh . . . or do youfeel too tired to go on?”The PC says, “I feel too tired to go on.”And the auditor says, “All right. We won’t go on.” At that exact instant, you’ve collapsed thePC’s bank on him. I mean, it isn’t a simple thing, that the PC is suddenly dismayed or goes outof session or something like this. An actual mechanical fact happens: Whether the PC perceivesit or not, the bank collapses on the PC, of course, because the bank is being held out, basically,and the PC is being held in position and the bank is being held in position only by the equationof auditor plus PC. And the second the presence of the auditor drops and the auditor ceases—that’s what we mean by “ceases to take responsibility for the session.”Now, that’s an esoteric statement; it hasn’t any mechanics with it that give you any explanation,but that is the primary method by which the auditor does not take responsibility for the session.And that is the exact mechanism by which an auditor gets into trouble—the exact mechanism.It’s down there to a hairline. All the auditor has got to say is “Is it all right with you if we uh . .. um . . . is it all right with you if we uh . . . run this uh . . . an hour and a half?”And the PC says, “No, I don’t think so.”And the auditor says, “Well, all right. Then we won’t.”Well, on the surface of it, it is the socially acceptable, kindest thing you can do: The poorfellow feels tired, so we just won’t go on with it. And at that moment, we just picked up thestewpot and hit him in the face with it. See, we collapsed the bank on him. The bank willcollapse—can be counted on collapsing—instantly that this occurs. He’ll get a reaction from thebank, bang!That means actually, probably, that the Model Session should be rephrased, on a discovery ofthis magnitude. Don’t worry about it until you see it in an HCOB, because it may be and it maynot be, because basically the Model Session is written up just to get the illusion of courtesy.I say, “Well, is it all right if we end this session now?”And the PC says, “No, it’s not all right. I’m having a great deal of trouble here and I’mstruggling around,” and so forth.I say, “Well, all right. I’ve made a mistake, and we’re now going to end the session.” It’salways all right with the PC. I decided to end the session. If I decide anything else now, merelybecause the PC told me something else, I’ve had it, because the bank just will go splat! Now ifI don’t want this PC to be butchered up, I certainly better stick by my own ideas of what Ishould be doing, no matter how wrongheaded or inopportune or upsetting those ideas mayappear to be.So you just have to take fate in your own two fists on such a situation. You say, “Is it all rightif I end this session now?” It’s courtesy.And the PC says, “Well, yes, it’s all right. Uh . . . except uh . . . I’m pretty far back on thetrack.” All this is, is a comment to the effect that “Well, you knucklehead, you didn’t ask mewhere I was on the track before you sprung this other one,” don’t you see?Well, if you now say “Well, all right. We will run it ten minutes longer in order to get you upto present time,” you’ve had it at once! You’ll never get him to present time. Why won’t youever get him to present time? Because you just collapsed the whole track on him, that’s why!And then you probably didn’t do anything to reassume the control of the session. Do you seewhat happens?"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"So you just never, never, never, never do what the PC says. You just never do what the PCsays. I don’t care how logical it is, I don’t care how wrong you are. If you’ve given him atotally wrong, upside-down, incorrect instruction, you can do something more wrong thanthat.You know, English doesn’t permit the deepening of the word wrong. You can’t be “wronger,”apparently, according to English. But boy, I’m telling you, you can be wronger. It doesn’tmatter how idiotic the auditing direction was, how noncompliable the auditing direction was—itjust doesn’t matter. If the PC now gives you some advice concerning it and you take thatadvice, you are promptly and at once wronger. You have just lost the control of the session,but that isn’t what’s important. Mechanically, you’ve collapsed the PC’s bank on him.So you just must never do it! That’s just something an auditor must never do. He says, “Allright if I end this session now?”And the PC says, “No, it isn’t all right. I’m stuck down the track.”And the auditor says, “All right. I’ll run the process for ten minutes longer.” Why, this is thekindest, most sensible, decent thing you can do, isn’t it? And it winds you up every time in thesoup. Then you probably will spend the next five hours trying to end that session.Why? Because you are no longer auditing the session; the PC is. You haven’t got an auditorplus PC greater than the PC’s bank, so the PC of course can’t come up to present time, so hejust struggles. See? The mechanics are just dead against it. That’s the way the reactive mind is,not the way I think it is.So that is a primary method of getting into trouble. A primary method is to violate that originalequation. Auditor plus PC must both be there in order to be greater than PC’s bank, and whenthe PC says to the auditor, “Advice, advice,” and the auditor takes it, of course then at once,immediately, instantly, then, the PC becomes easily the auditor: He is running his own bank ona via, he’s no longer greater than the bank—it only takes a split second to happen—he’s in thesoup. Got the idea?Well, it isn’t that PCs mustn’t give advice to auditors. By all means, as a PC, give the auditorall the advice in the world. You understand? Give him all the advice in the world. If he takesany part of it, he’s a lousy auditor, that’s all. Because he at once passes over control of thesession. It’s something tantamount to walking out in front of the troops and handing yoursword over, see? I mean, it’s something of this order of magnitude. Promptly and at onceyou’ve lost the war, and that is it. There’s going to be reparations charged and the UnitedStates will be sending three quarters of the national income over to rehabilitate the country. Butif the United States doesn’t hear about it, then nobody is going to rehabilitate anything.Now, there’s the whole situation in controlling a session. And there is the primary difficulty anauditor runs into. Once more, it looks like pure kindness and it turns out to be totalviciousness.All right. Let’s take up one more point here. You can also put a PC at responsibility for thesession by a bunch of “PCs ought to,” and individual considerations about what ought to begoing on. This is a little more esoteric, but becomes less so when I say something like this (thisalso comes under escape as a philosophy): “Well, he ought to be able to get out of that veryeasily.” See, the auditor says, “Well, he couldn’t be in any great trouble. He ought to be able toget out of that very easily.”Well, you see, what did he do? Even if he did it silently to himself, he says immediately,“Well, the PC is responsible for the condition he’s in.” And you will find the one-plus-one-greater-than-the-bank also operates. That promptly operates, and the bank will cease to behave.It’s quite esoteric, it’s quite odd."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"You say, “Well, PC shouldn’t be in that much trouble.” “A man—a man of that age uh . . .shouldn’t have all of those difficulties with women. After all, after you’ve lived for forty orfifty years, you certainly should know something about women.” You know, something likethis. You have some kind of a little unkind thought of this character, but it’s an ought-to-be,you see? And you have just shifted responsibility for the session over to the PC, just as neatlyas though you’d suddenly crowned him with laurel wreaths. You see how you’d do that?The PC “ought to,” the PC “shouldn’t ought to.” Now, here is a whole class of things, yousee? “The PC shouldn’t be screaming at me.” Well, that would be the best way in the world tobring the scream up four more decibels. Don’t you see? That would operate at once to put thisPC at cause, so of course immediately eliminates and deletes the auditor plus PC over bank—iteliminates the auditor and, of course, collapses the bank on the PC. You get how this wouldwork, you see? The PC “ought to,” “shouldn’t ought to.”“Well, men are always like that.” That isn’t so bad, that type of consideration; it just denotes aninability to do something about it, so an apathetic acceptance of a condition which one isconfronting. Well, this merely lowers control over the PC’s bank slightly; it’s not a very greatthing. Well, that doesn’t amount to a great deal. It’s when you really drop it out—when youreally say “Well, the PC should be” or “the PC shouldn’t be,” or something of this sort—bang! You see, you’ve gone into the same old violation of this original rule.No, a PC is doing what the PC is doing, and the PC ought to be doing what the PC is doing.You see? And the PC oughtn’t to be doing the things the PC isn’t doing. And the PC does whatthe PC does. You get the idea? And considerations as to what the PC should be doing, up ontop of this, of course interrupt responsibility for making the PC do something. You get theidea?Now, of course, as long as your intentions are totally wrapped up in what the PC ought to bedoing with inspecting pictures and so forth, you of course are making this occur! You aredoing this, you see, so it isn’t an ought-to-be or a shouldn’t-be or something like this, see? ThePC is going up and down the track and around the bank: Well, he ought to be doing thesethings, you see? And you know that he should be doing these things; he knows that he shouldbe doing these things. He should be following the auditing command, and you know that heshould be following the auditing command, and all that sort of thing.I’m not talking about that class of thing. I’m talking about another class entirely: that instead ofmaking the PC do or become what you want the PC to do or become, you add this sneak oneinto it, you see? The PC “ought to,” you know, and you sort of said faintly to yourself, “Well,I’m not doing anything about it, and he shouldn’t really be upset about that ARC break. That’sreally nonsense; he shouldn’t be upset about it. He shouldn’t be—oh, well, it’s a . . .” “Well,he shouldn’t have that present time problem, not now. We’ve only got two hours here and,God, he shouldn’t have this present time problem now. No. Heavens on earth.”No, the PC has got what he’s got, don’t you see? You just look at what the PC’s got, and thenyou can go ahead and you and the PC can make him “got” something else, don’t you see, withgreatest of ease. But if the PC “ought to” without any further action on your part, of coursewhat do you wind up with? You wind up with a collapsed bank. Is that clear to you? That isnot as serious or as general as the other.Now, Q and A, Q and A: Every time the PC says something, you follow it, is the mostprevalent method of Q and A.You say, “Well, how’s that about your mother now?”And “Well, it’s not my mother now, it’s my father.”“Well, how about your father?”"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"“Well, it’s not my father so much, it’s . . . uh my father’s okay, but it’s actually my aunt . . .uh . . . uh . . . my aunt Bessie.”“Oh, well. Well, all right. Now, what—how does that apply to your aunt Bessie?” And by thetime you’ve done this, of course, you of course are doing two things: You’re letting the PCspot what you ought to be auditing—you’ve dropped responsibility, then—and you of coursepermitted him to escape Tom the original questions and you haven’t followed it through.You’re permitting the PC to escape, and the PC will go along a whole sequence and series ofescapes; and if you follow along this sequence of escapes without ever once saying “Whoa,now, PC! I asked you about Pop. I want to know about Pop and I’m not interested in AuntBessie. Now, Pop!” You can say it as rough as you want to; it won’t affect the PC, because heknows confoundedly well that’s what he ought to be doing.And he says, “Oh, oh, oh, I—ha-ha-ha-ha. Fly cops are on my trail. I didn’t get a chance toduck up that alley. Well, I guess I just better not do that and I better come back here and uh . . .take a look at Pop. Okay. Well now, what did you want to know about Father?”You say, “Well, all right. I just wanted how—to know how that was about Father?”“All right. Well, it’s all right about Father.” Now, what else about this?“Yeah, well, how is it all right about Father?”“Oh, kill the son of a bitch as quick as look at him, that’s how all right it is about Father,” andso forth, see?“Oh,” you say, “well, all right. Now, you got a picture there or some “Well, sure I got apicture there! What else do you think I have?”“You’ve had a picture there?”“Oh, yes, of course I’ve had a picture there!”“Well, all right. Now, what don’t you know about it?”“Well, I don’t know this and I don’t know that and I don’t know that and I don’t know that anddon’t know that and don’t know that, there, there, and . . .”“What else don’t you know about it?”“Well, I don’t know so-and-so.”“All right. That’s fine. Now, you still got a picture there of your father?”“No.”“All right. Now, how about your father?”“Well, all right. Take him or leave him.”“Okay. All right. Nova, we’ll go on to something else.”Got the idea?The PC never wants to handle what you want him to handle. You can just put it down: Henever wants to handle what you want him to handle. I don’t know a PC yet that’ll handleexactly what you want him to handle!"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"When a PC sits there smiling sweetly, I get very, very suspicious. I say, “What are youlooking at?”He said, “The same incident you told me to look at.”“Yeah, well, what incident was that?”“Oh, this incident about picking these flowers out here in the field.”And I say, “No, we had an incident there about burning down a house. What happened tothat?”“Oh, you caught me. Oh, well, all right. Burning down a house . . .” and so forth, andsomewhat grumpily they’ll go back in and look at it. But they don’t like you when you let themescape, because they know way down deep that it’s wrong. They know way doves deep thatit’s wrong. They know the road out is the way through, and the road out is not a bounce.The guy has been running away for two hundred trillion years, and he’s looking for somebodyto stand and hold the ground and say, “All right. Let’s pick up these devils one by one andfight them down.”He will say, “That is the most horrifying, shuddering thought that anybody has ever pushed inmy direction. but I know damn well he’s speaking sooth.”Now, it actually hasn’t worked for the last two hundred trillion years, running away. So, hesays, “Well, here’s a picture.”And you say, “Good. Got any other pictures?”“Uh. . . (These guys are gonna let me run away.) All right. Yeah, I got some other pictures.”“Good, you got any other pictures in there?”“Oh, yes, I’ve got some other pictures in there.”“Oh, yeah. Well, how’s your mother?”“All right, Eme.”“And how’s your father?”“Okay. Fine. Oh, yes,” and so forth. And the fellow says, “Well, it wasn’t my mother I wasthinking about, actually. It was my aunt Bessie.”“Oh, well, how’s your aunt Bessie?”And the PC right at that time says to himself, way down deep someplace, “That’s all we’regoing to do now is escape, and I know that it isn’t the road out.” So he has ARC breaksbecause he knows he’s not getting auditing.It’s a very funny thing. Not overwhelming a PC, not pounding him down: PC says, “I have togo to the bathroom.”You say, “You damn well sit there and don’t go to the bathroom,” and so forth, and the PCsays, “Well, I have to go to the bathroom; it’s a present time problem,” and so forth.And you say, “Well, I’m not going to let you go to the bathroom till 4:35; that’s the end ofsession—and that’s the end of it,” and so forth."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Well, you keep this kind of thing up forever and eventually the PC gets an overwhelm. He’spounded into a position. See, all of this stuff is moderated with reason, don’t you see?That isn’t any kind of a session direction. PC says he has to go to the bathroom. All right, say,“Go to the bathroom.” All right. Now go into session. You’ll find he’s slightly out when hecomes back. So put him into session again; put him into session again with a crunch.But five minutes later he says, “I have to go to the bathroom.”You say, “I’ve heard that before; we’re now going on with the session.” He’ll be back inprocessing again.Invalidation is the basic overwhelm. The PC says, “Oh, it was my father doing all this.”And the auditor says, “It couldn’t possibly have been your father.” You get the idea? Now,there’s where overwhelm comes from: invalidation.PC says, “I—I think it’s . . . I think it’s an automobile mechanic. I think it is.”“Couldn’t possibly be an automobile mechanic,” you know?You could run a whole case, possibly, by saying, “Who’s been invalidated?” See, what’sdeath? Death is invalidation—invalidation of a terminal. What’s sickness? Invalidation of aterminal. What’s punishment? Invalidation of a terminal. I mean, all things add up more or lessto the invalidation of a terminal, don’t they? And as a result, why, you’ve got a button therethat you’ve got to lay off of, which is just invalidation.PC says, “It’s made out of green soup.”You say, “All right. Solid green soup.” As far as he’s concerned, that’s the way it is. It’s justthat’s the way it is.And this sort of a matter-of-fact situation is, in a few minutes the PC says, “I made a mistake.It is not green soup.” The wrong thing to do is to tell him “Why, I could have told you thatearlier.”You’re taking him on a tour of a bank; you’re getting him familiar with various things byvarious mechanisms: He’ll wind up in the other end not afraid.Now, what, basically, then, would best answer up these conditions? Certainly not escape.Don’t let him escape. Make him face it up. You’re always safe.PC starts using rudiments for escape—omit them. Always the better choice is to audit; alwaysthe better choice.If the PC gives you directions as to what you ought to be doing in the session, give him thecheeriest acknowledgment he ever received and go right on doing what you were doing. Don’tever shift. Now is the time not to shift, because you’ve run into some kind of a valence or amachine which tells you “Change, change, change, change”; and you start going change,change, change with the PC, it’s a Q and A, and of course you’re going to get no place at theother end.Now, these are very important considerations in auditing, and if an auditor were to do thesethings, pay attention to them and handle those things, he actually could be quite ignorant ofsome other facets of technology and he’d still win. He’d be right in there pitching.No, there is no substitute whatsoever for having a reality on the bank. There is no substitute for"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"it at all, because now you know what’s happening to the PC, you know where his attention is,you know where he’s going, you know what he’s doing. And you don’t make the mistake ofbelieving he’s in present time and this is all a social chitchat that we’re indulging in. We’veknown auditors who’ve thought auditing was that, and they always of course wound up withPCs with no gain and tremendous ARC breaks and rudiments out all the time and that sort ofthing, because the PC’s attention was never in session.The basics of auditing, however, require that the PC feel able to talk to the auditor, so youdon’t necessarily shut the PC off about things like this or directions like this; you let the PC tellyou. But it’s a great oddity that when the PC has told you that the process is wrong and thathe’s having difficulty answering it—it would be a great oddity if, when you acknowledge thisand you say, “All right. I’m sorry, but that’s the process we cleared, and here is the nextauditing command,” the PC will say, “Oh, hell,” then he’ll go on and audit it, and you’ll windup, oddly enough, without any much of an ARC break.But you say, “Well, now let’s see, let’s just shift the process. He says he can’t answer this, solet’s change the wording of the process.” And, of course, don’t be amazed that for theremainder of the session, and maybe for the next couple of sessions, you get absolutely nochange of case. Why? There’s no auditor there. Why? Because the PC did the auditing.So these various considerations are right there amongst the fundamentals, and they’re things topay a great deal of attention to. And if a PC is moving through a bank, you should have someidea that people can get stuck on the track, and you’ll get an idea of other-timeness than hereand that things can happen, and that somatics, and so forth, are directly connected with pictures—which they are—and that sort of thing. There’s no substitute for that sort of thing.And in training auditors, one of the things you should always ask an auditor is “Well, do youhave any reality on an engram? Do you know what an engram is? Have you ever seen one?Have you ever had a somatic out of one?” Not necessarily “Have you ever had sonic?” orsomething like this, but “Have you ever seen one of these engrams?” and so forth. “Well, haveyou ever had a moment there when you were—on the track when you did not quite know whatwas happening?”“Uh . . . oh, yes. Yes, yes, I have. Yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah, ooh, well, sure, yeah. I was runnin’this one about elephants and these elephants were walkin’ all over me. Goddamn it. And uh . .. I don’t think it ever got flattened. Feel an elephant’s footprint on my chest right now.”Ah, this is a safe auditor. Why? He’s not running a big philosophy of “escape, escape, escapeis the road out,” don’t you see?If you asked this auditor—you say, “well now, have you had any reality on the track?”“Well, I’ve read about it in Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health.”“Well, have you ever run into an incident? Have you ever run into an engram?”“No. No, I know they exist, intellectually. I have good intellectual reality on them. Ronwouldn’t lie to me about that.”No matter how kind this auditor appears, this auditor is not safe as an auditor. Why? Becausethis auditor practices escape. That is the only reason why the auditor has never seen an engram,you see? So if they’ve practiced the escape from the bank, they have practiced the escape inauditing. and they u ill yank PCs out of session. Okay?These various considerations are very pertinent to training. to auditing. to understanding, and Igive them to you at a time when they’re easily remediable. There is no difficulty with thesethings. I am not citing you any 120-foot board fence that you have to climb over with yourfingernails. That process which I gave you is the most revealing process to somebody who has"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"no reality on the track. That is most revealing. They say, “Ooh, wow,” you know? “This iswhat I’ve been pulling people out of—and it was a good thing I did, too! “Okay. Well, possibly many interpretations could be made of this particular lecture. But justremember that it, too, just means exactly what it says, which is do the auditing, get the showon the road, get the most auditing done in the least time that you can. Your PCs will be veryhappy with you and they won’t ARC break, either.And you’ll be amazed how seldom you have to put the rudiment in. When you come intosession, you bang yourself down in a chair, you move the PC’s chair slightly, you tell him,“Sit there; hold the cans. All right. We are now going to start a session. Start of session. Good.Now, process we left unflat yesterday was so-and-so and so-and-so. The first auditingcommand is. . .” Bang!The PC will say “(pant, pant, pant).” He’ll say, “But w-wait a minute. I’m not even in session.You haven’t run any rudiments. You haven’t done any this or that and so on.”“The first auditing command is . . .” Bang! “Answer it, answer it, answer it. Answer it!”The PC says, “Well, let’s see. What is it again?”“You heard it. Answer it.”“Ohh-uh . . . Yep, what unknown stomach? What unknown stomach . . . ?”You say, “Good. What unknown stomach don’t you know nuthin’ about?”The PC answers the auditing question, chops back at you maybe a little bit here and there says,“Boy, this is rough, man. You’re rough, rough, rough, you know? You... Do you realize I’mstuck all over the track here, I got everything all messed up, I don’t know whether I’m going orcoming, and you just keep pouring these auditing commands at me?”You say, “Good. Here’s the nest one.”PC, at the end of twenty-five hours—he may or may not tell you anything about it—goesaround and tells the D of P or another student or somebody like this, “My God, that personcertainly gets a lot of auditing done! We’ve certainly had a lot of auditing done. Yes sir, thatperson really will audit.” And the whole aspect of the thing changes.Now, I’m not recommending that you let the rudiments be out; I’m not recommending thesevarious things. I’m just giving you the frame of mind in which sessions run well. And they dorun well when they do that.And the PC says, “I think I ought to be running something else,” you say, “You probablyshould be. But right now we’re running so-and-so.”PC is all ARC breaky about not running something else: “But my last auditor—but my lastauditor was running a five-way bracket on Mother, and it was never flattened. And I just keeptelling you this, that it was never flattened.”You say, “Well, all right.” And at this point you might think to yourself, “Well, maybe I oughtto ask what part of it isn’t flattened. “What was the auditor’s name?” something of the sort.And, man, you are handling a twelve inch stick of inch-thick dynamite with the fuse lighted.This is a booby trap. Don’t fall for it.You say, “Well, good. Good.” Even cheer him up: say, “Well, I hope it gets flattenedsomeday.”"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"I think you’ll find that this is the winning card.

The basic answer to aquestion is, obviously, a question if one follows the duplication of the Comm formulacompletely. See Philadelphia Congress 1953 tapes where this was covered very fully. A laterdefinition was “Questioning the pc’s Answer”. Another effort to overcome it and explain Q &A was the Anti-Q and A drill. But none of these reached home.The new definition is this:Q AND A IS A FAILURE TO COMPLETE A CYCLE OF ACTION ON A PRECLEAR.A CYCLE OF ACTION IS REDEFINED AS START—CONTINUE—COMPLETE.Thus an auditing comm cycle is a cycle of action. It starts with the auditor asking aquestion the preclear can understand, getting the preclear to answer it and acknowledging thatanswer.A process cycle is selecting a process to be run on the preclear, running the Tone Armaction into it (if necessary) and running the Tone Arm action out of it.A programme cycle is selecting an action to be performed, performing that action andcompleting it.Thus you can see that an auditor who interrupts or changes an auditing comm cycle beforeit is complete is “Q and A-ing”. This could be done by violating or preventing or not doing anypart of the auditing cycle, i.e., ask the pc a question, get an answer to a different idea, ask thedifferent idea, thus abandoning the original question.An auditor who starts a process, just gets it going, gets a new idea because of pccognition, takes up the cognition and abandons the original process is Q and A-ing.A programme such as “Prepcheck this pc’s family” is begun, and for any reason leftincomplete to go chasing some new idea to Prepcheck, is a Q and A.Unfinished cycles of action are all that louse up cases.Since Time is a continuum, a failure to carry out a cycle of action (a continuum) hangs thepc up at that exact point.If you don’t believe it, prepcheck “Incomplete actions” on a pc! What Incomplete action"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"has been suppressed? etc, cleaning the meter for real on every button.

It comes fromcomputer technology where all data is in a “bank”.)The difference between auditors is not that one has more data than another or more tricks.The difference is that one auditor will get better results than another due to his stricter adherenceto procedure, better TRs, more confident manner, and closer observance of the Auditor’sCode.No “bedside manner” is required or sympathetic expression. It’s just that an auditor whoknows his procedures and has good TRs inspires more confidence.

Thus if you run out the force thewords drop into insignificance. This is often how the pc gets cognitions: the words andmeaning concealed in the engram are changing value and devaluating. The pc can then thinkclearly again on a subject previously pinned down by the force. Get the force out and the wordstake care of themselves and need no special handling.The meaning of things plays a secondary role in processing to forces.Thetans find counter-forces objectionable. Almost all chronic (continual) somatics havetheir root in force of one kind or another.In that the handling of things with bodies involves force to greater or lesser degree,incapability and derangement of mental values is proportional to the thetan’s objection to force.This objection descends down to a wish to stop things. It goes below that intooverwhelmedness in which propitiation and obsessive agreement manifest themselves.LOW TAsThe low TA is a symptom of an overwhelmed being.When a pc’s TA goes low he is being overwhelmed by too heavy a process, too steep agradient in applying processes or by rough TRs or invalidative auditing or auditing errors.A low TA means that the thetan has gone past a desire to stop things and is likely tobehave in life as though unable to resist real or imaginary forces.HIGH TAChronically high TAs mean the person can still stop things and is trying to do so.However, all one has to do is restimulate and leave unflat an engram chain to have a highTA. High TA is reflecting the force contained in the chain.An “over-run” means doing something too long that has engrams connected with it whichmeans an engram chain with too many engrams on it being restimulated by life or auditing.Hence Over-run."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"If this overrun persisted unhandled eventually the pc would be overwhelmed and one, intheory, would have a low TA.MENTAL MASSESMental masses, forces, energy are the items being handled by the C/S on any pc.If the C/S loses sight of this he can wander off the road and go into the thickets ofsignificance.Engrams, secondaries, locks all add up to mental masses, forces, energies, time, whichexpress themselves in countless different ways such as pain, misemotion, feelings, oldperceptions and a billion billion thought combinations buried in the masses as significances.A thetan can postulate or say or reason anything. Thus there is an infinity ofsignificances.A thetan is natively capable of logical thought. This becomes muddied by out-points heldin by mental forces such as pictures of heavy experiences.As the masses and forces accumulated and copied from living build up, the logic potentialbecomes reduced and illogical results occur.PC SEARCHThe pc is continually searching for the significance of a mass or force—what is it, why isit.The C/S is easily led astray by this.All forces in the bank contain significances.All forces can be unburdened and lightened up by the various procedures of auditing.The search of the pc is for significance.The action of the C/S is reduction of forces.THE E-METERThe E-Meter records what force is being discharged in every slash, fall and blowdown.The amount of TA per session is the C/S’s index of gain.Note that a discharged process no longer gives TA and gives case gain.The amount of significance recovered or realized by the pc only shows up as cognitions.As the TA works off the case, then one has two indicators:1. There is needle and TA action.2. The pc cognites.One shows that force is coming off. Two shows that thought is releasing from force.BACKWARDS C/SingIf a C/S processes toward significance only he will get cases that do not progress.The needle action detects not so much significance as where the force is."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Diving toward significance the C/S winds up shortening grades, looking for “magic one-shot buttons” and overwhelming cases by shooting them on up the grades while levels remainloaded with force.RELIABLE INDICATORSWhen a pc gets no more TA action on Level I he will have made Level I and will know it.He will therefore attest to “No problems”.The reliable indicators are TA action and cognitions while a level is still charged.Diminished TA action and cognitions mean the purpose of the level has been reached.A feeling of freedom and expansion on a subject is expressed in a normal TA and a looseneedle.The pc will now attest to an ability regained.F/N ABUSETo process only to F/N and even chop off the cognitions on a process abuses theindicator of the F/N.You can find many pcs who bitterly resent F/N indications. They have been:A. Not run on all the processes of a level;B. Still have force on the subject;C. Were chopped off before they could cognite.The ARC Break in this is UNFINISHED CYCLE OF ACTION.The proper End Phenomena for a process is F/N Cognition VGIs. Now look at thatcarefully. That is the proper end phenomena of a PROCESS. It is not the end phenomena of aLEVEL or even of a TYPE of process.Let us say there are 15 possible Scientology processes for orienting a pc in his presentlocation.To run one of these 15 and say, “F/N that’s it. You’re complete,” is a Quickie impatientaction that rebounds on the pc eventually. If there are 15, run 15 !Possibly the pc on no. 12 will cognite he’s really right where he is. Only then could youcease to work at it.An F/N Cog VGIs tells you a process is finished, not a whole class of actions!Thus 2l/2 minutes from 0 to IV is not only impossible, it is murderous. It will result in anoverwhelm, a low TA or a high TA eventually.Level I says, amongst other things, “Problems Processes”. There are certainly half adozen. Each would be run to F/N Cog VGIs. When these and the other processes of the Levelare run, the pc will come to have no further reaction to problems and will be able to handlethem.A cognition in lower levels is not necessarily an ability regained. Thirty or fortycognitions on one lower level might add up to (and probably would) the realization that one isfree of the whole subject of the level."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"It is safe to run more processes. It is unsafe to run too few.PC ABILITIESIt is not enough for the pc to have only negative gains of deleting force. Sooner or later hewill have to begin to confront force.This comes along naturally and is sometimes aided by processes directly aimed at furtherconfront. “What problem could you have?” sooner or later is needed in one form or another.What force can the pc now handle?All auditing in a body—and any living in a body—makes a being vulnerable. Bodiesbreak, suffer, intensify pain.Sooner or later a pc will go Exterior. The Interiorization Rundown must be ordered as thenext action or you will have a pc with a high TA. 2-way comm Ext-Int must be given in afollowing session (not the same one) so the full cognitions will occur.After this the pc is less subject to the body and his ability to confront force will improve.Do not be too worried or surprised if after this the pc has some minor accident with thebody. Exterior he forgets its frailty. However, such things are minor. He is “learning how towalk” a new way and will run into chairs! He gets this figured out after a while.Pcs sometimes improve their ability to handle force while interior so as to havemysterious headaches or new body pressures. Inevitably they have been exterior and needInteriorization run. They were just using too much force while still inside !Thus force is the thing, significance very secondary.Force of course is made up of time, matter, energy, flows, particles, masses, solids,liquids, gasses, space and locations. All this gets inherently handled in processes publishedlong since.The pc tends to dive for the thought imbedded in the force. He will tell you he’s beingprocessed to find out who his parents were or why he is sterile or who did him in, etc, etc. TheC/S who chases after this is a deerhound illegally chasing mice!C/S PURPOSEThe C/S is there to make certain that the pc makes gains and attains the actual abilities ofthe level.The C/S is for the pc.C/S auditor control exists only to keep the auditing standard, the TRs good, the processesordered done and to End Phenomena each one.No other reasons for C/Sing exist.L.

Thebasic error is overestimating the case’s ability. All failures stem from a failure to undercut thereality of a case. If that reality level is reached, the case will improve. If not, the case remainsstagnant.RESULTS DEFINED: Case achieves a reality on change of case, somatic, behavior orappearance, for the better.BETTER DEFINED: Negative gain. Things disappear that have been annoying orunwanted.ABILITY GAIN DEFINED: Pc’s recognition that pc can now do things he could not dobefore.INTELLIGENCE GAIN DEFINED: Loss of restimulation of stupidity by reason ofattempts to confront or experience the problems of life. (Intelligence appears when stupidity iskeyed out or erased.) Intelligence is a confronting ability.FAMILIARITY: or familiarization permits intelligence to manifest. Reaching andwithdrawing are more possible when stupidity is keyed out or erased. Increasing ability toreach and withdraw increases intelligence.It can be seen that when attention is fixed, the ability to reach and withdraw decreases,therefore intelligence decreases, therefore the ability to change decreases, therefore no “casegain”.Unfixing attention is done in various ways. As hypnotism is done by fixing attention, aparallel observation is that a person wakes up, receives less fixed effect, when attentionbecomes unfixed.Unfixing attention must be done by increasing ability to reach and withdraw from thespecific thing or person on which attention is fixed in the bank. The bank merely expresses arecording of past attention fixations.Shocks of various kinds can unfix attention but always lead to a decrease in ability over aperiod. Unfixing attention by violence throws a case downscale. As the case goes upscale theattention refixes on things violence unfixed it from.Clearing is a gradient process of finding places where attention is fixed and restoring theability of the pc to place and remove attention under his own determinism.Case Analysis consists then of the determination of where pc’s attention (at current stateof case) is fixed on the track and restoring pc’s determinism over those places.This is done by:1. PT Problem running.2. Dynamic survey and remedy of fixed points."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"3. Selected items and persons survey and unfixing other-determined attention atthose points.The auditor’s skill in locating where attention is now fixed is even greater now than theauditor’s ability to remedy the fixation of the pc’s attention since this latter problem is fairlywell in hand.There are many ways of doing a survey to determine what the pc’s attention is fixed uponnow. The E-Meter and interrogation of the pc are the main methods.“What has your attention been fixed on lately (or ‘in this Life’)?” would elicit a reply thatcould then be used in the questions“Recall a time when you did something to (item or person so located).” “Recall a time when you withheld something from (item or person so selected).”If you find the exact item or person on which attention is fixed, you achieve immediatecase gain, which is to say reality, which is to say interest, in-sessionness, success.If any pc you are running has not manifested case gain, reality, interest, in-sessionness,then one of two things is true:1. You haven’t found the item or person on which pc’s attention is other-determinedlyfixed and haven’t run it yet, or2.

Here theyare given names and assigned to Levels so that they can be taught moreeasily and so that general auditing can be improved.(Note 2: These have not been written before because I had notdetermined the results vital to each Level.)There is a Style of auditing for each class. By Style is meant a method or custom ofperforming actions.A Style is not really determined by the process being run so much. A Style is how theauditor addresses his task.Different processes carry different style requirements perhaps, but that is not the point.Clay Table Healing at Level III can be run with Level I style and still have some gains. But anauditor trained up to the style required at Level III would do a better job not only of CT Healingbut of any repetitive process.Style is how the auditor audits. The real expert can do them all, but only after he can doeach one. Style is a mark of Class. It is not individual. In our meaning, it is a distinct way tohandle the tools of auditing.LEVEL ZEROLISTEN STYLEAt Level 0 the Style is Listen Style Auditing. Here the auditor is expected to listen to thepc. The only skill necessary is listening to another. As soon as it is ascertained that the auditoris listening (not just confronting or ignoring) the auditor can be checked out. The length of timean auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be a factor. What the pc does isnot a factor considered in judging this style. Pcs, however, talk to an auditor who is reallylistening.Here we have the highest point that old-time mental therapies reached (when they didreach it), such as psychoanalysis, when they helped anyone. Mostly they were well below this,evaluating, invalidating, interrupting. These three things are what the instructor in this styleshould try to put across to the HAS student.Listen Style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this:Listen to the pc without evaluating, invalidating or interrupting.Adding on higher skills like “Is the pc talking interestingly?” or even “Is the pc talking?”is no part of this style. When this auditor gets in trouble and the pc won’t talk or isn’tinterested, a higher classed auditor is called in, a new question given by the supervisor, etc.It really isn’t “Itsa” to be very technical. Itsa is the action of the pc saying, “It’s a this” or“It’s a that.” Getting the pc to Itsa is quite beyond Listen Style auditors where the pc won’t. It’sthe supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to Itsa."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"The ability to listen, learned well, stays with the auditor up through the grades. Onedoesn’t cease to use it even at Level VI. But one has to learn it somewhere and that’s at LevelZero. So Listen Style Auditing is just listening. It thereafter adds into the other styles.LEVEL ONEMUZZLED AUDITINGThis could also be called rote style auditing.Muzzled Auditing has been with us many years. It is the stark total of TRs 0 to 4 and notanything else added.It is called so because auditors too often added in comments, Qed and Aed, deviated,discussed and otherwise messed up a session. Muzzle meant a “muzzle was put on them”,figuratively speaking, so they would only state the auditing command and ack.Repetitive Command Auditing, using TRs 0 to 4, at Level One is done completelymuzzled.This could be called Muzzled Repetitive Auditing Style but will be called “Muzzled Style”for the sake of brevity.It has been a matter of long experience that pcs who didn’t make gains with the partiallytrained auditor permitted to two-way comm, did make gains the instant the auditor wasmuzzled: to wit, not permitted to do a thing but run the process, permitted to say nothing butthe commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgmentwithout any other question or comment.At Level One we don’t expect the auditor to do anything but state the command (or ask thequestion) with no variation, acknowledge the pc’s answer and handle the pc origins byunderstanding and acknowledging what the pc said.Those processes used at Level One actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst tomisguided efforts to “Two-Way Comm”.Listen Style combines with Muzzled Style easily. But watch out that Level One sessionsdon’t disintegrate to Level Zero.Crisp, clean repetitive commands, muzzled, given and answered often, are the road out—not pc wanderings.A pc at this Level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him, exactly what the auditorwill do. The pc is even put through a few “do birds fly?” cycles until the pc gets the idea. Thenthe processing works.An auditor trying to do Muzzled Repetitive Auditing on a pc who, through past “therapyexperience”, is rambling on and on is a sad sight. It means that control is out (or that the pcnever got above Level Zero).It’s the number of commands given and answered in a unit of auditing time that gets gains.To that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have a release in short order, usingthe processes of this Level.To follow limp Listen Style with crisp, controlled Muzzled Style may be a shock. But theyare each the lowest of the two families of auditing styles—Totally Permissive and TotallyControlled. And they are so different each is easy to learn with no confusion. It’s been the lackof difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about. Well, these two are"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"different enough—Listen Style and Muzzled Style—to set anybody straight.LEVEL TWOGUIDING STYLE AUDITINGAn old-time auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names: (a) Two-Way Comm and (b) Formal Auditing.We condense these two old styles under one new name: Guiding Style Auditing.One first guides the pc by “two-way comm” into some subject that has to be handled orinto revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitivecommands.Guiding Style Auditing becomes feasible only when a student can do Listen Style andMuzzled Style Auditing well.Formerly the student who couldn’t confront or duplicate a command took refuge insloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or “Two-Way Comm”.The first thing to know about Guiding Style is that one lets the pc talk and Itsa withoutchop, but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitivecommands.We presuppose the auditor at this Level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy theviewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc. We also presuppose at thisLevel that the auditor, being able to occupy a viewpoint, is therefore more self-determined, thetwo things being related. (One can only be self-determined when one can observe the actualsituation before one: otherwise a being is delusion-determined or other-determined.)Thus in Guiding Style Auditing, the auditor is there to find out what’s what from the pcand then apply the needful remedy.Most of the processes in the Book of Remedies are included in this Level (II). To usethose, one has to observe the pc, discover what the pc is doing, and remedy the pc’s caseaccordingly.The result for the pc is a far-reaching re-orientation in Life.Thus the essentials of Guiding Style Auditing consist of Two-Way Comm that steers thepc into revealing a difficulty followed by a repetitive process to handle what has been revealed.One does expert TRs but one may discuss things with the pc, let the pc talk and in generalone audits the pc before one, establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisprepetitive auditing, but all the while alert to changes in the pc.One runs at this Level against Tone Arm Action, paying little or no heed to the needleexcept as a centering device for TA position. One even establishes what’s to be done by theaction of the Tone Arm. (The process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fellwhen he was running what’s being run, now belongs at this Level (II) and will be re-numberedaccordingly.)At II one expects to handle a lot of chronic PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks with Life (but notsession ARC Breaks, that being a needle action, session ARC Breaks being sorted out by ahigher classed auditor if they occur).To get such things done (PTPs, overts and other remedies) in the session the auditor must"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"have a pc “willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties”. That presupposes we have anauditor at this Level who can ask questions, not repetitive, that guide the pc into talking aboutthe difficulty that needs to be handled.Great command of TR 4 is the primary difference in TRs from Level I. One understands,when one doesn’t, by asking more questions, and by really acknowledging only when one hasreally understood it.Guided comm is the clue to control at this Level. One should easily guide the pc’s commin and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time. As soon as an auditorgets the idea of finite result or, that is to say, a specific and definite result expected, all this iseasy. Pc has a PTP. Example: Auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimulate thePTP so pc is not bothered about it (and isn’t being driven to do something about it) as the finiteresult.The auditor at II is trained to audit the pc before him, get the pc into comm, guide the pctoward data needful to choose a process and then to run the process necessary to resolve thatthing found, usually by repetitive command and always by TA.The Book of Remedies is the key to this Level and this auditing style.One listens but only to what one has guided the pc into. One runs repetitive commandswith good TR 4. And one may search around for quite a while before one is satisfied he has theanswer from the pc needful to resolve a certain aspect of the pc’s case.O/W can be run at Level I. But at Level II one may guide the pc into divulging what thepc considers a real overt act and, having that, then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasn’tan overt and so eventually blow it.Half-acknowledgment is also taught at Level II—the ways of keeping a pc talking bygiving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone TR 2.Big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going offthe subject.LEVEL IIIABRIDGED STYLE AUDITINGBy Abridged is meant “abbreviated”, shorn of extras. Any not actually needful auditingcommand is deleted.For instance, at Level I the auditor always says, when the pc wanders off the subject, “Iwill repeat the auditing command” and does so. In Abridged Style the auditor omits this when itisn’t necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it.In this style we have shifted from pure rote to a sensible use or omission as needful. Westill use repetitive commands expertly, but we don’t use rote that is unnecessary to thesituation.Two-Way Comm comes into its own at Level III. But with heavy use of repetitivecommands.At this Level we have as the primary process, Clay Table Healing. In this an auditor mustmake sure the commands are followed exactly. No auditing command is ever let go of until thatactual command is answered by the pc.But at the same time, one doesn’t necessarily give every auditing command the processhas in its rundown."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"In Clay Table Healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time. This isdone more often by observation than command. Yet it is done.We suppose at III that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe.Thus we see the pc is satisfied and don’t mention it. Thus we see when the pc is not certain andso we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question.On the other hand, one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and getsthem executed.Prepchecking and needle usage is taught at Level III as well as Clay Table Healing.Auditing by List is also taught. In Abridged Style Auditing one may find the pc (being cleanedup on a list question) giving half a dozen answers in a rush. One doesn’t stop the pc fromdoing so, one half acknowledges, and lets the pc go on. One is in actual fact handling a biggerauditing comm cycle, that is all. The question elicits more than one answer which is really onlyone answer. And when that answer is given, it is acknowledged.One sees when a needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate allthe pc’s relief. And one sees it isn’t clean by the continued puzzle on the pc’s face.There are tricks involved here. One asks a question of the pc with the key word in it andnotes that the needle doesn’t tremble, and so concludes the question about the word is flat. Andso doesn’t check it again. Example: “Has anything else been suppressed?” One eye on pc, oneon needle, needle didn’t quiver. Pc looks noncommittal. Auditor says, “All right, on “ andgoes on to next question, eliminating a pc’s possible protest read that can be mistaken foranother “suppress”.In Abridged Style Auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it impedescase advance. But that doesn’t mean one wanders about. One is even more crisp and thoroughwith Abridged Style Auditing than in rote.One is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected result.By “Abridged” is meant getting the exact job done—the shortest way between twopoints—with no waste questions.By now the student should know that he runs a process to achieve an exact result and hegets the process run in a way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time.The student is taught to guide rapidly, to have no time for wide excursions.The processes at this Level are all rat-a-tat-tat processes—CT Healing, Prepchecking,Auditing by List.Again it’s the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time thatmakes for speed of result.LEVEL IVDIRECT STYLE AUDITINGBy direct we mean straight, concentrated, intense, applied in a direct manner.We do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide. We mean it isdirect.By direct, we don’t mean frank or choppy. On the contrary, we put the pc’s attention onhis bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"It could also mean that we are not auditing by vias. We are auditing straight at the thingsthat need to be reached to make somebody clear.Other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed.At Level IV we have Clay Table Clearing and we have Assessment type processes.These two types of process are both astonishingly direct. They are aimed directly at theReactive Mind. They are done in a direct manner.In CT Clearing we have almost total work and Itsa from pcs. From one end of a sessionto another, we may have only a few auditing commands. For a pc on CT Clearing does almostall the work if he is in session at all.Thus we have another implication in the word “direct”. The pc is talking directly to theauditor about what he is making and why in CT Clearing. The auditor hardly ever talks at all.In assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pc’s bank and wants no pc in front of itthinking, speculating, maundering or Itsaing. Thus this assessment is a very direct action.All this requires easy, smooth, steel-hand-in-a-velvet-glove control of the pc. It lookseasy and relaxed as a style, it is straight as a Toledo blade.The trick is to be direct in what’s wanted and not deviate. The auditor settles what’s to bedone, gives the command and then the pc may work for a long time, the auditor alert, attentive,completely relaxed.In assessment the auditor often pays no attention to the pc at all, as in ARC Breaks orassessing lists. Indeed, a pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of a list.And in CT Clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at a stretch.The tests are: Can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without ARC Breakingthe pc? Can the auditor order the pc to do something and then, the pc working on it, can theauditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour, understanding everything and interrupt alertlyonly when he doesn’t understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him? Again without ARCBreaking the pc.You could confuse this Direct Style with Listen Style if you merely glanced at a sessionof CT Clearing. But what a difference. In Listen Style the pc is blundering on and on and on.In Direct Style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to Itsa, let us say, with no claywork and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay, you’d see theauditor, quick as a foil, look at the pc, very interestedly and say, “Let’s see that in Clay.” Orthe pc doesn’t really give an ability he wants to improve and you’d hear a quiet persuasiveauditor voice, “Are you quite certain you want to improve that? Sounds like a goal to me. Justsomething, some ability you know, you’d like to improve.”You could call this style One-Way Auditing. When the pc is given his orders, after thatit’s all from the pc to the auditor, and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruction.When the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc. Only when the assessmentaction hits a snag like a PTP is there any other auditing style used.This is a very extreme auditing style. It is straightforward—direct.But when needful, as in any Level, the styles learned below it are often also employed,but never in the actual actions of getting CT Clearing and Assessment done.(Note: Level V would be the same style as VI below.)"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"LEVEL VIALL STYLESo far, we have dealt with simple actions.Now we have an auditor handling a meter and a pc who Itsa’s and Cognites and getsPTPs and ARC Breaks and Line Charges and Cognites and who finds Items and lists and whomust be handled, handled, handled all the way.As auditing TA for a 21/2 hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions (compared to 10 or15 for the lowest level), the pace of the session is greater. It is this pace that makes perfectability at each lower level vital when they combine into All Style. For each is now faster.So, we learn All Style by learning each of the lower styles well, and then observe andapply the style needed every time it is needed, shifting styles as often as once every minute!The best way to learn All Style is to become expert at each lower style so that one doesthe style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs.It is less rough than it looks. But it is also very demanding.Use the wrong style on a situation and you’ve had it. ARC Break! No progress!Example: Right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty. The auditor can’tcontinue—or shouldn’t. The auditor, in Direct Style, looks up to see a-puzzled frown. Theauditor has to shift to Guiding Style to find out what ails the pc (who probably doesn’t reallyknow), then to Listen Style while the pc cognites on a chronic PTP that just emerged andbothered the pc, then to Direct Style to finish the Assessment that was in progress.The only way an auditor can get confused by All Style is by not being good at one of thelower level styles.Careful inspection will show where the student using All Style is slipping. One then getsthe student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it a bit.So All Style, when poorly done, is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one ormore of the lower level styles. And as all these can be independently taught, the whole can beco-ordinated. All Style is hard to do only when one hasn’t mastered one of the lower levelstyles.SUMMARYThese are the important Styles of Auditing. There have been others but they are onlyvariations of those given in this HCO Bulletin. Tone 40 Style is the most notable one missing.It remains as a practice style at Level One to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to gethis command obeyed. It is no longer used in practice.As it was necessary to have every result and every process for each Level to finalizeStyles of Auditing, I left this until last and here it is.Please note that none of these Styles violate the auditing comm cycle or the TRs.LRH :jw.rd L.

Always have a good dictionary in the auditing room. Have a copy of the ScientologyDictionary and any other materials necessary to define Scientology terms.If the PC’s native language is not English, have a dual dictionary for that language andEnglish. A simple grammar book may also be required. For a foreign language case oneshould also have a dictionary of the foreign language itself.Eg. English “apple” - looks in English/French, finas “pomme” - looks in Frenchdictionary to define “pomme”. So for the foreign language case 2 dictionaries are needed- (1) English - to foreign language, (2) foreign language itself.2. Clear the commands (or questions or list items) by first clearing in turn each word inbackwards sequence of the words in the command. (Eg. if command is “Do fish swim?”clear “swim” then “fish” then “do”). This prevents the PC starting to run the process byhimself while you are still clearing the words.3. What a word reads when clearing an assessment or listing question does not mean that thequestion has read. Misunderstood words read on the meter.4. F/Ns obtained on clearing the,words does not mean the process has been run.5. Next, clear the command itself. Auditor asks the PCs “What does this command mean toyou?” LRH. If it is evident from the PC’s answer that he has misunderstood a word as it isused in the context of the commands.a. reclear the obvious word (or words) with the dictionary.b. have him use each word in a sentence until he has it. (Clear all definitions of a misunderstood word.)c. reclear the command.d. If necessary, repeat steps 2 & 3 to make sure he understands the command.e. “Under no circumstances is the auditor to evaluate for the PC and tell him what theword or command means.” LRH6. You clear the first command (or bracket) that you are going to run, then run it. Then clearthe second command (or bracket) and run it etc. Don’t clear more than one command (orbracket) at a time.7. When,clearing the command, watch the meter and note any read on the command (per"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"HCO B 28 Feb ‘71 C/S Series 24 “Metering Reading Items”)8. Have the PC on the cans throughout the clearing of the words and commands - except whenthe PC is doing demos as needed. The Auditor holds the dictionary ,for the PC.9. As it is difficult to clear all the words of a correction list on a PC over heavy by-passedcharge, it is standard to clear the words of an L1C and Ruds - very early in auditing and toclear an L4BRA before commencing listing processes or an L3RF before running R3R.When the need for those correction lists arises one does not then need to clear all the wordsas it has already been done, thus such corrective lists can be used when needed withoutdelay.“ARC breaks and lists should be word cleared before a PC gets into them and should betagged in a folder, on, a yellow sheet as cleared.” LRHIt is also standard to clear the words of the Word Clearing correction list early in auditingand before other correction lists are cleared. This way, if the PC bogs on subsequent wordclearing, you have your Word Clearing Correction list ready to use.10. However, if, for example, your PC is sitting in the middle of an ARC Break (or other heavycharge) and the words of the L1C (or other correction list) have not been cleared yet, yougo ahead and assess the list to handle the charge. “Don’t clear first. Just verify by askingafterwards if he had any misunderstoods on the list...(otherwise it’s auditing after an ARCBreak).” LRHAll the words of the L1C (or other correction list) would then be cleared thoroughly at thefirst opportunity - per your C/S’s instruction.11. Do not re-clear all the words of assessment lists each time the list is used on the same PC. Doit once, fully and properly the first time and note clearly in the folder, on a yellow sheet forfuture reference, which of the standard assessment lists have been cleared.12. These rules apply to all processes, listing questions and assessments.13. The words of the platens of Advanced Course materials are not so cleared.__________________Any violation of full and correct clearing of commands or assessment questions, whetherdone in a formal session or not, is an ethics offence per HCO PL 4 April 1972 (revised 7 April72) “Ethics and Study Tech” section 4, which states:“ANY AUDITOR FAILING TO CLEAR EACH AND EVERY WORD OF EVERYCOMMAND OR LIST USED MAY BE SUMMONED BEFORE A COURT OF ETHICS.The charge is OUT-TECH.” LRHRevised byTraining & Services AideApproved byL.

The First number indicates the level taughton. Those that begin with TR-100 are level I drills. Unbullbaited drills end with odd numbers,and bullbaited drills end in even numbers.The drills are done within the basic format of the bullbaited and unbullbaited drills as inthe front of this issue.Simply start with the first actions and work through the pack applying the drillsunbullbaited and bullbaited until you are thoroughly familiar with each separate auditing actionand can apply it flawlessly even with distractions.If a student has trouble on a drill cut back the gradient. On a bullbaited drill this couldmean returning the student to the drill on a doll or even to TR 0-4.IMPORTANT: ALSO CHECK THAT THE STUDENT HIMSELF HAS NOMISUNDERSTOOD WORDS 0N THE HCOB OR DRILL AS THIS WILL CAUSE HIM TOALTER—IS AND HAVE DIFFICULTY. ALWAYS COACH ON A GRADIENT ANDBUILT THEM UP TO GET TOUGH!NOTE: If coach upset occurs because of restimulation, fruit words should be inserted in theplace of the process Key Words, for bullbaited drills only.FORMAT FOR UNBULLBAITED DRILLSNAME: Auditing on a Doll unbullbaited.COMMANDS: As for each separate process.PURPOSE: To train the student to be able to coordinate and apply the commands andprocedures of each separate auditing action with the actual doingness of auditing.POSITION: Student seated at a table with E-meter, worksheets and auditing forms as needed.In the chair opposite the student is a doll occupying the position of the pc. (During checkoutsthe coach is seated or standing beside the auditor. He does not take the position of the doll.)TRAINING STRESS: This drill is coached. The student sets up the E-Meter and worksheetsexactly as in a session as follows:(1) Set up E-Meter as for E-Meter drills."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"(2) Set up shield (to prevent TA and admin being seen by pc (doll).(3) Have extra pens under the E-Meter(4) Have C/S face down between the bottom of the E-Meter and the table.(5) Have W/S and Lists readily available in sequence required for the session.Auditor starts the session and runs a standard session with the particular auditing actionbeing taken up on the doll, keeping full session admin and using all standard procedures of theauditing action.The drill is done on a steeper and steeper gradient until the student can very quickly do theaction correctly.The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with good TRs 0-4,correct procedure and commands without comm lags or confusion; i.e.. flawlessly.FORMAT FOR BULLBAITED DRILLSNAME: Auditing _____________Bullbaited.COMMANDS: As for each separate auditing action.PURPOSE: Do train the student to be able to coordinate and apply the commands andprocedures of each separate auditing action in a drill similar to a real auditing session andthereby become flawless in applying it.POSITION: Student seated at a table with E-Meter and auditor forms, as needed. In the chairopposite the auditor is the coach (bullbaiter), as pc.TRAINING STRESS: The drill is the same as for auditing on a the “pc” coach bullbaits thestudent auditor, using “fruit answers” during the session in an attempt to throw the student offsession. The coach does not “look” for and “find” real answers. He must not go “into session”like a pc but must remain with his coach’s hat on and pretending to be a pc. On any list thecoach squeezes the cans to simulate reads. He still uses “fruit answers” (six apples, blue pears)when asked to speak, but as the student auditor reads off the list items (e.g.; L3RD he squeezesthe cans for reads.)When bullbaiting an auditing action the coach should THROW IN VARIOUS SIGNS OFPC OUT OF SESSIONESS. (Per HCOB on good and bad indicators) The student auditormust:(1) Obnose the out of sessionness(2) Align this to the process run(3) HandleThe pc bullbaiter can throw in situations originate troubles, or gains, be tricky etc., but hemust never lose sight of HCOB 24 May 1968 “Coaching” especially the second paragraph“coach with reality”.Once the coach throws out a situation, etc. he must allow the student auditor to carry itout, and handle the situation before the coach calls a new situation.Before the coach gives the student any situations, he should first ensure the student caneasily do the auditing action in a forward direction without fumbling or flubbing commands.Stress is on training the student auditor to have TRs 0-4 IN on the bullbaiter.The coach (bullbaiter) does the “start”, flunking or “that’s it”. Flunks are given for anyimproper commands, procedure, comm lags, break in TRs or improper session admin."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Each drill is to be done thoroughly, building up the speed of auditor commands andactions. (It’s the number of auditing commands per unit of auditing time which makes gains ina session.” LRH)The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with excellent TRs 0-4,correct procedure and commands without comm lags or confusion.These are the drills that train the student auditor to handle all the elements in a session sobe exact and be real.GRADE I EXPANDED PROCESSESCCHsrefs:HCOB 2 AUG 62 CCH AnswersHCOB 7 AUG 62 CCHs More InfoHCOB 1 DEC 65 CCHsBTB 12 SEP 65 CCH DataTR 100-1 CCH’S 1 - 4 UNBULLBAITEDTR 100-2 CCH’S 1 - 4 BULLBAITEDNOTE: The coach must be a coach and not a real pc. He must keep his coach hat on and notget driven “into session”. If any difficulty arises the coach carries a doll and makes it do theactions and has the student address the commands to the doll.STEPS: (Use Basic Drill Format, change position as needed to do the steps)1.Select an auditing room large enough and suitable for the pc to be able to walk from wallto wall.2.Before session set up the room with a meter so the pc can be put on the cans as necessaryand so that session can proceed without having to dismantle and re-assemble the meter setup.3. Take the pc into session and put on the meter, as in the start of any ordinary meteredsession.4. Fly a rud- (Or have upper class auditor Two Way Comm to F/N according to C/Sinstructions.) Keep normal session admin.5. R-factor. “We are now going to do CCHs. This process is done off the meter. First we’llclear the commands”. Clear what CCH stands for. Clear any words necessary then clearthe commands, explain this is a repetitive process. (Ensure the pc really understands this)6.Move pc and self away from meter and table, Sit facing pc (both seated comfortably - it isbest to use armless chairs for this process.) The pc’s knees are between the auditor’s. Theauditor is seated nearest the door.7. Don’t go into a discussion of the process. Just say “We will now run CCH 1; this is theprocess”Raise your right hand to just above waist height halfway between your body and the pc.Hand held open.8. Give Tone 40 command “Give me that hand” Indicate pc’s right hand by slight nod.9. When pc has put his right hand in the auditor’s give an acknowledgment, “Thank you.”"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"10. Take the pc’s right wrist by your left hand and return the pc’s hand to the pc’s side.11. Repeat from the second part of step 7 through step 10 continue until the pc has done so to3 equal consecutive comm lags.12. Take up any new physical manifestations as pc origination’s by saying, “Whathappened?” Never stop the process until a flat place is reached.Freezes may be introduced at the end of cycle, this being after the “Thank you” andbefore the next command. They are used to ascertain information from the pc or to bridgefrom the process. This is done between 2 commands holding the pc’s hand after the ack,maintaining a solid comm line. Make every command and cycle separate maintaining aTone 40 intention on commands.13. If pc doesn’t give you his hand after the command and waiting a normal response period,take the pc’s right hand in your left hand and place the pc’s hand in your right. Thenacknowledge the pc. Ask “What happened?”. Accept whatever the pc says and continue.14. After 3 consecutive commands with the pc actually doing the commands and of equalcomm lag without any new physical changes CCH 1 is considered flat for this cyclethrough.15.Tell pc “We will now run CCH 2.” Clear words and commands. Tell pc the commandswill be run repetitively ensuring he understands this.16.Stand up, move chairs to side of auditing room leaving an unobstructed walk betweentwo opposite walls of the room. Stand to the right of the pct with the pc facing theopposite wall (keeping to the pc’s right). “Thank you.”17.Give the command (Tone 40) “You look at that wall.” Indicate the wall by pointing.“Thank you”.18.“You walk over to that wall,” Walk with pc to opposite wall (keeping to pc’s right).“Thank you.”19.“You touch that wall.” “Thank you”.20.“Turn around.” As pc turns around move in 2 steps to a position just in front of the pc(facing pc). “Thank you”. Then move to pc’s right.21.Repeat 17 to 21 until the process is flat (3 consecutive sequences of commands with pcdoing the process and no new physical manifestations or change of comm lag.)22.Take up any new physical change as a pc origination as it occurs with “What happened?”,maintaining a solid comm line while doing so. (i.e.: hand on arm or shoulder)23.When CCH 2 is flat tell pc “We will now run CCH 3.” Clear Commands and tell pc thisprocess will be run repetitively ensuring he understands this.24.Return to the two chairs set up as in CCH 1.25.Raise both hands palms open facing pct hands about shoulder height and half waybetween auditor and pc.26.Give command (not Tone 40) “Put your hands against mine, follow them and contributeto their motion.”27.When pc has hands against auditor’s, move first the right hand, then the left hand in a"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"simple motion. Straight line motions are simpler than curved motions. Make the motionsfairly slow, very positive and smooth. (TONE 40 INTENTION IN THE MOTIONS.)28.After the motion is done with the right then left and both hands returned to startingposition, (pc’s hands still raised against auditors) ask “Did you contribute to themotion?”.Usually the pc says yes, if so, acknowledge, “Thank you” and allow pc to break the solidcomm line, without telling him to.If the pc is not happy that he did contribute to the motion, you can repeat the samemotion.29.Repeat steps 26 to 28 each time varying the motion a little. You can increase thecomplexity slightly but don’t get too complicated.30.Include in your drilling the change over to hand space mimicry. The change occurs on therun through the CCHs after contact mimicry is flat with no change, i.e.: CCH 1, 2, 3(HCM with change) 4, 1, 2, 3 (HCM with change) 4, 1, 2, 3 (HCM 3 commands only,no change) 4, 1, 2, 5 (hand space mimicry) .31.After 3 consecutive cycles with the pc actually doing the process and no new physicalchange or change of comm lag, tell pc “We will now run CCH 4.”32.Remain seated in chairs as in CCH 5. Take up a book.(a light hard covered book with aplain cover is best) Explain to the pc that you are going to make a motion with the book.When you have done so, you want him to duplicate the motion. Clear DUPLICATE inthe dictionary and as ‘making the same motion in the same space’. Do not evaluate it asmirror image wise.33.When the pc understands, then hold the book steady in a comfortable position betweenauditor and pc. Make a simple Tone 40 motion of the book (similar to CCH 3 typemotions). Complete the action at the starting point, pause, then hand the book to the pc-(Don’t tell him to take it, just move it slightly toward him and look at the pc as thoughoffering him the book.) The pc then takes the book and repeats the motion mirror imagewise.34.After the pc has repeated the action ask “Did you duplicate that motion?” or “How did youget on with that one?” (Not a rote question - friendly, 2 way comm quite free.) (Tone 40in motions only)35.If the pc is happy with it, then do a new motion.36.If pc says he wasn’t happy that he duplicated it, then do it again and then keep themotions very simple to improve pc confidence.37.If pc says he was happy with it but the auditor sees it was obviously misduplicated, justacknowledge him; start a new cycle doing just the first part of the motion and have himduplicate that and then building it up until the pc duplicates the full motion.38.Don’t invalidate the pc by continuing to repeat motions he is happy with. Never say orindicate by facial expression that he didn’t really duplicate the motion, Repeat 32 to 38 tothree consecutive no change sequences.Repeat CCH 1, 2, 3 & 4 through and through until(A) all are flat on one run through.(B) Or until pc has Good cog with VGIs.(C) Or pc exteriorizes."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"39.On step 38 on A or B put the pc on cans, check for TA position and F/N.

We explain to him (and we explain this every command) “Now I want you to get yourbody moving down the room when I so indicate and when I tell you to stand still I wantyou to make that body stand still, Do you understand that?” The preclear says he does,the auditor acknowledges. Then the auditor gives the pc a slight shove and the preclearmoves the body down the room, and the auditor says “Stand Still” and the preclear triesto get his body absolutely still in that instant. The auditor then says “Did you make thatbody stand still?” The pc answers and the auditor acknowledges.7.

Ron Hubbard of theALL RIGHTS RESERVEDCHURCHES OF SCIENTOLOGY"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"RUNNING CCHsA lecture given on22 June 1961All right. I’d better cover the running of the CCHs just for fun just for fun, just as an amusingactivity that, of course, has no relationship to anybody that’s ever going to make a mistake—particularly here.And the way the CCHs are run is CCH 1, 2, 3, 4; 1, 2, 3, 4; 1, 2, 3, 4; just like a waltz step.You just continue them over and over and over and over and over and over and over and overand over and over and over. And it is a breach of the Auditor’s Code, Clause 13, to run aprocess longer than it is producing change; and it is a breach of the Auditor’s Code, Clause 13,to cease to run a process that is producing change. And nothing we are doing these days hasexceeded the Auditor’s Code in any way, shape or form.The odd part of it is, the more we seem to change our minds, the more they remain the same, asfar as what we’re doing is concerned. People who accuse us, you see, of always changing ourminds miss the point that we haven’t changed very many fundamentals. But we’ve sure beenlooking for an opening in other people’s minds, and CCH is one of them.And the CCHs were basically pioneered, I see, back in about 1956. And that is the first waythey were run, and that is the way they produce the maximum change. And after that, I didn’tpay too much attention to them, and they slopped into very careless ways. And people startedadding additives to them; that is the usual thing that happens. And people started to endurewhile running them, and it hadn’t anything to do with the CCHs.Hence I’m calling this back to your attention. Commands have been added to them, like “Putyour hands back in your lap.” Now, what that has to do with the CCHs, I'm sure I don’tknow, because I never heard of it until I picked it up on a sheet of paper not too long ago.Somebody refined it and I okayed it carelessly and then forgot about it, and so forth. Truth ofthe matter is, the words in a CCH process have practically nothing to do with the process.Now, I had a question on an auditor’s report here the other day, as to whether or not you w erereally supposed to put the person’s hand—or touch the person’s wrist with your other hand. Atleast that’s the way I interpreted the question. Well, how are you going to get the man’s hand?It’s a matter of seizure, as far as you’re concerned; it doesn’t matter whether he’s hanging fromthe chandelier or anything else. You take his wrist delicately between your thumb andforefinger and put his paw in your paw, and you execute the auditing command for him. Andyou continue to do that. It’s always the same repetitive motion; you always do it the same way.And there are exact motions that you go through. I won’t try to describe these verbally; I’drather show you. They’re very simple. For instance, when you’re doing CCH 1, your kneesare interlocked with the PC’s knees. Try to get out of a chair when somebody has got yourknees clamped. You see, you don’t sit back across the room and so on. You do so muchformal auditing that you’ve forgotten that there was an awful heavy routine regimen laid downhere on these CCHs. They were quite precise.Anyway, you’re moved in practically into the PC’s chest, and you’ve got at least one of hisknees between your knees, and he starts anyplace, why, there he is. He isn’t going to get up—not if you close your knees. And furthermore, you should be between him and the door.Always. Your back’s to the door; his face is toward it.Now, he’s got a wide perimeter to leap through to get to the door, but you’re covering all of it.If you’re suspicious of him, back him to the far corner of the room on a CCH 1; so therefore hehas to walk through you to get to the door. And you don’t lose PCs. I mean, they sit there and"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"run CCH 1, that’s all.You do a certain routine with your hands, and you present the hand into your hand, and youdon’t shake it and wish him happy days and all that sort of . . . He has given you his hand, andat that moment you put his hand back. See, you don’t tell him “Now, put your hands back inyour lap.”What was this—telepathic CCHs? Well, the CCHs are run with meat. They are very meatyprocesses, you see? They’re not verbal “Let’s all get along . . .”We had a student one time on one of the ACCs that was running CCH 2, and the PC wasgiving the auditor a very bad time, you see? But it was just a coaching session because theywere doing Upper Indoc. And this PC was acting as the PC, of course, was slumping anddoing unexpected twists and turns. And this dear person who was running this TR, all of asudden just abandoned the whole thing and turned around to her instructor and said, “PCsnever act that way; I’m simply not going to run that TR anymore.”Well, time went by, and she ran into one who did act that way, who acted much worse in anactual session. So all of your Upper Indoc was simply basic training by which you could thendo the CCHs. But unless you’d done Upper Indoc, you see, and got your confrontingness upon this amount of motion, then it was difficult to do the CCHs.Now, two of the CCHs are as rough as bear rassling. Now, the other two CCHs are not.Nevertheless, they, too, are done by compulsion if necessary.You can run one-handedly CCH 3 and CCH 4, and you run it one handedly. That’s aninteresting aspect of it. You take the PC’s hand and you make the PC’s hand touch yours andfollow the motion. That’s all. And then you release his hand. I mean, that’s as simple as that. Itbecomes a kind of a CCH 1 all over again, but it was with motion in a different pattern eachtime, don’t you see? So if the PC is running fine, you run it two-handed and if the PC is notrunning fine, you run it one-handed. And that’s all there is to it.And book mimicry: He says he’s not going to do book mimicry because when he was veryyoung he got hit by a book. And you say, “That’s fine,” and you take the book and you put itthrough a motion, and then you put the book in his hands and you put it through the samemotion. And then you take the book and put it through a motion, then put it in his hands and gothrough the same motion. You understand?This PC never has an opportunity not to execute the auditing command, and that’s all there is toit. And that’s CCH 1, 2, 3, 4. The PC never has an opportunity not to execute the auditingcommand.And the auditor who will let the PC get away with a non-execution of a CCH oh, my. It justisn’t done—not at all, not even in Chelsea. Not done. The PC always executes the auditingcommand, no matter if you have to sit on her chest and get it done! And you could fully expectthe PC to turn up to high C, high G. soprano, contralto, or just get into a roaring funk oranything else. Who cares! It has nothing to do with your Tone 40ing through the CCHs. It isjust that way. It is not nice; it is effective.Now, the consequences of letting a PC get out of a CCH are very grave, and you only have todo it once and you will wish to God you never did it again.I saw a PC let out of CCH 2 one day, and that PC went crazy. How do you like that? It was aninstitutional PC to begin with. And the PC was getting better under CCH 2 and all of a suddenmade a break for the door, and the auditor did not stop her. And she rushed out into the street.And the auditor walked along behind her trying to persuade her to do the process. And shewalked all over the town and was eventually picked up by the cops and thrown into the localspin bin, where she had come from originally. I’m not trying to tell you that CCH 2 drove this"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"person crazy. But do you know that PC didn’t get all right for years? Now, the consequencesof it are pretty fabulous.That auditor just stood there and let the PC blow. You got the idea? He heard about it for years,too. Whenever he was getting out of line, why, we’d mention it to him, see? We’d say, “Well,at least you didn’t let the PC blow out on the street,” you know? And he’d cringe.No, it’s a serious thing. Nov., all he had to have done was just to have blocked the PC’sleaving. Yes, it was an institutional PC; yes, the girl had been in spin bins till you couldn’tcount; yes, she’d been electric-shocked and all the rest of it. So what? All he had to have done,all he needed to have done, was simply to have stopped her going out the door and put her backthrough CCH 2—through the next command. And that psychosis was blowing and would haveblown. We know by experience that this is quite common and quite ordinary.The CCHs run out electric shocks; they run out surgery; they run out almost anything you canthink of, if they are run right.The darnedest physical manifestations turn on. And, of course, the CCH is not flat at its pointsof hugest volume of reaction. Your PC doesn’t, oddly enough, sustain tremendously highvolume reaction, and you almost never see a PC screaming for twenty minutes so that you haveto say that it’s flat, don’t you see, and go on to the nest CCH. Almost never happens.Neither do you necessarily wait till he stops screaming and then say it’s flat. Has he stoppedscreaming for twenty minutes, you see? That would be the test.But, of course, by rule now, what do we mean by flat? We mean the same aspect of the PC fortwenty minutes, which by ne plus ultra; reductio ad absurdum, would be, if the PC werescreaming at exactly C-sharp minor exactly, for twenty minutes, that is a no-change. So you’dgo on to the next process. You got it?If the PC is lying on the floor in a funk for twenty minutes, that process is flat. Have you gotit? You’re executing the auditing command, and the PC remains on the floor for twentyminutes, there’s no aspect change of the PC, so that process, as far as you’re concerned, isflat. Now, you got that?Now, how slight a change is a change? A somatic enters and leaves in that twenty minutes.Well, that’s not flat. You’ve got to run it for twenty minutes without the return of that somatic.You got it?Now, most CCHs run rather calmly. Most of your CCHing is not done with this tremendousduress. About the only time that tremendous duress sets in is usually when the PC is goingthrough something he considers quite painful.Now, the CCHs turned it on and the CCHs will turn it off, and that is one of the oldest rules ofauditing: That which turns it on turns it off. What do you think is going to happen? You’ve gota horrible, strong, beefy process of this character, and you’ve turned something on with it.Well, when is he going to get the CCHs run again? See, you didn’t run it on through and turn itoff. Well, that’s a serious thing, you see? That’s a blunder of magnitude.But it’s twenty minutes, and it’s by the clock. It’s not about twenty minutes; it’s twentyminutes, by Greenwich meridian, navigational chronometer, sidereal time. Twenty minutes.And if there’s no change of aspect in the PC for twenty minutes, then it’s flat.Well, what if the PC, during the whole of the run—nothing happens? PC just offers his handand he offers his hand and offers his hand and offers his hand. Nobody said anything to—youran it till you got a reaction!Now, let me point out something: An E-Meter very often, on a level (and this will fool you"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"sometime if you don’t know about it, so know about it pretty well)—the E-Meter, assessed ona level, sometimes for the first three to five hours of run will be giving you the answer to a flattone arm. A flat tone arm. It’s giving you less than a quarter of a division of motion for the firstthree to five hours, in an extreme case. Less than a quarter of a division for twenty minutes isthe signal to change to another process, isn’t it? How can you call it flat when it hasn’t yetbegun to bite?But there is some motion in the tone arm; there is some motion in the tone arm. Therefore, it isnot flat at the beginning of an assessed level run in Routine 2. In Routine 2 it’s moving aneighth of a division. It moves an eighth of a division, it almost reaches a quarter of a division, itmoves a sixteenth a division, it moves an eighth a division, it moves almost a quarter of adivision. You get the idea?Well, those all say—according to the test—”process flat,” because it’s moving less than aquarter of a division. Look, how can a process be flat when it hasn’t begun to run? It can’t be.And you will find—and you needed some subjective reality on this; you’ll run into it soonenough, because it happens to people early in processing, particularly on a Routine 2. But itsometimes happens when you’ve assessed the goal and you’re running on a Routine 3, too. Allright.Here’s this little creak, creak, creak, you know? And you say, “Well, by all the rules, it’smoving less than a quarter-division in twenty minutes; therefore, I’ll come off of it.” And thenyou say, “Well, the PC was ungratefully spun.” And the process has not yet begun to run.Three to five hours, sometime in that period, all of a sudden it suddenly picks up and moves aquarter of a division. Now suddenly it moves a half a division. Now all of a sudden it moves adivision. And then it gets down and you say, “Well, thank goodness, it’s coming on downnow, and this level is flattening.” And it’s only moving about a third of a division, and prettysoon it’ll move a quarter-division, and then it goes from 1.0 to 6.0 to 7.0 to 5.0 to 3.0 to 4.0 to2.0, because when they do this, sooner or later they get hot, hot, hot!Now, the only danger in overrunning a process, of course, is sticking the tone arm. And theonly danger there is that you stick it for a couple of sessions, and you can’t reassess. But youcould stick it for a half an hour and still reassess. So if you’re in doubt, while you’re feelingyour way over this, go ahead and stick it!It’s like I told Barry Fairburn up at HGC London. He kept telling me, on this one PC, he said,“Well, it’s just . . . I just . . . when will it ever get flat?” You know, it had picked up and hadgone very slow, and he’d come off it and he’d reassessed another level in the same afternoon.And of course there I was, looking right down the telex wire at him.And I said, “Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!” I said, “With a tone arm doing that little, thetone arm has not yet begun to move on that level. That tone arm will beg n to move on thatlevel. So let’s get on the ball here.” And he promptly and instantly went off of the second onehe bad assessed and went back to run the fat one he had assessed. And much to his amazement,the first one really started to pick up and fly!And then he finally wrote me in desperation, about six or seven hours of auditing later. Hesays, “When is this thing ever going to flatten?”So I said, “All right now, Barry, you just run it to a stuck tone arm.”And he did; it took quite a while, but he ran it to a stuck tone arm, an then reassessed. Stuck thetone arm for twenty minutes and learned how long you could run it and what it looks like.In other words, this tone arm action, sometimes early in auditing, takes a long time to getgoing; and at no time can you consider that flat, because it’s never run yet. It assessed, so ifyour assessment was good, it will run. And it may take three to five hours for it to start to run,"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"and we’ve seen that quite consistently.Now, that’s just one level of the Prehav Scale. Now, let’s apply this same thing to the CCHs.This is why I’m taking it up.Now, your CCHs are run without Model Session and without an E-Meter. We care nothingabout the E-Meter in running the CCHs because the PC is the E-Meter. Just as you’ve learnedto watch the tone arm move, so must you learn in the CCHs to watch the PC move—the bodyreaction. It isn’t what the PC says; it is what the PC is doing and it’s what is happening to thePC. Now, the PC may communicate to you that certain things are happening, and that’s fine—that’s a change. But the PC is the E-Meter.You have to consider all four of the CCHs as one level of the Prehav Scale, in this wise, forthis purpose: Sometimes the CCHs do not begin to bite. So, what do you get? You get twentyminutes of CCH 1, followed by twenty minutes of CCH 2, followed by twenty minutes ofCCH 3, followed by twenty minutes of CCH 4, followed by twenty minutes of CCH 1,followed by twenty minutes of CCH 2, and followed by 181/2 hours of CCH 3. You got that?Just as it takes, on a normal level, a while for a tone arm to pick up and run, so does it also takea while on some cases for the CCHs to begin to run. But if you sit there and grind on just oneCCH, this won’t happen. And if you don’t run the CCHs . . .The reason why the CCHs were trotted back out of mothballs,-dusted off, the smell ofcamphor whisked off the top of them, and put back into the lineup, was because you had whathappened in the CCHs: the person would run up against the withhold block. In other words,the person would accumulate more responsibility and become aware of more withholds, andthere was no way to get rid of them because the PC wasn’t being talked to and no rudimentswere being run. So the CCH game was limited by the fact he never had a chance to get hiswithholds off. Right?So, in running the CCHs today, you are going to run a processing check—a standard HCOWW form. I repeat, no Security Check is permitted to be edited or altered, changed or addedto, period. If it doesn’t say HCO WW Form something-or-other at the top of it, it isn’t aSecurity Check. Okay?And, of course, you don’t use a Staff Member Security Check—that is to say, a new . . . oneof these new HCO WW Form 6s or something like that —as the repetitive Security Check forprocessing, or something like that. It means right what it says.You run a Joburg. You take your most violent versions of Security Check, and you run themone for one. If the PC is an hour on the CCHs, the PC gets an hour of Security Check. Yougot it?Now, if you’re really booting somebody over the horizon and just really giving them the rocketin a mad way, swap their broomstick for a rocket: give them the CCHs from one auditor and aJoburg from another one. Perfectly feasible. Now, you can actually go ahead and assess forSOP Goals with a third auditor, all at the same time.In the morning PC gets his CCHs, and in the afternoon he gets assessed for goals, and in theevening gets a Security Check run on him. How fast can you get a gain? Well, wait till you’vetried that one—wait until you’ve tried that one and seen that one go, because, man, you get again. It’s really inevitable.But the CCHs are quite powerful, and they throw overts into view quite easily. And the personwho is pegged down gets a little bit of auditing and all of a sudden these overts start to loom alittle large, and they have to get rid of them.Now, I don’t want you to run into trouble and I don’t want you to be abused in auditing, but I"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"hope it happens to you at least once that you get a lot of wonderful auditing that gives you abeautiful case advance without a Security Check, and then suffer for two or three days, and it’llsure make a citizen out of you. Boy, that gives you a subjective reality, right there.An auditing gain without a Security Check—an auditing gain with velocity, you understand,such as we’re handing out now, without a Security Check to clean it unhand you’ve reallyhanded somebody a bad time. They just practically start bleating, you know? “Why am I doingall these horrible things? My life is such a horrible mess. I have. . .” You know? They didn’tthink it was; they were in a wonderful state of fixed irresponsibility just a day before and thensomething got run on them, like Routine 1 or Routine I mean, the CCHs or assessments on thegeneral scale. And this was run and all of a sudden, there they are, off to the races.And you let them improve and improve and improve and improve, and don’t inquire into theirprivate lives, because that wouldn’t be nice. You’d practically kill them.I don’t wish you any hard luck, but there’s nothing makes a citizen out of you like having thathappen to you. You get miserable.So the CCHs are highly functional as long as they can produce a change in the PC. And thechange in the PC is ordinarily stopped by the fact that the PC can’t get off his overts. And he’sbecome more responsible by running the CCHs, and then can’t get off his overts and so,bang!—that parks his progress on the CCHs.Now, how many ways could you park progress on the CCHs? One, you could fail to run Tone40 auditing. You could go at it in some old crummy way, you know? You got so used, in theAcademy, to putting it into the ashtray that you keep putting the intention in the ashtraythroughout the auditing session, you see? Be pretty wild.You run it sort of permissively. You say, “We shouldn’t be mean to the preclear,” and we justsit back and we don’t really press it home. And the PC says, “Well, I’m tired today. And Ireally don’t feel . . . I really think this CCH 1 is pretty flat now, and I’m very tired today, andso forth, and I’d rather it wouldn’t . . . weren’t run. I’d rather you’d go on to CCH 4. I thinkthat was the one I was interested in.”Go on to CCH 4, you’ve had it. Here we go, because you violated C. The first C is control,the next C is communication and the H is havingness. Control, communication, andhavingness, or communication, control and havingness. Either way, because you applycontrol, you get communication; and if you apply control and get communication, havingnesswill result. If you communicate with somebody you can apply control, which will give youhavingness. Whichever way this adds up, the end result is havingness.Now, irresponsibility can deny havingness. Irresponsibility, then, is pulled off of a case by theSecurity Check, which results in havingness. All O/W results in havingness. So Routine 1,whether looked at from above, below, plan view, or projected, gives you havingness. And thefinal net run of it is havingness. Routine 2, all the prehavingness buttons, are the things thatprevent people from having. Prehavingness might as well mean “prevent havingness” buttons.But we don’t call it that because somebody would say the scale was designed to preventhavingness. And by that overt, of course, they prevent themselves from having any gain.Anyhow, prehavingness, and the end result of patching up somebody’s various buttons on thePrehav Scale is to give him havingness. And when the individual has enormous numbers ofunrealized goals all over the track, the net result of all of these all up and down the track was todeny him havingness because he never attained the goal. So that when you do a GoalsAssessment, just the assessment, the end product of it is havingness. And you’ve got threehavingness routines.Now, all three routines—you have in these routines the inherent fact that you run O/W on apreclear and he gets havingness."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Now, why does he get havingness? Because the individual individuates from things because hecan’t have them. And therefore he develops overts only on those things he can’t have. Andwhen you get the overts off, he can then have.Here’s one of the tests: If you can’t get the havingness of the Havingness and ConfrontProcess to work, did you know that all you had to do was run some O/W and you will achievethe same thing?Supposing we did this weird one: This is just taking it straight from theory, you see? I don’tsay it’s workable or anything else, but it’s just theoretical. You look around and you say,“Well, notice that cupboard.” And you say, “Well, have you ever done anything to a cupboard?Have you ever withheld anything from a cupboard?” And he recalls one. You say, “Good.Look at that floor; notice that floor. Now, have you ever done anything to a floor? Have youever withheld anything from a floor? Oh, you have. All right. That’s good. Now, notice thatfireplace. Have you ever done anything to the fireplace? Have you ever withheld anything froma fireplace? Oh, you have. That’s dandy. Very good.”You didn’t force him, you see, to have actually done something to fireplaces, and so on,because some of these will draw blanks. He says “No,” that’s right; you say, “We’ll go on tothe next one.”And all of a sudden that room will become the most fantastically real room he ever was in.Theoretically, that would be the normal outcome of it. You got it? You give him theenvironment.But of course you have shorthanded ways of doing this with all of those thirty-six HavingnessProcesses that you run on a PC objectively in the room. They all more or less do just this. Yousee?So your routines are all devoted to increasing the PC’s havingness. And they are devoted to—Routine 1, applying control so as to get him into communication so that he can have; Routine 2,getting out of the road the fixed reactive buttons which prevent him from having things;Routine 3, getting out of the road all of these unrealized goals, each one of which has been adefeat for him at sometime or another, all of which—any goal—all of which goals had as theirend product havingness. You can’t help but raise his havingness.Now, running right along with this you run O/W and get off all of his withholds, which arepreventing him from having. See, he gets the impulse— he can now have, but he’d better nothave because he’s done bad things, and if he had these things he would ruin them. Andtherefore, if you don’t get this out of the road, you’ve left him stuck with the idea that he nowcould have these things but he’d better not, and he’s never noticed before now. And it becomesquite painful to him. He says shame, blame, regret, guilt—oh, he says all kinds of things, butthat’s what it results in. You got it?So everything you are doing in auditing at the present moment has the end product ofhavingness. And, of course, if you could have the whole ruddy universe, I assure you itwouldn’t be the least trouble to you, not the least bit of trouble. It’s only those things you can’thave you have trouble with.Next time you have a PT problem, look it over—look it over. And just ponder this: “Howmany things are involved with this problem? All right. What blocks off my having of thesethings or people?” You’ll see a problem blow up.You see, individuation: individuation from the thing, from the object, from the universe, fromthe dynamic is what brings about the trouble, because you get into an obsessive gamescondition. And an obsessive games condition simply adds up to the fact that you can’t have it;and it, of course, by your determination, can’t have anything to do with you."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"Had a fellow around one time who had a games condition going with fire. And my Lord, thatfellow burned up couches and suits and fire just pursued him every place. He could stand in themiddle of a street without a bit of fuel anywhere in view and have a roaring bonfire almostconsume him. And he was in this terrific games condition with regard to fire.Now, if you’d improved his havingness in general, sooner or later along the road you wouldhave hit the reactive button “fire,” see? What has he done with and to fire? In some way he’smade it discreditable, in some way he has made it guilty, in some way he’s becomeirresponsible for fire.All of a sudden, fire no longer has this obsessive chasing effect. Fire just doesn’t pursue himup and down all the boulevards and through his whole life, you see? Because fire isn’tpursuing him anyhow: He simply cannot have fire, he cannot control fire, and he can’tcommunicate with fire. Soon as he gets into that condition, wow, he’s had it. Because nomatter where fire will occur, he has to retreat from fire and pull it in on him. See, he’s part ofthe same universe this fire’s in, only he hadn’t noticed that.All right. Now, the CCHs, then, are no different than the other two routines. Where anindividual is having any difficulty whatsoever with their physiological beingness, where theindividual has been obsessively abused, particularly in this physiological beingness that theyfind themselves in at the moment, the CCHs knock out individuation from the physicalbeingness. That physical-beingness individuation has been caused by duress on the part of thepreclear toward his body and by, apparently, his body toward him.He’s having difficulty: he can’t get in his head, he can’t come near the body, he can’t do this,he can’t do that, and therefore, the body is giving him somatics and he’s having trouble withthe body. You’ve got the natural concatenation: he’s just individuated, that’s all. He’s one thingand the body’s another thing and he can’t have it.And of course the CCHs attack this one particularly, right on the button. It isn’t necessarily thecriteria for running CCHs, but it’s its most immediate and direct result.So you take somebody that’s been given electric shocks. Of course, this has individuated himfrom the body, because of his own giving the body electric shocks of one kind or another.Well, what happens to this fellow? You start running the CCHs and his havingness on a bodystarts rising, inevitably. So he has to become aware of all these electric shocks. So as soon ashe becomes aware of them, they start running out.All right. But as soon as they start running out, if he himself takes no further mental step tofind out what he’s done to bodies and get rid of his overts against bodies, he’s left with thesomatics running out—but they stop running out—and his overts against the body in fullbloom. Pow! This hurts.So you’ve got to improve a PC’s responsibility if you’re going to improve his havingness,because he won’t permit himself to have unless he can be responsible for having. And that’sthe other philosophic button on which this rests, which we’ve known for a very long time.Now, you got this?So the way you run the CCHs is directly, immediately and so on, precisely, and you pay verylittle attention to the PCs mental reactions. All you do is give him a demonstration that that bodyhe’s sitting in can be controlled. As soon as he sits in on this one and says, “You know,somebody’s controlling this body. Heh-heh. Somebody’s controlling this body. Maybe I can.”And so he’ll try.Now, if you let him get up to a point where the body flies out of control and you say to him,“Well, that’s all right. That’s giving you some trouble. You want to rush out in the street andnot come to session and so forth? Well, go ahead”—mmmm. you’ve shown him the body can’t"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"be controlled, haven’t you? And he retrogresses like mad. So you mustn’t do that to him,because it’s a direct reversal to what you’re trying to do.You’re trying to show him that his body can be controlled; a failure to execute the CCHs showimmediately and directly the body can’t be controlled. Of course the body wins.Now, all you’d have to do if you’re going to ruin somebody—I can tell you how to ruinsomebody—is start the CCHs and if the guy says, “Oh, I’m tired of this silly process, ‘Giveme that hand.’ What are we doing? Getting in practice to join the Elks?”And you say, “Well, if you’re tired of it, then we just will go off onto something else.”All right. We go off onto CCH 2 and we march him up and down the room, and eventually hesuddenly throws us off a little bit and says, “You know, this is getting awfully annoying tome.”And you say, “Well, all right. We’ll go on to something else. Now, let’s sit down here in thechair, and now, you put your hands up there . . .”“Well, I don’t know that I want to!”“Well, all right. Then here’s this book. All right. Here’s this book and . . .”Fellow says, “I never read books. I don’t like books. Don’t want anything to do with books.”You say well, there’s nothing you can do about it, and you go and see the instructor, the seniorauditor, or call somebody long distance, or send them cables from Johannesburg, you know?And you say, “Well, we have this PC who we can’t make any progress with, with theseCCHs.”Now, do you know that you can take Routine 2 and Routine 3 and do— I’m being very hardon Johannesburg. Actually, Johannesburg is snapping out of it, and I’m very happy to noticeit. I have noticed it. It was sure in the basement for a while.Well, anyhow, if you were to do the same thing with any auditing activity, and let the PC getout of control at each and every turn of the road, you of course are giving them the side effectof proving it to him that his aberrations are so strong that they cannot be controlled. And don’tbe too puzzled if the PC eventually becomes practically unauditable.Don’t be too surprised, if you fail to exert heavy auditing control during a session, if the PCstarts getting mad at you, chopping you up, doing this, doing that, doing the other thing;because by not controlling him, by taking his advice all the time, by asking him “How do yourun this process, anyway?” by doing this and doing that, you have shown him that you are notcontrolling him in the session. And showing him that you are not controlling him in thesession, of course, results in the model of “no control” taking over and he himself is defeatedbecause he sees that he cannot control his mind, he cannot control his body, he cannot control.That’s true of any auditing process.That might give you a new shading on this idea of control. Whereas you would look on it verybad—I’ve mentioned this to you just the other day.I was auditing a PC, actually on a think process, and the PC said, “Oh, I’ve had enough ofthat,” and leaped madly out of the chair from a very, very calm, you know, demeanor, andactually said “I’ve had enough of that” while springing through the air like an impala. And wasspringing straight to the door, and in mid-flight I simply grabbed her by the wrist, turned heraround in mid-flight and brought her back sitting down in the chair—its legs almost spraddledout into a total splash, you see?—and gave the next auditing command. And that PC began torun like a doll. Nothing to it, man. And we had that process flat just in no time."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"And you say, “God, that’s awfully harsh!” No, I wasn’t being harsh to the PC; I was beingrather decent about it. If I’d been mad at the PC, all I would have had to have done was notreach out and grab her wrist, let her reach the door, and then not audit her. Oh, pow. She’s hadit. She’s had it! She’d go around now in the total belief, “Well, if Ron can’t control this muchaberration and so forth, it’s uncontrollable,” don’t you see? And “Zzooh! What can poor littleme do about it?” You know, some kind of a stupid rationalization like this, you know, toherself. She’d go off hiding from herself in corners.All right. So she did have a black-and-blue addendum. That was an awful lot better than havinga black-and-blue psyche.And if you for a moment think you’re being anything but ornery when you fail to control a PCin session, get rid of the idea. Don’t get this kindness all mixed up. I saw I didn’t get throughto you too good the other day on the subject of kindness, but that’s right on the button now. Bymisguided kindness, you let the PC take control of the session; by misguided kindness, you letthe PC off from finishing off the somatic; by misguided kindness you consult endlessly withthe PC to make sure that he isn’t displeased with what we are doing; and out of that misguidedkindness, you practically drive somebody to the bottom of a well.Be the most vicious thing you could do to a PC is to fail to control him.The factor is so strong that even if the PC is right in his advice’s, you had better not take it,because he will suffer more from having been run rightly but out of control, than wrongly incontrol. Now, do I make myself clear?Just the fact that the PC has said, “But this has been flat for days!” And you were just thatmoment going to open your mouth and say, “You know, I think this level has been flat fordays!” You were just about to say this. But the fact that he says it, that’s enough, man. Youhave no choice but to run it. Why? Because his announcement of the act throws him out ofcontrol. And it is more serious to let a PC out of control in session than it is to run the wrongprocess or to overrun a process. That can’t louse him up, but letting him go out of control canpractically kill him.So if you ever want to err, don’t err on the side of sweetness and light, man, err on the side ofthe heavy-handed parent; err on the side of the lion tamer; err on the side of the machine-gunner. Keep the Auditor’s Code, but keep control. And if you do that, your PCs will never doanything but recover, because the hidden factor of the CCHs are present in whatever you’rerunning, even though you’re doing formal auditing.“Well, is it all right with you if I end this process?”And he says, “No, it certainly is not!”And you say, “What objection do you have?”And he says, “Sa-rowr, rowr-rowr, rowr-rowr.” And you say, “All right. Okay. Thank youvery much. Now, I’ll give you two more auditing commands and end this process.”“Oh, God! What are you doing to me?”And you say, “Have you ever shot the moon? Thank you. Have you ever shot the moon?Thank you. Is there anything you’d care to say before I end this process?”And you know, about that time, if you’ve done the job right, he’ll say, “No, as a matter of factI don’t have.”You say, “Good. End of process.”"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"What happened to the ARC break you knew was going to occur? It wasn’t that he wasknuckled under and overwhelmed—that was not what happened. You say, “What do youknow? This outburst is easily controlled. Look, PC controlled it.”PC’s controlled it. “Not only did the auditor control it, I controlled it too. Heh-heh. What doyou know? Tooh! Nothing to it.” Got the idea?All right Wrong—wrong way: “Well, is it all right with you if I ask you two more times andend this process?”“No, my God, I will say it isn’t! I’ve got a somatic eight feet thick, and why don’t you everpay any attention to your auditing, and what is the matter with you anyway?”“Well, how wide is this somatic? Okay. All right. Well, we’ll carry on the process a little whilelonger then, and see if you get rid of it.”“Well, you’d better.”Fifteen minutes more auditing and you’ve got a real roaring ARC break. What’s the ARC breakover? You did what the guy said. You tried to flatten this terrible somatic; you were being niceabout the whole thing; you were being reasonable about the whole thing. Well, the test is, didthe somatic get better? No, as a matter of fact, it will always get worse. Always. It’s better toend the process wrongly on the auditor’s determination than to end it on the PC’s rightly.Remember that. Of course, it’s a happy chance that you end it rightly on the auditor’sdetermination.Give you a new viewpoint of this sort of thing?Audience: Yeah.Yeah.Now, the auditor is running the session, and if the PC starts running the session, expecttrouble expect trouble, man. It’s not a kind thing to do; it’s a rotten, mean, dirty, nasty thing todo to a PC. It’s almost covert hostility to do that to a PC.PC says, “Oh, God, you’re not gonna . . . you’re . . . you’re actually . . . no, my God!You’re not going to run any more ‘failed can’t’!”And the auditor says . . . My normal response to such a thing is “What’s the matter?”And he says, “Yow, yow, yow, yow, yow! And yow, yow, yow, yow, yow.”You say, “No kidding! All right. The auditing command is ‘What have you failed to can’t?’‘Who has failed to can’t you?”’ And he’ll all of a sudden—he’s suddenly good as gold.He says, “Well, it (kmpf, kmpf) wasn’t nat-tarted to run flat.”The PC can steer a session wrong on me by being too informative of actually what is the exactsituation, because he opens a gate there that you can’t let him go through. And he says, “Well,this ‘failed can’t’ has been flat for the last session. I know it.” And you were just about to openyour mouth and say, “This ‘failed can’t’ has been flat for the last session, I’m sure.”And he says, “This ‘failed can’t’ has been . . .” Whooh. Well, here goes a half an hour of‘failed can’t.’In the first place, I wouldn’t believe it was flat if he was protesting against it. And the other"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"thing, even if it was flat, it would do him more harm to let him start running the session than itwould be to overrun a process or underrun one. You got that? It would do him more harm.Now, many people have trouble ending sessions, and that’s because they keep consulting thePC as to “what’s the state of the PC,” so as to determine when the session should end. And I’lltell you a good test sometime, is the next time a PC says to you that the session shouldn’t end,or he has something undone, or he feels very bad about it, or he hasn’t made his goals, why,that’s just dandy; just nicely, firmly and pleasantly end the session, and find no ARC break.And you’ll say, “What happened to the ARC break that we knew was coming?” It didn’tmaterialize.Now, what happened to it was, this is an effort of a breakout, an effort at a continuance, andyou come along behind the thing and you say, “You see? It wasn’t necessary to continue it.”And he says, “It wasn’t necessary to continue it.”So the nest time you have trouble ending a session... This, by the way—a new auditor on anHGC always, almost always, has this difficulty. They say to the old-timers, “How can youpossibly get your sessions ended by 3:30? How can you end a session by 3:30?” And the newauditor is staggering out of the auditing room, you see, at 6:45.Well, that’s a sure indicator that the new auditor does not have his PC in control, because he’ssaid to the thing, “Now, how do you feel now? How do you feel about the process we’ve beenrunning, and so forth? How do you . . . how are you . . . how’s your general health?”And the PC says, “Well, it’s pretty bad, actually. My aunt Methuselah matildaed the other day,and it’s pretty bad.”And the new auditor would say, “Well, the poor fellow. Why, we . . . the best . . . the bestthing for him to do is to carry on here and get this matildaing out of the way.” And so he doesthat, and then he’ll find something else, and he’ll find something else and it goes on and on andon. And the PC anises less and less, and makes less and less progress, and is slowed downmore and more, and the auditor’s getting into more and more trouble, and he wonders, “Whaton earth is happening to me?”Whew. The only thing that’s happening is, is back there at 3:30 with the tone arm moving—itcould have been, you see, as bad as this. The tone arm was moving on a rock slam—the tonearm was rock-slamming, you see, not the needle. And 3:30 was about to come around, and hejust had time to get in his end rudiments before he reached 3:30, and he said, “All right. Is it allright with you if I give you two more commands and end this process?”“All right with me? My God, I’m just getting going!”You say, “All right. Thank you very much.” Give him two more commands. “Is there anythingyou’d care to say before I end this process?”“Well, there certainly is. My God, I never saw such horrible bad auditing, and you’re doing mein,” and so forth.And you say, “Good. End of process.” And then you run your end rudiments. “Now, is thereany ARC breaks?” And you expect immediately that you’re going to get your head taken off,before you get used to this kind of thing, you know? And you’re sitting there all ready for themeter to blow up. Ah, there’s a little twitch.And you say, “What was that?”“Well,” he says, “you ended it. You ended the process, and I don’t know if I can ever get backinto it or not.”"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"“All right,” you say. “Well, is it all right with you if we take that up tomorrow?” And you say,“Okay. Now, do you have any ARC breaks?” And there is none. And you say, “All right. Andhere we go,” you see, and run off the end rudiments and that’s it. The PC goes out whistlingand everything’s fine, dandy.But the new auditor, the new auditor at 6:35, you see, streaked with sweat and coal dust,comes staggering out of the auditing room, you know, and he says to the others, he says (whohave now assembled for an evening briefing session or something of the sort), “How do youpeople do it? You must be terribly cruel. You must just chop the PC off in the middle ofnothing, you know, and you just must be thinking about yourselves and nobody else, and . . .”They say, “Well, I don’t know, we end it, and it never seems to do any harm.” And that’s thecorrect way to go about it, that’s all. You run the session.Now, that’s very, very observable in the CCHs, but, of course, it carries over into theremainder of auditing. In the CCHs it is so observable that if you let the PC start running theauditing session, he will practically spin, and in the others he just has an ARC break.You want to know what an ARC break is? Sometime or another the PC went out of session andyou lost control of the PC. And it sometimes takes as much as an hour to an hour and a half forthat ARC break to materialize in the physical universe. That is so true that when I get a PC whois ARC breaking (which doesn’t happen very often, because I do this other one), I say to them,‘What happened a half an hour ago?”“Half an hour ago? Oh, a half an hour ago. I’m not interested in a half an hour ago. It’s what’shappening right now. I mean, I’m . . . after all, I feel these bayonets in my chest and so forth,here.”“No, what happened a half an hour ago?”“Oh, I remembered a half an hour ago, I—yeah, that’s right. There was something there. I . . .I remembered about a half an hour ago I’d forgotten to phone my wife at noon and she’sprobably furious with me.” There was your ARC break; didn’t have anything to do with whatyou were doing in auditing.Now you, not understanding what ARC breaks are, or how to take ARC breaks apart, findyour auditing apparently under criticism all the time from the PC, and then you try to put yourfinger on what it is that you are doing wrong in your auditing so as to set it right. And the truthof the matter is, the only thing you’re doing wrong in your auditing is not being pig-bullheaded. And a half an hour after you have broken down and relinquished control of thesession, you get an ARC break and get all this criticism from the PC of your auditing. And thathappens an hour and a half to a half an hour after you have committed the “fox pass” [fauxpas]. And you let them “foxes” through and you’ve had it.And that’s what occurs. You got it now?Audience: Yes. Hm-hm.Try sometime to be overbearingly, stupidly domineering about a session. Just try it sometime,just for the hell of it! Have the PC make a perfectly reasonable suggestion, such as “Could Ihave a break so that I can go to the bathroom?” and look at him as though he has suddenlystolen the crown jewels. Yes? And say, “Well, we’ll get a break in an hour or so,” and note thepeculiar lack of an ARC break.And then sometime have a PC say this to you, “Well, actually, I don’t quite feel up to runningthe process at the moment,” and you say, “Well, we'll do something else,” and watch the ARCbreak materialize in an hour and a half to a half an hour."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"You see? And because it’s an hour and a half to a half an hour afterwards in most cases, youdon’t associate cause and effect, because it’s such prior cause that you haven’t noticed whereyou lost control of the session. But the best way to patch up an ARC break is to find out whereyou lost control of the session and reassert control of the session, not Q-and-A with the ARCbreak! Now, there’s a real way to patch them up.So you’re very graduate in the way of auditors, and you ought to learn that one, and you oughtsomeday, just for the hell of it, just to find out that it’s true, just start—as you’re auditing, justbe pigheaded about something sometime or other. Just utter pigheaded. Pick out one of thecartoons they used to draw of the German army back in World War I, you know, and put it on.And the PC has made a perfectly reasonable request. The PC has said, “Can we end the sessionby 4:30, because I have a date with a millineuse?”And look at him pityingly, you know, and just disregard it utterly. Just make as if—pointedly—he’d never said a word. You’re going to be charitable; you’re going to disregardthis terrible thing he has obviously done.Now, to your way of thinking, that would cause an ARC break. No, the way the ARC break iscaused, you must also do this one—do this other one, see?Sometimes a PC says, “Oh, I don’t know if . . . I . . . you . . . God . . . God almighty! I . . . Idon’t . . . I don’t have to run this. You say you found a present time problem on that meter.Well, look, I’m so tired of having all of my auditing time wasted on present time problems!Can’t we just skip the present time problem for once?”Go ahead. Skip it. Just knuckle-headedly skip it, pleasantly, and just say, “Well, all right.Well, if you don’t want to run it, we won’t run it. Okay. Now, let’s take up the nest one here.”And watch it start to arrive. You can actually measure it on your clock. The maximum time youwill have to wait is one and one-half hours of auditing, but somewhere, certainly—certainlywithin an hour and a half, and in certainly not less than a half an hour, you’re going to have anARC break on your hands.“Your fingernails are dirty. Your fingernails are dirty. You know, you really ought to get sometraining at the local Academy, because if you ran your confronting a bit better, I’m sure I couldmake some progress or something. Do you realize that you have crossed your legs?” Any kindof an ARC break you can think of that has nothing to do with the price of fish. No, it was rightback there.And you say, “Well, naturally. We had a present time problem. That’s making him edgy.” No,that is not what happened. Is you let the PC run his own bank for a moment and showed himthat you were an incompetent, weak schnook. And showed him that his bank was notcontrollable, and you’ve proved this to him conclusively that his bank was not controllable, sowhat materialized? The simplest thing in the world materialized: the bank, having beendemonstrated to be uncontrollable, of course becomes uncontrollable. And you get what iscommonly called an ARC break.And auditors who have constant, continual ARC breaks with PCs can be rated just exactly this:no control of PC. PC says, “I am schnooking today,” and the auditor says, “You poor fellow,so therefore we’re not going to schnook.” You know, he says, “It’s schnooking. Naturally,we’ll avoid schnooking then. We won’t get into that nasty field.”Or the PC says, “I keep hearing these violins in my ears,” and that sort of thing. And theauditor is sitting down there just to do one thing, which is to run an assessed level of thePrehav Scale—get the rudiments in order to run a level of the Prehav Scale. And the PC knowsvery well what’s going to happen. And he says, “Violins in my ears,” you know, “all thetime!” and so forth."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"And the auditor says, “Well, is this a present time problem with you?”And he says, “It certainly is.”And the auditor just goes right on down the line and gets the rest of what he ought to do andruns the assessment, and we don’t hear anything more about it. And the violins turn off ‘causethey were part of the level.But, this one: The auditor says, “Oooh, violins. Well, we’ll have to do something aboutviolins. Now, what trouble have you had with violins in your life?” and just throws the sessionaway. And you’ve got an ARC-breaky PC from that point right straight on. You got it?Learn that one well. Because it’s the difference—no matter what tricks you learn, that one thatI’ve just been talking about, which is very much in keeping with the CCHs, that one is thedifference between auditing and no auditing. You’ve got a black and white: auditing or noauditing. Auditing, the auditor is in control of the session with a capital C and a capital T. Gotit? All right. Auditing takes place. Auditor not in control of session, reactivity takes place,because there’s nobody now in control of the session, so there couldn’t be any auditing.And the easiest way in the world to get rid of auditing is to delete control from an auditingsession. Then the auditor isn’t controlling the session, the PC can’t control the auditingsession, the reactive mind damn well won’t control the auditing session, so where is theauditing?Actually, a lot of your feeling about auditing, or some of your flinches that you occasionally getabout auditing, simply stems from times when you have not controlled an auditing session; andonly then did you come under heavy criticism from the reactivity of the PC. Only then.The only thing that could ever be criticized about any of you as an auditor is that you do notcontrol a session heavily enough.So take your cue from the CCHs and control the rest of auditing the same way, and the resultswhich you get will be five to ten times as fast as they are right now. You want to know how tospeed up auditing results? Just try it. Okay?Audience: Thank you. Hm-hm.Right-O. Said my piece.

The CCHs are auditing specificallyaimed at and using all the parts of the Two Way Comm Formula.CONTROL is the first action of the CCHs and is highlighted by being done Tone 40 forthe first two CCHs (CCH 1 and CCH 2).The reason for Control being the main point is simply to bring about an awareness of Terminalsto which communication will be possible; this is done by A. bringing to the PC’s awarenessthat his body and he are being controlled from a particular KNOWN SOURCE POINT and B.that he also is a Source Point of Control with Control over self and body, all of which isaccomplished with CCH 1. i.e. Awareness of two known terminals:Once the above has been done with CCH 1, the gains can be developed further with CCH2 by finding for the PC more known points (environment) and familiarity in this “new”environment plus the beginnings of the next major step forward in this developement ofCommunication, the awareness of distance.COMMUNICATION (CCH3) is the next major step forward in the rehabilitation of yourPC. Tone 40 is used in the next step but only on the motion. Communication is encouraged.The type of Communication practised by the actual auditing actions is that of “one waycommunication” i.e.Cause-distance-effect with intention, attention, duplication andunderstanding, plus the first glimmerings of cause being given to the PC by Auditor receivingPC’s comm and then getting the PC to get the idea of contributing to the motion. In this sectionyou are also going to develop the PC’s ability to reach by showing him it is safe to reach acrossa distance (hand contact mimicry) and then reduce his dependency on YES? and increase hisreach even more (hand space mimicry).As an added bonus to the above you are also on the beginning step of Havingness(Duplication) as you will be teaching the person to duplicate as a being in two waycommunication and not as a body with reference to body Right and body Left.HAVINGNESS is the final step in this portion of the CCH formula (full formulaCCHCACTCH where A = attention (control) T = Thinkingness (control)). This step of CCH 4is the final culmination point which restores the PC’s ability to be in good two waycommunication with a high level of Havingness. By the use of Duplication, the full Two WayCommunication Formula is practised in a physical manner with the result that you will havetravelled a very very steep case gain from No Comm as a Thetan to full Two WayCommunication as a Thetan with lots of Havingness. i.e. The emanation of an impulse orparticle (Book and Motion) from Source Point across a distance to Receipt Point with theintention of bringing about at Receipt Point a Duplication and understanding of that whichemanated from the Source Point, with Receipt Point then becoming the Source Point backacross the distance to the Source Point which has now become the Receipt Point with intention,attention, duplication and understanding."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"OBSERVED GENERAL ERRORS1. Not knowing how to change from Hand Contact Mimicry to Hand Space Mimicry.ANS. The change occurs on the run through the CCHs after Hand Contact Mimicry is flatwith no change, i.e. CCH 1, 2, 3 (HCM with change), 4,1,2,3 (HCM with change) 4,2, 1, 2, 3 (HCM 5 commands only, no change), 4, 1, 2, 3 (Hand Space Mimicry).2.Trying to handle “verbal originations” on Tone 40 CCH 1 and 2.ANS. Tone 40 is used to overcome revolt of circuits, Body Originations are handled, circuitsare not validated.3. Overwhelming PC with very slow, very fast or continuously varying speeds ofmovements.ANS. An overwhelm is always wrong. Velocity plays an important role in being part of theComm Formula. By all means experiment with it but pay close attention to PC, makefor wins and increase tolerance, not losses and decrease tolerance.4. Interrupting PC to handle a Body Origination.ANS. Body Originations must be picked up when they occurs. In deciding to pick up a BodyOrigination the Auditor should bear in mind that it is against the Auditor’s Code toprevent a PC from carrying out a command.5. While doing CCH 4 Auditor tells PC to do it Mirror-image-wise.ANS. When the process is being done as per the Two Way Communication Formula you willsee that the PC will be executing the command “mirror-image-wise” (the receipt pointhas become the source point). However, to tell the PC to do it mirror-image-wise isabsolutely wrong as such a direction will prevent the PC from looking and put him on aself-audit.6. Not being sure of a CCH flat point.ANS. Flat Point = 3 cycles with no change in Comm Lag, no physically observed change andthe PC doing it.7. Imprecise Body movements of Auditor on CCH 2.ANS. Auditor on right side of PC (PC on Auditor’s left) with Auditor slightly in front of PCexcept on “Turn around”. The change of position is achieved by moving the left leg onepaoe to the left and forward in each case.H. G.

The variations and some of the most potent processes are not included in this TrainingBulletin but will appear in the Student Manual when published in September 1957.NUMBER: Training 0NAME: Confronting Preclear.COMMANDS: None.POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other a comfortable distance apart— about fivefeet.PURPOSE: To train student to confront a preclear with auditing only or with nothing.TRAINING STRESS: Have student and coach sit facing each other, neither making anyconversation or effort to be interesting. Have them sit and look at each other and say and donothing for some hours. Student must not speak, fidget, giggle or be embarrassed or anaten.Coach may speak only if student goes anaten (dope off). Student is confronting the body,thetan and bank of the preclear.HlSTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington in March 1957, to train students toconfront preclears in the absence of social tricks or conversation and to overcome obsessivecompulsions to be “interesting”.NUMBER: Training 1NAME: Dear Alice.COMMANDS: A phrase (with the “he saids” omitted) is picked out of the book “Alice inWonderland” and read to the coach. It is repeated until the coach is satisfied it arrived where heis.POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart .PURPOSE: To teach the student to send an intention from himself to a preclear in one unit oftime without vias.TRAINING STRESS: The command goes from the book to the student and, as his own, to thecoach. It must not go from book to coach. It must sound natural, not artificial. Diction andelocution have no part in it. Loudness may have.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, April 1956, to teach the communicationformula to new students."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"NUMBER: Training 2NAME: Acknowledgments.COMMANDS: The coach reads lines from “Alice in Wonderland” omitting “he saids” and thestudent thoroughly acknowledges them. The coach repeats any line he feels was not trulyacknowledged.POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE: To teach student that an acknowledgment is a method of controlling preclearcommunication and that an acknowledgment is a full stop.TRAINING STRESS: Teach student to acknowledge exactly what was said so that preclearknows it was heard. Ask student from time to time what was said. Curb over and underacknowledgment. Let student do anything at first to get acknowledgments across, then evenhim out. Teach him that an acknowledgment is a stop, not beginning of a new cycle ofcommunication or an encouragement to the preclear to go on.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to teach new students thatan acknowledgment ends a communication cycle and a period of time, that a new commandbegins a new period of time.NUMBER: Training 3NAME: Duplicative Question.COMMANDS: “Do fish swim?” or “Do birds fly?” Communication bridge between.POSITION: Student and coach seated a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE: To teach a student to duplicate without variation an auditing question, each timenewly, in its own unit of time, not as a blur with other questions; and to teach him how to shiftfrom one question to another with a communication bridge rather than an abrupt change.TRAINING STRESS: One question and student acknowledgment of its answer in one unit oftime which is then finished. To keep student from straying into variations of command. Toinsist on communication bridge when question is changed. Even though the same question isasked, it is asked as though it had never occurred to anyone before. To teach students that acommunication bridge consists of getting three agreements—one agreement to end thisquestion, second agreement to continue session in general and maintain ARC, third agreementto begin a new question. Teach student that preclear is part of these agreements. To teachstudent never to vary question or shift question or command without a bridge.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, April 1956, to overcome variations andsudden changes in session.NUMBER: Training 4NAME: Preclear Originations.COMMANDS: The student runs “Do fish swim?” or “Do birds fly?” on coach. Coach answersbut now and then makes startling comments from a prepared list given by instructor. Studentmust handle originations to satisfaction of coach.POSITION: Student and coach sit facing each other a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE: To teach a student not to be tongue-tied or startled or thrown off session by"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"originations of preclear and to maintain ARC with preclear throughout an origination.TRAINING STRESS: The student is taught to hear origination and do three things: (1)Understand it; (2) Acknowledge it; and (3) Return preclear to session. If the coach feelsabruptness or too much time consumed or lack of comprehension, he corrects the student intobetter handling.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956, to teach auditors to stayin session when preclear dives out.NUMBER: Training 5NAME: Hand Mimicry.COMMANDS: All commands are by motions of one or two hands. The auditor makes a simplehand motion, holding his hand or hands in the final position. The coach bobs his head ashaving received it. The coach then, mirror-wise, makes the same motion with his hand orhands. The student then acknowledges. If the motion was not correctly done by coach thestudent acknowledges doubtfully, then repeats the motion to the coach. If the coach does itwell, student thanks coach by shaking own two hands together (prize fighter fashion). Keepmotions simple. Student must always be able to duplicate own motions.POSITION: Student and coach are seated facing each other at a short distance, coach’s kneesinside student’s.PURPOSE: To educate student that verbal commands are not entirely necessary. To makestudent physically telegraph an intention. To show student necessity of having preclear obeycommands.TRAINING STRESS: Accuracy of student repeating own commands. Teaching student to givepreclear wins. Teaching student that an intention is different from words.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, April 1956, from the principles of bodymimicry developed by LRH in Camden, N.J., in 1954.The following group of processes are usually taught in Upper Indoctrination Course:NUMBER: Training 6NAME: Plain 8-C.COMMANDS: “Look at that wall.” “Walk over to that wall.” “With your right hand, touch thatwall.” “Turn around.” All with acknowledgments. Not Tone 40. (Preclear is acknowledgedwhen he originates, no physical contact.)POSITION: Student and coach both ambulant in a room with no center obstacles. Studentwalks with coach who does process for student.PURPOSE: To give preclear reality on environment, control in following directions andhavingness. Not all effects fully explored.TRAINING STRESS: Precision in repetition of commands by student and experience on agradient scale in directing another body than own. Handling of originations. Acknowledgingexecution of commands by preclear. When this process develops somatics on a preclear it mustbe continued until flat.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Camden, 1953. Originally called “Opening"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"Procedure of 8-C”, 8-C being a full auditing procedure aimed at negative thought. The onlysurviving part of this is now called 8-C and means the above process. Original intention was toplace preclear within the control of the auditor so auditing could occur. Proved so successfulbecame an end-all in itself. Nominated in Summary Research Project 1956 as responsible all byitself for approximately 50% of results achieved by auditors across the world.NUMBER: Training 7NAME: Hi-School Indoc.COMMANDS: Same as 8-C but with student in physical contact with coach, student enforcingcommands by manual guiding. Coach has only three valid statements to which student mustlisten: these are “Start” to begin process, “Flunk” to call attention to student error, and “That’sit” to end session. No other remark by coach is valid on student. Coach tries in all possibleways, verbal, covert and physical, to stop student from running 8-C on him. If the studentfalters, comm lags, fumbles a command or fails to get an execution on coach, coach says“Flunk” and they start at beginning of command cycle in which error occurred. Coach fallingdown is not allowed.POSITION: Student and coach ambulant. Student handling coach physically.PURPOSE: To train a student never to be stopped by a preclear. To train him to run fine 8-C inany circumstances. To teach him to handle rebellious people.TRAINING STRESS: Stress is on accuracy of student performance and persistence bystudent. Start gradually to toughen up resistance to student. Don’t kill him off at once.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London, 1956.NUMBER: Training 8NAME: Tone 40 on an Object.COMMANDS: “Stand up.” “Thank you.” “Sit down on the table.” “Thank you.” These are theonly commands used. (If student has trouble with Training 9, have him do Tone 40 on anObject with 8-C commands.)POSITION: Student standing beside table holding ashtray which he manually makes executethe commands he gives.PURPOSE: To make student clearly achieve Tone 40 command. To clarify intentions asdifferent than words. To start student on road to handling objects and preclears with postulates.To obtain obedience not wholly based on spoken commands.TRAINING STRESS: have student give orders for a while alone. Then begin to nag him to getthem up to Tone 40 commands. Have student silently permeate object with command and anexpectancy that it will do it. When student can “see” his intentions going in accurately, when hewonders why object doesn’t instantly obey, when he is not stumbling through energy ordepending on his voice, the training process is flat. This process usually takes the most time intraining of any process and time on it is well spent. Objects can be ashtrays or rag dolls.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., 1957, for the 17th ACC.NUMBER: Training 9NAME: Tone 40 on a Person.COMMANDS: Same as 8-C. This is not Tone 40 8-C (CCH 12). Student runs fine, clearcutintentions and verbal orders on a coach. Coach tries to break down Tone 40 of the student."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Coach commands that are valid are “Start” (to begin), “Flunk” to tell student he has erred andmust return to beginning of cycle, and “That’s it” to take a break or stop session for the day.No other statement by coach in session is valid on student and is only an effort to make studentcome off Tone 40 or in general be stopped.POSITION: Student and coach ambulant. Student in manual contact with coach as needed.PURPOSE: To make student able to maintain Tone 40 under any stress of auditing.TRAINING STRESS: The exact amount of physical effort must be used by student plus acompelling unspoken intention. No jerky struggles are allowed since each jerk is 3 stop.Student must learn to smoothly increase effort quickly to amount needed to make coachexecute. Stress is on exact intention, exact strength needed, exact force necessary, exact Tone40. Even a slight smile by student can be a flunk. Too much force can be a flunk. Too littledefinitely is a flunk. Anything not Tone 40 is a flunk.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., for the 17th ACC.The following processes are taught in the Communication-Control-Havingness Course:NUMBER: CCH 0NAME: Rudiments, Goals and Present Time Problem.COMMANDS: Establishing session beginning by calling attention to room, auditor and thesession to begin. Discussing the preclear’s goals for the session. Auditor asks for present timeproblem and settles it with problems of comparable magnitude or incomparable magnitude orby Locational Processing. In general, remarks and commands enough to bring about ARC atsession’s beginning but not enough to run down havingness of the preclear.POSITION: Auditor and preclear seated at a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE: To make known the beginning of a session to a preclear and the auditor so that noerror as to its beginning is made. To put the preclear into a condition to be audited.TRAINING STRESS: To begin sessions, not just let them happen. To educate the student intothe actual elements of a session and condition of preclears. To stress the inability to auditsomething else when present time problem is not flat. To demonstrate what happens whenpreclear doesn’t know session has begun or has no goals for it or what happens when presenttime problem only half flat when other things are engaged upon. Stress that it is done eachsession. Explain closure mechanism of problem with preclear, the solution of “the liability ofsolutions”.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Elizabeth, N.J., 1950; Goals in Wichita, Kansasin 1951; Present Time Problem, London, 1952; Rudiments, Phoenix, 1955.NUMBER: CCH 1.NAME: * Give Me Your Hand, Tone 40.COMMANDS: “Give me your hand.” Physical action of taking hand when not given and thenreplacing it in preclear’s lap. And “Thank you” ending cycle. All Tone 40 with clear intention,one command in one unit of time, no originations of preclear acknowledged in any wayverbally or physically. May be run on right hand, left hand, both hands, each one flattened inturn.POSITION: Auditor and preclear seated, in chairs without arms, close together.

This position reversed for left hand.

Absolute control by auditor thenpasses over toward absolute control of his own body by preclear.TRAINING STRESS: Never stop process until a flat place is reached. To process with goodTone 40.

To leavean instant for preclear to do it by own will before auditor does it. Stress Tone 40 precision. Tokeep epicenters balanced. CCH I (b) should also be flattened.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in the 17th ACC, Washington, D.C., 1957.* The name and command for CCH 1 has since been revised to, “Give me that hand.”NUMBER: CCH2NAME: * Tone 40 8-C.COMMANDS: “Look at that wall.” “Thank you.” “Walk over to that wall.” “Thank you.”“With the right hand, touch that wall.” “Thank you.” “Turn around.” “Thank you.” Runwithout acknowledging in any way any origin by preclear, acknowledging only preclear’sexecution of the command. Commands smoothly enforced physically. Tone 40, full intention.POSITION: Auditor and preclear ambulant, auditor in physical contact with preclear as needed.PURPOSE: To demonstrate to preclear that his body can be directly controlled and thus invitinghim to control it. Finding present time. Havingness. Other effects not fully explained.TRAINING STRESS: Absolute auditor precision. No drops from Tone 40. No flubs. Totalpresent-time auditing. Auditor turns preclear counterclockwise then steps always on preclear’sright side. Auditor’s body acts as block to forward motion when preclear turns. Auditor givescommand, gives preclear a moment to obey, then enforces command with physical contact ofexactly correct force to get command executed. Auditor does not check preclear from executingcommands.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., 1957, for the 17th ACC.* The name and command for CCH 2 has since been revised to, “You look at that wall.”NUMBER: CCH 3NAME: Book Mimicry.COMMANDS: Auditor makes a simple or complex motion with a book. Hands book topreclear. Preclear makes motion, duplicating auditor’s mirror image-wise. Auditor askspreclear if he is satisfied that the preclear duplicated the motion. If preclear is and auditor is alsofairly satisfied, auditor takes book and goes to next command. If preclear says he is and auditorfairly sure preclear isn’t, auditor takes back book and repeats command and gives book topreclear again for another try. If preclear is not sure he duplicated any command auditor repeatsit for him and gives him back the book. Tone 40 only in motions.

The fact that another has pictures shouldbe totally real to the student under training.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in 1951 in Wichita, Kansas. This was once a veryimportant process. It has been known to bring people from a neurotic to a sane level after onlya short period of application. It has been run on a group basis with success but it should benoted that the thinkingness of the individuals in the group would have to be well under thecontrol of the auditor in order to have this process broadly beneficial. When it was discoveredthat this process occasionally reduced people’s havingness, the process itself was not generallyrun thereafter.

There is really nothingwrong with the preclear except that he cannot control his thinkingness, thus he cannot changeconsiderations at will because he is stopped by the bank. This is the most permissive of suchprocesses since the preclear cannot really help to think a thought and we do not much carewhether he thought it or the bank thought it.HISTORY: Developed in 1955 in Phoenix, Arizona, by L.

The prerequisites demand that thethinkingness of the preclear be to some degree under the control of the auditor. The auditormust not be impatient with the preclear, but let the preclear try again and again to get these twoideas, one a low-scale idea and change that idea into an upper-scale idea.

Ron Hubbard in Wichita,Kansas, and is taken from Scientology 8-8008 as published in England and as given in TheCreation of Human Ability, page 129, as R2—51. This is probably the oldest purelyScientology process in existence. It was not entirely workable in the past because it was notunderstood that the body has to be brought under the auditor’s control and that the attention hasto be brought under the auditor’s control before the thinkingness of the preclear can be broughtunder the auditor’s control. The process, however, run on preclears who were not in too badcondition, has been continually successful both in changing their physical beingness andabilities, the latter being in the sphere of interest of Scientology.

When thepreclear experiences a somatic, when he sighs, when he gives a reaction to a Tone 40 process,the auditor repeats the process two or three more times (random number) and then pausing theprocess asks the preclear, “How are you doing now?” or “What is going on?” and finds outwhat happened to the preclear just as though the auditor has not noticed that the preclear had areaction. The auditor does not point out the reaction but merely wants a discussion in general.During this discussion he brings the preclear up to at least a cognition that the preclear has had asomatic or a reaction and then merely continues the process without further bridge. This is donerandomly. It is not always done every time the preclear experiences a reaction.POSITION: Whatever position the preclear and auditor are in as directed by the process theyare running. But usually with the auditor touching the preclear. For example, in “Give Me YourHand” the auditor continues to hold the preclear’s hand after he has said “Thank you” and asksthe preclear how he is doing.TRAINING STRESS: Is that the fishing of a cognition is an art and it cannot be taught bygeneral command, that the auditor must not as-is the preclear’s havingness by asking him,“How are you feeling now?”, that the preclear must not be placed in possession of theknowledge that he can stop the auditor from auditing by having a reaction or experiencing areaction to the processing, otherwise he will begin to experience them simply to stop theauditor. Thus the use of Training 13 is not routine and regular but is random. It should bestressed that this can be used while running any and all Tone 40 processes. It should bestressed that the Tone 40 is run as itself and that fishing a cognition is run into the processbetween cycles of command and acknowledgment and command and acknowledgment. After athorough acknowledgment one can fish for a cognition thus pausing momentarily in theprocess, get things straightened out, maintain ARC with the preclear and then go on with theTone 40 process. One does not enter fishing a cognition between the command and theacknowledgment. One never reacts to what the preclear is doing the instant that the precleardoes it, otherwise one educates the preclear to stop one. Training stress here is that a Tone 40process is not run on an automaton basis."},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"HISTORY: Developed by L.

No. 152 of 15 January 1959on “The Five Levels of Indoctrination”)Compiled from the Research Material and Taped Lectures of L. Ron HubbardWE GO NOW INTO CCH. CCH could not even vaguely be attempted without the fivelevels of Indoctrination having been run. Nevertheless, early in the HPA or HCA Course youwill discover that an individual hasn’t yet had Tone 40, so, although CCH starts with Tone 40,the training continuity of CCH does not. Training starts with dummy auditing in theCommunication Course and then goes to the second level of Indoctrination, which is simple 8-C, and they coincide at that point. The order of learning these processes is therefore differentfrom the order in which they are given to a pc. You don’t have to remember the order oflearning, but you do have to remember the order of giving them to a pc. However, I am goingto give them to you in the order of training.We have simple 8-C (which I have already given you) at the second level. The commandsof simple 8-C are very simple and they do not depend on any other command. In simple 8-Cthe commands are: “Look at that wall. Thank you.” “Walk over to that wall.Thank you.” “With your right hand touch that wall. Thank you.” “Turnaround. Thank you.”The second process we deal with in training is Locational Processing, and this, as youcan see at once, is a command of attention process. The commands are: “Notice that .Thank you.” This is very simple Locational Processing and, by the way, an interestinglytherapeutic process. The training stress is simply this: the direction of attention must not bedisturbed by other mechanisms of attention direction. The auditor must do this smoothly. Weare trying to get the auditor to get the preclear’s attention to go smoothly to the object indicated.What we have here is one person handling another person’s attention—this is quite unusual,and must be done very smoothly. We don’t care how well the commands are getting across,beyond, of course, that they should get across as well as a person learned to get across acommand in dummy auditing. The auditor picks out objects and says, “Notice that .”He normally points, and the preclear merely turns his head. There are no cautions to be usedwith this except that, if the preclear gets very restimulated, flatten it.The third is called Locational, Body and Room, and here we have the first example ofextraversion-introversion. The commands are: “Look at that____.Thank you. Look atyour (foot, hand or knee). Thank you.” There is an alternative set of commands onthis: “Notice the chair. Notice your hand Notice the wall. Notice the floor.”They actually have a difference. A person who is pretty dead in his head had better be told to“notice,” because the strain and stress which will come on him through trying to get out of hisbody and “look” at his head is so great he will start pulling ridges to pieces. So, of the two, the"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"safest is “Notice.” The other will exteriorize somebody. They are two different sets ofcommands, two different objects. “Look at that wall, look at your hand,” etc., is liable to find aperson out there five feet outside his head. But if a person would not normally exteriorize byhis build, bank behavior, etc., you would use “Notice.” In training we use “Notice,” but wemust remember that the process works fabulously well with “Look.”That’s an extraversion-introversion process. We have the sequence of it as “Look in onyourself. Look at yourself. Look at the environment. Look at yourself. Look at theenvironment”—alternating it. This is what is known as an alternate command. It is necessary tocall your attention to that bit of terminology because in “Give me your hand” Tone 40, we run iton the right hand and we run it on the left hand, but it is not an alternate. We don’t say, “Giveme your right hand. Give me your left hand.”The next one of these is Objective Show Me. Here the preclear does a littledemonstrating. The reason this is put in here is because it is one of the more miraculoustherapeutic processes. It is the reason why a person’s bank is invisible to other people. It is thereason why people have secrets, they pull banks in on themselves, and the reason why theydon’t dare show it to anybody else. The commands are: “Show me that . Thank you.”The auditor points to the object he wishes to be shown. Only when that is running fairly wellwill you run it on an extrovert-introvert basis, and the next series of commands on it could be“Show me that . Show me your .” (i.e., “Show me that table. Show me your foot.Show me that ceiling. Show me your hand.”) This, by the way, opens the door to mock-upsand facsimiles anybody could see. If there is some method of achieving that, this is the processto do it. A person overcomes his unwillingness to show things, and he realizes that he is notstill on Arcturus and you are not the space police from Saturn. He is being made unwilling bylife to show anybody anything.Actually, I would omit this process under training. I wouldn’t show a person how to dothis early in his training. I would let him find this one up the track somewhere. That is why Ihave not given it out in training earlier. But you must know that it exists because it is a veryimportant process and has to be handled very delicately—that is why at this level of training itisn’t used.Instead, we use a mild one called Attention by Duplication 9, Number 4. This is a veryold process, but we don’t run it in the old manner. We place a book in one location and a bottlein another location (never more than five feet apart), and we say, “Look at that book.Walk over to that book. Pick up that book. Put the book down in exactly thesame place.” The same goes for the bottle. You could add a “Turn around” in there, but youhave then graduated this to Tone 40 Book and Bottle.Tone 40 Book and Bottle is not Opening Procedure by Duplication. You have to be readyto assume total control of the preclear to run Tone 40 Book and Bottle. The commands are thesame, except that you never acknowledge anything but the execution of the auditingcommands. Then we would only have to add the command “Turn around.” He is really notsupposed to do anything else we have not told him to do. (In training we use OpeningProcedure by Duplication and later on will have to show somebody what we mean by Tone 40Book and Bottle.) The training stress on this is precision. The auditor must not make anymistakes or omissions on this command. It is one of the most arduous processes to run knownto man. If an auditor adds into it the randomity of getting his commands mixed up, he canpractically finish a preclear. It is one of the number one exteriorization processes. If OpeningProcedure by Duplication 1957 will exteriorize somebody (and it will), Tone 40 Book andBottle is likely to send him on his way. You have no latitude for mistakes here. The trainingstress is the exact duplication of the commands. One of the cautions that must be observed inrunning this is that it is not left unflattened and mustn’t be faltered if it begins to run. If theprocess is biting it must not be stopped simply because there is a class schedule involved. Ifyou were unfortunate enough to begin Opening Procedure by Duplication 1957 at 3 p.m. and itwas running on the preclear, you have no choice if it is still running at 2 a.m. in the morning—Auditor’s Code or not, you are still going to be there running it.

Until the preclear’s reality on his environment is good, Opening Procedure byDuplication should not be done, for the preclear only turns on an unreality circuit and goesthrough it mechanically. The first part of Opening Procedure by Duplication is to get thepreclear to examine, communicate with and own (somewhat on the order of Opening Procedureof 8-C) two dissimilar objects. These objects are then placed several feet apart and at a level sothat the preclear can pick them up without bending over, but so that he has to walk betweenthem. Once the auditor is entirely satisfied that the preclear has reality on these objects and canown them he then begins Opening Procedure by Duplication with the following commands,supposing that one of the objects was a book and the other was an ash tray, ‘Go over to thebook’, ‘Look at it’, ‘Pick it up’, ‘What is its color?’ At this point the preclear must give ananswer. ‘What is its temperature?’, here the preclear must answer again. ‘Put it down in exactlythe same place.’ When the preclear has executed, ‘Go over to the ash tray’, ‘Look at it’, ‘Pick itup’, ‘What is its color?’ the preclear says his answer. ‘What is its temperature?’, the preclearsays his answer. ‘Put it down exactly in the same place.’ When the preclear has executed, ‘Goover to the book’ and the same words and the same formula are used over and over again untilthe preclear has had a sufficient number of hours of Opening Procedure by Duplication toenable him to do it without communication lag, without protest, without apathy, but onlycheerfulness, each time seeing the items newly.

It’s just an effort to speed up clearing. A closestudy indicates that the UK case tends strongly to alter-is a command. It’s no wonder, lookingover the country’s history, that commands got dangerous.Therefore, in the HGC in London, I am now going to require an addition to procedure forclearing as follows:When the Formulas are gotten out of the way and, while still running Failed Helpbetween tests for havingness, the Havingness is found, a period of at least forty-five hours isinstituted where the pc is run on S-C-S or 8C interspersed with a few commands of hisHavingness every half hour. The last five hours will be run on Op-Pro-by-Dup.Only when this is done will the auditor locate the Confront and then continue withRegimen 3.If a test by the auditor, on any case, regardless of nationality, shows that the pc is pooron control, the above routine should be followed.This data is backed up by enormous success with S-C-S and Op-Pro-by-Dup in Englandand the general success of 8C.I have been looking for the bug in UK clearing for some time and feel that this is itsremedy.S-C-SS-C-S now has four stages, instead of three. It has been found that at least one pc neverflattened start because the body was “already started” being in constant motion and so the pcnever could start it.

Ron Hubbard, Ph.D., C.E.Continued from PAB 86SCIENTOLOGY PROCESSINGScientology is applied in many ways to many fields. One particular and specialized methodof application of Scientology is its use on individuals and groups of people in the eradication ofphysical illnesses deriving from mental states and the improvement of their abilities andintelligence. By processing is meant the verbal exercising of a patient (preclear) in exactScientology processes. There is a great deal of terminology and precision in these processesand their use and they are not combinable with older mental activities such as psychiatry,psychology, psychoanalysis, yoga, massage, etc. However, these processes are capable ofaddressing or treating the same ills of the mind as are delineated by older methodology, withthe addition that Scientology is alone in its ability to successfully eradicate those psychosomaticills to which it is addressed and is the only science or study known which is capable ofuniformly producing marked and significant increases in intelligence and general ability.Scientology processing, amongst other things, can increase the intelligence quotient of anindividual, his ability or desire to communicate, his social attitudes, his capability and domesticharmony, his fertility, his artistic creativity, his reaction time and his health.An additional sphere of activity allied to processing is Preventive Scientology. In thisbranch of processing an individual is inhibited or restrained from assuming states lower than hehas already suffered from. In other words the progress of tendencies, neuroses, habits anddeteriorating activities can be halted by Scientology or their occurrence can be prevented. Thisis done by processing the individual on standard Scientology processes without particularattention to the disability involved.Scientology processing is called “auditing” by which the auditor (practitioner) “listens andcommands.” The auditor and the preclear (patient) are together out-of-doors or in a quiet placewhere they will not be disturbed or where they are not being subjected to interruptinginfluences. The purpose of the auditor is to give the preclear certain and exact commands whichthe preclear can follow and perform. The purpose of the auditor is to increase the ability of thepreclear. The Auditor’s Code is the governing set of rules for the general activity of auditing.The Code follows:"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"THE AUDITOR’S CODE1. Do not evaluate for the preclear.2. Do not invalidate or correct the preclear’s data.3. Use the processes which improve the preclear’s case.4. Keep all appointments once made.5. Do not process a preclear after 10 p.m.6. Do not process a preclear who is improperly fed.7. Do not permit a frequent change of auditors.8. Do not sympathize with the preclear.9. Never permit the preclear to end the session on his own independent decision. 10. Never walk off from a preclear during a session. 11. Never get angry with a preclear. 12.Always reduce every communication lag encountered by continued use of the samequestion or process. 13. Always continue a process as long as it produces change and no longer. 14. Be willing to grant beingness to the preclear. 15. Never mix the processes of Scientology with those of various other practices. 16.Always remain in good two-way communication with the preclear during sessions.The Auditor’s Code governs the activity of the auditor during sessions. The activity of theScientologist in general is governed by another broader code.THE CODE OF A SCIENTOLOGISTAs a Scientologist, I pledge myself to the Code of Scientology for the good of all: 1. To hear or speak no word of disparagement to the press, public or preclears concerningany of my fellow Scientologists, our professional organization or those whose names areclosely connected to this Science. 2. To use the best I know of Scientology to the best of my ability to better my preclears,groups and the world. 3. To refuse to accept for processing and to refuse to accept money from any preclear orgroup I feel I cannot honestly help. 4. To punish to the fullest extent of my power anyone misusing or degrading Scientology toharmful ends. 5. To prevent the use of Scientology in advertisements of other products. 6. To discourage the abuse of Scientology in the press. 7. To employ Scientology to the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics. 8. To render good processing, sound training and good discipline to those students orpeoples entrusted to my care. 9. To refuse to impart the personal secrets of my preclears.10. To engage in no unseemly disputes with the uninformed on the subject of my profession.As it can be seen, both of these codes are designed to protect the preclear as well as Scientologyand the auditor in general. As these codes evolve from many years of observation andexperience by a great number of people, it can be said that they are intensely important and areprobably complete. Failure to observe them has resulted in a failure of Scientology."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Scientology can do what it can do only when it is used within the limits of these two codes.Thus it can be seen that the interjection of peculiarities or practices by the auditor intoScientology processing can actually nullify and eradicate the benefits of that processing. Anyhope or promise in Scientology is conditional upon its good use by the individual and its use inparticular within the limits of these two codes.THE CONDITIONS OF AUDITINGCertain definite conditions must prevail and a certain methodology must be followed inorder that processing may be beneficial to its fullest extent.Probably the first condition is a good grasp of Scientology as a Science and its mission inthe world.The second condition would be a relaxed state of mind on the part of the auditor and theconfidence that his use of Scientology upon the preclear will not produce a harmful result.The third requisite should be finding a preclear. By this it is literally meant that oneshould discover somebody willing to be processed and having discovered one so willingshould then make sure that he is aware that he is there being processed.The fourth requisite would be a quiet place in which to audit with every precaution takenthat the preclear will not be interrupted or burst in upon or unduly startled during processing.All requisites for auditing from here on are entirely concerned with procedures andprocesses. By auditing procedure is meant the general model of how one goes about addressinga preclear. This includes an ability to place one question, worded exactly the same way, overand over again to the preclear no matter how many times the preclear has answered thequestion. It should include the ability to acknowledge with a “good” and “all right” every time apreclear executes or completes the execution of a command. It should include the ability toaccept a communication from the preclear. When the preclear has something to say the auditorshould acknowledge the fact that he has received the preclear’s communication and should paysome attention to the communication. Procedure also includes the ability to sense when thepreclear is being over-strained by processing or is being unduly annoyed and to handle suchcrises in the session to prevent the preclear from leaving. An auditor should also have theability of handling startling remarks or occurrences by the preclear. An auditor should also havethe knack of preventing the preclear from talking obsessively since prolonged conversationmarkedly reduces the havingness of the preclear and the sooner long dissertations by thepreclear are cut off the better for the session in general. Processes, as distinct from procedures,consist of utilizing the principle of the gradient scale to the end of placing the preclear in bettercontrol of himself, his mind, the people and the universe around him. By gradient scale ismeant a proceeding from simplicity toward greater difficulty, giving the preclear always nomore than he can do, but giving him as much as he can do until he can handle a great deal. Theidea here is to give the preclear nothing but wins and to refrain from giving the preclear loses inthe game of processing. Thus it can be seen that processing is a team activity and is not itself agame whereby the auditor opposes and seeks to defeat the preclear and the preclear seeks todefeat the auditor, for when this condition exists there are little results in processing.The earliest stage of auditing consists in taking over control of the preclear so as to restoreto the preclear more control of himself than he has had. The most fundamental step is thenlocation, whereby the preclear is made to be aware of the fact that he is in an auditing room,that an auditor is present and that the preclear is being a preclear. Those conditions will becomequite apparent if one realizes that it would be very difficult for a son to process a father. Afather is not likely to recognize anything else than the boy he raised in his auditor. Therefore thefather would have to be made aware of the fact that the son was a competent practitioner beforethe father could be placed under control in processing. One of the most elementary commandsin Scientology is “Look at me, who am I?” After a preclear has been asked to do this many"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"times until he can do so quickly and accurately and without protest, it can be said that thepreclear will have “found” the auditor.The preclear is asked by the auditor to control, which is to say, start, change and stop(the anatomy of control) anything he is capable of controlling. In a very bad case this might bea very small object being pushed around on a table, being started and changed and stopped eachtime specifically and only at the auditor’s command until the preclear himself realizes that hehimself can start, change and stop the object. Sometimes four or five hours spent in thisexercise are very well spent on a very difficult preclear.The preclear is then asked to start, change and stop his own body under the auditor’sspecific and precise direction. In all of his commands the auditor must be careful never to give asecond command before the first one has been fully obeyed. A preclear in this procedure iswalked around the room and is made to start, change the direction of and stop his body, one ofthese at a time, in emphasis, until he realizes that he can do so with ease. Only now could it besaid that a session is well in progress or that a preclear is securely under the auditor’scommand. It should be noted especially that the goal of Scientology is better self-determinismfor the preclear. This rules out at once hypnotism, drugs, alcohol or other control mechanismsused by other and older therapies. It will be found that such things are not only not necessarybut they are in direct opposition to the goals of greater ability for the preclear.The principal points of concentration for the auditor now become the ability of thepreclear to have, the ability of the preclear to not-know and the ability of the preclear to play agame.An additional factor is the ability of the preclear to be himself and not a number of otherpeople such as his father, his mother, his marital partner or his children.The ability of the preclear is increased by addressing to him the process known as theTrio. These are three questions, or rather commands.1. “Look around here and tell me what you could have.”2. “Look around here and tell me what you would permit to remain in place.”3. “Now look around and tell me with what you could dispense.”No. 1 above is used usually about ten times, then No. 2 is used five times, and No. 3 isused once. This ratio of ten, five and one would be an ordinary or routine approach tohavingness. The end in view is to bring the preclear into a condition whereby he can possess orown or have whatever he sees, without further conditions, ramifications or restrictions. This isthe most therapeutic of all processes, as elementary as it might seem. It is done without toomuch two-way communication or discussion with the preclear and it is done until the preclearcan answer question one, two and three equally well. It should be noted at once that twenty-five hours of use of this process by an auditor upon a preclear brings about a very high rise intone. By saying twenty-five hours it is intended to give the idea of the length of time theprocess should be used. As it is a strain on the usual person to repeat the same question overand over, it will be seen that an auditor should be well disciplined or very well trained before heaudits.In the case of a preclear who is very unable, “can’t have” is substituted for “have” in eachof the above questions for a few hours until the preclear is ready for the Trio in its “have” form.This can-can’t is the plus and minus aspect of all thought and in Scientology is called by aspecialized word, “dichotomy.”The rehabilitation of the ability of the preclear to not-know is also rehabilitation of thepreclear in the time stream, since the process of time consists of knowing the moment and not-knowing the past and not-knowing the future simultaneously. This process, like all otherScientology processes, is repetitive. The process is run, ordinarily, only after the preclear is invery good condition and is generally run in an exterior well-inhabited place. Here the auditor,"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"without exciting public comment, indicates a person and asks the preclear, “Can you not-know something about that person?” The auditor does not permit the preclear to “not-know” things which the preclear already doesn’t know. The preclear “not-knows” only thosethings which are visible and apparent about the person. This is also run on other objects in theenvironment such as walls, floors, chairs and other things. The auditor should not be startledwhen for the preclear large chunks of the environment start to disappear. This is ordinaryroutine and in effect the preclear should make the entirety of the environment disappear at hisown command. The environment does not disappear for the auditor. The end goal of this “not-know” process is the disappearance of the entire universe, under the preclear’s control, butonly for the preclear. It will be discovered while running this that the preclear’s “havingness”may deteriorate. If this happens he was not run enough on the Trio before he was run on thisprocess. It is only necessary in such a case to intersperse “Look around here now and tellme what you could have” with the “not know” command to keep the preclear in goodcondition. Drop of havingness is manifested by nervous agitation, obsessive talk or semi-unconsciousness or “dopiness” on the part of the preclear. These manifestations indicate onlyreduction of havingness.The reverse of the question here is “Tell me something that you would bewilling to have that person (indicated by the auditor) not-know about you.”Both sides of the question have to be run (audited). This process can be continued for twenty-five hours or even fifty or seventy-five hours of auditing with considerable benefit so long as itdoes not react too violently upon the preclear in terms of loss of havingness.It should be noted that, in running either havingness or “not-know” on a preclear, thepreclear may exteriorize. In other words it may become apparent, either by his observation orbecause the preclear informs him, that the auditor has “exteriorized” a preclear. Under “TheParts of Man” section there is an explanation of this phenomenon. In modern auditing theauditor does not do anything odd about this beyond receive and be interested in the preclear’sstatement of the fact. The preclear should not be permitted to become alarmed since it is a usualmanifestation. A preclear is in better condition and will audit better exteriorized than “in hishead.” Understanding that an actual ability to “not-know” is an ability to erase by self-command the past without suppressing it with energy or going into any other method isnecessary to help the preclear. It is the primary rehabilitation in terms of knowingness.Forgetting is a lower manifestation than “not-knowingness.”"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"P.A.B.

RON HUBBARDVia Hubbard Communications Office35/37 Fitzroy Street, London W.1_____________________________________________________________________1 June 1958SOME MORE CCH PROCESSESCompiled from L. Ron Hubbard’s Research Writings and Taped Lectures to the18th American Advanced Clinical CourseCONTROL TRIO:After one has run CCH 0 to 5 and has brought the preclear’s body and attention undercontrol, there are various ways of handling the case from there on. Here is a series of processeswhich undercuts Trio and is called “Control Trio.”The commands for Control Trio are:1. “Notice that (auditor indicates object) and get me idea of having it.”2. “Notice mat (auditor indicates object) and get the idea of permitting it tocontinue.”3. “Notice that (auditor indicates object) and get me idea of making itdisappear.”The processes should be run in that order and each one must be run flat before the nextone is attempted. It is very necessary to clear the command before embarking upon the process.Preclears simply understand that “having” means that they must possess something, carry itwith them wherever they go—without just leaving the mountain, chair or whatever it is, in itsown space-time continuum. He gets it confused with ownership and so forth.In Fundamentals of Thought there is an excellent definition of havingness: “The essentialdefinition of having is to be able to touch or permeate or to direct the disposition of:”During the running of the first command the preclear will come up with cognitionsregarding the necessity of having or not having things, its goodness or badness, and will ingeneral run out his earlier training regarding this point. It will change his conceptions whichearlier religions may have implanted, such as it is “bad to have,” and run out the compulsionsof “must, must not, got to, can’t have,” etc.Find out what the preclear is doing and how he is doing this, for he should gethavingness from this process and his tone should rise considerably. A change should take placewithin a very short period, otherwise (a) his body and attention are not under control or (b) hedoesn’t understand the command and is running a different process than that which youintended."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"There should be no qualifications or conditions such as “If I had the money I could buythat object and then have it,” or “I don’t like it and thus don’t want it,” or “What shall I do withit once I have got it?” It is just the ability to have without other considerations of goodness,badness, ownership or beauty going with it, and the auditor and preclear should clear suchconceptions through good but non-evaluating two-way communication.The second part of this trio brings the preclear’s sense of active participation of creativityand responsibility out, for he must grant that particular object sufficient life and beingness toallow it to “continue within its own space and time.” Preclears come up with the considerationsthat they have either tried to not-is objects and/or people or “withheld” something from them ortried to push them out of their environments because they didn’t like them or agree with them.This is an interesting process to put their ideas about what they should have around them backinto proper perspective. They will find that there is no harm in permitting the sixth dynamic tocontinue in present time right where it is.The third part of the trio is the most effective and more will be said about it in a followingPAB. It is a very good exteriorizing process and the preclear will come up with manycognitions on his own and the rest of the dynamics. Here the idea is just to “get the idea ofmaking the object disappear” instead of to dispense with it or not-know or not-is it.This cycle can be run over and over again until it is flat, within a few minutes after thecommand has again given the preclear some gains.After this, Trio (old-time Terrible Trio) can then be run with great advantage on a casewho couldn’t do it before. Control Trio, which undercuts Trio, will bring out its reality level.GOALS:With every preclear it is most necessary to establish goals that are REAL for thePRECLEAR. You want him to have some goals which are HIS and not what grandma, fatheror schoolteacher desires for him. Preclears who have no real goals are working on otherpeople’s determinism and we have to (a) establish the certainty of a future for the preclear, and(b) get him to put things in that future that he WANTS, so that he can have a future.There is a gradient scale of processes which will establish goals which are REAL to thepreclear by casual two-way communication, using the following questions:1. “What are you absolutely sure will happen in the next two minutes?”one hour, three days, one week, three months, one year, etc.Complete certainty on each time span is necessary before the auditor continues to the nexttime span. This is done by two-way communication, and the auditor must all the time be surethat the preclear is certain that these things are going to happen in the next two minutes (orwhatever the time span is) to ensure that the process really bites.2. “Tell me something that you would like to do in the next twominutes,” one hour, etc., is the next process that would put doingness and moretime into that future.On some preclears the following questions may be realer and bite faster. This is puttingthe accent on have instead of do, since we work from the bottom up on the Be, Do, Havetriangle. They are:3. “Tell me something you are sure will be there in two minutes, etc.,”and4. “Tell me something you would like to have in two minutes, etc.”"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"The last two processes really undercut the above and are thus lower level processes and itis advisable to run them on preclears whose ability to communicate and reality level are low.Watch out for the preclear attaching all sorts of conditions to his answers. Also worktowards positive goals of “things” and not conditions such as “I want to get rid of my fears andsomatics.” The latter type of preclear is working towards nothing rather than towardssomething. (A more positive goal of something would be “I want a stick of candy or a glass ofwater.”) Check for certainty at all times, for certainty strengthens reality and the reality of afuture for the preclear is most essential if auditing is to succeed all the way.LOSSES:Why doesn’t a preclear exteriorize easily and stay exteriorized? And “Why does he getsick when one asks him to conceive a static?” is the accompanying question. The answer to thisis “Losses.” The preclear associates a static with loss, and he says, “All right, if there isnothing there I’ve lost it.”Conceiving a static is therefore painful, and whenever he lost anything somethingdisappeared. An individual cannot conceive a static if he associates static with a loss-if it ispainful. So we have to cure him of the painfulness of loss, consideration of, before we canexteriorize him easily.We do this by going back to automaticity. The universe has been taking things away fromthe preclear. It has become an automaticity known as “time.” Time itself is a consecutive seriesof losses. So we have to cure this preclear of losses before we can get him to appreciate time,otherwise he would be so afraid of losing it that he’d park himself on the track, and this is the“stuck on the track” phenomenon.This is done with the process “Recall a moment of loss,” sandwiched withhavingness (Control Trio, Trio or Locational Processing). This gets the preclear to take overthe automaticity of all of the losses which he has experienced unwillingly.When an individual has no visio, has never seen anything, couldn’t see anything, theonly thing that he is looking at is a “stuck” loss.Recall a Moment of Loss and Goals are a lower harmonic of running Then and NowSolids and are at the moment making a bid for our chief exteriorization processes. Recall aMoment of Loss should be run with two-way communication, but not too much outflow of thepreclear. Communication must at all times remain two-way. Ask the preclear “when” thishappened now and again, unless, of course, he told you when he recalled the loss.Control Trio, Goals and Recall a Moment of Loss are a combination of processes andshould be run as a combination to secure the best gain for the preclear.A Scientologist is one who controls persons, environments and situations.Scientology means knowing in the fullest sense of the word.Scientology is used on Life and its forms and products.A Scientologist operates within the boundaries of the Auditor’s Code and the Code of aScientologist.The chief uses of Scientology are in the fields of education, organization, mentaldisability and religion.

It was given by L. Ron Hubbard to the HGC staffauditors in Washington, D.C. on 23 August 1957.Thinkingness in general should not be suspected to be under anybody’s control. It isprobably more under the auditor’s control than it is under the preclear’s.When I say or ask “Is the preclear’s thinkingness under control?” I want you tounderstand that it is less under the preclear’s control at any time than under the auditor’s. Theauditor can certainly control the preclear’s thinkingness better than the preclear can. But beforeyou can do this you must first get the preclear’s body and attention under control.A condition to running Trio is: Is the person and attention under your control? To assumethat the power of choice is also under the preclear’s control—much less his thinkingness—is,of course, completely wrong.This condition then moves Trio way up on the present scale of processes. In order to givethe preclear some havingness after CCH 0 to 5 has been flattened, I have developed anundercut to Trio.Trio is a directive process and should be prefaced by “Get the idea of having thatclock.” “Get the idea of having that picture (indicated picture on the wall),”etc. That’s highly directive and would keep thinkingness of a rough case under control.The second version is: “Get the idea that it is all right to permit that (indicatedobject) to continue.” It is also just an indicating process.The third section of this trio is the clincher: “Get the idea of making that(indicated object) disappear.” One runs “disappear” instead of “dispense with” or “not-know.”Small objects are much easier for the preclear to make disappear than large ones. Youhave not told him to make it disappear but only to “get the idea of making it disappear.”Preclears usually literally interpret you and try like mad to make it disappear—and it usuallydoes for a short time.I have solved the enigma of exteriorization. Why doesn’t a preclear exteriorize easily andstay exteriorized? We ask the accompanying question: Why does a preclear get sick when oneasks him to conceive a static? Obviously we would have to get somebody to conceive a staticbefore he could himself stay comfortably outside his body’s head."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"The answer to this problem is contained in the process “Recall a moment of loss.”Loss prevents the preclear from conceiving a static. He associates a static with loss. He says,“All right, if there is nothing there I’ve lost it,” or “I’ve lost something there, therefore I’dbetter not conceive a static.”Conceiving a static is therefore painful. The truth of the matter is whenever he lostanything, something disappeared. All right. The funny part of it is that he never noticed that hedidn’t lose totally every time. He still had other objects. He lost his tie pin, but he still has histie. He’s still got the floor, the room, this universe, space, etc., but he never realizes this inthese instances and that is why we run this process “Recall a moment of loss” to accustomsomebody to conceiving a static very directly on loss and to get him to exteriorize.An individual cannot conceive a static if he associates static with loss—if the loss ispainful. So we have to cure him of the painfulness of loss, consideration of, before we canexteriorize him easily.We do this by going back to automaticity. The universe has been taking things away fromhim. It has become an automaticity, and we find that the universe has an automaticity known astime and time itself is a consecutive series of losses. So we have to cure the preclear of lossesbefore we can get him to appreciate time, otherwise he would be so afraid of losing it that he’dstick himself on the track and we get the “stuck on the track” phenomenon.The process “Recall a moment of loss” aimed at this, but the third command of ControlTrio (as this series of processes had better be called), “Get the idea of making that(indicated object) disappear,” handles it very well. This gets the preclear to take over theautomaticity of all of the losses which he has unwillingly experienced.The universe has been taking the things away from him, and just spotting objects andgetting the idea that they are going to disappear or are disappearing takes over the automaticityof losses, and he becomes accustomed to it after a while.All of the invisible masses that preclears have around them are actually simply symptomsof mass—loss, mass—loss. When an individual has no visio the only thing that he is lookingat is a “stuck” loss. He is looking at the nothingness of something that was there.So one takes over that automaticity with the third command of Control Trio and onetherefore has a very highly directional, workable set of processes.Each part of that Trio would be run relatively flat and go on to the next part, and I wouldsay that one would run each part certainly not a hundred commands each and the auditor shouldendeavor to stay in that order of magnitude and just run it round and round.Take somebody with glasses, for example. His eyesight will do more tricks in less timeon this third command of Control Trio than one can imagine. Things will go black. Well, whydo things go black? Blackness makes things disappear and one takes over the automaticity ofblackness to make things disappear. Night grabs, the way of the universe, once in every 24hours on earth here. This is the process we have been looking for to turn on visio.If you want to turn on sonic with this you would have to go down to a noisy part of townand just run Trio on sound, but you wouldn’t dare run Control Trio on sound if the preclear didnot already have it flat on objects. Visio turns on before sonic.There are many things one could do with this process. People who have anaesthetizedareas in their body—like they have no chest, etc.—do weird things during this process.I wanted to tell you particularly about this particular process because it is a specific andwill be found to be very useful to you. We had to find out if one version of this would run"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"without killing a preclear and that is “Recall a moment of loss.” Actually “Recall a moment ofloss” should act as a havingness process because it as-ises all of the lost points on the track andit should be a havingness process all by itself; but we didn’t want to be so bold as to run it withno havingness.(Until I find out differently, this Control Trio and “Recall a moment of loss” are making abid for our chief exteriorization processes.)Now here is a process which is based on our old “Recall a secret.” The version isentirely straight wire. The auditor explains to the preclear that he is not looking for hidden datato evaluate it. He is only asking the preclear to look at the data. He then makes a list ofvalences, paying great attention to those the preclear considers “unimportant” or is very slow todivulge. Then the auditor takes this list and runs repetitive straight wire ( 1951 ) as follows:“Think of something you might withhold from (valence).”The auditor repeats this question over and over until no communication lag is present. Henever says “something else you might withhold from valence” because the auditor wants thepreclear to think of some of these many times.Before selecting another valence the auditor runs a little Locational or Trio. He then takesthe next valence the same way. The list is covered once and then the same list is covered again.The object is speed. Cover many people. Given time the auditor can do the same thing on alldynamics.There is a variation. Instead of a valence, body parts may be used. “Think ofsomething you might withhold from that (body part).” Leave sexual parts orobvious psychosomatic difficulties until last. Don’t begin on a withered arm, for example.It is amusing to realize that this process overlords all early psychotherapies, but they,using this effort to locate secrets, thought that divulgence and confession were the therapeuticagents. These have no bearing on workability. Further, early efforts naively thought there wasone secret per case. Actually there are billions. It is easy to get into past lives on this. A basicsecret is that one lived before.Whenever you run “withhold” on a valence you finish up with “can’t have” on thevalence and “have” for the preclear. It flattens off better that way.You will often find that it is more advantageous to run Locational Processing thanProblems of Comparable or Incomparable Magnitude at times. A Problem of ComparableMagnitude is all right, but it is a thinkingness process and on a case that is having an awful lotof trouble with it, it gives them hell to run Locational Processing, but nevertheless it does runout the present time problem, which is most fascinating.Any one of the Rudiments is an excellent process. Two-Way Communication is great anddoes not as-is havingness. You have to keep the reality of two-way comm very high, though,and be willing to interrupt obsessive outflows and silences of the preclear. It is establishing ahigh level of reality. It consists of the auditor feeding experimental data to the preclear to havehim look it over and decide about it one way or the other. You don’t let the preclear in Two-Way Comm as-is everything he knows, thinks, or wants to do.The latest addition to the Rudiments is “Clearing the Auditor.” Actually the crudest wayknown of clearing the auditor is “Who do I remind you of?” “Tell me"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"something you like about me.” The best way of clearing the auditor we know of is inTraining 15, which is “Could I help you?” “How?” “Could you help me?” “How?”“Could I help anybody else?” “How?” “Could you help anybody else?”“How?” “Do other people ever help other people?” “Do women ever helpwomen?” “Do men ever help men?” “Do men ever help women?” etc. You beat itto pieces on a big long bracket.This goes so far that it becomes a fantastic process in itself. You take father and mothervalences and they are usually quite hot. You can run this on “Help.” This is usually quitenecessary on a case that is going to hang up because the only reason he is sitting there is towaste help.One has to understand that this case is trying to waste help, and it isn’t a matter of “Findthe Auditor” in the Rudiments today, but “Clear the Auditor” and the only point on which he iscleared is “Help”—”Can I help you? Can you help me?”We use Handbook for Preclears to give the preclear some homework at the HubbardGuidance Centers and it has been helping out just to the degree that it does some clarification ongoals and gets the preclear stirred up. It simply stirs up the case so that it will run out.I was running over a phrenological questionnaire, and it said people are never permittedto do anything they want to do and this is the best goal of discipline. I got this tangled out inone way or the other. I got thinking about it from the standpoint— this was about 20 yearsago—of “I wonder if there is anybody around that could articulate with great conciseness whathe would like to do?” And I have found on all hands a failure to articulate was the maindifficulty. A person had the feeling that he wanted to do something and that it would bewonderful, but it was all in a sensory capacity. If he could have been made to articulate this itwould really have been something. And I experimented on it a little bit and we see that today inthe Handbook for Preclears.If you can get a person to articulate in a session anything about the future you have wonthe subject of goals. But it must be in the alignment of this person’s frame of reference. It mustbe aligned with his life—not aligned with something we think he ought to live.So let’s take a look at the clearance of goals. Goals would not be likely to run on a highgenerality. In other words, they are specific, personal and intimate. It is “What do youthink? What do you want? What is aligned to your life?”Let’s look at Goals as a process. One could run Goals for 25 hours with the greatest ofease. One could run the Present Time Problem for 25 hours, and we just had a report of aterrific win here on a preclear who was run on Locational for 25 hours. So it looks as thoughthe Rudiments could be the session.We discover a preclear in the terrible condition of not wanting any auditing, not going anyplace and all of his goals being somebody else’s goals. Two things can be done immediately:Clear the auditor and then run Goals.Goals could be run with two-way comm in this manner. You ask the preclear what he isabsolutely sure would happen in the next couple of minutes, the next hour, a day from now, aweek from now, one month from now and one year from now. We want something that thepreclear is absolutely sure would happen.We are running right there the reverse process of atomic bombs which say “no future—no future—no future.” That is basically what is wrong with a person. Why does he get jammedon the track? It is because of “no future.” He had been denied to a point where his loss was sogreat that he dared not own.I had a case, by the way, which was one of the roughest cases I have ever run into. He"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"put on the total appearance of being sane—dramatized sanity—and yet the case would makeodd remarks like “I really think people are crazy.” “Well, why do you think people are crazy?”I would say. “Well, because people say they can tell right from wrong and you know there’sno difference.” It was fascinating. He would make odd remarks like this from time to time.One day he made a remark on goals: “Well, it’s really best to tell people that things cannothappen to them because otherwise they might hope they could and then they would bedisappointed.”This person was stark, staring mad and had no future of any kind. Five hours just thisone question, “Is there anything going to happen in the remainder of this afternoon?” “Willanything happen the rest of today?” “Is there anything going to occur any place in the world therest of today?” was run on him and his confident answer, with great certainty was, “No. No.No.”Finally we broke through it and I finally got the person to admit that there was someslight possibility that there would be a room here for the rest of the day. That busted the case. Itread from total no-future up.This case was an isolated one as we have had occasionally. Now and then an inspirationalsort of process cracked them through. Well, now we see this process of Goals on the basis offutures and a person without futures cannot have a fancy future called a goal and all a goal is isa fancy future determined by the person. If he has no future at all determined by anybody, thenhe isn’t going to go anywhere from that point and any goal he has is totally unreal.The best way that I know of to clear up a goal is as follows (with two-way comm): “Isthere anything that is going to happen in the next couple of minutes?” We getthis thrashed out until he has got some great big certainty that there will be something a coupleof minutes from now. Then we gradiently move it up and we get certainties at each one of thesestages and levels—regardless of on what.The person knows there is going to be a future there. Now let’s have him put somethingin this future he has now created. He has created a future and has certainty on it. Now let’s putsome desire in the future and we get a goal.“Now what would you like to have happen in the next couple of minutes?”or “What would you like to do in the next couple of minutes, tomorrow, nextweek, etc?” We will get weird things which have no desire in them; they will all be get-rid-of’s, and if you finally plowed him down on it he would get down to the bottom of the ladder,which is “Knock this body off right now.” And when he says, “I would like to get over myfear of darkness, I would like to get over feeling bad every time my mother screams at me,”these aren’t desires. These are run-aways, flinches. These are “Let’s not confront it,” “Let’s getout of the universe; let’s scram,” and the final result is the basic postulate, “If I could just getrid of this body right this instant I would be all right.”So that process doesn’t even vaguely get flat unless there is a real goal like “I’d like tohave a stick of candy.” That is a goal, a real goal.Preclears will modify their goals in some way or another: “Of course, I can’t because Ihave to work and I don’t have any money,” and “yak, yak, yak.” They are modified goals, andas long as they modify them they don’t have a goal because they are making a postulate and theMEST universe is kicking the postulate in on them. So we do this on a gradient scale of time sothat goals become real to them.  L. RON HUBBARD"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"P.A.B. No. 34PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR’S BULLETINFrom L. RON HUBBARDVia Hubbard Communications Office163 Holland Park Avenue, London W.11_____________________________________________________________________4 September 1954With this issue of the Professional Auditor’s Bulletin begins a new series by L. RonHubbard entitled A BASIC COURSE IN SCIENTOLOGY. The bulletins in thisseries are planned to cover the period of at least one year. This Basic Courseconsists of numerous articles by Ron on the theory and techniques of present dayScientology. The experienced professional auditor will find this an excellent sourceof review; the newcomer will have available a wealth of new data in easily used andhighly understandable form.OPENING PROCEDURE, SOP-8-CA Basic Course in Scientology—Part 1Because many people write to me requesting information on how to run a particulartechnique, and because the greater portion of such inquiries are on how to get a case running,this process is here outlined for your use as the first part of the Basic Course. Having once runthis Opening Procedure, SOP-8-C on a so-called “tough case,” you will not require any furtherreassurance or sales talk about it. And having it run thoroughly on yourself by an auditorskilled in its use will adequately demonstrate its workability.IMPORTANT: IN PROCESSING PSYCHOTICS AND NEUROTICS OFWHATEVER DEGREE OR THOSE HAVING PSYCHOSOMATIC AILMENTS OF ANYTYPE, USE ONLY OPENING PROCEDURE, 8-C, EACH PART, UNTIL THE PERSONIS SURE WHO IS DOING IT. USE ONLY OPENING PROCEDURE, SOP-8-C UNTILTHE CASE IS FULLY SANE. USE NO OTHER PROCESS OF ANY KIND.The entire modus operandi of Opening Procedure 8-C consists in having the preclearmove his body around the room under the auditor’s direction until (a) he finds he is in actualcommunication with many spots on the surface of things in the room, (b) until he can selectspots in the room and know that he is selecting them and can communicate with them, and (c)select spots and move to them, decide when to touch them and when to let go. Each one ofthese steps is done until the auditor is well assured that the preclear has no communication lag.The auditing commands for part (a) are as follows: “Do you see that chair?” “Goover to it and put your hand on it.” “Now look at that lamp.” “Now walk overto it and put your hand on it.” This is done with various objects, without specificallydesignating spots of a more precise nature than an object, until the preclear is very certain thathe is in good communication with these objects and walls and other parts of the room.The above is run until the following manifestations of communication lag (and any othersyou may encounter) are well erased: the preclear just brushing the object he is told to touch,looking away from it very quickly, not looking at it at all, looking at the auditor instead of theobject he was told to touch, carrying out the command before it is given such as going over totouch the lamp when all the auditor has said is “Do you see that lamp?”, complaining"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"about the process in any way, objecting to being ordered to do the actions, unwillingness totouch the items designated, putting all his attention on creating an effect on the auditor, andapathy, grief, anger, fear and boredom turned on by this process.When the above has been accomplished the auditor can say anything he pleases, orseemingly introduce any significance he wishes to so long as he hews very closely to the actualthing in this method which makes it work—which is to say perceiving the physical universeand making contact with it. At this time the auditor can become very specific about the selectionof spots for the preclear to touch. “Do you see that black mark on the left arm of thatchair?” “Go over and touch it with your right index finger.” “Now take yourfinger off it.” “Do you see the lower bolt on the light switch plate?” “Now goover to it and touch it with your left ring finger.” “Now take your finger offit,” and so forth until the preclear has a uniform perception of any and all objects in the roomincluding the walls, the floor and the ceiling. This step can be kept up for a long time. It has aninfinity of variations. But it is not the variations which work, it is the making and breaking ofcommunication with the actual designated spots. You can do the following at this point: makecertain the preclear is doing the process by asking questions such as, “Are you touchingthe door knob?” “Where is the door knob?” “What is its shape?” “What is itscolor?” “What sort of texture does it have?” “Are you sure you are touchingit?” “Can you feel it?” “Look at it.” “Who is touching it?” “Whose hand is onthat door knob?” “Who is holding your hand there?” “Where is that doorknob?” “When is it there?” You can badger the preclear in the above fashion until hisactions show that he is in communication with the object and until he is not angered by yourquestioning and direction.IF AT ANY TIME THERE IS ANY DOUBT ABOUT THE PRECLEAR’S CASE DOTHIS STEP [PART (a)] UNTIL SATISFIED THAT COMMUNICATION IS GOOD. ACASE WHICH WILL NOT OBEY 8-C (a) ORDERS WILL ALWAYS PERVERT OR ALTERCOMMANDS TO BE PERFORMED WITH LESS SUPERVISION THAN PERCEPTIONOF HIS BODY.Part (b) has these auditing commands: “Find a spot in this room.” No furtherdesignation is necessary for this spot. Spotting procedure gives the preclear determinism ofselection. When the preclear has done this the auditor says, “Go over to it and put yourfinger on it.” When the preclear has done this the auditor says, “Now let go of it.” Itmust be emphasized that the preclear is not to act upon a command until the command is givenand must not let go until told to let go. The preclear is permitted to select spots until such timeas all communication lag is flat and until he is freely selecting spots on the walls, objects,chairs, etc., with no specialization whatsoever— which means that his perception of the roomhas become uniform. Many things turn up in running this procedure such as the fact that thepreclear cannot look at walls, etc.Part (c) of this procedure is run with these auditing commands: “Find a spot in theroom.” “Make up your mind when you are going to touch it and then touch it.”“Make up your mind when you are going to let go of it, and let go.” A variationof this process is to have the preclear make up his mind about a spot and then have him changehis mind and select another spot.The trouble with most cases, and the trouble with any case which is hung up and is notprogressing, is that an insufficient quantity of Opening Procedure 8-C has been used by theauditor. This has been found to be an invariable rule. Preclears will pretend to run commandsof a subjective nature but not run them at all. In other words, the auditor is saying do one thingand the preclear is doing quite another. Thus the process is not actually being used on thepreclear. The difficulty in this case is a specific difficulty in communication where the preclearcannot duplicate. But more important than that, any preclear whose case is hanging up is out oftouch with reality and the environment to such an extent that he has begun to do processes onmock-ups rather than on the actual physical universe. It will be discovered that doing processeson mock-ups such as finding spots in them, finding distances to them, and so forth is"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"productive of no gain, and even negative gain.

The onlycaution on the part of the auditor is that he must be very precise about giving his orders andmust insist on the preclear being very certain that he is actually seeing spots and touching themand inhibiting the preclear from executing the commands before they are given.

It is first and foremostamongst the key buttons of Scientology. Thoroughly clearing Help alone, and on back trackterminals, has made clears. In an essay published on the otherwise unpublished Students’ Manual, I stressed the factthat unless the preclear and the auditor had Help straightened out they were not not likely tomake very much progress. Help is the key button which admits auditing. The remainingbuttons of Control, Communication and Interest, give us a session. But ill we cannot even startpresessioning with any other button than Help.Since the winter of 1957/58 when this was used in an American ACC I have beenworking with this trying to get a better understanding of it for you.It now appears that Help is the make-break point between sanity and insanity. That aperson cannot accept help along some minor line does not mean that he is insane, but itcertainly means he has some neurotic traits.The inference level of this condition of aberration on the subject of Help would be a fearof dependency. This means that Help has already gone wrong with the person. We see inchildren occasionally an enormous striving to be self-reliant. We ordinarily applaud this but ifwe inspect the child carefully we will find that resistance to being helped goes along with anobsession to help. Parents themselves, disbelieving that the child can help them, usually inhibitthe child’s help and thus worsen the condition. I have seen one child go downhill to “normal”by reason of a thwarting of help by the parents. But no matter how fondly the psychologistused to believe in the nineteenth century that childhood was a good pattern to use for estimatingfuture social conduct, we in Scientology know that the child has already become aberrated onthe subject before it is manifested in this light.My examinations have now led me to the conclusion that a person has a make-break pointof sanity on any given subject. This point is help. On the tone scale it would compare at 2.0 forany dynamic. The whole index of a personality could be adjudicated by an examination of theperson’s reactions to various types of help. Above this point a person can help, and can behelped, providing, of course, the help is sincere, and really is help. Below this point helpbecomes betrayal.Help is always betrayal to a thoroughly aberrated person. This explains a great deal to uswhen we understand it. The first example that comes readily to notice is the reaction of a verylow scale pc undergoing auditing. He invariably thinks, and may even sometimes tell theauditor, that the auditor has not helped him but betrayed him.All auditing protests except those against flagrant breaches of code denote a breakdown ofthe help button in the auditing session. While it does no good to run Help on a preclear andcontinue while running it to repeat flagrant code breaks, it does do a great deal of good toclarify the whole subject of help if a session seems to be full of ARC breaks, no matter whatthe auditor tries to do to patch them up."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"It is unfortunately true that help can be as wrong with the auditor as it can be with thepreclear where we have uncleared people doing auditing. However, it has been my experiencethat even while some of their efforts were completely knuckleheaded, practically no auditorsexist who are not sincerely trying to help the preclear. The trouble comes about when thepreclear clips the effort of the auditor into the category of betrayal. This makes the auditor reactagainst the preclear, and the situation deteriorates.We have, in the immediate past of this civilization, the deterioration of several of thepractices which began as a sincere effort to help and which are not now classifiable as anythingbetter than betrayal. Psychiatry and medicine are both good examples of this. The person whogoes to a psychiatrist usually finds himself betrayed. He does not receive help, he receivesbrutality in the form of electric shocks, brain surgery and other degrading experiences. Even inthe highest form of psychiatry it was common advice for the psychiatrist to tell the wife that thebest cure for her troubles was to betray her husband, and vice versa.The psychiatrist was caught in this help-betrayal deterioration. Psychiatry had so longattempted to help the insane without success that at last they began to Q and A with theirpatients. Of course, to an insane patient help is always betrayal. Medicine is now going asimilar course unwittingly, and has lost most of its public repute through not having stayed ona research line that would bring medicine upscale, but continued with a line of applicationwhich considered man a body and would not consider him anything else. Considering a personto be a “hunk of meat” is a sort of a betrayal in itself. Naturally one betrays a thetan when heregards the thetan as a piece of meat.World War Two pretty well saw the end of the last dregs of sincere help in psychiatry,most governments involved in the war employed psychiatry, it now turns out, for politicalpurposes. They were set a very good example by one, Hitler. Thus the last embers of sincerehelp in psychiatry were more or less extinguished. Nothing like this would happen inScientology because we are dealing with basic truths rather than basic ambitions. Whereambition becomes greater than truth any sphere of activity goes to pieces. Indeed, in the finalanalysis that is the fundamental deterioration of the track.Another excellent example is found in the Mau-Mau uprising in Kenya. The terroristskilled only twenty whites as compared to thousands of natives, but the whites they chose to killwere only those who had sought to help them. The Kikuyu was evidently completely certainthat anyone seeking to help him was only betraying him. Their reaction, then, in killing theirbest friends becomes more understandable. The action remains insane, but in their frame ofreference it was entirely comprehensible. Any time we go about the task of handling largebodies of insane people or illiterate and fearful native populaces, we would do well to keep inmind the importance of this help button, realizing that to these help is totally betrayal. The thingto betray is this help-betrayal identification, not the people.If you sort this out and find your own examples and see whether or not it holds true foryou, I think you have a small gasp of relief coming to you. No Scientologist has been without apreclear who has not become absolutely certain somewhere in the course of auditing that theentire goal of the auditor was to betray. This left one hanging with an unsolved riddle. Our ownsincerity was beyond question. How to be misinterpreted this wildly was so incomprehensiblethat we often assigned the reasons to ourselves. Perhaps some of these reasons did lie withourselves. Nevertheless, in the final analysis the only thing we did wrong was not to clear theHelp button with the preclear.CLEARING HELPThere are many ways to clear the Help button. As this is the first step on presessioning, itmay be that the button has to be cleared several times in the course of auditing.The first thing to do is to put the preclear on a meter. If you don’t have a good meter, andyou don’t know what a meter does, order one fast and get instruction. Discuss help with the"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"preclear, and note the needle reactions. If the needle tended to stiffen and stick on anydiscussion of help, then you have your work set out for you. If the needle remains free andcontinues to be free on the subject of help, no matter what you run or how you discuss it, ofcourse the button remains free.It is important that any attack you make upon this button be continued as a presessionactivity for auditing period after auditing period, if necessary, until the meter needle is free onthis subject. There is no need to go on, in fact there is no point in going on, if the preclearthinks that you are going to betray. Somewhere this will manifest itself as ARC breaks, thewhole auditing programme will go to pieces, and you will wind up without a preclear, as wellas an unfinished cycle of action. So pay attention to what I tell you here, where auditing isconcerned: work with help and nothing but help until the needle is free on the subject.What processes should you run? The first process, of course, is ordinary two-waycomm. One discusses the preclear helping others and others helping the preclear. One gets thepreclear’s views on the subject of help, and without evaluating for the preclear, lets the preclearexpress these views.The next process is Help on a two-way bracket. This is, “How could you help me?”,alternated with “How could I help you?” Do not expect this to do very much to the tone arm,because it won’t. A two-way flow of this character is not a reliable way to bring a tone armdown. But it does do something, and does tend to free up the needle on this particular subject.The old five-way bracket on help can then be employed: “How could you help anotherperson?” “How could another person help another person?” “How could another person helpyou?” “How could you help me?” “How could I help you?”This is a rough bracket but it is useful and should not be dropped out of the repertoire.Is there any process which would clear up the help button thoroughly and totally?Naturally, since it moved forward again into such importance, I have been doing work onit and have developed up to a stage of conditional application (which means, I leave myself freeto change my mind when broad experience has been gained) a new way of loosening up anysolution. I have been applying this to the central buttons in Scientology and have found itworking. The general formula is to take the button one wants to clear and ask the pc whatproblem a certain solution could be to him.Applying this to help, one would repetitively ask the pc, “What problem could help be toyou?”I first used this on the button responsibility with very good results, since I found thatresponsibility is very aberrated in its reactive definitions and, because one is often being avalence, is run irresponsibly. This version of running responsibility to a flat point seems to bequite workable.If the preclear is inventing answers rather than picking them up off the track, you mightdo better to ask him the following version, “What problem has help been to you?” If inventionwas present one always has the remedy, in spite of the fact that no terminal is apparentlypresent, of running, “What help could you confront?” “What help would you rather notconfront?” I don’t know how far this would go as I have not tested it over a long period, but atleast in its first stages it works. Responsibility, oddly enough, can be run on a no-massterminal or significance. I have not had much chance to test out confront, but on the theory thatanything you could run responsibility on you could also run confront on, I would say at firstglance this is probably a workable process. I will know more about it soon and I wouldappreciate your telling me anything you have on it.You have, therefore, several processes by which help can be flattened. Unfortunately,"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"none of these processes reach an unconscious or insane person. Of course, when I sayunconscious, I mean somebody with his eyes shut, and when I say insane, I mean somebodywho is institutionalized, and should be. In the matter of the unconscious person, you have theCCHs and you also have them with the insane person to some extent. However, the best thingfor an insane person is not processing, but rest, and when the person has had considerable rest,still processing is not yet the answer, exercise is. And when the person has had some exerciseover a long period of time, you will find that group processing with other insane persons is stillbetter than individual auditing. Only at this time is it possible to do very much for the insane.The first reason, of course, that one takes this approach is the auditor. Why attack largenumbers of insane cases with individual auditing when other methods are far more economicaland efficacious, so long as those other methods are only rest, exercise, group processing,hobby work, and such. Efforts to reach the insane with help, of course, simply restimulate theinsane idea that help is betrayal. This is why psychiatry resorted to such savage and bestial“treatments” as shock and surgery. They were up against people who apparently would not behelped. Thus psychiatry went into total effect. This is why psychiatry failed, and is in a failedstate today and has lost all of its public repute.People have been betrayed so often on the whole track that it is no wonder they get helpmixed up with betrayal, but help became betrayal only at those periods of the track where thedwindling spiral had been reached for any civilization. Even the upstanding Roman by the thirdcentury A.D. was happily using the political mechanism of inviting all the Germanic chiefs, thatwould accept, to feasts and then poisoning them, after vast assurances that Rome was about tohelp the chief’s country. A deterioration of help can occur on any dynamic and in any area, but,as I said above, it occurs at the make-break point of sanity-insanity.One word on all this. The preclear may be sane analytically and still react violently attimes in session. Remember that he is reacting in session because he has been thrown into thearea of his reactive mind. In reactive zones and areas help is almost always betrayal. Thuswhen running a rough engram do not be amazed to find the pc (whom you have carefullycleared on the subject of help) getting rabid about betrayal. He is in the middle of an engramand, of course, the hard core of any engram is betrayal. Don’t break off and start running helpon him, just run him on through the engram. He will come out of it all right, if you do yourjob. Help should be handled as a presession process and should be handled well andthoroughly and if in any series of sessions the preclear’s idea of help apparently deterioriates,you have gotten him into a series of incidents where help is betrayal and he should be clearedonce more as a presession activity in some later session on the subject of help.There are many possible processes, there are many possible approaches. As aScientologist, understanding this, you should not permit yourself too far into the frame of mindof believing a pc is evil or cannot be helped, simply because he apparently will not be helped.All pcs can be helped. Most pcs have aberrated ideas on the subject. It’s up to you to take holdof these as a first order of business and clean them up, at least until the meter needle is free onthe subject, no matter how many hours that takes.L.

It can be distracting when the pc hits anautomaticity on who or what. However even the alternate version will win.This flattens PTPs and ARC breaks, so on a very low case whose havingness is down,the rudiments may be omitted the first few sessions.Failed Help may also be run on a terminal. If the pc is always having PTPs with a certaintype of terminal (woman, man, etc) then failed help can be run in a specific or general fashion.How have you failed to help your wife? This is run repetitively. Or: How could you fail to helpa woman?A lower dichotomy could be run in this fashion. How could you prevent help? Howcould you fail to help? This last pair are experimental. They would be run alternately.While running failed help one should attempt every now and then to find the pc’shavingness process.If the pc’s havingness process cannot be found even with overts off, run failed help asabove, but continue to search for the havingness process at least once a session. If failed help isrunning very well indeed do not chop into it to search for the havingness process. Do thattoward the end of the session.A quarter of a division of the Tone Arm in three hours auditing is a good shift for a lowcase on failed help. Do not expect big changes at first.As any failed help run is good, it’s all right to make an error and use it on cases that couldhave better gains on something else. Cases that don’t need it move the least on the Tone Armwith it.No one has yet run 75 hours of failed help on a previous CCH case. So I cannot tell youhow much it will take or how far it will go. But I would be prepared to run 75 hours of it of theWho—What version on a case before it could run a havingness process.This is a marvellous process. I thoroughly recommend it. Just be careful not to lay inARC breaks and try to keep the case coaxed along and I think you’ll make it with some versionof failed help on cases we found hard to start before.LRH:js.cden L.

This consists of running failed help as the confrontprocess and O/W on specific present time terminals as the havingness process.Failed Help is almost the lowest rung of help processes. It is run with the commands“Who have you failed to help?” “What have you failed to help?” alternated. There’s a lowerhelp process than this. That is “Who have you intended not to help?” “Who have you helped?”,but this is not Formula 13.Overt Withhold is a havingness process. This comes about since havingness isduplication and one will not care to duplicate what he has overts against. Therefore the sourceof low havingness is overts against people and mest. It might be commented that overts againstmest are more important than against people in the reduction of havingness, but this again is notFormula 13.The essence of running Formula 13 is running in model session form a little failed help,with O/W on a present time terminal. It is done in this fashion. One opens the session, evenuses Presession I if needed, does rudiments using O/W to clear PTPs and ARC breaks, andthen does about ten minutes on failed help. Then he makes an assessment from a prepared listof people the pc knows in PT, and assesses for a needle fall on one of these. Then O/W is runon that specific person until the fall vanishes regardless of TA position, and returns to failedhelp for ten minutes or so, then reassesses for a PT terminal from his list until he finds one thatfalls, and flattens O/W on this, and then runs failed help and so on.It will be found that this is the best case undercutter for general use I have so fardeveloped. It is generally recommended and urged for all HGCs.Formula 13 is followed by finding the havingness process then the confront process, andthen Regimen Three is used, assessing for a general terminal and with the havingness andconfront process running alternate help on the general terminal.

This problem is the primary caseproblem. Presession 37 resolves it. This presession is now the proper way to run “Whatquestion shouldn’t I ask you?”The auditor runs “What question shouldn’t I ask you?” for a few times.Then the auditor runs “Think of something you’ve done.” “Think of something you havewithheld.” Alternated for a short time (maximum five minutes).Then the auditor runs “What question. . .” a few more times.If the pc develops an evasion system such as “You shouldn’t ask me if I have murderedanybody,” the auditor asks it.

They have more trouble with creating than thinking andconcepts are more in kind with confronting than with creating. Making a pc invent answers is,of course, right on his worst button. Therefore Concept Help goes a long ways on a case. It isquite unlimited, no matter what form is run, so long as some attention is paid to flow direction.(A flow run too long in one direction gives anaten—unconsciousness, remember?)ALTERNATE CONFRONTConcept Help, however, has the liability of making things “muggy” at times because ofits indefiniteness.Aside from create, the primary button that is awry (but which cannot be directly attackedwithout often overshooting the case or involving it in heavy bank reaction), the next thingsmechanically wrong with a pc would be unconsciousness and confusion. Help, of course, isthe primary point of association and identification and is WHY things go wrong with a pc. Buta scale of WHAT is right with a pc in descending order of importance would be, as above: Creativeness Consciousness"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" Order Controland these would be flanked by the things wrong with these items which make them decline:Create—IrresponsibilityConsciousness—Refusal to confrontOrder—Unwillingness to bring orderControl—Lack of control.Help fits in somewhat on this order. One creates to help (and fails). One goesunconscious to help or makes another unconscious to help him/her (and fails). One seesdifficulty for others in too much order, seeing that two systems of order clash, and lets downhis to help.One conceives that control is bad and ceases to control and resists control to help others.These are all wrong helps, apparently, and when done, bring about aberration.Aberration consists, evidently, of wrong-way assistance as follows:Optimum Condition -----> Response -----> Resulting ConditionCreativeness -----> Irresponsibility -----> Disowned CreationsConsciousness -----> Non-Confront -----> UnconsciousnessOrderliness -----> Unwilling conflict -----> ConfusionAbility to Control -----> Consequence of control -----> Mis-control.Confront is a remedy for the consequences of the first three conditions and alsocommunication. An auditing session itself by its TR mechanics, improves control andcommunication. Therefore Confront in one form or another is needed in routine sessions.Havingness is an objective and somewhat obscure method of confronting and using it aswe do objectively, it is a specialized form of confronting, possibly its best form, objective orsubjective, even though a series of subjective havingness in Washington in 1955 tended toshow that profile gains were not made by subjective confront, a conclusion still subject tofurther checking.Confront straightens out any “mugginess” churned up by Concept Help. No vast tonearm improvements should be expected from Alternate Confront, but even if it doesn’t workwell, like havingness, as a primary process, it has very good uses. Alternate Confront gives usa stabilizing tool. Pc feels weird = run Alternate Confront. He’ll feel saner. Following thissubjective process with the best objective process, havingness, we achieve stability for thegains reached by a help process.As a comment, beingness is more involved with havingness than with confront.Confront, on short test, can be run lop-sided, and does disturb the tone arm. “Whatwould you rather not confront?” run all by itself in one pc (a BMA type test series!) did verywell. “What can you confront?” of course did very well. Alternate Confront has enough wrongwith it to be poor as a process for getting gains but wonderful as a process for stabilizing acase. I’ll run some more tests on Negative Confront and let you know. But it is a fluke. Bytheory it is improbable as it is a cousin to the no-good “What could you go out ofcommunication with?” But “What could you withhold?” is the greatest IQ raiser known! And itworks. So perhaps Negative Confront, “What would you rather not confront?”, will work too.Of course it’s a fundamental button.

But this is the middle ground, already half way to lazy thinking.Help, as assistance, is an identification of mutual interest in survival. Thus we have (1)possible confusion of beingness and (2) continuation. This makes help ripe for trouble. Whenone fails to help he keeps on helping! No matter how. He does keep on helping what he hasfailed to help. One of many mechanisms is to keep the scene in mock-up.Help is a fundamental necessity, it appears, to every person. But it is dynamite when itgoes wrong.As a symptom of its continuance (survival factor—see Book ONE) pcs running helpreadily get the idea that help on some terminal “will never flatten” even though it is flatteningnicely!To handle this as a special item, one can run the confront part of a session with“Continuous Confront”, the Alternate form of which is:(a) “What could you continue to confront?”(b) “What would you rather not continue to confront?”The positive form (a) can be run alone for case gain. And I am going to test the negativeform (b) as a single run to see if it can be “gotten away with”. In theory, as all anaten isunwillingness to confront and as all help is continuous survival, form (b), NegativeContinuous Confront, should do marvels for IQ and may become the proper companion forhelp processes if the session is ended with havingness.At the present moment auditing routine is: Pre-session Model Session Help Processes Alternate Confront Havingnessall in every session.

The first clears made easily by others were done with meter assessmentsand five-way help brackets on terminals.It was found that Step 6, being a creative process, was bad on some cases. The clearingformula was help and Step 6. We tended to abandon both when Step 6 became an overt. Itblew us off.The next big technical development was O/W. Overt-withhold, of course, is as old as1954 (Phoenix) when reach-withdraw was introduced. But the full knowledge of what overt-withhold meant to cases was not released until November, 1959. Here came much newtechnical data, all of it vital to clearing. A person with large withholds from the auditor will notgo into session. This is true, valid and useful. We could not clear many people even nowwithout it. Further, we find all losses in Scientology personnel in Central Orgs and the fieldstem from O/W.In researching O/W, as early as December, 1958 (Washington, D.C.), it was found andproven conclusively that it was what the person himself did to others that was aberrative, notwhat was done to him. The test of this can be made easily. Given: an ARC break betweenauditor and pc who have known each other some time. Note the position of the meter tone arm.Run “What have you done to me?” “What have I done to you?” Observe that after some smallvariation the limited value of this two-way flow (which assumes the auditor’s bad action washalf what was wrong with the pc) shows up in a stuck tone arm. This two-way process is toolimited to alter the tone arm after a few minutes. A lie has been introduced. This lie sticks thetone arm. Now shift to “What have you done to me?” “What have you withheld from me?” Andwatch the tone arm free up and eventually go toward clear reading. In other words, the situationfreed wholly only when we assumed that only what the pc had done had any aberrative value.This and other vital material learned between 1957 autumn and now was the technologynecessary to do full clearing on everyone except the wholly psychotic and unconscious people(where we have the CCHs).Everything learned about O/W is still necessary to clearing. But everything that applied inO/W also applies to running help.It’s marvellous that a five-way bracket on help cleared people. It did clear some. Butwhere it failed it ran into the rule that it’s only what the pc does that is aberrative, what is doneto him is not. Thus, what help the pc has given and what help he has denied or failed to giveare aberrative. What help the pc received, in the long run is not (no matter how thepsychologists cut it).There are probably thousands of ways help could be run. You can think of dozens.

But the one general process on help that would rank high would be “What have youhelped?” “What have you not helped?” alternated.This is not a dichotomy. This is the best way I know of to run the sense of what help onehas given plus what help one has withheld. This is the O/W version and we will call it “HelpO/W” to keep ourselves oriented and not introduce too many new terms. I find “failure to help”instantly upsets “What help have you given?” “What help have you withheld?” This versiondoes not run. The correct sense wording is “What help have you given?” “What help have younot given?” This lets the pc as-is his failures to help as well as his denials of help.This is only the general form. Think how much more we know about O/W. Apply it tohelp.Two-way help would have use. But would be limited. Use it. Know it’s limited.Five-way bracket help would have use. But would be limited. Use it. Know it’s limited.This pair has enough power to gain more constant attendance in a PE Co-audit than wehave had. So use them in PE Co-audit. Two-way help has just moved a PE Co-audit case thathas been in co-audit for one year without moving on any other process.Two-way comm on help has value. It’s the presession version. No matter who is helpingwho, a discussion of it can get the pc closer to session.Now here is data you’ve been wondering about. Does help in presession become an endall in the HGC. No. Hit the presession points lightly, then in Model Session form use help asthe process to be run. And run it until it’s flat-flat-flat.When the Model Session has begun, run a meter assessment. Find any terminal thatdrops. On that terminal, in specific or general form, “How have you helped ....?” “How haveyou not helped ....?”Any experience you’ve had with O/W and meters and assessments, apply it to help.And that’s how you’re going to clear people.

Then sort it out,attempting to get parts of it to clear up. Do not let pc linger on matters which do not stick.Responsibility sorts the matter out. His realization (cognition) of various zones is whatdoes him good.This is not necessarily a repetitive command.

Everything which has been given to you thus far is near themark, and pre-sessioning, model session and flattening help are right on the mark. Howeverthere are certain things that make auditors unhappy with running help. Chief amongst these isthe fact that it is a tremendously restimulative process when one has not had any run. Thismeans that we had better get the staff theta clearing course or staff co-auditing going fast on asupervised basis.The second thing is that help does not flatten very easily on a late specific terminal. Ofcourse, this is true of all processes. But help is a peculiar process and is slower on lateterminals than other buttons, and here is why.Help resolves cases because it is the basis of all association, and as you know associationleads to identification. And identification is the basis of all mental upsets. The action of help isnot aberrative. The failure to help is what does it, or the lack of things to help. However allvalences and all identification stem from this button and no other. Now do lights dawn andbells ring? Help is the button which, if run, settles all difficulties with association andidentification and all problems of beingness.Thus there is something peculiar about help which is not true of any other button. Anyhelp run is a gain even (Gawdelpus) if it is left wholly bogged with a half hour comm lag. Allbits of help run are chewing away at all tangles of identification. So chew away and to theDickens with it. Any help run is better than no help run. And because the PC is a bundle ofaberrated identifications, any help run untangles some of him. And any help run on anyterminal tends to “get at” any other terminal.So that’s why help run in any old way will sooner or later make the grade. But this is noreason to believe there are not also smart ways to run help.Any late specific terminal, being so confounded far from basic-basic on the time track,runs tough and endlessly. Therefore as always it is better to run general terminals than to runspecific terminals. However in the case of a PTP you can go ahead if you have to and run helpon the PTP personnel, but as soon as the edge is off the PTP for Heaven’s sakes shift to thegeneral form of the specific terminals you have been running, and flatten those a lot or a little.Keep a very close record of what you have run on help as the only precaution you have totake, and when the PC is running toward mest clear check back with help on these terminalsand make sure they are flat. When a lot of help has been run on basic material then of courseyou will find that what ran very arduously before will now run much better. It is almost a wasteof time to run specific terminals, but still you must run things that are real to the PC, and if onlyyesterday was real to him then you are stuck with running the PC on later terminals or evenspecific terminals.A much faster way to run help than by sorting out real terminals on an E-Meter (which isstill necessary sometimes) is to do an assessment on the PC using help and the dynamics, andfinding a button that is entirely off dynamic and that the PC can’t imagine helping. This is atrigger to a case. Unusual results happen very fast.Another way to go about this is a simple questioning of the PC on the subject of his"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"dislikes. Watch the meter and when you get a silly reaction on a dislike, like a rock slam or aheavy drop or a sudden theta bop, then pick this out, make a general form out of it that registerslike the first mention, and run that on the PC. This is a rather loose and sometimes misleadingassessment. But remember that all help run leads to untangling all buttons and so it is aperfectly good approach, and as the PC gets run on something he is awful darn sure he oughtto be run on he is often very happy and co-operative in this. Whereas on a dynamic assessmenthe is made intensely curious as he didn’t know he was aberrated on what you found out. Inother words just asking the PC what is wrong with him, getting it into a general form thatregisters on the meter and running Help O/W or concept help on it, is good reasonably fastprocessing. It is better than assessing for just a terminal that drops or for a specific late terminalthat drops.As a comment it should be noted that help is the last thing that folds up in the dwindlingspiral of aberration. About the first thing that folds up is interest. But when it is gone there arestill three buttons left on which the person can function. The next one to go is communication.This becomes a contest of overts as in the ARC breaky case. Anybody below this lives his orher life this way. The next one to vanish is control. So don’t be surprised to find somebodyaround who does plenty of overts and who can’t stand control who can yet be run on help andwho can still function in life. When interest, communication, control and help are gone, that’sit. You haven’t got a person left. So beware people who are below help. Beware of them inliving. But in auditing when you can’t get HELP to bite at all (and if he can talk to you you canget help to bite) you have nothing left but the CCHs. You can make it on them too but withtremendous investment in hours. And when you’ve got the CCHs flat then you can startrunning help.But as I said above I have not yet been able to say the PERFECT way of running help. Iam still investigating it like mad and am giving you all the gen as it comes visible. Howeverhave patience with me. I have learned that people not only have it twisted a bit, they’ve got itshattered, and that’s the majority of people. So we’re in there slugging away and we’re makingclears, and if I get hold of any faster ways to do you’ll be the first to get the gen.LRH:js.cdenL. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1960by L.

Byalways using the same words to open, continue and close a session, to begin and end processes, aduplication of sessions is achieved which as they continue, runs them out. The patter wording of aModel Session should be learned by heart and not changed. The commands of regimens ofprocesses used in Model Sessions may change. But not the patter. It is this patter which makes aModel Session a Model Session, not the commands run in it.ASSESSMENTNo assessment is used in Regimen Two. The E-Meter is employed to determine the advanceand stage of case. Advance is determined by change of tone arm position and loosening ortightening of needle, per unit time of processing, the sensitivity knob always being set the same,session after session. The stage of case is judged by the rapidity of the repetitive loosening andtightening of needle action and the width and rapidity of change of the tone arm.CLEAR INDICATIONWhen a case has at last a steady tone arm near clear reading for the sex of the pc and whenthe needle is loose and does not respond to elementary presession questions, the person is MestClear.

This is the what?Audience: 21st of April.21st of April.All right. Well, you’re going to get a very complex, offbeat lecture here today—very complex,very offbeat. Nothing simple today. Tired of talking about simplicities, you just never seem tolatch on. Talk to you about a complexity here, and see if we can’t do so.As you may know, not contained in the body of Scientology but standing aloof, there are aseries of research maxims, or data, which I have really never bothered to collect. You’ll findsome trace of them in, of all things, Dianetics: Evolution of a Science. It’s got quite a few ofthem in it. You know, the rationale and the how of how you figure it out. There’s a wholebook that was devoted to this—was “Excalibur,” is how you went about figuring it out. Andevery once in a while one of these things cracks through and you get a grip on the put-togetherof existence, and that sort of thing, which is extremely useful.These things vary. I’m not giving you a big mystery. These things vary all over the place; theygo from the sublime to the ridiculous. One of the maxims—I’ll give you an idea—is take abody of knowledge which has produced very bad effects and results, and if that’s the case,then you move it out and don’t pay any further attention to it. Take the one which is leastproductive of results and rule it out, and you can eventually corral truth on this type of anapproach.Let’s take all those things that haven’t worked and let’s throw them out, see? That’s this type ofdata, see? And this is of assistance on analyzing cases, you know, like mad. You do it all thetime. You say, “Well, this fellow has been run on this and he’s been run on that and he’s beenrun on something else. and nothing happened in those instances, so it must be something else.”See? Well, this can be done on a broad philosophic basis.But let’s take something of an unworkability and let’s throw it away. Now, that’s a researchdatum. Doesn’t sound like much, does it? But it has a broad workability. The reverse doesn’thappen to be true: Because something has worked on a case is no reason it will work on allcases. Isn’t that an interesting thing? That is to say, because something is true in one instance isno reason it’s true in all instances. You’ve got to have it applied in several instances anddirections before you have any confidence in it.That’s one that an auditor misses all the time. He gets a tremendous win. He’s got “Recallbeing drunk,” see? And he ran this on this old lady, and she got a tremendous “send” out ofthis whole thing, and it gave him a big win. And now he fails to apply this little researchdatum, this truth of the matter. You see, he’s only gotten a workability on one case here, seriesof one, and he has no real idea yet whether or not that is applicable more broadly. And yet outof the enthusiasm of his win, he goes ahead and runs “Recall being drunk” on this one and thatone and the other one, the village parson, and all of these sort of things, and he doesn’t get anymore wins with it. You see? So he feels very defeated.Well, what he’s done is fail to apply the other side of the thing: Just because it had a"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"workability in this instance is no reason it’s broadly workable, see? That’s the maxim that goesback of that. There are a lot of these, a lot of these. They’re sort of idiot’s-delight sort ofthings, and rules of thumb by which you progress.But once in a while one of them turns up that has tremendous value. And this may or may nothave some value to you. (This lecture, by the way, is about Levels.) This may or may not havesome value to you as a technical datum, but it certainly has tremendous value as a researchdatum, to such a degree that I was able to crack through some of the wildest web work that Ithink I have ever gotten mixed up in, with this.You see, you can get certain things to read on a meter. You get in the vicinity of “create”GPMs—let us just mention that in passing—and you can get, on Monday, this combination toread; on Tuesday, this other combination to read; on Wednesday, this other combination toread; and on Thursday you get an entirely new combination to read. By that time, you’re prettycaved in, so the only thing you can run on is whether or not you’ve got a creak. So you trythen to rule out the creak, and you go back over these things. And it just gets to be one of thewildest swamps that you ever got mixed up in, trying to pilot through the basic morass of theindividual, because you can get so many things that contradict so many things.Now, in view of the fact that a pretty well-off auditor, I doubt very much could pilot his waythrough a goals plot and still have a PC sitting across from him. PC would probably be dead bythe time he got the goals plot half finished and there wouldn’t be any point in finishing it. Thisis grim. This is real grim. I mean, you see the tiger here; he’s got teeth, see?You get everything checked out, and then it doesn’t check out tomorrow, see; it’s somethingdifferent. So I had to have a datum which would pilot through this, and I finally managed totailor-make a datum which piloted through this. And we get a maxim that doesn’t sound likevery much to begin with, but it’s very, very pervasive. And that is: A problem is as complex asit presents potential solutions. A problem is as complex as it presents potential solutions. Howmany wild ramifications has this problem got? Well, you want to know how many wildramifications it’s got; how many potential solutions has it got? And that gives you an immediateindex of how complex the problem is. That’s interesting, isn’t it?All right. Well, let’s say this perhaps has some workability—there’s some more to this whichI’ll just go into in a moment. But let’s dispose of this first one first. Let’s say this PC—thispossibly has use in the field of figuring out what’s wrong with a PC. So the PC comes in toyou, and he’s been to the chiropractors and he’s been to the doctors. And a last result, last,last, last result, why, he went and saw—something practically nobody who is decent woulddo—he went and saw a psychiatrist. And he went even further downscale and he saw amedico. And he’s taken up good-luck charms and so forth. Well, all of this kind of thing, don’tyou see, is—those are all potential solutions, aren’t they? Potential solutions.Now, medicine just gets rid of this fellow by saying he’s a hypochondriac. And I’ve run into alot of hypochondriacs, and they were sick. They were sick enough to be worried about. Iremember one famous case of a very dear lady, and her husband was practically ruined throughthis. He was quite a famous writer—and she always used to be worrying about her health. Andshe’d worry about her health and worry about her health, and all of his writing friends and allof their wives simply wrote her off as a hypochondriac. And he was dearly devoted to her anddoted on her, and probably only the [the only] reason he kept on writing was because sheencouraged him, you know, and she—so on. But nevertheless she was always worried abouther health. And everybody was very sure that she was a hypochondriac—labeled it as such,brushed it all off as such—right up to the moment when she up and died on them. It’s quiteinteresting.That was the end, by the way, of his career. He went down and went to work for thegovernment. He started writing Herbert Hoover’s “Reorganization of the Government,” orsomething like that, and he quit writing. And the clique that this girl more or less held togetherall broke up, and so forth. But it left everybody absolutely stunned, you know? She was sick."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"You know? Well, she was.Some people are sicker than others and some people talk about it more than others, you see?And a handy way of getting rid of it, you see, if you can’t solve it or do anything for ityourself, just say “Well, he’s a hypochondriac,” you know, and dust the whole problem off,you see? And in this case, this was all very handy, but the patient died, do you see? Kind of agrim look at the situation.You get awful tired of somebody who keeps nibbling around and worrying about this, that orthe other thing. And you get awful tired of this person and so forth. But the problem they’representing can be measured by the complexity of the solutions.So this hypochondriac who has tried everything under the sun—”hypochondriac”—he’sactually got a problem that’s that complex. Do you follow that? I mean, there’s that complicateda thing wrong with him, see? You got the way this works. This is another way of looking at it.All right, now this defeats forever the idea that you’re going to slip somebody Pill 62 and havean OT. Now, you see the error? This used to be introduced to me about once a week or once amonth. And we even have a cliché that comes forward from that time. It’s called a one-shotClear, see? It means a one-process Clear or something like that, see? And for years, why, Iwas interested in this particular line and everybody was always dreaming up with this. Abeautiful dream: all you did was sock somebody in the gluteus maximus with a couple of cc’sof “whizzo,” or something, you see, and they immediately went bing!Won’t ever happen. Why? If this datum is true, it never can happen. In other words, theproblem they’ve got is complex as the number of solutions that are pushed in its particulardirection, or have gone around its edges, you see?The problem of government, then, must be terribly complex, because you think of the numberof solutions. Look at the number of political solutions there have been to the problem ofgovernment. Well, that gives you an immediate index of how complicated is this problem ofgovernment. How complex a problem is it? Well, it must be terribly complex, don’t you see?Now, this thing which has just one little old “whizzo” solution, don’t you see, and itsurrenders to that, that must have been a very simple problem. In other words, there’s acomparable line between the complexity of the problem and the number of solutions. See, itisn’t the complexity of the solution, it’s the number of solutions. Solutions, quantitative, andcomplexity in the problem. I want you to differentiate that rather cleanly, see? It’s not “bigsolution, big problem,” see? It’s complex in the problem, and numerous in the solution, see?Something you should look at.So this tells you at once that when a PC comes in there and sits down in the chair, and youhave to start running up the solutions to his case, you see, and it isn’t surrendering easily—youalways blame yourself on the basis you haven’t used the right process or something of the sort,whereas you merely may be looking at this mechanism. This is a terribly complex case. It’s avery complex case and therefore is going to require numerous solutions. Do you see?So you’re just defeating yourself. You say you’re going to run one process that’s going toresolve this particular guy’s problem in life. See, you’re defeating yourself, because you’regoing to run that one process, and that’s not going to defeat his problem in life. Just make upyour mind that if his problem in life has received many solutions, then it is itself a complexproblem and will therefore require a complexity of processes to resolve it. See? Elementary.All right. And let’s go on from there. Now, a solution must be as complex as the potentials ofthe problem. There’s the other “whizzo” here. Now, we’ll look at it in reverse here. Howcomplex does a solution have to be? Well, it has to be as complex as the potentials of theproblem. In other words, here is, again, not a one-for-one. Here you have the solution being"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"complex, don’t you see? This is another view we’re looking at, another maxim: The solutionhas to be complex because of the potentials of the problem. You get the idea?Now, what do you mean, potentials? Well, let’s just take old “survive.” This problem has thispotential of knocking out of existence survival along various fronts or in various areas, yousee? It’s a threat. See, here’s a problem that is a big problem. So, the thing to solve that: youlook for a simplicity in the solution to solve this big threatening problem. And here’s a way youget defeated like that: This bird comes in and he’s got this dangerous problem. Now, we’retalking about a dangerous problem, see—potential of the problem, dangerous potential. Hecomes in and he’s got this very dangerous problem, you see? They’re going to throw him outon the street tomorrow—very dangerous; going to throw him out on the street tomorrow, andhe’s going to lose his job as a result, you see, and he’ll probably be sued in court forsomething or other.But he comes in and he tells you he’s going to be thrown out on the street tomorrow. All right,now you give him a simple solution. You say, “Well, I’ll loan you five pounds or five bucks,”you see, “and you can pay your rent.”Did you ever have it happen to you, that you found out that he all of a sudden told you then,“Well, yes, but then how does this take care of Maizie?”“Well, what about Maizie?”“Well, she’s pregnant.”You get it? So you’ve set up a defeat for yourself. He’s got a dangerous problem: You offerhim a simple solution. That’s an immediate way of setting up a defeat for yourself. You’regoing to be defeated in this. You can sit and talk to these fellows. Eventually you say they’recompletely ungrateful. You just sit there and you give them solution after solution aftersolution, and they can’t seem to buy any of them because they always say, well, there’s alwaysthis other thing, too, see, and then there’s this other thing, too, and then there’s also this otherthing, too. And then they finally shyly look at you and say, well, actually, the reason they can’tmarry the girl is because they’re already paying alimony to a wife elsewhere, you see? Younever knew this either. This all has to do with their being thrown out on the street tomorrow.See, this thing just travels miles. In other words, nothing ever really becomes a dangerousproblem which is very simple, or the guy would have solved it in the first place.Problems only become dangerous that are quite complex. They require, then, a complexsolution. “Well, what we have to do, I guess, is so forth, and we . . .” Your level ofsolution—this guy is going to be thrown out on the street tomorrow, and so forth. “Well, let’ssee, maybe I could get you a job with United Fruit, and we could change your name. Take alittle doing; we have to get you a forged passport. And then, let’s see, I happen to know Joe—that will require that. And you better—in order to get financed for this, you better rob a banktomorrow,” and so forth.I mean, you get the idea, this thing is going to mount up into this. If you were going to be realin your solution, to match the thing, see, well, it’s got to be—this is a dangerous problem—ifyou’re going to be real in your solution, why, give them a real complex solution, see? It’s gotto take care of all these ramifications this way and that, and it’s a put-together the like of which. . . Because in order to become a dangerous problem, the thing had to coast practically into anunsolvable condition, and therefore it must contain many “unsolvable” points.It’s quite amusing to look at advising human beings from the basis of these maxims, see? Ifyou recognize those two maxims, you’d always be a whiz. This girl comes in and she says,“Well, I’m going to leave my husband. I’m going to have to leave my husband, because . . . soforth—things have gotten too tough.”For you to say at once, like a marriage counselor, “Oh, well, no, I think we could just patch all"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"this up”—you better watch it, man, because this is a complex solution required here, becausethat’s a dangerous problem. Well, she’s got two kids. She has no means of support. She’sgoing to leave the guy. She’s going to have no home. Well, let’s just look at this, look at whatshe’s threatening to do, here, see?It isn’t just a matter of blow, don’t you see? It’s a matter of she’s got this very, very dangerousproblem: she can’t stay with him and can’t go, don’t you see? But this thing is pretty grim, see?Not just grim in her own mind, it must be that grim. Then your solution to that must be verycomplex. So if you just say ‘Well, I’ll just run a little O/W on him and her and then straighten itall out,” you’re going to get yourself in for a lose, see? Because there’s a tremendous numberof things surrounding that problem.She’s not saying “Well, I’m mad at Joe and I’m not going to serve him any supper,” see?That’s not very dangerous. See, it could be a few pots and pans blow up—but this is going tobe a bust-up of some kind or another. This is big stuff.Well, a marriage counselor always gets it when it’s right on the edge of the precipice, don’t yousee? So you offer any simple solution, you know, to this, you’re being a fool, and you’regoing to have a big lose. It necessarily requires a very complex solution—nice, complicatedsolution. So the thing you had better sit down and do is not give her a little “bing,” you know,and say “I’m going to do that.” Sit down and find out all the items that have to be solved in thisproblem.Now, that would be your real action. How many angles to this are there? See, not just a glib“Oh, well, I’ll just run a little O/W on it; you can go home,” and so on. No, no. There’sGertrude, his former wife, who is in Tallahassee, and then there’s the matter of his mother andfather, and so forth, and they’re bringing pressure on her mother-in-law, because, you see,they own the mortgage on the house. You get the idea?This thing builds up, and you’ll just be stonied to find out how many dead ends, see, that thereare in this thing. It’s big! See? It’s not little. So if there’s a big problem, dangerous problemand so forth, then you can just count on the fact that this thing has a tremendous number oflittle things begging to be solved, out here in the woods, that you’re not aware of at all. And weget that just out of this maxim here: A solution must be as complex as the potentials of theproblem.You can get yourself a big win on this sort of thing, you know? This person comes in: Oh,God, they’re going to blow their brains out, see? Well, man, that’s a pretty wild solution. It’sall right for you to say “All right, he’s in GPM ‘destroy self.’ All right, that’s all. So we’ll justfix that up, and so on.” Maybe so, and maybe you would get to first base on it, except for this:The individual is not up to running at this level, and the individual has personal pressures in hisimmediate environment which would distract his attention to such a degree he probablycouldn’t sit still. And what are we dealing with here? We’re dealing at Level 0, aren’t we? Sohe’s going to come in and he’s going to blow his brains out. Good. He’s going to blow hisbrains out. Boy, that’s a dangerous solution, you know? People get hurt doing that! You didn’tget that gag! And you just better decide at that point, just better decide that this is begging for avery complex solution, very complex. This solution is going to be awful complex by the timeyou get through with this threatened suicide.My God, this goes back to World War II and the orphan asylum and the girl who is writingletters that unless . . . And it goes to this and it goes to that, and it’s something else, and it’sover here someplace.Well, why—why get all worn out by saying, “Well, there’s just one more.” See, you’re gettingin the same frame of mind he’s getting into. Just take your original assumption, which is thecorrect assumption to begin with, and then work with it.Well, it’s a very dangerous problem this guy is involved with. Well, let’s see how complex the"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"solution is here. Let’s just find out how many things have to be solved in this problem. Let’ssee, let’s roll them off here. All right. “Well, all right, let’s begin. You’re going to blow yourbrains out. Good. All right. Now, now—ahem. What’s the immediate and direct pressurethat’s causing you to do that?”He won’t give you the immediate and direct, but he’ll give you something or other. Well, he’sworried about his income tax. He keeps figuring it out and the government keeps unfiguring iton him, and so forth.And you say, “All right, very good.” Well, you say, “Well there’s got to be some solution toincome tax, is that it?” And you don’t offer a solution. There’s got to be a solution to incometax for him.“Oh, yeah. Yeah, but definitely has to be one.”“All right, fine. Now, let’s see, what’s the next one here? Is there anything”—take it bydynamics, you see? “Any group you’re connected with, or anything like that?” and so on.“Oh, well, yes. I haven’t paid my union dues, and they’re going to beat me up next week if Idon’t. I’ve already been posted for being thrown out, and of course that makes me lose myjob,” and that sort of thing.“Ah, well, there has to be some solution there too. How many—how many of these areproblems? Being beaten up? Is that all one problem, or is that several problems?”“Well, being beaten up. Well, that . . . that’s a problem, yeah, and uh . . . yeah, there’s two orthree problems involved there. And I’d have to go and get a job in some house that uh . . .doesn’t insist that it be union members, and so forth.”“And you been posted, and so forth, for your dues, and that requires money—that comesdown to there. All right, now, how many. . . how many solutions do you think we have tohave here?”And he adds it up, see? All right, that’s fine. You got that out of the road. “All right. Now,let’s see, is there any—there any sex mixed up with this? Any sex mixed up with thisthreatened suicide?”“Oh, well, yeah, that’s what it’s all about. That’s what it’s all about.”And, “All right. Well, how many things are there there?” and so forth.And there has to be this and there has to be that, and there has to be something or other.“Oh, all right. Fine. Now. Now, is there any other condition? You about to”—go up to thesixth dynamic, you see? “Are you going to lose your possessions, or you’re trying to hold onto possessions, or . . . ?”“Yeah. Well, I . . . three-quarters completed for the payments on all the furniture in the houseand they’re going to take it away.”“Ah, there has to be some solution to that, doesn’t there? All right. Solution to the payments,time payments, on the house.”By the time you finish up, you’ve got a big sheet of paper here, see? It’s just scribbled all over.But the funny part of it is, he won’t be blowing his brains out. You didn’t give him a singlesolution. You just said where they were needed. Takes him out of the confusion, of course,because it puts up the buffer “needed solution” in front of every one of these problems, don’tyou see?"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"And he’ll come down to it, then, and he’ll be able to think his way through to that, and thenyou can pull it off.“Well, let’s see, we could start these things one by one, couldn’t we? We could take thesethings one by . . . Which one of these things could be solved now?” See? And then run agradient scale on the thing. Straighten out his whole life.See, if you know this, you could handle Level 0 like a breeze. And Level 0 is the rough one tohandle, man. What makes it rough? Well, these guys’ problems are so great they don’t evenknow they got them. That’s how great that problem is. This fellow is walking around in abody! He thinks he’s an animal! He doesn’t even know he’s a spirit! He doesn’t even know hisright name! He doesn’t even know where he is or what he’s doing, and he doesn’t look at thefact of the importance’s in his vicinity at all. He’s looking at a bunch of cotton-pickin’ littlepieces of nonsense here that wouldn’t have anything to do with anything. See? Level 0. Thisguy’s in trouble!“But that’s the way it is. That’s life. Huh. Everybody else is like this, so I couldn’t possibly bein trouble, because everybody else is like this, see? I’m not in trouble. Blah-lah-ruh-ruh.”So, you see, his problem is so complex, he doesn’t even know he’s in trouble. No solutionspossible in any particular direction, and the man’s state is that way because no solutions havebeen possible in any state.All right. Now, any time you dream up a simple solution to a complex problem you’re going togo appetite over tin cup, square on your cranial capital. Simple solution to a complex problem.Nyaaaa. This is how guys go politically bug-eared, see? You got to have something complex,as complex as the problem.I want to point out to you that the International City—International City, and so forth: you startlooking at this confounded thing, it’s terribly complex. You start getting into complexities, yousee, my heavens! You’re into economics, and you’re here and you’re there, and banking, and,boy, this thing is complicated, see? Well, actually, if you just blow up each one of its simplementions into all the potential complexities, you’ve got the size of the problem it’s trying tosolve. And it might have a show.Now, let me show you the simple solution: “Vote Republican. We have a Democrat in, voteRepublican. Now, that solves everything, and that’s all you got to do, see?” And we haveanother four years with things just going worse, see? “All right, now the solution is to voteDemocrat. Get that Republican out and get the Democrat in. That is the solution to all ouraffairs!” See the idiocy of the simple solution? See? Complete idiocy.First place, you’d have to go find a statesman someplace. I don’t know where you’d find him;going to have to find him. Then you might set him up with a big team of guys that had someinkling of what they were doing, and they might figure out for a little while. And if theyworked for a year or two like beavers, they just might be able to cut the fringe off of theproblems that the country has. They just might be able to come into something.Now, all right. This is Levels. Do you recognize I’m talking to you about Levels? Now, as yougo on up through the Levels, you’re actually apparently confronting more and tore complexproblems and more and more complex auditing. But that is not the case at all. You’re actuallyconfronting less problems, and you have less demanded solutions.Now, previously, people in motivation—I mean, psychoanalysis—people have been asking mefor years, “Do you have any contacts with industry, or doing any work for industry?” I neverreally realized that they were asking me (psychologists and that sort of ilk, whenever I ran intothem, and so forth; I go slumming every once in a while, I have to admit it)—but they’realways asking me, they’re always asking me, if we’re doing work for industry. I didn’t quite"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"understand what they were talking about until I read a review of what psychology was doingfor industry.Psychology is big business now, because it’s moved in hand-in-glove with industry. It is alittle bit into government, but mostly into industry, and it’s hiring and firing their employees forthem, and it’s selling all their goods for them. And it’s telling them how to advertise andpackage their goods. And that’s what it is doing. And that is all it is doing. It isn’t doinganything else for anybody. Its testing services and so forth are all in this line. Now that’swhere its money is coming from, and of course we’re cutting their throat on testing by simplygiving it free in several large cities. This really upsets them.The point here, however, is not any rant against the psychologist. He, after all, has his cross tobear. This bird is not even vaguely concerned with any of the problems of existence. He’scompletely out of touch, man. But he thinks and the psychiatrist thinks that you go down inman’s psyche.Now, let me introduce to you a brand-new principle, a brand-new principle: You don’t godown through three levels of subvolitional unawarenesses and so forth to rock-bottommotivation, and that sort of thing, the way they’ve got it dreamed up, see? You’re there, man.That’s the one point they’ve never grasped. They’ve not grasped that point. The guy is there.You have to go up through heightened awareness in order to progress through these “deeperstates,” as they call them. In other words, a guy has got to be more and more aware of thesevarious levels of awareness. He’s got to have a better insight into existence before he can see itat all, see? In other words, his perception has got to improve.He’s at the bottom rung of the ladder, and the only route he has available is up. He reallydoesn’t have any down route left. There isn’t any hidden, deep motivation. All you have left isthe individual and he is motivated. You have a motivated individual. You don’t have somebodywho is unaware of his “motivations.” He really is at no point where he is motivating anything;he is being motivated. And that is it. What are these areas?Now, the psychologist and the advertiser, and so forth, trying to stir up these things whichmotivate the individual: to that degree they are aware of this but they think that they areproceeding through lower levels of awareness, of less awareness, to reach these things. No.These things are reached through heightened awareness. In other words, as they try to researchto find out . . .This is why they never get anyplace with processing, why they dead-ended in the whole fieldof therapy and actually jettisoned it. It had been jettisoned, if you want to know the truth of thematter.Now, this fellow hasn’t got an unconscious to be probed. He’s unconscious. You see? Hehasn’t got one to be probed. He is simply the effect of all of this. There isn’t any place you gobelow his level of awareness. They get this idea because a person can go to sleep, you see.And they get this all mixed up with the fact that he can not be aware and be aware, and they’vegot “sleep” and “awake,” which has nothing to do with it.Now, they want to know what motivates this guy, so they put him out further, or they search“deeper,” or they plumb into the hidden recesses of his—”hidden?” Gone, man! He’s thefellow that’s hidden! See, they’re looking for the wrong thing. They’re looking for the deeperareas of unconsciousness, when as a matter of fact, they already have arrived there, they’ve gotit sitting in the chair in front of them.Now, in order to discover anything more about this individual at all, you can only go up. Youcan’t discover more about this individual, you see, by putting him in deeper, or something likethis, you see? It’s hard for me to make this point because it’s so ingrained in us that we godeeper all the time, see?"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Now, let’s look at it from another point of view. See? You’ve got to make him more aware inorder to find out anything about him at all. So there is no shortcut, as we have eventuallylearned—we even jettisoned Dianetic reverie—but there is no shortcut by which you can getthis guy half baked up on peyote, or something like this, so that you get to a deeper level ofawareness, which you can then examine to find out what’s wrong with him. You see that as acomplete detour? You’re going exactly no place.I’ll give you an actual experiment on this thing. You could run this experiment on almostanybody. You say, “What have you been upset about lately?” or “Why are you nervous?”There’s a good one. “Why are you nervous?”And then the fellow says, ahh . . . I—I don’t know. Am I nervous?”“Well, you look so. You keep going like this all the time.”“Uh . . . well, I—I—I—I don’t know. I—I didn’t—don’t—I do—don’t know what’s makingme nervous. I—I—if—if I am nervous, I don’t know what’s making me nervous!”Run this little test, like this: “Well, what considerations have you had about your state?” Run itfor a few minutes and then ask him what’s making me [him] nervous, and he tells you at once.Well, that’s very interesting, because, in other words, you had to heighten his awareness bypulling charge off of this subject of his state of beingness. And now he knows. He can tellyou. Well, this isn’t him going into his subconscious, you see? This is opening up a little bitupper strata above him. You’ve made his awareness a little bit better so he can look better, andyou’ve gotten him up to a point of where he can look at a little higher condition of beingness.And that’s the route that you take with a PC. And you can very easily get terribly confused andupset by current nomenclature, Freudian nomenclature and current understanding about havingto go into the lower levels of consciousness of the mind in order to . . . No, there is no spook.There’s no bogy sitting down below, you see?It’s like on a ship, you see? It’s like you’d walk down through all the ladders of the engineroom, and you finally run into this black, grimy character, covered with coal dust, and he issitting there staring into a huge, roaring maw of a fire. And you say, “I’m looking for thefireman.” And he starts accommodatingly looking all over the whole fireroom to find thefireman.You see, this is the exact idiotic thing that they’re doing with regard to the mind, see? And hewill be very accommodating. He’ll go into every corner of that fireroom, he’ll go all throughthe engine room, he’ll look under the gratings, he’ll look in the bilges, and he’ll cheer you upon the road and everything else. And he’s looking for the fireman.Now, if you were a Scientologist and you just ran a few considerations about his identity, see,made him a little bit more aware of things, and so on, he’d say, “Ha-ha. Oh! I’m the fireman!”You see what’s going on here, you see?So we must be careful not to fall into this same parallel line of balderdash. You’re looking forman’s spirit, see? Great! Men will accommodatingly walk with you almost every place to findman’s spirit, you see? And there he is, right there! See, he’s it!Yet how many times have you had to explain to somebody, “We’re not interested in your soul.You are your own soul!” See?Everybody says, “A what? I—duh-uh!” See? That’s the same gag as the fireman. Duplicategag."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"No, the guy is there, see? There are no rungs—try to go further south than the bottom platingof the ship. There’s no ladder going down there because there’s nothing there!So, the fellow is almost at total effect. He has lost his identity, he’s lost his true beingness,he’s associated himself with other things. Now, you’ve got to increase his awareness to findout anything.There is no reason why—and by the way, I’ve made tremendous experiments in this particulardirection, in all ways and directions. You can’t shoot him full of scopolamine or truth serum orsomething like this, or hypnotize him and ask him something or other. All you’d restimulate isthe GPM “to create the past,” or something like this, you know. And he’ll create a nice past foryou, because he’s less aware now than he was before.See? So you reduce awareness, you find less person, and you’re looking for the fireman andyou already got him, see? And that’s all there is there. And you’re at the complete bottom rungof the ladder.All right. Now, how do you get anyplace else? This is your problem as the auditor, see? Well,there are seven Levels up. And these Levels are determined only by this—only by this: anincreased awareness of his beingness and his relationship to existence, and the problems andsolutions of life. You just increase his awareness of this. What is a problem to this man? And ifyou simply ask that of each one of the seven levels as you go up, you could draw those levelsvery nicely. What is a problem to this man? And when you raise him up the line, in somehorror you get up about four levels up—oh yes, he’s calmer about everything now, but he cantake a look at the problems he has got, man. He’s better able to confront them so that hedoesn’t shudder with horror. But if you were to pull him out of 0 and put him at Level IV withone dull thud, and say “Now look at the problems you really do have, brother,” he is not goingto be able to look at those problems at all.One, he has never climbed a single line of the stairs, because you’ve never increased hisawareness of his relationship to existence. Only by increasing the individual’s awareness of hisrelationship to existence can you bring about any heightened condition of ability, performance,livingness or anything else.Now, this seems to be argued with by the fact that some guy can fill himself up full of BromoSeltzer or heroin or something like that and perform very fantastic feats in some direction orother. And you know, I think they’re all fairy tales? l did a tremendous amount of research withdrugs back in ‘49, ‘50, and so forth. And the only thing that ever happened people went tosleep.I’ve never seen any of these marvelous experiments that I see Mitten up with such glibidity. Inever see the results of these experiments. I read all about them, but a scientific experiment issomething that can be duplicated in a laboratory, and apparently none of these experiments soadvertised can be duplicated in a laboratory. That’s an interesting one, isn’t it?Yes, you hear about this fellow, he drinks a half a gallon of rum and therefore he can lift up ahorse, you know? I’ve seen guys drink half a gallon of rum. I’ve seen them think they couldlift up a horse. I haven’t seen any horses rising off the ground, man. Their coordination getsworse.There are some writers that think they can write better when they have some drinks. Old DashHammett used to have a ring, one of these fancy service things that has a shot glass in six orseven holes all in a little wheel, and all of the thing beautifully rigged up here, so all you had todo was turn it around and you could pick out the next shot glass, you know—these little salonpresentation pieces of stuff. And he used to set that down the side of his desk; and when hewould finish a chapter he’d pick up the next shot glass, you see, and down it, and go so . . . Iheard all about this and how well he did it."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"But I ran into some other writers that weren’t so good this way. And one finally put the cap onthe whole thing: He says, “You know,” he says, “I can’t write when I can’t spell.” Thatactually wipes out the whole theory of “how much better I write when . . .” A guy thinks hewrites better because he’s less aware. If he were a little more aware, he’d realize that what hewas writing stunk! I don’t know if you’ve ever risen in the middle of the night and writtensome deathless prose or poetry. Let’s say your sense of appreciation was heightened by beinghalf out.See, we hear about all these things, but in actual performance, and so forth, we don’t see thesethings get delivered. We don’t see the half-drunk guy suddenly capable of magnificent feats ofsomething or other, and we don’t see this and we don’t see that. But we see guys saying thatthey are this way. See?So we can see here that there’s a bit of a hole in some of the logic that is presented to uswhereby “if we just became a little less conscious of everything, why, we would be a lot betteroff.” Well, naturally, that rationale is a very current rationale, because it’s been extant since thebeginning of this universe, and is probably the basic rationale that lies back of solutions to allproblems— is “become unaware of them.” And that is the final solution: become totallyunaware.There’s one just before you become totally unaware, and that is “Whatever you’re doing makesyou right.” Regardless of how irrational what you’re doing is, it’s this last point of assumptionthat, well, you’re doing right, you see? Completely irrational action.Well, just below that, as the next solution down, is simply “become unaware.” That’s thegradient scale of solutions, if you want to know the truth of the matter.Now, where you’ve got, then, an individual who is trying to improve himself, and so forth, hehas two routes open. One is to become more aware of existence so as to cope with it, and theother is to become less aware of existence: Become less aware and hope that you don’t get runover. Or become more aware and be jolly sure that you don’t. So the dwindling solution, thesolution which is going out the bottom, and so forth, is full of hope, full of a lot of things, butactually doesn’t lead anyplace. And it is a very treacherous solution, because it is simplyhoping it will be all right. “Well, I’ll just forget about it and hope that it doesn’t bother me.”We see this type of philosophy: “If you want to know why you are overworried, rememberwhat you were worried about yesterday and realize that you aren’t worried about it today. AndI’m very glad that all the things I have been worried about never happened.” This kind ofphilosophy Well. it’s very witty philosophy, but is it at all factual? How do we know that thatfellow’s worry and the actions he took in relation to that worry did not prevent the totalcatastrophe? See, we’re not sure of that at all So this other solution is a complete slipshod oneand is hardly any solution at all, which is just become less aware.As one is standing there and the lion is charging down on one, of course it’s always offered asa solution: faint. See? In the nineteenth century, it’s practically the only solution womankindhad. She was not in a position—she was still in a state of chattelism. She was not in a positionwhere she could fight back in any particular way. Her word wasn’t really very good in courtand that sort of thing. But she could still faint. She fainted like mad and she fainted by degrees.She “Camille’d,” also.So, this is a solution of sorts, don’t you see? If you can’t confront it, and you can’t move awayTom it, why, you can become unaware of it. The black panther mechanism, I think we used tocall this in Dianetics. Some such— “ignore it,” you see? This is worse than the black panthermechanism; this is just become unaware.Now, therefore, it becomes somewhat terrifying to people when you reverse the flow on them.And this is one of the reasons why it’s difficult for you to do this. Although you can do this asan auditor very, very easily, it’s still sometimes quite terrifying. And you’ll have some people"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"wondering whether or not they should run out their GPMs, or something like this, see? Almostanybody will hit that one. You know you’ve got him running pretty good if about the third timeyou start to audit him he becomes not quite sure that this is a good idea.You’re asking him to reverse the flow of the universe, which is gradient unawareness. Thisuniverse has simply been a progress of less and less awareness. It’s the route to the total sleep.And the trick of the whole thing is, it’s so rigged that you never get to sleep. The lower you go,the more problems you’ve got, because now the littler problems seem bigger. And nobody everlooks at this parallel route as they go down the route of unawareness.Actually, their becoming unaware of the big problem brought them less power or force itreduced their confront—and so now they are less able to confront little problem at that level. Sotherefore it seems as big now as the big problem seemed, and just one stage back. And it seemsfar more dangerous and threatening and—because it is! What’s the condition of someindividual who, because there’s a slight wind blowing, goes into terror? What is this condition,you know? There’s a little bit of wind blowing, not much, just a little bit of wind, and thisindividual is in white, blanched terror.Well, now let’s map exactly what happened to this fellow. There was some bigger problem, onthe same gradient, that he ceased to confront. He became unaware of it—almost purposely—and this put him into a confront of a slight wind. See, he came down to where he could onlyconfront this little breeze. But the big problem was full of terror, so the breeze is full of terror.And there’s your trick when you uncover hidden memories, and this is the big invitation to gouncover hidden memories; because you often can uncover a hidden memory, and incidentallyincrease the individual’s awareness slightly, you see—and uncover this memory by some kindof trickery—and the individual will lose this particular little fear. That he shifts over to anotherfear now and doesn’t go any further than this, is something they never really bothered toinvestigate.Well, I could take almost anybody who had a phobia, and most of you too, put them on themeter—you old smoothie—put them on a meter and start figuring out, “Well, what are youafraid of?” you know? “Oh, you’re afraid of this. Oh, all right.” And let’s just find the biggerfear that made them prone to the lesser fear. See? This that I’m telling you, then, has directapplication— actually wraps up psychoanalysis. Freud can go back quietly to sleep in hisgrave. This was what he was looking for. This mechanism I am telling you right now is whathe was looking for—the only mechanism he was really looking for.All little fears are irrational and are based on a bigger fear. That’s what he considered, see? Hesaid the little fear is irrational, so therefore we’ve got to find the bigger fear that promotes thelittler fear. And he went off into all kinds of symbolism and everything else. He got lost in therat race; he got lost in the maze before he got through. But he nevertheless was on this thing.Now, why does that work? It works because the individual solved the bigger fear by becomingless aware. That’s the solution to the bigger fear. And let me tell you—because I’ve practiced inthe field of psychoanalysis—you can throw the individual back into the bigger fear and knockhim galley-west!You can sit here with your meter and you can smoke the whole thing out very carefully—notprocessing him, see, not getting any charge off, no TA action or anything like that; just sort itout on the meter.“This fear you have of cheesecakes: now, does this associate with your mother? Your fatherOkay. Cheesecakes, and so forth. All right. Were you afraid of your father? Did your fatherever eat cheesecakes?” And all of a sudden the PC has got two directions to go: One, cognition,he blows some charge, you see, and he feels better about it. That’s almost totally an accidentfrom your point of view, because—I’m talking to you out of experience—you can just as easilythrow him over into a complete gibbering terror."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"And the reason why, in psychoanalysis, 33 1/3 percent of their patients commit suicide isbecause they’ve put their foot into the wrong bin. They have accidentally pressured theindividual’s awareness up to a point of intolerance, and the individual explodes. Withoutincreasing his ability at all to become aware, they suddenly confront him with the tiger. And hegoes boom!See, there’re two things he can do. One is suddenly blow some charge at this point—becomesmore aware and says, “Oh-ho! I’m afraid of cheesecakes merely because the old man hit mymother over the head with some when I was two. All right, fine. That’s—that’s—ha-ha! Prettygood. Yeah, oh, that’s— that’s very good. Yeah. Yeah. Feel much better now; I don’t have tobe afraid of cheesecake. I can be afraid of tie pins now.”See, that’s one route. That’s one thing that could happen to him. But remember this other thingcan happen to him, too. You’re steadying him down, you’re saying “Father,” and so forth, and“Mother.” All of a sudden, a horrified look comes into his eye and he begins to shake.“What’s the matter?”“I don’t know! I’m really just terrified!”See, you could play hell trying to push him any further down that track, now. He got somehorrible idea, “Oh, my mother is dead!” and all of a sudden he starts screaming and howlingand goes into a complete dramatization and crawls up in a ball, and you call the men in thewhite coats.I’m not saying you could do this accidentally, because you don’t process this way. I’m justgiving you a little bit of warning about “processing” this way: “Reaching into the deeper statesof consciousness in order to discover the fears that motivate this individual.” Blooey! That’sfrom nowhere. There’s no route.Because the dwindling spiral of consciousness has brought him to ignore his problems, see?And the bigger problems are less and less and lessAh ! Let me give you a practical example—not boxing around with nothing here. Let me giveyou a very practical example.First time I binged out of me bean in recent times here and started looking around about threehundred miles up and that sort of thing, I thought, “Hey, what do you know,” you know?“Ho-woo-woo! Wait a minute, you know? And aren’t these clouds high. Everything’s fine,”you know? And all of a sudden a problem hit me about eight miles high, see? I’d forgottenabout that. This was one of the prices of freedom.Well, it was totally unintentional getting out of me ‘ead anyhow, see? And it was just a flip inthat particular direction, and we were taking off some charge in another area. And I got hit inthe face with a problem that I had buried beautifully! It had sod all over it. I wasn’t in anygradient up to being able to confront this problem, see? “Oh, look, I’m free! Hurray! Hurray!I’m free. Everything is fine.“What the hell is that?” Interesting, see?Another instance of this: I’d forgotten that some time ago I’d had a fear of being drawn into thesun—a reverse light vector. See, I’d forgotten this. Completely unbraced, all of a suddenthere’s the sun—here I come, you know? Beams screech, you know, rubber burning. What’sthis, you know? No gradient. See, that was just me being unwontedly brave.Now, of course, one ordinarily retreats.. . The reason a person exteriorized, see, and then wentback into the head and you couldn’t get them out again with a can opener—I’m giving you"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"what exactly this mechanism is, see?—without taking off the charge of why they were in theirhead, you took them out of their head, and they suddenly confronted the problems that they hadlong since dwindled down on unawareness, so they’re no longer aware of these problems.They had those nicely handled. You all of a sudden bang him out of his head, he all of asudden looks these problems square in the teeth— like, you know, little things, like “How doyou keep yourself centered in a room? I don’t know. I can’t keep myself centered in the room.I keep going one side of the room. What’s all this black stuff around here? I didn’t know I hadall this black stuff around.” Pang! Back into his head, see?Or, “Gee, there’s my body down there and my car is caught in a traffic jam. What am I goingto do?” Bang. “I’m liable to suddenly lose my car and lose my body too. To hell with thisracket!” You see? He’d forgotten that he had to retain a certain skill to run a body remotely,see?So back into his head he goes. Now you try to get him out of there again. Bluooh, no. Heknows better now. Ho-ho, he knows better. He’s smart now!“Come on, just one more time out of your . . .”“No! No.”He even sometimes gives you tremendous reality being outside just vivid, see? Everything 3-Dand all set up, man. He’s all set. He’s all roaring to go. Something like this happens to him,you see, he confronts some of the old problems that he’d become unconscious of. Carefully,he made himself less conscious so he wouldn’t be aware of this problem. He never solved thatproblem; he just became unaware of it. He took that line of “solution,’! see?So, back into his head he goes when he confronts that problem again, only this time he nowhas the awareness that there was some reason—this still sticks at him—there was some reasonhe went into his head. He can’t quite spot what it is, but there is some reason.So now you give him the business, you see? You say to him, “All right. Now, but you had agood reality on it while you were outside. You know, then, that you are a spirit, that you arenot a body. You know all this. You’ve got this all—”“Ho-ho, no. I haven’t got any reality on that. Outside? When was that? When was that? I didn’tdo. Not—not me! Oh, I know we thought something happened, but probably just myimagination.” You ever have anything like this happen?Well now, this is why this happens. It’s the dwindling spiral of unawareness.Now you’re all of a sudden going to take this individual that you’ve walked down into thebowels of the ship and asked him where’s the fireman, and he accommodatingly searched fortwo hours when he was it—you’re going to take this individual, and you say, “All right, it’svery nice in the crow’s-nest. You can see every place. Now, we’re going to put you in thecrow’s-nest.” Swump-glump, into the crow’s-nest.Crow’s-nests have their disadvantages. They reel. They are not warm. They are lonely. Theyare dark. When one falls out of them, one splashes. You haven’t got him in that crow’s-nesttwo minutes: He’s saying, “Why, hey, look how nice it is around here!” you know? He’ssaying, “Gee whiz, oo-oo, I’d forgotten there was such a thing as the sea. Gosh!” you know?“And all this fresh air. Golly, I—no—no coal dust in it. Hey, what do you know!” And he’senjoying all this, and all of a sudden he’s starting to look sort of haunted and he says, “Takeme out of here.”And you say, “What’s the matter?”“Oh, don’t bother with what’s the matter; take me out of here.”"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"You get him back down in the stokehold; you could come down and offer him a thousandpounds cash to sign on, not back in the crow’s-nest, but even on the deck force, and hewouldn’t have anything to do with it. What happened?Well, actually he didn’t become aware enough of what happened for him to really be aware ofwhat happened. He came to an area of something he didn’t understand. And this was alarmingto him, and he saw that his position was insecure and he was very unsafe, and that hecompared it to how safe he had been—if uncomfortable—down there in the bowels of the ship.So his vote is in, with a great big X on the ballot box, for “in front of furnace door, coal dusteverywhere; I at least knew, by experience, that I survived there, and I know that it’simpossible to survive in a crow’s-nest.”This is his total rationale. In other words, you put him into a higher level of awareness. Thereis no deeper subconscious for the individual to go in.You put him in this higher level of awareness, one of the things he becomes aware of is theproblems he has not handled. So this alone makes it necessary for the forward progress of theindividual to be by gradients. And you can make it, as long as you gave him a chance to sitdown occasionally and admire the new view.In the first place, he’s a victim of charge—self-created, tremendously restimulated, orquiescent, masses of charge. He is not aware of these things, really, at all; but the second hebecomes more aware—he starts to get aware of them—he doesn’t really want anything to dowith them, so he ducks out on them again. You do nothing about these things, you do nothingabout this charged-up atmosphere, you do nothing to take—”just take charge off.” What am Italking about? I’m talking about you process this guy without tone arm action. Take charge off:get tone arm action on this individual. As he is getting tone arm action, he gets about so muchtone arm action, he’s moved up to a new level of awareness. Having moved up to this newlevel of awareness, he’s able to look around, and he is perfectly comfortable where he is.Actually, the preclear who is progressing just looks a little better and a little better and a littlebetter. It is not a spectacular activity. Now you’ve got him up to a point of where you can takemore charge off per unit of time. And the charge is more fundamental. That’s why you haveLevels.Now, actually, the charge which you can take off at one fell swoop at Level IV wouldpractically kill somebody if you tried to do anything about it at Level 0, see? Now, as theymove up the line, their problems are apparently greater. No, their problems aren’t greater, theycan see better. Actually, their problems are less, and they are more capable of handling them.And so it stays in better balance. They’re more satisfied. But they can handle more breadth ofproblem than they could before. As they go up they can handle more problem; the problem isless upsetting to them. As they go down they can handle less problem, and these problems aremore upsetting to them. That’s just the awareness of the problem, as you go up and down.Now, the complex individual who requires the complex solution is the guy at Level 0. There isthe boy who has to have the complex solutions. His problems are terribly complex, and hissolutions have to be numerous. And the potentials of the problem are dangerous in the extremeto him. And therefore the solution that is handed to him must be relatively complex.Now, how do we get around all this? Just let me give you this in a very, very rapid rundownhere. How do we get around this? You know that solving somebody’s problems doesn’t doanything for him, because the new solution becomes a new malady. The old solution is all he issick from now. Everything is a cure for a cure. Cures cure cures. It’s a gradient scale of curingsomebody’s old cures. I can tell you what fellow has been a man-o’-warsman, or somethinglike this, by his reaction to rum. This was about the only cure he had. It was a cure for fear,and it was a cure for this and cure for that, cure for being wet. Never had any dry clothes, theyjust gave him a drink of rum."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Rum now turns on chills, gives him a cold, and makes him terrified. Why? It restimulatesrising to the zone of these old problems, which it cured. So now you have to put him through acourse of treatment to cure him of rum.Now, what gets us away from this? It’s just this: we are not giving people solutions. What isthe only thing that divorces us from this in processing? How is it that we can get around this atall? Well, it’s elementary how we get around it. The basic error is the most fundamental part ofthe problem that can be as-ised. The basic error that you want to as-is is a fundamental part ofthe problem, because of this chain of solutions.You, as an auditor, are attacking it at a problems level. You are not giving the PC newsolutions for his livingness; you are taking out of existence old solutions which now exist inthe form of problems. In other words, you’re as-ising past solvents. You’re as-ising what hasbeen solved in the past. You’re taking him in the same direction up, see? See, you’rebacktracking the same track he came down. You’re not giving him a new solution to thecondition he is in. But you’re taking out of his think the old solution which made him dropdown and become more unaware. You’re taking this out of his perimeter of existence .In other words, you’re not attacking the problem by giving the PC new solutions. You’reattacking the problem by as-ising old problems. That they, in their turn, were solutions isbeside the point. From an auditor’s point of view, just for simplicity, simply attack theproblems the fellow has had. Well, you run this gorgeously in, what, 1C, 1CM—R1CM andso on—problems, solutions: What problems has he had? What has he done about theseproblems? What considerations has he had about these problems? Any such action as this—andparticularly, how has he solved these problems? What solutions has he had to these things?And you start backing the guy up, and you’re actually backing him through yesterday’sproblems.When you start running solutions on somebody, you’re running yesterday’s problems. See, ifyou run it as a problem, you are running it below its point of awareness and it won’t as-is.I’ll let you in on a little trick, here. You have been told that you must not run problems at R1C.Well, that is simply a blunt technical statement, and it’s perfectly true and valid and workable.But let’s ask “What the devil is a problem?” You’re told that you can only run solutions on thisperson. Ah, but what’s a solution? A solution is a way you don’t have to confront the problem.And a problem is something you don’t want to confront. By definition, what is a problem? Aproblem is something you don’t want to confront. That’s why it’s a problem.So your effort to handle it is solve it in some way, and when you solve it in the direction ofbecoming less aware of it or turning your back on it—when that comes in as a solution—youhave now moved into less levels of awareness. So the way you as an auditor are backtrackingthis thing, you’re actually looking at yesterday’s solutions. And you start to ask the PC, “Whatproblems have you had?” “What problems have you had?” “What problems have you had?”He’s just saying, “This I couldn’t confront, that I couldn’t confront, this other I couldn’tconfront.” And so you don’t get any meter, see? You don’t get thisBut you say, “What solutions have you had?”He’s saying, “This problem and this problem and this problem that I could confront.” Do yousee that? It’s the difference between running no-confront and running confront.See, today’s problem was yesterday’s solution. So you inevitably are running solutionsregardless of whether you call them problems or not. But if you call them “problems,” thenyou’re saying the individual couldn’t confront them; if you’re saying “solutions,” then you’resaying he could confront them. You see this?"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"You got to backtrack this boy’s solutions, because then you’re getting rid of the problemswhich he set up so that he couldn’t confront anything. And this is how this all degenerated. Soyou’re actually cutting in at an entirely different area. You’re cutting in at the solutions thefellow has had, which of course in their turn were problems.And therefore, processing can solve the way back up the whole track, you see? And hebecomes more and more aware, he’s more and more capable of confronting, so therefore theseterrifying things—you know, like going out and seeing the street—these terrifying things areless and less terrifying to him. And what’s the final there? He just graduates up through thesevarious levels of awareness, up to a point of where he can confront the problems that made himstart getting unaware in the first place, and he finds those, in turn, were solutions, so there he’sall set. And he moves on out to freedom.And this is the route to freedom, through becoming more aware; it’s expressed on your tonearm, it’s expressed on the fact that you’re attacking the various solutions of the past. And thisholds through even to GPMs at Class VI.What were these things but very complex solutions? Extremely complex solutions. Well, theremust have been a hell of a problem back of it, man. That’s obvious! There must have beenquite a problem back of all that. Well, the problem back of all that and so forth was only aproblem because the individual wasn’t confronting it. So he took an extraordinary-solution wayout called a GPM. It was a pretty wild thing to do. But there’s where the areas of confront go.Now, he got himself so thoroughly bogged down in all the charge and mass that his chances ofbecoming aware enough to even know what this problem was became very remote indeed. Ifhe were suddenly to walk back and face this old problem, he’d fold up like a tent with its tentpeg pulled. Crash!Just ask him “Go ahead and face this old problem.”Hhahh!You say, “Get rid of these GPMs.” You got rid of the charge now, which were the solutions,and all of a sudden he suddenly turns around and confronts the problem that he had. He willconfront that portion of it that he can confront. You start handling this and work him throughthat and he can confront more and more of it, and then he’ll finally laugh at himself.But that’s what Levels are, that’s why they’re there. And it just behaves on this basis on theoperating principle that the individual, at any given time, is at his lowest level of awareness, nomatter what level he’s in. And you’ve got to walk him up into further awareness, furthercomprehension, understanding, for him to be able to hold his own in the environment that hehas now entered.That’s the rationale of Levels, and why you bring the individual back up. That’s how toprocess an individual. That’s how you keep from stampeding an individual in some particulardirection. That also explains why you occasionally turn on a manic on a PC: “Oh, it’swonderful! Every—wonderful!” And three days later the PC collapses. He was put in there toofast, too quick, with too much.You see, you don’t need tougher processes now, see? You need more adroit use of theprocesses you’ve got. And you walk an individual up this track. He might tell you he wants tobecome OT tomorrow, but that’s a solution. What’s an OT? “It’s a person who’s totallyunaware of anything and has buttoned the problem up.” You see how that would work?So when we look into this, when we look into this, we see how an individual can be madebetter, how an individual can recover, and we see the direction we’re trying to put him; and wesee that trying to put him there in a disorderly fashion and not knowing what we’re doing"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"would arrive at very little gain for the individual and a lot of loss for the auditor. If you justrealize that you’re simply increasing the individual’s level of awareness, you’re getting off thecharge which debars him from confronting the problems which he had deserted—and if youlook at it from that point of view, with that degree of simplicity—then it doesn’t matter howcomplex a problem is. It doesn’t matter how complex the solution is. But always remember thata problem is as complex as it presents potential solutions. And the man down there in thefirehold, you’d be surprised how many solutions it takes to keep him alive and keep him going.Man, they’re just fantastic.These start to drop off as you walk the individual back up. The most complex being that youconfront is the PC at his lowest level. And therefore this requires the most complex solutions.But you bypass that as an auditor by having the key to the gates. You start getting rid of thesolutions he has had, and therefore the complexity of the solutions he is now adding onreduces—reduces because the problem all the time is less and less complex. See, reduce thecomplexity of the problem by reducing yesterday’s solutions. And this is how processingworks, and this is what handles it and this is the direction you steer it. If you steer it in anyother direction, you will have a severe loss.But this way, if you understand it this way, then—let me add one little point here, now: Thething it takes to drive this home real good is to ask that little proposition I gave you. Ask someindividual for an answer to something (he won’t give you the answer), then take some chargeoff, his considerations or solutions he’s had to it, and then ask him again for that datum, andhe’ll give you the datum. Well, how come he could give you the datum now, when he couldn’tgive you the datum then? He was barred from the datum before, he had retreated from thedatum before; you raised his level of awareness, you got the charge off, you got him—uppedhis confront, upped his awareness, and he all of a sudden could give you the datum.Nothing is more positive than this than trying to get an individual to understand an item, orsomething like this, in a GPM. You start this one, and the guy will sit there, “How do dogsbring about masters?” you know?“I couldn’t imagine that. What do dogs have to do with masters? Dogs don’t have anything todo with masters, and so forth. Doesn’t . . . dogs doesn’t . . . bring masters . . . Oh, it doesn’tmake any sense to me at all! Dogs. Masters. No connection. No connection whatsoever.”You say, “What considerations have you had about it?” (In other words, what solutions have you had to this and what have you been doing about it?) And you run thisfor a few minutes and say, “All right, would dogs bring about masters?”He says, “Of course, you fool! Anybody would know that.”Well, you say, “What was that all about?” Well, what that was all about, a very simple thing.Overcharged area, too mucked up with solutions: guy couldn’t think, he couldn’t see, couldn’tbe aware in that particular area. And for you to get him anywhere at all, you had to take himthrough the charge.So the road out is not by a spectacular open sesame or a wave the wand, or something like that.You take them back out through the charge they came down to avoid. What’s that chargeconsist of? It consists of the solutions they had to other charge they couldn’t avoid, theycouldn’t—didn’t want and became unaware of, see?So the road into this universe is successive unawarenesses. And the road out is successiveawarenesses. But not just bare-breasting your chest to the whole universe. No, you have tofind out why the individual didn’t want to be aware at those points, and he didn’t want to beaware because he solved it. Well, what’s this solution?

He runs problem with “inventsomething worse”, considers it flat, never looks at it again in intensive. Girl friend calls up pcevery night, invalidates him, finally makes him so sick she carts him off in triumph to ahospital. BLUNDER: Auditor tried to clear pt problem for the whole intensive, not at thebeginning of each session. BLUNDER: Auditor in this case went backtrack to a dead wife toclean up charge.A pt problem is cleaned up as itself only. One doesn’t backtrack to get why the pc hassuch a problem when doing CCH 0.A pt problem is checked at the beginning of every session—and if there is a break atnoon, is cleaned up also at the beginning of the afternoon session.A pt problem doesn’t always bop on the meter at the first question. The auditor has tospend a little time asking around and making sure. Then he audits it on if it falls under abovedefinition of pt problem.THINGS TO AUDIT PT PROBLEM WITH: A very bad off case: TR Ten and if it turnson a somatic, flatten TR TEN “YOU notice that object.” An average case: Isolate the terminalmost closely associated with the problem and run “Invent something worse than (terminal)” andthen flatten it off with “Invent a problem of comparable magnitude to (terminal).” Also can berun “Spot where (terminal) is now. Okay. Spot where you are now. Okay.” A very easy case:Two way comm about the problem and terminals, getting pc to cognite, until the charge isgone.Where the PT PROBLEM is pain in some member of the body, the auditor can run“Recall an unwanted (member that hurts).” And when that has been run for a few cycles frompresent to past, “Recall a lost (member that hurts).” (Always run lost and unwanted in the samesession and for the same length of time.)

Therefore problems are probably why some people clear easily and others don't.Considerations about the stable datum and the confusion also lead toward the auditing ofproblems as such. For a problem consists of two opposed stable data and therefore twoconfusions.The definition of a problem is “Two or more postulates in opposition to each other”.Probably all pcs should be run on Routine One. The Change Scale was aimed at handlingalter-is in doing auditing commands. Auditing Problems, you will find, cures alter-isness in acase.The full rundown on the basic Routine 1A was given to the Sthil Briefing CourseStudents on July 3, 1961, and the tape of this date should be studied for full data on Routine1A. Routine 1A can however be used without serious consequences and with great benefitwithout all its data; at least it will get better results than poorly run CCHs and will get resultsanyway.

A Security Check is done (and soare goals) only by INSTANT READ and never by LATENT READ. If the needle falls or reactswithin a tenth of a second after the question is asked pursue it, for this is an Instant Read. If itdoesn't fall or react for a second or more and then reacts, do NOT pursue it or do anythingabout it. This is a LATENT Read. Only use the E-Meter if the pc says “No” or disclaimshaving done it.If the pc owns up to a question, don't refer to the meter. Don't even look at the meterwhen asking a Sec question the first time. If the pc then says he hasn't done it, look at theneedle and without looking at the pc ask again. Pc still says “No” or its equivalent and you getan instant read, pursue it with more questions.

But never on the samemorning or same afternoon or same evening. Never in the same session. Sec Check mornings,run Problems afternoons. Or vice versa. Or on alternate days.

When you asked someone to invent a problem of comparable magnitude, his problemwent further away in distance. When you asked someone for a solution to his problem theproblem approached closer.Well, I have now found the reason for this—the “penalty of solving”. It is, I mightcomment, not an unimportant discovery for we all become victims of problem-collapse whenwe solve things. This is why people won’t solve their problems, why they “have to haveproblems”.Failure to make solutions (or postulates) stick elsewhere makes the thetan “believe” thatsolutions collapse problems on him.A process to demonstrate the first observation is well known—problems of comparablemagnitude—and getting the pc to then “solve the problem” (this last of course is not“therapeutic”).A process to overcome this collapsing of problems upon one is “What solution could youmake stick?”  L.

[These steps come after the steps as given below.] The auditorasks the preclear, ‘What kind of a problem could you be to your mother?’ And when thepreclear has found one, ‘All right, can you be that problem?’ And when the preclear hasbecome it, ‘Can you see your mother figuring about it?’ And whether the preclear can or not,‘Give me another problem you could be to your mother’, ‘Can you be that problem?’ etc., untilthe communication lag is flattened. Then one asks the same question about father and aboutother people in the preclear’s life, asking the preclear each time for the problem then asking himto be the problem and then asking if it makes other people worry and think about it. Finallyone asks, ‘Now what kind of a problem can you be to ... (preclear’s name)?’ And when thishas finally been flattened to a communication lag constant, one can assume that he has more orless handled this situation for the moment and he uses exactly the same process on solutions.The same wording as above is used with the exception that ‘solution’ is substituted for‘problem’. When the preclear cannot be a problem, the auditor should find some things that thepreclear can be with great certainty, have the preclear be those things, then have the preclear bea problem. When processing an auditor, have him be an auditor and a preclear alternately,physically assuming the proper position for each until all auditing has been run out and thepreclear is no longer waiting to find out what is going to happen. The auditor should keep inmind the fact that a preclear can be a ‘no-solution’ also that the preclear can be a ‘no-problem’also that the preclear can be a solution that needs problems. Many various and strangemanifestations take place, but this process very severely uses only the above commands. Theprocess can be continued, and should be, into the commands of R1-11 which take up problemsin havingness.It may occur if the preclear is a mystic or is interested in the occult, that he offers apeculiar problem in problems. Such a preclear may be looking for the solution to all problems,assuming that only one solution is possible for all problems. If he were to discover thissolution, he would, of course, find himself completely out of problems. Thus his havingnessin terms of problems would be so enormously reduced that he would discover himself withoutany interest of any kind. But even if the preclear is not in this category, the process which isgiven in this paragraph is definitely indicated in the field of problems. Actually it is acombination of running significances and handling problems, and it is useful for any state ofcase except, of course, those upon whom only Opening Procedure of 8-C may be run. Thecomplete remedy of problems, of course, takes place when the preclear is convinced that he cancreate problems at will. Until he is so convinced, he is going to hold on to old problems. Theway to Convince him that he can create problems is to have him pick out, or pick up, an object.Have him examine this object until he is sure it is real. Then ask him the question: ‘Whatproblems could this object be to you?’ Have him begin to name off various problems. It will bediscovered at first, as always in the handling of significances, that he begins to drain the objectitself of the problems which are inherent in the object, and then will eventually begin to inventproblems. The problem should be run until the preclear is convinced that he can createproblems at will. Many objects can be used rather than just one if it is discovered that thepreclear’s attention is fixing too strongly upon the object."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICESaint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, SussexHCO BULLETIN OF 14 AUGUST AD14RemimeoFranchiseSthil StudentsSCIENTOLOGY TWOPREPCHECK BUTTONS(Cancels previous issues)The following order and number of Prepcheck Buttons should be used wherever “an 18button Prepcheck” is recommended. Do not use the old order of buttons.The full command is usually “(Time Limiter) (on subject) has anything been____” or “Isthere anything you have been_____” for some of them which don’t fit with “Has anythingbeen_____”. The (on_____) may be omitted. The Time Limiter is seldom omitted as it leads thepc to Itsa the Whole Track. On an RRing goal found and used in R3SC the Time Limiter “Inthis Lifetime” can be used with good effect. All Service Fac questions or Prepchecks must havea Time Limiter.In running R4 (R3M2), pc’s actual GPMs, the goal and RIs are Prepchecked without aTime Limiter as pc is on the whole track anyway. But in all lower levels of auditing,particularly when using a possible goal as a Service Fac, the Time Limiter, usually “In thisLifetime_____”, must be used or pc will become OverRestimulated.In order to avoid most GPM words, for all uses the 18 Prepcheck Buttons now are:SUPPRESSEDCAREFUL OFDIDN’T REVEALNOT-ISEDSUGGESTEDMISTAKE BEEN MADEPROTESTEDANXIOUS ABOUTDECIDEDWITHDRAWN FROMREACHEDIGNOREDSTATEDHELPEDALTEREDREVEALEDASSERTEDAGREED (WITH)BIG MID RUDSIt will be noted that the first 9 are the Big Mid Ruds used as “Since the last time Iaudited you has anything been_____?”"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"A USEFUL TIPTo get the Meter clean on a list during nulling the list the easiest system is to show the pcthe list and just ask “What happened?” This saves a lot of Mid Ruds.TWO USEFUL PAIRSWhen trying to get an Item to read, the two buttons Suppress and Not-Ised are sometimesused as a pair.To get a pc easier in session the buttons Protested and Decided are sometimes used as apair.DIRTY NEEDLEMid Ruds (called because Middle of Session was the earliest use + Rudiments of aSession) are less employed today because of the discovery that all Dirty Needle phenomena isusually traced to the auditor having cut the pc’s communication. To get rid of a Dirty Needleone usually need ask only, “Have I cut your Communication?” or do an ARC Breakassessment if that doesn’t work. A Dirty Needle (continuously agitated) always means theauditor has cut the pc’s Itsa Line, no matter what else has happened.Chronically comm chopping auditors always have pcs with Dirty Needles. Conversely,pcs with high Tone Arms have auditors who don’t control the Itsa Line and let it over-restimulate the pc by getting into lists of problems or puzzlements; but a high Tone Arm alsomeans a heavy Service Fac, whereas a Dirty Needle seldom requires Mid Ruds or Prepchecks.It just requires an auditor who doesn’t cut the pc’s Itsa Line.THE OLD ORDER OF PREPCHECK BUTTONSThe following buttons and order were the original buttons and may not be used, as theyinclude GPM words which would make the pc uncomfortable in some cases if over-run.SUPPRESSEDINVALIDATEDBEEN CAREFUL OFSUGGESTEDWITHHELDPROTESTEDHIDDENREVEALEDMISTAKE (BEEN MADE)ASSERTEDCHANGED (OR ALTERED)DAMAGEDWITHDRAWN (FROM)CREATEDDESTROYEDAGREED (WITH)IGNOREDDECIDEDLRH :jw.cden L.

If you fail to get one INthen the outness of the next one reads faintly. And if your TR1 is at all poor, you’ll miss therudiment’s outness and there goes your session.To get over these difficulties, I’ve developed Repetitive Rudiments.The auditor at first does not consult the meter, but asks the rudiments question of the pcuntil the pc says there is no further answer. At this point the auditor says, “I will check that onthe meter.” And asks the question again. If it reads, the auditor uses the meter to steer the pc tothe answer, and when the pc finds the answer, the auditor again says, “I will check that on themeter” and does so.The cycle is repeated over and over until the meter is clean of any instant read (see HCOBulletin of May 25, 1962, for Instant Read).The cycle:1. Run the rudiment as a repetitive process until pc has no answer.2. Consult meter for a hidden answer.3. If meter reads use it to steer (“that” “that” each time the meter flicks) the pc to theanswer.4. Stay with the Meter and do (2) and (3).The process is flat when there is no instant read to the question.One does not “bridge out” or use “two more commands”. When the meter test of thequestion gets no instant read, the auditor says, “The meter is clean”.The trick here is the definition of “With Session”. If the pc is With Session the meter willread. If the pc is partially against session the meter will read poorly, and the rudiment will notregister and the rudiment will get missed. But with the pc with session the meter will read wellfor the auditor.FAST CHECKINGA Fast Check on the Rudiments consists only of Steps (2) and (3) of the cycle done overand over.Watching the meter the auditor asks the question, takes up only what reads and, carefulnot to Q and A, clears it. One does this as many times as is necessary to get a clean needle. But"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"one still says “The meter is clean” and catches up the disagreement by getting the additionalanswers.When the question is seen to be clean, the question is left.In using Fast Checking NEVER SAY, “THAT STILL READS.” That’s a flunk. Say,“There’s another read here. “REPETITIVE PREPCHECKINGWe will still use the term “Prepchecking” and do all Prepchecking by repetitive command.STEP ONEWithout now looking at the Meter, the auditor asks the question repetitively until thepreclear says that’s all, there are no more answers.STEP TWOThe auditor then says, “I will check that on the meter” and does so, watching for theInstant Read (HCO Bulletin May 25,1962).If it reads, the auditor says, “That reads. What was it?” (and steers the pc’s attention bycalling each identical read that then occurs). “There .....That .....That .....” until the pc spots itin his bank and gives the datum.STEP THREEThe auditor then ignores the meter and repeats Step One above. Then goes toStep Two, etc.STEP FOURWhen there is no read on Step Two above, the auditor says, “The meter is clean.”This is all there is to Repetitive Prepchecking as a system. Anything added in the way ofmore auditor questions is destructive to the session. Be sure not to Q and A (HCO Bulletin ofMay 24, 1962).Be sure your TR4 is excellent in that you understand (really, no fake) what the pc is sayingand acknowledge it (really, so the pc gets it) and return the pc to session. Nothing is quite asdestructive to this type of auditing as bad TR4.END WORDSThe E-Meter has two holes in it. It does not operate on an ARC broken pc and it canoperate on the last word (thought minor) only of a question. Whereas the question (thoughtmajor) is actually null.A pc can be checked on the END WORDS OF RUDIMENTS QUESTIONS and thecharge on those single words can be made known and the question turned around to avoid thelast word’s charge.Example: “Are you willing to talk to me about your difficulties?”"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"The word “difficulties”, said to the pc by itself gives an Instant Read. Remedy: Test“Difficulties”. If it reads as itself then change the question to: “Concerning your difficulties, areyou willing to talk to me?” This will only react when the pc is unwilling to do so.Caution: This trouble of END WORDS reading by themselves occurs mainly in thepresence of weak TR1 and failure to groove in the question to a “thought major”. With goodTR1 the END WORDS read only when the question is asked.IN PRACTICE you only investigate this when the pc insists strongly that the question isnul. Then test the end word for lone reaction and turn the question about to make it end withanother end word (question not to have words changed, only shifted in order). Then groove itin and test it for Instant Read. If it still reacts as a question (thought major) then, of course, it isnot nul and should be answered.DOUBLE CLEANING“Cleaning” a rudiment that has already registered nul gives the pc a Missed Withhold ofnothingness. His nothingness was not accepted. The pc has no answer. A missed no-answerthen occurs. This is quite serious. Once you see a Rudiment is clean, let it go. To ask againsomething already nul is to leave the pc baffled—he has a missed withhold which is anothingness.LRH :jw.bp.cden L. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1963by L.

Reads are small falls or falls or long falls or long fallblowdown (of TA).A preclear’s case can be gotten into serious trouble by listing a list that doesn’t read orprepchecking or running an item that doesn’t read.On a list, this is the sort of thing that happens:The List is “Who or what would fly kites?” The C/S has said to “List this to a BD F/NItem”. So the auditor does list it without checking the read at all. The list can go on 99 pageswith the pc protesting, getting upset. This is called a “Dead horse list” because it gave no item.The reason it didn’t was that the list question itself didn’t read. One does an L4 on the pc tocorrect the situation and gets “Unnecessary action”.On a list that is getting no item you don’t extend. You correctly use L4 or any subsequentissue of it. If you extend a “dead horse list” you just make things worse. Use an L4 and it willset it right.This weird thing can also happen. C/S says to list “Who or what would kill buffaloes?”The auditor does, gets a BD F/N Item “A Hunter”. The C/S also says to list as a second action“Who or what would feel tough?” The auditor fails to test the Question for read and lists it. Hadhe tested it, the list would not have read. But the list comes up with an item, “A mean hunter”.It has stirred up charge from the first question and the item “A mean hunter” is a wrong item asit is a misworded variation of the first list’s item! Now we have an unnecessary action and awrong item. We do an L4 and the pc is still upset as maybe only one or the other of the twoerrors read.____________In a Dianetic “list” one is not doing a listing action. One is only trying to find a somatic orsensation, etc that will run. The item must read well. Or it won’t produce a chain to run. Inactual fact the Dn list Q does usually read but one doesn’t bother to test it.But an item that doesn’t read will produce no chain, no basic and the pc will jump aroundthe track trying but just jamming up his bank.The moral of this story is:ALWAYS TEST A LISTING QUESTION BEFORE LETTING THE PC LIST."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"ALWAYS MARK THE READ IT GAVE (sF, F, LF, LFBD) ON THE WORKSHEET.ALWAYS TEST AN ITEM FOR READ BEFORE PREPCHECKING OR RUNNINGRECALL OR ENGRAMS.ALWAYS MARK THE READ AN ITEM GAVE (sF, F, LF, LFBD) ON THEWORKSHEET.CHARGEThe whole subject of “charge” is based on this. “Charge” is the electrical impulse on thecase that activates the meter.“Charge” shows not only that an area has something in it. It also shows that the pc haspossible reality on it.A pc can have a broken leg, yet it might not read on a meter. It would be charged butbelow the pc’s reality. So it won’t read.THINGS THAT DON’T READ WON’T RUN.The Case Supervisor always counts on the AUDITOR to test Questions and Items forread before running them.The auditor, when a Question or Item doesn’t read, can and should always put in“Suppress” and “Invalidate”. “On this (Question) (Item), has anything been Suppressed?” “Onthis (Question) (Item), has anything been Invalidated?” If either one read, the question or itemwill also read. The Case Supervisor also counts on the AUDITOR to use Suppress andInvalidate on a Question or Item. If after this there is still no read on the Question or Item,that’s it. Don’t use it, don’t list it. Go to the next action on the C/S or end off.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:dz.ka.rdCopyright © 1970by L. Ron HubbardALL RIGHTS RESERVED"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"THE PRIOR CONFUSIONA lecture given on3 October 1961Thank you.Okay. This is one of those days. What’s the date? 3rd of October?Audience: That’s right. Yes.And my watch stopped last night. How would I know? And 1961. Special Briefing Course,Saint Hill.Now, Suzie has been giving you an explanation up here as to the prior confusion. And I’dbetter give you some material on this and some other things. I could give you a lecture on abrand-new series of discoveries, but you haven’t caught up with these. I’ll mention these inpassing just to get them as a matter of record, however. There is a great deal to be known aboutmutual motion. Mutual motion is a terribly interesting subject. It’s the motion of two generatingsources. This has something to do with problems. And mutual motion runs with great rapidity,and so on. There’s a lot more about that, but I just wanted to get this little slight note on record.You’re interested in the prior confusion, the hidden standard, because this puts into your handswhat the hakim, the witch doctor, the bone rattler, the medical doctor, and all such ilk havebeen trying to do something with here, now, for a good many thousands of years. This putssomething into your hands. And if you grasp this, you’ve grasped something. And if youhaven’t grasped it, you’re stuck in one.Chronic somatic is a stuck moment on a time track which is the stable datum of a priorconfusion. A hidden standard is the stable datum of a prior confusion. Prior confusion.Now, in trying to explain this to you, you take a look at a chronic somatic, you try to look atthe prior confusion and you swing back up into the chronic somatic again, and you don’t evenknow that you looked at the prior confusion. This is a very, very easy one to forget. It’s a veryeasy one to slip on because it is, actually, the basic anatomy of how pictures and illnesses andconcepts of one kind or another get very, very stuck.The way they get stuck is the confusion and the stable datum. Now, that confusion and thestable datum has been known to us for mans! many years. And what we’ve done to it is addtime to the span. The confusion is in one place and the stable datum at a later place. So in alltime-track plotting. you get the confusion, and then you get, after that, the stable datum. Soactually, they’re linear in time. In other words, you don’t have the stable datum and theconfusion occurring necessarily—and certainly not very aberratedly—you don’t have these twothings occurring simultaneously in time. In other words, the stable datum and the confusion donot occur in time, if they’re going to become aberrative, which is the same time—you don’thave the stable datum and the confusion in the same instant of time.Now, by that we mean twelve o’clock, second of October 1961: There’s a confusion while aperson is sitting at a table. Well, the confusion doesn’t make the person necessarily sit moresolidly at the table. That’s not the kind of stuck that we’re mixed up with.This is the way we get the person if the person is going to be stuck at the table: At eleveno’clock there was a hell of a confusion, and the person had an upset and had an upset stomachat twelve o’clock, and sat down in the table— at the table to ease their upset stomach, andsomehow or another it didn’t ease.Well, there was no confusion at twelve o’clock. The confusion was at eleven o’clock, just an"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"hour before. Do you see this now?In other words, the confusion is at an earlier instant of time than the stable datum that theperson adopted afterwards. But we find that the stable datum which is adopted afterwards is thesticker. Of course, you can always adopt a stable datum in the middle of a confusion. This is it.But that isn’t the one that sticks. The one that sticks is where you have a stable datum adoptedafter the fact of the confusion.The United States goes to war with Japan; nothing much occurs as a result of the war, perhaps.And then we all of a sudden have President Eisenhower talking about loss of face. Well, it’svery interesting to have an American president use a Japanese term.We give the Wehrmacht a hell of a shellacking, and during the war nobody is being theWehrmacht, that’s for sure. The 88s are going on one side and the 22s are going on the otherside, and we have a good, solid, flat-out, knock-down-drag-out war. And nothing happensduring this period of time that is at all upsetting, except people getting killed and buildingsblown down, and so forth. But everybody is too interested to have any stable data to amount toanything.And then after the war, there’s a discussion about “should American troops goose-step?” Therewas, you know? Now we add in World War I to it and we find American troops wearingGerman helmets. It’s fascinating. This gets more and more fascinating.Now, we can understand the Confederacy all wearing Federal uniforms during the Civil War,because they didn’t have any but there were lots of Federal dead to take them off of. Thatwasn’t much of a stable datum. But today we find the Confederacy is very stuck in theConfederacy.Now, we think that something happened, like the assassination of Lincoln or something, andall of this. Well, we certainly know all about Lincoln’s assassination. Well, how about a lot ofthe other people who got assassinated by bullets in that war? You see, we’re not worried aboutthem. That stable datum isn’t sticking, but something that happened after the action is stickinglike mad.This is a peculiarity, and it’s not necessarily sensible. It doesn’t necessarily follow any logic;this is an empirical fact. By empirical fact I mean one that is established by observation, notestablished by theory or reason. This is true only because it’s observed to be true.Now, you can develop a lot of theories about why water doesn’t flow uphill. There could belots of theories developed about it, but you stand alongside of a river, and then you go findanother river, and then you go find another river, and then you go find another river, and youobserve all of these rivers, and you find out finally that the common denominator of all riverswas that water was flowing downhill. The points downstream are at less altitude than the pointsupstream. And we establish the fact, then, that water flows downhill. We don’t have to havethe theory of gravity; we don’t have to have any other theory connected with it at all. All wehave to have is the observation that all rivers we are able to contact are flowing downhill.That’s an empirical datum.All right. Now, this “prior confusion” is an empirical datum, and that is all it is. It’s empirical.It’s just observed that this is the case: that the person is not stuck in the marriage that they arecomplaining about but are stuck in the marriage because of the confusion that existed before themarriage; they’re not stuck in the marriage because of the confusion of the marriage.Now, you’ve always been assuming that the marriage got stuck because of the confusion of themarriage. All right. Now let’s get down to workability Solid, sound workability. How manymarriages have you squared sup by knocking all the confusion out of the marriage? Well, it’ssort of a lot of little failed lines on that. We’ve straightened up a lot about marriages, and soforth, by knocking out their confusion. We’ve done a lot about marriages by knocking out the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"confusion of the marriage. But the reason we couldn’t do it rapidly, and the reason we gotbored stiff trying to do something about it, is if a person is stuck on the subject of a marriage,the reason they are stuck has nothing to do with that period of time but has to do with the priorperiod of time that predated the marriage. And if you free up that prior period of time to themarriage, the difficulties of the marriage blow. Now, this is an empirical oddity, an oddity ofmagnitude.We’ve got somebody who has got to have their liver operated on; something wrong with theirliver. We find them stuck in an operation on a liver. They’ve got to have another operation on aliver. They know it’s their liver. Their attention is stuck solidly on the liver, and so we goahead and process the liver, but we never find the basic-basic on the chain of when theirattention got stuck on the liver.When did their attention get stuck on the liver? Actually, it got stuck on the liver immediatelyafter a confusion. Immediately after a confusion. So the way to blow this operation on the liveris to blow the confusion which preceded the difficulty with the liver. It’s so peculiar. It’ssufficiently peculiar that this occurs when you try to learn it: You immediately think of yourown chronic somatic. You try to swing your attention before you had the chronic somatic, andyou wind up with the chronic somatic. And you say, “Well, there is the chronic somatic, and ofcourse, that is all there is to it.”And then one tells you again right away, “Now look. Let’s look before you had that chronicsomatic.”And you say, “Yes. Chronic somatic.” It’s just as though we’re trying to put your attention ontop of a spring. And as you put your attention on the spring, it rebounds, and blows you backinto the chronic somatic, do you see? And your attention just doesn’t go on to the priorconfusion. It’s quite remarkable.You say to somebody, “All right”—you’ll do this as an auditor, now, many times. You’ll say,“Put your attention now on the period”—or “What happened,” you say in some otherfashion—”What happened just before you got all upset with this marriage?”And they say, “Well, I got all upset with the marriage.”And you say, “Well, what happened just before you met this person and so forth?”“Oh, well, just before I met this person, um... Uh, yeah, well, we certainly had a hell of a timein that marriage.”And you say, “Well now, look-a-here. We’re talking about just before you met the person.What was the date before you met the person?”Well, they’re liable to do something like “Well, I had an awful lot of trouble when I was a littlechild.”You say, “Yeah. But just before this marriage. Just before the marriage.” And they say, “Yeah.Well, I had an awful lot of trouble in that marriage.” What’s happening is, is the PC’s attentionbounces to later periods of time. Chronic somatics are always the result and solution of anunconfrontable disturbance which occurred immediately before them. Hidden standards andpresent time problems are always the result of a confusion which immediately preceded thedifficulty. And when you get the PC to put his attention on the confusion, you are asking himto do what he couldn’t do, and why he pinned his attention just after the confusion. You see?He looks at the confusion, and then his attention, without his recognizing anything, bouncesstraight into the stable datum.Man has a broken leg. And this broken leg has just been going on and on and on for years andyears and years. He doesn’t recognize it as a broken leg. The medicos say it’s a “tibiosis of the"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"filamoriasis,’’ and that he’s suffering from a decay of the tendon.Well, he busted his leg sometime or another. Let’s get it down to simple language us folks canunderstand, and—you see, if you don’t know anything about a subject, you can get awfullyfancy. As a matter of fact, the more fanciness and the more oddball opinion and crosscurrent ofopinion you find in a subject, you can assume that that is in direct relation to the amount knownabout the subject.The more confusion in the subject, the more crisscross, the more learnedness, the morepretended knowingness there is in the subject, the less is actually known about it. You can get aterribly complicated idea about life and the mind from fields where it isn’t known. Youunderstand? There’s a lot of invented, pretended knowingness on the thing. For instance, Idon’t know how many medical terms there are for a leg, and yet this leg won’t heal, and theycan’t make it heal fast, but they can sure call it by lots of names and have lots of opinions on it,don’t you see?Well, they’re sort of bouncing off the confusion. All right. So the person has got a busted leg.Well, the leg should have healed up in five or six weeks and that should have been all there wasto it, and that’s it—finished. But it isn’t. Seven years later, like the children’s doctor, thefellow is still limping—I think two years ago.He kids me every time he sees me. You know, he comes in limp, limp— masking the limpvery consciously as soon as he’s on the premises, trying very hard not to limp. He was in askiing accident 8 couple of years ago, and I told him I was going to process him, and it scaredhim within an inch of his life. And so he always has some kidding remark to make to me whenhe comes in to look at the children’s tongues about whether or not I’m going to process him.But look, it’s been two years and he’s still limping. Ah, well, then this isn’t just a skiingaccident, because there’s nothing really in bad shape about the bones. They were all puttogether by the very best orthopedic surgeons. He had the best of care; he’s a doctor.So what must have happened? Well, he busted his leg in a skiing accident. And two years laterit has yet to heal, really. Oh, well, the bones are grown together and it isn’t bleeding anymore,but it isn’t operating. All right. Now let’s take a look at that.Was it the instant of the accident? Ah, well, we know more about the mind than they do.We know very well that before some fellow does a practiced action . . . If he’s in a smoothframe of mind, he’s used to doing this action, he goes down the slope and slaloms like mad,and everything is just dandy, and he winds up at the bottom upright and saying “Whee!”But if a fellow is in a disturbed frame of mind, and his attention is on many other things—hejust received a letter from his wife or his girl saying, “Well, I’ve just gone out again with Pete,”don’t you see? And there’s nothing he can do anything to but himself. He can’t do anything toanybody but himself. There’s nobody else around or he’s powerless or something like that.Then this practiced skier starts at the top of the slope, and he goes halfway down and he says,“This is a good place,” and wraps himself around a tree.Then they put him pathetically in the hospital and bring him home by ambulance plane and soon, and it goes on for years, don’t you see?So the high probability is that the accident had nothing to do with the motions of skiing. Skiingprobably has nothing to do with the confusion which resulted in a broken leg, mentally.Because we have to ask the question, how did he get himself bunged up, and why?Now, a fellow doesn’t get himself bunged up by accident. See, it’s not by accident. That’s thefirst thing you have to recognize—that there’s some kind of a postulate in there to bung himselfup. And he’ll manage it every time."},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"All right. So this medico: all right, we ask him, “Now, what happened just before you brokeyour leg?”And he’ll say, “Well, the snow was flying all around, and the wind was going whee, and . . .and so forth. And then there was this condemned Switzerland pine tree, and it pulled itself upby the roots and moved over in the middle of the ski track.”And you say, “Good.”And we keep on running this. And at the end of many hours, we actually do get the thing toremove to a marked degree. We get an abatement of the chronic somatic. Yes, we can do that.We have done that many times.Well, how would you like to see that chronic somatic vanish? Well, that would be a muchbetter procedure and much faster than that. Ah, well, we’d have to find out what went onbefore he went skiing that day.Well, he was on vacation, we know, and we know that he felt he needed a vacation. Why didhe feel he needed a vacation? An odd thing to need (me particularly, I never get one, so I don’tdare need one!). He needed a vacation. Well, what was the randomity that preceded that? Whatwas his mail like while he was on vacation? Let’s search in this area. Let’s find out anywherein the last six months what had been going on. And all of a sudden we wind up with thedamnedest, knockdown-drag-out confusion. If it was enough to make him break his leg, it willbe sufficient to bar out his inspection of it. And at first he won’t be able to inspect the priorconfusion.It takes an auditor sitting across from him to chonk his attention into that period and do anassessment of it. And all of a sudden he finds out that he thought the broken leg happened lastyear, when it happened two years ago. And he’s completely forgotten that he broke the sameleg when he was five; and all kinds of oddball forgettingnesses turn up.Now, what causes forgettingness? It’s the inability to confront a motion. The inability toconfront a motion brings about an occlusion of that area of time. Now, you’ve got postulate—the first-, second-, third-, fourth-postulate theory. The first postulate is not-know. The secondpostulate is know.All right. So you’ve got a big not-know, you see? He had a big lot of mysteries and a lot ofconfusion’s he couldn’t confront, and nothing he could do anything about of any kindwhatsoever, and he got himself a “know” which immediately succeeded it in time. In otherwords, this not-know area, this confusion area, is followed by a know area later in time. Now,this is quite interesting because he follows a not-know by a know, and the know might be quitestupid, and it might be quite painful, and it might be quite destructive, but nevertheless it’s aknowingness. Some fellow who is gimping around with a bad leg certainly knows something:He knows he’s got a bad leg.You might say all psychosomatics and hidden standards are cures for mystery. They givethemself a knowingness, following a period of not-knowingness.Now, people can get stuck in relief, and very often when your PC feels better, he will feelbetter momentarily and quite artificially and not feel better at all. Now, for instance, supposingwe were all sitting here and we heard a high whine and a dull thud out in the park, and anairplane full of screaming passengers had apparently just crashed, you know, and we couldhear the whole works, sitting here. And so we in a big flurry crowd out the door and rushoutside to see this airplane that’s crashed, and so on. And it’s just Peter left one of his recordplayers on.See? Quite a feeling of relief, but the relief followed a period of confusion. Now, I’m not"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"saying this is very aberrative. This would be so light that it’s very easy to face indeed. Then,you see, we’d have a little period of relief, and it actually would stick slightly on the track. See,it’s a period of relief. It’s a period of know.Now, you see, at the moment we heard it crash, we didn’t know what was happening, sowe’ve got a not-know. And then we go out and we find out what happened, we find outnothing happened and that it’s all all right, so we know. You get this. This is just in vignette.What I’m talking about is not at all aberrative. It takes much greater volume of magnitude tomake one of these things.All right. Now, let’s go into what Mary Sue was showing you here just before I came in. Andwe have ourselves a period there, which we see as a big, white chalk mark up at the top, andthen there’s a little chalk mark down the line, and we’ve got a vertical time track here; and it’sgot a big blob of white chalk at the up part, and a little blob, and then below that a big blob, andthen below that a little blob, and some more little blobs. All right. Now, I’m not making fun ofher cartooning here. But anyway, taking a look at this now, we see the time track plots linearly.Now, she’s got herself plotted from a zero at the top to 1961 at the bottom. Well, all right.We’ll take it that way because time tracks don’t run in any direction. All right.Now, we take that little tiny, last, bottom white blob, and that’s a chronic somatic. The personhas a chest wheeze, and every time you process them, they look at their chest to find out ifthey’re still wheezing. And they know the auditing command worked because the wheeze isless, or they think the auditing command didn’t work because the wheeze is more. This is howthey know, you see? This is how they know. Well, isn’t it interesting that this know wouldoccur in connection with a chronic somatic?Now, a person must have a hell of an avidity for knowingness if they have to find out if theirback is still broke or their chest is still caved in or if their rib cage is squashed. What kind ofknowingness is this? Well, it must have followed one God-awful confusion, man. If that’s theacceptable level of knowingness—wow!—what must have happened before that? So we takethis PC, and we say to this PC, pointing to that last white blob there, “yell, what was going onin your life immediately before you noticed this difficulty with your chest?”And your first, usual, immediate response, if this is a hot subject, is “Well, my chest hasalways hurt me.” It’ll be something “intelligible” like this.They haven’t answered the question at all. You say, “No, no, no. Just before you noticedthis—before you noticed this—what happened in your life?”And they say, “Well, um . . . I don’t know.”That’s right. There you got it hot. That’s hot and heavy. And, boy, they never—they neverspake more sooth than that. They were spaking sooth with all front teeth. They didn’t know,that’s for sure, or they wouldn’t have this chest difficulty. All right.So we punch it a little harder—you see, it’s the auditor compelling the PC’s attention into thatarea—and we say, “Well, when did it turn on? What period of time was it when it turned on?”“Well,” he said, “well, it must have been—must have been the summer of ‘59 or somethinglike that. I know I had it then.”You see, they haven’t said anything “before” yet, you see? They know they had it in thesummer of ‘59. You say, “Now, that’s good. Now, just what happened just before thesummer of ‘59?”“Well, I had it in the spring of ‘59 too.”See, they haven’t answered your question yet, you know? All right. But you see what’s"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"happening here? You’re plowing their attention back toward an unconfrontable area. So yousay, “Well, all right. What happened before that? Well, what was going on before you noticedthis chest somatic and so forth?”And they say, “Well . . . Oh, well, uh . . . yeah, well, it uh . . .” (And we notice this littleupper white blob here, see?) They say, “Yeah, well, it turned off for a long time.” Haven’tanswered your question yet. See, it’s off from the first white blob to the second white blob,see? Well, it’s off.“Yeah. Well, I wasn’t troubled with it then, and uh . . . I remember—oh, Yes! Yes, that’sright. I recall in ‘56, I had medical treatment for this” See, they’ve told you nothing about“before” yet. But they’ve got it stretched back in time. And then all of a sudden they’ll come upand say, “Well, let’s see, ‘56.” (And we’ll call that earlier blob there 1956.) They’ll say, “Well,let’s see.”You say, “What were you doing in ‘56?”“Well, I . . . ‘55. That was when I was down at camp in Cornwall. No. No, no, no. Come tothink about it, that was ‘52.” And they’re liable to come up with the adjudication that they don’tknow what happened from 1952 to 1956. This is a curious blank period. And they figure it allout, and they say, well, it must have been this and it must have been that, and it might havebeen this and might have been that. And then all of a sudden they say, “Well, the truth of thematter is, I was . . . Well, I’m not sure. I’m not sure. But do you know, I had this when I wasa child?”See, way back now. Way, way back. Boom!“Yes, I had this when I was a child. They thought that I had consumption and so forth, and I—actually I hadn’t remembered that, but I had a lot of consumption, and I remember 1 was livingwith my grandmother, and so forth. And uh . . . they—they had me to the doctor a lot of times,and that sort of thing. And I just had overlooked this fact.”Now we’re up at the first white blob up there, see?You say, “Well, what happened just before you were living with your grandmother?”“Well, I wouldn’t know. I was awfully young. I was eleven.”“Well, yeah. Well, where were your parents at that time?”“Well, let’s see.”And brother, we’ve got another blank spot, and we’ve got a nice, big, juicy blank spot. Now,we keep plowing into this blank spot, and we finally find out that Mother and Father hadagreed to separate just before this, and there had been a lot of domestic difficulties, and wethink we’ve got it now, and we’re trying to really pin it down. We think we’ve got it. And theywere trying to separate, and this was happening, and that was happening; it was all veryclouded up, and it was all very this and that. And we’re just about to get a touching short storyabout this whole thing, when suddenly the PC remembers that he burned down the house.And that will be the end of that chronic somatic. Just by assessment only. See? That’s just byassessment. But your assessment is, doggedly, to find out what happened before they noticedthis.Now, perhaps it’s a bad thing to say “for the first time” because this is always a lie. One of thestable data of auditing is always make your auditing question as truthful and as factual aspossible. Don’t make auditing questions that are nonfactual. So you say, “Well, what is thefirst time you remembered this?” or “What is the first time you noticed this?” Of course the PC"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"cannot answer this because he’s going to give you fifty more first times after he’s given you thefirst time. So it’s much cleverer to say, “What is a time that you noticed this? When did younotice this? What happened before you noticed this?” And then just keep chugging it in.Now, it’s not a repetitive command, and this is actually getting rid of chronic somatics byassessment. If you are very clever at assessing, you can just go on and assess and assess andassess, and you finally find out the confusion; and you pin the confusion down to such adegree that you’ve made the PC confront the confusion, the confusion will as-is. Right there.Bang! And everything else will blow after it, and that is it. You can do it by assessment onlywith an E-Meter. That requires a rather clever auditor to do the whole job by assessment only.Now, here’s an easier way to do it. We finally spot the area of confusion by assessment, andthen we put together Security Checks to fit that area. We find out that this person had this whenthey were eleven: Well, it’s some kind of a childhood activity that is all messed up. Well, youcan actually take the Child’s Security Check, and bend it around one way or the other, questionby question, and add your own questions to it, and so on; and you’re going to get yourselfsome interesting data that this PC has never seen before.And you’re going to blow out those zones of confusion, and you’re going to find thedissipation of the hidden standard of the chronic somatic. That is a more standardized methodof going about one of these things.All right. Let’s take another example. This girl finds that she has headaches. She finds she haslots of headaches. And in auditing, she’s always sort of aware of this headache. And sheknows the auditing process is working because the headache turns on or turns off, and ifnothing affects the headache, she of course doesn’t think the auditing process is working.That’s her hidden standard—that by which she finds out whether or not auditing is working.That is the definition of a hidden standard.Well, naturally, your rudiments are out as long as the PC has this condition. Why? Well, thePC is via-ing the auditing command.Now, in all cases where a PC is not making progress on Routine 3, you can bet your bottompeseta that the PC has not and is not doing the auditing command. They might be doing theauditing command plus, plus, plus, see, or they might not be doing it at all.I do remember back in Wichita, long, long ago, a PC coming around to me after a twenty-fivehour intensive and bragging to me that they had succeeded in not answering an auditingcommand once, and they thought this was awfully clever of them. Yes sir, the PC was reallybragging about it. What was the matter with the auditor that he didn’t find it out?Now, here is the more usual thing: The PC does the auditing command and applies it to acertain area of the mind or body in order to find out if it has affected something else. And theydo the auditing command by applying the auditing command to something in the mind, andthen they look over here to see what is going on and if anything happened. And they do thiscontinually. They’re not just doing the auditing command. They are doing something else.Now, they know they did the auditing command right or they know they did it wrong, or theyknow the command is right or wrong, in direct comparison to how much happens to alleviatethis difficulty.You are auditing a PC who has an attention fixed, not on the bank in general but on someparticular, peculiar activity. And they’re doing something peculiar with every auditingcommand. You feed them the auditing command, they do something peculiar with it. Eventhough they verbally answer it and so on, and apparently have executed it, they do somethingelse with it.And when a PC is not making progress, you can say his attention is stuck someplace. Well,that’s a shortened form of saying the rudiments are out. One of the rudiments are out. The PC"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"is not really in session. The PC is on auto. The PC is not under the auditing control, the PC isunder his own control. He’s under his own control to this degree: You say something, then thePC takes over as auditor and executes the auditing command, and then gives the session backto you. And you ask the next question, and when you ask the question, then the PC takes theauditing command, goes on auto, audits the auditing command on himself and then gives theauditing session back to you. Have you got the idea? And the PC, during the entire period ofexecution of the auditing command, is not in session. Any PC who hasn’t gone Clear in 150hours is doing it. PC has got a hidden standard.What is this hidden standard? Maybe he’s got six hidden standards. Well, every one of thosehidden standards is totally this stable datum stuck after the fact of the confusion. They all havethe same anatomy. PC takes the session away from you, does the auditing command, finds outwhether or not it moves this electronic, then sees whether or not the electronic is affectingwhether or not he’s a boy or a girl.That’s right. That was how we moved into this, with just that action on the part of a PC. Weknew about this for a long time, but we’ve never really seen it in action to this flagrant degree.This PC had been audited for about a thousand hours, and had applied every single auditingcommand ever given to the PC to the resolution of an electronic incident which the PC wasconvinced, if it were run out, he would turn from a man to a woman. Thousand hours—noprogress. Well, why? The PC was never in session.So the rudiments are out. The basic rudiment that is out is present time problem of longduration, where you have a hidden standard.All right. Very good. Now if we take ourselves a PC, and we audit along with Routine 3, wecan find the PC’s goal, we can find the PC’s terminal; oh, yes, with some difficulty, but wecan find them in relatively short order, certainly under twenty-five hours of auditing, if we’rereally in there. We keep the most flagrant rudiments in, don’t you see? But we haven’t noticedthis hidden standard yet. Now—and then we assess the PC on the Prehav Scale, and we runthe PC on the Prehav Scale, and we run the PC and we run the PC and we run the PC andnothing happens. Well, there’s where it’ll show up.See, we can do the action of finding a goal, because the PC’s attentions are very, very solidlyon goals. We can certainly find the action of a terminal, we can find this terminal, because weactually haven’t really asked the PC to do an auditing command. It’s all between you and themeter, see? We can find the assessed level of the Prehav Scale very easily, but now we go intothe repetitive auditing command and the PC goes on auto.Why does the PC go on auto? Well, the PC has got a hidden standard. The PC is auditinghimself on making his nose well. PC is not running—not at all running—the terminal of arailroad engineer. He’s running a nose. And so he doesn’t go Clear.Now, very often, in worse cases, the PC will be very resistive toward an auditor’s inquiringquestions. The auditor says, “What are you doing? What did you do with that auditingcommand?” You’ve all of a sudden got a knockdown-drag-out fight on y our hands. PC doesnot like you inquiring into it.The first time you ever notice anything like that, you say to yourself, “This PC has a hiddenstandard. Let’s find out what it is.”Now, although you can find the person’s goal, terminal and level, you actually can’t run thePC on that in the presence of hidden standards. It is a waste of time.Now, there’s one earlier action that can be taken with the PC, that the PC will do and that willproduce results. But there is only one earlier action can be taken before a Routine 3 assessment,and that is a Security Check. This can be done without knowing the PC’s terminal and will"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"produce lasting, excellent results. There is no other process—now we have all the facts in overthe years—will produce easy and lasting gains on a PC. No other process will produce easy,good, solid, lasting, positive gains on a PC. You have a Security Check and you’ve got theassessment and you’ve got the running of the assessment.So, this leaves us with a Security Check as a very powerful auditing weapon, because it willoperate whether you’re running the goals terminal or not. The Security Check will operate, andthose gains you make with a Security Check will be lasting gains.Hence, we divide up auditors into: Class I—run any process on which they have a certainty.This will probably be some kind of a control process, by the way. It’ll be some cousin to theCCHs, if the auditor is wise, because that at least works out the control factors of the PC, andyou do make a sort of gain. You’re running in order, and something is going to happen withthis PC, and it doesn’t come under the heading, however, of a fast, easy gain. It is not a fast,easy gain. It is a lasting gain, but it is a hard, long gain, and that’s all you can say for it. That’sthe CCHs, SCS—all these various things. They are long, hard, arduous things to handle, andthey do produce a lasting gain, but at what cost! So it doesn’t come under the heading of a nice,easy, stable gain achieved by the auditor at all.But Class I auditors had better be employed, even though it is very hard to achieve a long,lasting proposition. No matter how arduously, they had better be put to work doing someauditing, because any auditing is better than no auditing, and this type of gain will be quitebeneficial in the long run, and so forth. And this argues that a Class I auditor is doingsomething, as long as he’s doing one of these types of processes.All right. We move up to Class II auditor, and a Class II auditor can security check. All right.Security Checking produces a lasting gain, and it is very easy. It is very easy to do. It is verynice. It is very, very fast, and it is a lasting result. So we have the Class II auditor doingSecurity Checks. And actually when we’re talking about the hidden standard, and that sort ofthing, we can envision that a Class II auditor would have set up a PC on the basis of havinggotten rid of all of his hidden standards, and that’s what we look Go a Class II auditor to do,not just to sit there and prate off a Sec Check 3.We’re asking him to do something else. We’re asking him to Sec Check in the direction ofgetting rid of all of the stuck points in this lifetime. We’re asking him to get rid of theconfusions of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth marriages. We’re asking all of the. . . We’re asking him to get rid of that crooked neck. We’re asking him to get rid of the oddhabit he has that every time you say something to him he goes drvvvvvkh! It seems rather oddthis person would do that, you know? Because you haven’t asked him to smell a thing.In other words, these things all surrender to Security Checking. All of them, now, the lot. Butwhat kind of Security Checking does it take? Well, it takes a standard Security Check. That isalways a good thing to bang into a case. The first and foremost thing you do. That’s a goodthing—just go on and pick out the probable Security Check.Let’s take an old-time auditor, he’s been knocking around and into God knows what. Well, thefirst Security Check we want to shove into him is the last two pages of a Sec 3, plus Sec Check6. There’s no reason to do the first many, many pages of 3 or do anything very fancy, becausehe’s not going to get any benefit of something that he has overts on, and so on. So let’s get thatout of the road.And now having done this, let us get clever and apply this data about the stable datum and theprior confusion. Now, this is different than the stable datum and the confusion—the idea thatwe get all of the stable—we get all the confusions off the case and we will of course knock outat once all of the person’s activities, and so forth. No, that isn’t quite true. We have to knockthem out selectively—has to be very selective.So after you got the last two pages of a Form 3 and all of a 6 done, you should roll up your"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"sleeves at about that point, and let’s go for the hidden standards. Let’s find out if there isanything by which this person measures gain or no gain.“What would have to happen for you to know that Scientology works?” that’s the cluequestion.And you get these things, and sometimes these things are detached things. Sometime thesethings are “Well, my mother would have to get well.” Well, he doesn’t really mean—perhapshe does, but he really, probably, doesn’t mean—that his mother would have to be sold onScientology and brought to an auditor. No. The auditing command which he is doing, ifapplied to himself, would have to cure his mother. You see, he often means that, too. So thisidea, this—he says, “Well, my mother would have to get well.” Well, this is marvelous. Itmeans his mother is a stuck . . . a stuck chronic somatic.Now, the way you would have handled this in the past—the way you would have handled thisin the past—is not the fastest way to handle it. You could have handled it in the past, and itwould have worked out all right in the past, but that is not the fastest way to handle it. I’m justgiving you a much faster method.When did this occur that Mother became a stable datum? And what confusion preceded it?Ahhh. In other words, we don’t run O/W on Mama, and we don’t security check Mama, andwe don’t have very much to do with Mama. We want to find out what happened before Mamabecame a chronic somatic. Because Mama is a stable datum for a confusion before the fact ofaccepting Mama as a stable datum. There’s some confusion prior. Remember, it’s alwaysprior.Let’s reorient your thinking on this. Now, the fellow says, “Well, uhhh . . . I just have to getover hating my father. That’s what would have to happen. Yes, sir. To know Scientologyworked, I’d have to get over hating my father.”“Well,” you say, “that’s good.” So obviously you can do something about that. You do aSecurity Check about his father. That’s obvious, isn’t it? This is past thinking on it. And youget all of his overts against his father, and all of his withholds from his father, and you clean upFather. And what do you know? You could do it, I mean, you could have gotten a long way inthis direction .Ah-ha, there’s a much faster method. Let’s find out what happened before “hating Father”became his stable data in life. “Hating Father” must be an activity he can confront, as a retreatfrom earlier activities he can’t confront. And they probably have nothing to do with his father.Hatred of Father was much more acceptable to him than the tremendous confusion he hadwith— who knows? Probably not Father. Who knows who it is? Lord knows.So, what do you do? You assess. And you find the area of prior confusion to the hatred ofFather. Now, at first the PC is going to tell you it’s something that Father did, and it’ssomething that had to do with Father. But remember, it can’t have anything to do with Father ifFather is the stuck somatic. Can’t have anything to do with Father, you see, if Father is thestuck personnel. If Father is the broken leg on this case, it hasn’t anything to do with Father,because he can confront Father. Well, if he can confront Father and he’s spent all these yearsconfronting Father and so forth—it hasn’t got him well— why do you, in an auditing session,put in more hours confronting Father? Waste of time, see?No, let’s find out what happened before this occurred. So you’d want to know, “When did younotice that you hated your father, and what happened before that?”First answer, well, inevitably, “My father did this, my father did that.”And you say, “Good, fine.” Give him a cheery old acknowledgment and then find out whathappened before that with other people. Oh, you find out his old man hasn’t been anybody—"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"man, his old man has been nobody in this fellow’s life. There is some kind of a person on abroomstick that has been flying around in this person’s belfry.You know, as a child, why, this person would see—well, maybe it was his father’s mother orsomething, you know? And the child would see her sitting there quietly knitting and rocking inthe rocking chair or something, and he absolutely just couldn’t resist, you see, spilling the caton her, or you know, or pulling up the ball of yarn, or somehow or another stealing all of thebread dough, or putting salt in the plum pudding—just anything, see, anything. And you’llfind that these are overts, but they won’t come through that way at all.He will finally recover the character on the broomstick, see? Total occlusion. Recover thischaracter on the broomstick, and you will try to do a Security Check on this, and “She beat meand she socked me and she used to hold me over the well and say she was going to drop me . ..” And he’ll just go motivator, motivator, motivator, motivator, motivator, see? Of course.Why? Because he can observe the inflow, but he can’t observe his outflow.Yeah, but what did he do? That’s what’s getting interesting here. What did he do? Did he stealher broom? Because you’ll find inevitably that this is what happened. So you make up somekind of a roster of the personnel involved prior to the stuck personnel. And you make a rosterof the “missing persons bureau.” And your little list is a “missing persons bureau.” And boy,you’re really going to find missing people. PC doesn’t even know they exist. There’s going tobe sections out of his life he don’t know are gone.And you’re going to find those sections and find out who is in them and then write up aSecurity Check, any old kind of a Security Check, to find out what he did to them—these otherpeople, not Father. Skip Father; he was a confrontable character. Why bother with Father? Justa waste of time. That’s what the PC is complaining about.Now, whatever the PC complains about, do something earlier. There is your stable datum.Whatever the PC complains about, you do something earlier. And don’t pay any attention tohandling the object about which he is complaining. You pay attention to his complaint. But ifyou continue to handle the object about which he’s complaining, such as his big ears, why,you’re not going to get anyplace. He’s complaining about big ears. “Well, I’m seeing . . .Every time I . . .” You find out every time he answers an auditing command that he finds out ifhis ears shrunk.You find stuff weird like this, man. Well, did his ears shrink? Okay. “When is the first timeyou ever notice”—that would be wrong. “Now, when did you notice that you had big ears?When did you notice this?”“Oh, well, I have had big ears for some time,” you see? That’s your inevitable reply.Now, if you get a reply of this character which is a non sequitur, you know you are on to a hotarea of disturbance, because the PC’s attention went onto it, and then flick!—came right up thetrack to the big ears. Your effort to put his attention on the area of confusion results in puttinghis area Attention] on the object. Whenever you try to put his area [attention] on the confusion,and then you only succeed in putting his area—attention on the object, you know you’ve got itmade. You know you’re looking at one God-awful area of occlusion.You say to him, “When did you first notice that you had big ears? Now, what happened beforeyou first noticed you had big ears?” Any such question.And he says, “Well, I’ve just worried about it for years—my big ears.”Well, now, you see the mechanism at work? You asked him about a time before “big ears,” andhe answered “big ears.” So it’s obvious that his attention deflected from the area you tried toput his attention on. You have located a hidden springboard. He doesn’t know it’s there, butyou now do. He coasts right up the track to it. Every time you put that hull in the water it goes"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"straight to that particular dock with a crash. It won’t head out to sea It won’t go anyplace, yousee? You just put it in the water, and it hits this dock. “Father” or “ears” or something, see?Bang! And there it is.You say, “Well, now in your—in your early life, what went on there? What went on in yourearly life?”Now, this would be just asking for a whole bunch of balderdash. Now, it would take an awfullot of millions of words for the PC to tell you every single, horrible thing that’s been done tohim in his early life. There’s no sense in having much of a synopsis on it. It’s up to the auditorto continue to direct the PC’s attention where he wants the PC’s attention directed, not to listento a recount—a blow-by-blow recount—of all the beatings the dock gave him. See, that’s silly,because that’s all he’s going to tell you.He hates his father—this is his hidden standard—he doesn’t feel better yet about his father, sonot feeling better yet about his father, he knows the auditing isn’t working. And you say,“Well, tell me about your early life.”So he says, “Well, my father . . . and he used to take me out in the woodshed, and then he didthis to me and he did that to me. And he did this and he did that, and my father this and myfather that.” Well, are you doing anything for this PC? No. No, you’re not doing anything forhim at all, because you’re leaving his attention stuck on a refuge.Any chronic somatic, any stuck personnel, anything of that nature is a refuge on which the PCcan put his attention. And you are not doing your job as an auditor unless you get his attentioneased over on to what makes him stick his attention on it. And you do that by a gradient scale,and the PC can get very restive if you jump your gradient too hard.So you say, “All right. Big ears. Now let’s see. What happened just before you noticed that, orwhen did you notice that you had big ears? Tell me a time you noticed you had big ears. What’ssome early period when you noticed that?”And the PC says, “Well, well, well, well, well, well . . . I was working in London for anattorney’s firm. I used to notice it.”“Good.” You say, “Is there any earlier time than that?”“Oh, well . . . no. In the attorney’s firm . . .”Oh, well, hell, you got his attention stuck there. And you say, “No, earlier—earlier than theattorney’s firm. What’d you do earlier than that?”“Oh. Oh, well, what did I do earlier than that? Uh . . . I don’t know! What did I do earlier?Let’s see now. I went to prep school, and then I went to college, and then—so on, and thatwas 1952. And I got out of there, and then ‘52 and then 1955 . . . 1955, and I went to work.Yes, it must have been ‘55 I went to work—I remember that, yes. It was ‘55. Went to workfor the attorney’s firm in 1955. And I got out of college in 1952.”“Oh good,” you say, “Well, what did you do between ‘52 and ‘55?”“I just don’t know. Now let’s see, what did I do? No, I—I met a girl. Ah, yes, I remembernow. I met a girl, and she . . . Uh, yeah. I met this girl and she had a boyfriend. And we hadan awful . . . No, that was ‘58. Let me see. No, no. I—I’ll get it in a minute. It’s 1952, 1955.Now, there’s a period of three years. Now, let’s see. After I got out of college, I must havegorse home for a little while. And then I must have done this, and then I must have done that,and I must have done something or other—probably. Yeah, I’m sure I must have donesomething like this, because, you see, you just wouldn’t ordinarily just go from college to anattorney’s firm"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"“Now, let me see. Oh, I know. I had an awful fight with a fellow. Yeah. Oh, that was prettyterrible. We met down in this bar, and he had some kind of a criticism of me one way or theother, and we had this hor ... No, that was ‘57. No, no. That wasn’t ‘55, that was ‘57.”And that’s the way he’ll go on. You understand? And you say, “Well, what happened in thisperiod of—anything that might have occurred between 1952 and 1955?”“Oh, uhh-uh, ruh, ruh, ruh, ruh-ruh, ruh, ruh-ruh. . .”“Well, did you ever think about big ears before 1952?”“No, no, no, no, no, I didn’t think about that before 1952,” and so forth.“Well, did you think about big ears after 1955?”“Well, yes. Oh, yes, oh, yes, all the time. Used to sit there at my desk with ink all over me,and I used to sometimes get it on my ears, and they used to call me ‘ink ears’ sometimes, andso on . . . That was probably it. Actually, the firm really hated me. And the senior partners . ..” this and that.And you say, “That’s good. Thanks! Good! Good! Good! Fine! Thank you! Thanks. Good.All right, now. Good. Now, we want ‘52 to ‘55. Now, who did you know in that period?”“Well, I must have known my father and mother.”“All right. Well, who introduced you to get work at the attorney’s firm?”“Uh . . . must have been some connection with my father.”And you know, you’re liable to find some damn-fool thing like a marriage? You’re liable to,man. You’re liable to find anything. But you will find something, and it’ll be a period there oftotal occlusion.What you’re trying to do is not necessarily solve the big mystery of it all. If you were veryclever, you could do the whole thing by assessment. On the meter, one of the ways you do itby assessment is “Well, ‘54: did you have a long vacation there after you left college? Was ittwo years? One year? Six months?”“Oh, I went to work, something of the sort. I was doing something. I’m sure I was doingsomething. I must have been doing something. Over a period of three years a young mandoesn’t do anything, you see? And I went up . . . I’m sure. Yes. Yeah. I’m absolutely sure.No.”You finally dredge up a name, Agnes. Ohhhh, Agnes. Ahhhh. All right. Now, in essence—asmuch as you can find out about Agnes—you just do it on an interrogation basis and assess“The worst confusion you ever had with Agnes. When is the worst time you ever had withAgnes?” and so forth. And this finally peters out and you find Agnes is just a red herring.She’s hardly a girl at all, and in actual fact it was Isabel.Isabel turns up along about this time, and now we have got a honey by the ear, and we find outthat she used to stand there constantly, and say what she said, and she used to do this and dothat, and she was the one who got him arrested. Arrested? ‘Where the hell did this come from?Don’t you see? We don’t find out, usually, anything about big ears. Agnes never said anythingabout big ears, nothing of this sort, but she went off with a boy who had big ears. And Isabel,Isabel, she went off with a boy who had big ears. Something stupid like this. So big ears got tobe something in here. And in some of the wild, devious way that all of a sudden works out andbecomes completely sensible, we find out how he wound up with a stable datum of big ears."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"This person says, “Well, I have a ball of light and it is just back of my eyeballs, and when theball of light glows, then I know the auditing question worked. And when it doesn’t glow, itdidn’t work.You want to find out “When did you notice this?” And then you want to find out whathappened before that. “Now, what happened before that?”And the person said, “I—well, I haven’t got the faintest idea. I’m . . . Let’s see, now. Whathappened before that?”And we run into some kind of a blank period. Then all of a sudden, marvel of marvels, we findout that between 1945 and 1948 the person was deeply immersed in the Temple of BlackMagic, someplace or another, and all this seems to have dropped out of sight. And what theydid, really, there, was “see the light.” And he’s been seeing the light ever since, but it was oneawful confusion. Because after the police raided the joint, you see . . . It wasn’t so much that,it was being sued for being the father of the child. That was what got him.But all of this has been fantastically occluded, you see? And all of these stable data that theperson has lead back to a prior unknown, and it’s just the not-know followed by the know. It’sthe confusion followed by the stillness. The confusion, then the stillness.All right. Now I’ll give you something I’ve got some kind of a reality on. It works like this:You find the bird . . . This works out on a broader track basis. You find this PC standing on arock in the middle of the sea waiting for somebody to pick him up. And he has this pain in hisstomach, and he had that pain in his stomach for many lifetimes. Many, many lifetimes he’shad the pain in his stomach.And you say, “All right. Let’s run this out.” So we run him standing on the rock in the middleof the sea. And we I guarantee you—we can run it and we can run it and we can run it and wecan run it and we can run it, and he will still have a pain in his stomach and still be standing ona rock in the middle of the sea. And this is the old engram that wouldn’t resolve.And this is why finding the earlier on the chain resolved the later engrams —the engrams thatwouldn’t erase: Because, of course, in finding the earlier engram you accidentally went acrossthe confusion, and you got the confusion knocked out. Well, there’s nothing precedes thatincident that’s hardly worth recounting except mutiny, shipwreck, sudden disaster, halfdrowning seven times, and there’s something kind of strange and spooky about the wholething. And then we finally find out that he’s standing on the rock without a body and hasn’tnoticed he’s dead. And this finally resolves the whole thing.Up to that time he knew all about it. But trying to get his attention immediately before theincident when this occurred will be one of the tougher jobs, because you say, “All right. Howdid you get on the rock?”And he says, “I was just standing there. Well, I must have gotten there some way. Uh . . . oh,I get a picture now of the surf. I must have come to the rock through the surf.”Well, any fool could tell that, man. He didn’t land there by helicopter, that’s for sure. But he’llmake these suppositional actions.Now, a person trying to do this, all by himself, begins after a while to appreciate an auditor,because his attention is pinned in a certain category.And as it tries to go back to areas that are unknown to him, it of course deflects onto thechronic somatics. So he tries to put his attention back on this and then comes up into thechronic somatic, and then he’s stuck with the chronic somatic; his attention is on it, so he startsauditing the chronic somatic, and he never does put his attention back on the earlier incident,"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"see? So he leaves himself stuck with chronic somatics.See, his attention goes back up, and he needs an auditor sitting there to tell him to put hisattention back again. You know? “What happened before that? What’s the worst kind of motionyou possibly could experience on a ship?”“Well, it wouldn’t be a ship. It’d be a submarine. I don’t know why I said that.”“Well, what’s the worse kind of motion you could experience on a ship?”“Well, being torpedoed by a submarine. Let’s see. Or torpedoing a ship by submarine? Beingtorpedoed by a submarine. Let’s see, torpedoing a ship or a ship torpedoing you? No, a shipwouldn’t torpedo you, you see? And the ship . . . It’s the worst kind of motion . . . worst kindof motion . . . Be standing on a rock waiting for a ship to come in.”You see exactly where the attention goes. Then he’ll get all interested in the thing. “Worst kindof motion. Let’s see. Well, what might have preceded that? Must be some kind of bad motion.”“What kind of a bad action could a person perform that that would pay for?” You know, askinghim for a direct overt—just suppositional.“Oh, oh, oh, well, you’ve really asked one now, you know? I get a picture of a foredeck of agalley. And all the galley slaves are there. And they’re all chained and their blood is runningdown underneath the fetters. And the overseers walk up and down the ramp, and the whips gowham! you see, and so forth. And in a battle, in a battle, when they start throwing Greek fire inamongst the galley slaves . . . No, that was much earlier. That isn’t the same period at all. I gotthat. That was much earlier. Much earlier.”And you say, “Well, how much earlier was that?”“Well, that was another lifetime. That’s a completely different lifetime. I don’t know what Iwas doing in this thing. It just seems kind of blank, the whole thing seems sort of blank.There’s this sailing ship, you see? And it’s sailing along, and I think I actually stood on therock, and I managed to coerce a ship to come in and wreck itself on the rocks. Or maybe . . . ormaybe . . .” And we finally find out that it wasn’t very dramatic. He just got dead drunk as acaptain of a ship and ran it square aground on the rocks and killed off all the crew, and they alldied in the jagged reef, and they were all screaming around him and so forth. But it wasn’t somuch that. He had stolen the ship and was guilty of barratry.Oh, we’re getting someplace now, yes. Actually, he had murdered the owner’s agent thesecond day out of port. Now we’re getting someplace. And the next thing you know, he isn’tstanding on the rock anymore. See what happens? You get the overts and that sort of thing offon the prior confusion and it blows. And that is the end of standing on the rock.But the more you Q-and-A with the PC and let him stand there on the rock, the less you’regoing to get done. It get pretty obvious? The less you’re going to get done.Now, you can keep chasing a PC’s attention back, back, back, back, back, back, back, andwind him up at the beginning of track, probably. Of course, that’s a kind of a Q and A too,because that’s a method of not confronting. He puts his attention on an incident much earlierthat he can confront, rather than confront the incident immediately before. We’re much moreinterested in that span of time just before, that seems so mysterious, and that keeps landing himback on the rock. That’s the period we’re interested in. We’re not necessarily interested in hiswhole career as a space commander. We’re not interested in that period, because spacecommanders very seldom take ships to sea. All right. So what we’re interested in is the periodwhich we have encountered.Now, you’re going to find this technique very interesting in the handling of engrams, just to"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"branch off on to something else. You’re going to find this very, very interesting.When you’ve got a person’s hidden standards and he’s been running well, and he’s runninghis goals terminal on the Prehav Scale, and you get up to Class IV-type auditing and you’regoing to run some engrams, you find these are usually very easy engrams and you haven’t gotto resort to very much trickery to run them. Because the PC, with the rudiments in, he’s invalence, he’s already contacted these pictures many times as he runs up and down the track;and you find out they kind of run like hot butter. Take about a half an hour to run one of thethings, an hour and a half. Three hours is the longest I’ve had so far. And they run very easily.But let’s suppose in some peculiar way that we didn’t really get this thing wheeling, and theperson seems to be stuck in it, and there’s a hell of a “burp” someplace in this engram we’rerunning, you see? And the person goes—every time they go through this area, they go “burp.”And every time they go through the area, they go “burp.” And we’re having trouble running theengram, we should assume that something confusing happened just before that, and try to getthat up rather than try to knock the burp out. Get the incident just before, and he will blowwhatever is hanging.Now, of course, the whole engram is hanging up, isn’t it?Now, how does a person get stuck on the track in the first place? Oh, let’s ask a much moreimportant question than that: How does a person get on a time track in the first place, and whatare you doing on the time track in this universe? That’s an interesting question. Why are youplodding along the time track with such orderliness? Could it be that there’s a confusion at thebeginning of track that you can’t face? I find that a very fascinating question. I won’t bother togive you any answers to that particularly. But what is time? Time very possibly could be retreatfrom a confusion we cared not to confront. So we retreated en masse and have been going eversince.But that gives you, now, a basic rundown on the prior confusion—trying to find the priorconfusion to find the stuck datum. A person’s ability to confront confusions, improved, ofcourse will blow a lot of chronic somatics. But I wouldn’t count on it. I wouldn’t count on justimproving their ability to confront and then having it all work out magically. I would muchrather that you just sawed into it from the word go and picked up these things and blew themselectively, one by one and very intelligently. Because a goals terminal run on the Prehav Scalewill give them lots of confrontingness and it’ll give them lots of changes and that sort of thing,and you’re much more interested in that.Trying to run a person, though, with a present time problem of long duration—one special kindof which is a hidden standard—trying to run a person on the Prehav Scale with five-, six-waybrackets and that sort of thing is highly profitless, because the PC never does the auditingcommand.When analyzing whether or not a case is running, look to find out whether or not the PC ismaterially advancing, the sensitivity is coming down and the needle is getting progressivelylooser.All right. That all betokens advance of the case. Now we go just a little bit further than that andwe say, if the case has not gone Clear in 150 hours of Routine 3, which includes, of course,Security Checks and assessment and runs, we’d better say to ourselves right about there, thiscase has never done an auditing command. This case has done something else too, or has donesomething else, or has not done it at all. And that would be the ne plus ultra of being kind ofstupid to wait that long, now that we know this. But if it did reach that time, then we wouldsay, well, there’s hidden standards here, and we would determine what they are. Anddetermining what they are, we would get rid of them on this basis of a prior confusion or anyrefinement thereof. We’d blow these hidden standards. We’d straighten out these things. Wereturn to a goals run. If the case still hung up, we would suspect another hidden standard. Wewould blow that and go on. So it might be a very good idea to blow all the hidden standards"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"that you could blow on a case before you do very much worrying about the case getting on theway with a goals run.In other words, by all means get their goal. By all means, get their terminal. By all means,assess a level on the Prehav Scale. By all means, give them some running on this sort of thing.But on a Security Check angle, first, let’s get off those last two pages of Form 3, and let’s getoff all of Form 6 on an old auditor. On new people, let’s straighten up Security Check ingeneral, let’s get this pretty well ironed out, and then let’s find out if the person has any hiddenstandards. And then let’s undercut those by finding the prior confusions; let’s fill in these blankspots, at least in this lifetime. Let’s get them sailing so that they can actually do a straightauditing command. And then, doing that, you’ll find you make very rapid progress withclearing.All summer and all last spring, I’ve just been working on speed of clearing. That is all I’vebeen working on.

Assesses for the Change, predates it by a month and runsthe Prepcheck Buttons on it over and over, flattening each one so far as possible.When one assessed change is run, another list of changes is made and assessed and it isall done again.It can be interrupted by an end of intensive without consequences to the pc if somethingwas left unflat.The public may scream to get clear, but most of it could only be audited on a ProblemsIntensive anyway.Unlike partially completed or badly done goals assessments, there is no liability to aProblems Intensive.All the gains envisioned in Book I can be achieved with enough Problems Intensives,even a 1st Dynamic clear in many cases.So don’t risk your pc’s health and good will if you’re not a Saint Hill graduate.

Now, we have before us, on this 11th of Oct., the little handy jim-dandy, the Class IIauditor’s pride. It’s called a Problems Intensive for Staff Clearing. And you notice it says StaffClearing. Staff always gets the best. [See HCO PL 10 October 1961, Problems Intensive forStaff Clearing]Okay. October 11th, 1961, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. And this is Problems Intensivesfor Staff Clearing. This is the second lecture on this subject.All right. Now we take this up, we look it in the teeth and we find that we are looking atbasically the Preclear Assessment Form.And you’ve been using this on preclears or should have been using this on preclears for a verylong time. The earliest edition of this is 1950 Elizabeth and Los Angeles Foundations, 1950.So you’re not looking at anything new. This has come a long way, and all that’s happened hereis we’re now using it to resolve the case.Now, it is of vast information to you and vast importance for you to know what the devil yourPC is all about. I have seen an auditor, believe it or not, process a PC for weeks on end and notfind out that the PC was having a dreadful time with a court or a child has been taken off by theauthorities or something. Now, you’d say that would show up in present time problems.But it gets worse than this. I have seen an auditor process a PC forever, and not know theirright name; not know if they’ve ever been operated on; not know they suffered from variousills; not know whether they were married or single. We’d say that auditor was running a bignot-know.Now, the basic part of this and the early parts of it right up to section O. but not includingsection O. if you’ll look it over, simply consists of vital information on a PC. And that is all itis, vital information on a PC.HCO Policy Letter of October 10th, 1961, Problems Intensive for Staff Clearing. Everyorganization has this under the guise of Preclear Assessment Form, right up to but notincluding section O. You notice the directions have been modified on this. They’ve just beendeleted a little bit, so I had better say something about when you do this.If you have a new PC who is brand-new to Scientology, you certainly do one. But if you havesomebody you are going to give an intensive to that you have never done one of these thingson, you should do one. It gives the PC some little confidence to know that his auditor knowssomething about him. And that in itself is an interesting factor in holding a PC in session—allby itself.Now, we see here that it starts out “Who Does the Assessment. The auditor assigned to auditthe preclear does the assessment.” Now, what does that mean? It means that’s his first action.That’s the first action the auditor undertakes. He doesn’t go in and run fifteen hours of “Createa reactive mind. Thank you. Create a reactive mind. Thank you.” He doesn’t do that. He sitsdown and he doesn’t do rudiments and he doesn’t do anything else; he simply sits down andruns off this form. And he sits there and makes out the form. But it is auditing. It is auditing. Itis done in the paid auditing time of the PC, because it is auditing.And when an auditor gets a preclear that he has not had before, he takes one of these forms,and he fills it out on the PC. Now, why is this?"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"The PC has a sneaking feeling that the auditor doesn’t know anything about him until this formis filled out. And therefore, you have a hard time keeping the rudiments in. But it’s because thePC is certain that there is a not-know sitting in the auditor’s chair. But as soon as you’ve filledout this form, then the PC feels that the auditor knows something about him or her, and ishappier thereby—feels more comfortable about this. PCs always have certain things that theyfeel that somebody should know, and those things are pretty well covered in this assessmentform. All right.The assessment form is for information. Auditors’ reports are for information. Not yourinformation: they are almost never for the auditor’s information. He knows. So if you can readyour own writing, that would be for your information if you wrote that way. But it’s forsomebody else’s information. An auditor’s report form in a Central Organization goes from theauditor to the Director of Processing, goes from the Director of Processing—very often isinspected by HCO, sometimes—but is certainly forwarded into here, or one copy of it. And ina class of this particular character, you are . . . If I ever see Mary Sue complaining about hereyes and so forth, why, I’m just going to go back and find all the badly written forms and put acurse on you.You want to know something, and bad handwriting is just another method of running a not-know on somebody. It is withholding the information, writing illegibly. Now, some of thesefellows in commerce that we occasionally do business with, you look at their signatures. Lookat their signatures. Can you read their signatures? It’s a blah, and so forth. And you’ll find thatfellow has withholds. You look over the letter he has written you, and you wonder how muchof that letter is true, how much of it is false. The fellow is withholding information from you,ordinarily.Now, that’s true of all handwriting, and you would be amazed how your handwriting improvesafter you’ve got a Sec Check Form 3 flat. There’s a direct coordination.So, it is made to be read, and if it’s illegible, somebody trying to check up the case is deniedinformation that might be of value.Now, we look down the line here, and we find out that we want information on the name of thePC, the age of the PC, and we want the tone arm position at the start of the assessment. Now,this will give us some sort of an idea, as we look this over, whether or not this PC is going torespond to ordinary and routine auditing, because as they give you the answers to this form,they should get some tone arm shifts. And if they get no tone arm shifts, talking aboutthemselves, of any kind whatsoever—oh-oh, oh-oh—this is a pretty desperate situation.You’re almost running into a CCH situation when you’re doing that.So that gives you that information. If you carry your tone arm position notations throughoutthis form, why, you’ll be fine.Now, we have—the first questions are Family, and we want to know this data about Fatherand Mother and so forth. And this gives us reactive personnel, as you will see here at once. (I’m going to pull this microphone closer to me.)Okay. You will see this at once, that the individual had very bad relationships with his father,and that you’re going to be running into Father, Father, Father, Father, Father. And that hecan’t remember anything about his mother, and so he’s going to be trying to run into hismother, his mother, his mother throughout the auditing. You see what we can divine from thatat once.Now, the next thing that we go into here is the other relatives who are in immediate line. Now,at this stage of processing, if this is the beginning of an intensive—at the first intensive the PChas—you’re going to have missing personnel here like mad. Well, should you try to find them?No. Just let it ride. Let it ride. The significant allies of the case are going to be missing, always,during the first Preclear Assessment Form. Great-aunt Agatha, Uncle Bill, the fellow who"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"made a drunkard out of the PC, you see—he is never going to be mentioned at this stage of thegame, if he is aberrative.Now, if it is known to a PC, it isn’t wrong with the PC. If the PC knows about it, it is notaberrative.Someday you will hear me, and you will stop auditing all these big knowns, and you will startmaking some progress with cases that is rapid. That’s one difference between my auditing and,sometimes, yours.If the PC knows about it, I pat him on the back, shake him by the right hand, cheer him up andgo on hastily to something else.And you all too often say, “Well, obviously, look here, his father was a drunkard and a jailbirdand beat him, he says, every day. And obviously we’ve got to spend a lot of time on Father.”And you do. You waste a lot of auditing time on Father, because Father has nothing to do withthe case. How do we know that? The PC knew about it! If the PC knew about it, it doesn’thave anything to do with his aberrations.The only time that crosses up is a hidden standard, but a PC usually doesn’t even know about ahidden standard until you start interrogating him.So, this gives us all of the areas we don’t have to monkey with in auditing. You see, it’s anegative assessment. We’re not going to have to worry too much about these.It’s going to say Family: Mother.“Mother living?”“Yes.”And you don’t then, of course, ask what was the date of her death. And the PC makes astatement of relationship with Mother.“Well, Mother was a dear, sweet person. Mother was always very good to me, much betterthan I deserved—much better than I deserved. She lives with us now. And somehow oranother, she keeps the marriage from going on the rocks. She tries. She’s nice—nice person,”and so forth.Well, you get trapped into this, you see? You say, “Well, what the hell is this? Some kind of anoverwhelm here of some kind or another?” you see? “And just exactly how does this thingstack up?” you say to yourself. “Mmmmmm-mm. Tries to keep their marriage from going onthe rocks—I’ll bet!” See, and you actually get trapped into this, because you have a little pieceof knowingness that is intriguing.Well, go ahead and be interested in it, but the PC knows all about this. Well, there are somethings the PC probably doesn’t know about it, but that will turn up in the line of auditing. Butwhat the PC knows about, we couldn’t care about.Then we get into Father, and we—same thing applies. And the PC says, “Oh, yes, well, theold man died when I was eighteen, and uh . . . so forth. And it was good riddance. Uh . . . heused to beat me every day, and he shot me on Sundays, and uh . . . he’s what’s wrong withme!” Oh. Well, that’s one area we don’t have to have anything to do with. Get the idea? It’sjust negative rundown.If you were to shake that down, you could find some surprising data in it. And the PC, sooneror later in this particular type of intensives will find very surprising data in it extremelysurprising—such as his father spanked him once. Very ordinary. His father beat him every day"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"and shot him every Sunday and so forth. And you find out the father spanked him lightly once.That’s the truth of the matter; see, he’s got some kind of a synthetic.But this is something that’s going to come up, sooner or later, and you’re not going to have toworry about it too much, particularly if he says that is everything that is wrong with him.If the PC knows that is wrong with him, and has known that’s what’s wrong with him for along time, why has it continued to be wrong with him? See? That’s the £156,000 question.Why has it continued to be wrong? Why hasn’t it as-ised? Well, it hasn’t as-ised because itisn’t there, and it never was there. But it gives us a method of skirting these things. We’re notgoing to take that up. It’ll all come out on withholds sooner or later.Now, Relationships: and there you’re going to have missing personnel. And Married—veryoften you find missing personnel.Now, there’s one thing that may possibly go haywire, is numbers of times divorced on this.That is important to know, because the PC is very often holding this up, and it’ll hold up hiscase. But it’s the number of times divorced. Well, maybe he didn’t get divorced. Maybe he gotmarried five times and only divorced once. And that would be quite a withhold, wouldn’t it? Sonevertheless, you fill that in, try to get the data on there.Any difficulties the PC presently has. Now, that gives you some sort of an idea how manypresent time problems you’re going to have to cope with in session.And if divorced, the reasons for the divorce and the PC’s emotional feeling about divorces.And you had better remember again that it doesn’t say how many times he is not divorced, orsomething of this sort. There might be some sleepers back on the case of some kind or anotherthat never get mentioned. So you better get that question answered very, very well and verythoroughly.And then Educational Level: This has some interest in the matter. Very often you will find a PCsquirming around and telling you that he is not educated and he has never been to school and soforth. And it would actually turn out to be a withhold if you didn’t go over it slightly. Youevery now and then find a PC who’s ashamed that he hasn’t been educated, and you very oftenfind a PC who is ashamed that he has.You know, I have a lawsuit I’ve been very laggardly in filing. It’s against the University ofTexas and so forth. And these things do come up in education. But I want to claim all of theGerman courses that Mary Sue had there. I want to claim back the fee and considerabledamages, because every time we’re around Germans—she’s had four years of German, see?And every time we’re around Germans—I’ve only had a couple of lifetimes as German, yousee, I’ve had no courses on it, and I have to order all the beds and breakfasts, you see, and soforth. And I turn around to her and I say, “Suzie, ask the lady to sell us a loaf of bread,” yousee? And Suzie looks sort of blank, you know? And then finally—I finally get Brot. Let’s see,Brot, Brot, Brot. Restimulates hell out of me. After you’ve been killed in a country a fewtimes, you know, you try to talk its language, you get restimulated.So, the University of Texas is going to get sued sooner or later on this business.But you run into oddball angles on education of some kind or another. And if you wereprocessing—well, I think probably if you were processing dear old Mr. Penner out here—he’squite a fireball. He’s our bricklayer Tad he’s quite a boy. You go out there, and-if the materialsare available, and if the East Grinstead merchants have been talked into letting go of something,you go out there and you will see a low wall of bricks—a low wall of bricks being put up—andyou go back about a half an hour later, you know, and the wall is over your head. You justnever saw bricks throw themselves and plant themselves and get masonried into shape as fastas Mr. Jenner can do it. He is terrific. Right now, I don’t know how many cubic yards of dirtthey’ve moved out there this afternoon, and bricks flying in all directions and that sort of thing."},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"But I don’t know particularly that he has a thing on education, but he rather considers, to aslight degree, that he is not educated. And he is likely not to inform you on this subject. And itsort of is a withhold, because you are processing him in some highly intellectual line, see—Scientology, and that would be intellectual.And then he tries to kind of measure up to all this and he gets into some kind of an impressivefog. You got the idea? And his relationship could be actually twisted and made poor with theauditor if this point wasn’t straightened out with such a PC.Other people, they’ve had twenty-nine years of education, postgraduate courses and all that sortof thing, and they can’t write their name, so they’re ashamed too. And they try to say “No. Evenever been to school.” But you get a lot of lies in this particular area. And so you’d better getthat pretty well straight.It’s not that it has anything to do with whether he can run the process or doesn’t run theprocess, but it’s a fruitful subject of withhold. And you’ll find most of this is.All right. And you ask him about his professional life and main jobs he’s held, and so forth.You ask him about serious accidents and the date of such, and any permanent damage, and thatsort of thing. You ask about principal illnesses, and now you’re getting into an interestingzone, because if you didn’t know some of these things, you could run into them head-on. Youcould keep running into engrams of one kind or another that you wouldn’t have anyinformation on whatsoever because he never mentions them.And then you go into Operations. And that’s one that you should do briefly. Accidents,illnesses and operations are all subject to restimulation. And you can restimulate the livingdaylights out of a PC if you start auditing these things as he brings them up. Now, how do youaudit them? All you have to do is ask about them. Just ask about them, thoroughly, and he’ll bein it. You can throw him, as an auditor, straight into such an incident.Now, you get somebody out in the Middle West and you ask them if they’ve ever had anyillnesses or operations, and of course there goes the intensive. Don’t know if you’ve ever readany letters coming from the Bible belt, but as I’ve mentioned before, they read something likewhat was that quack’s name that was arrested down in Texas for practicing medicine without alicense? And somebody awarded ten million dollars damages for his having— Morris Fishbeinof the AMA. Morris Fishbein, the head of the AMA. This is all true about Morris. He wasarrested for practicing medicine without a license. But they actually read like his primarytextbook: “How to Get Sick and Go to the Doctor,” I think the textbook was called.And you get somebody started on this, and, my God, here we go. You get some PCs startedon this who have a slight strain of hypochondria, and man, they will give it to you blow byblow, and writhe around, and run their havingness down and so forth, and then start on theirfamilies’ illnesses, and so forth; and then they get to all the mistakes the doctor made, and howthe doctor had to open them up again in order to—in order to recover his nurse, or something.And this can become far too windy.So your ability to acknowledge is the only way you turn this off. Your ability to acknowledge,in making out this form, must be good and never better than under Accidents, Illnesses andOperations. Your ability to acknowledge— wonderful. And you can say to them, if it doesn’tturn off, “Well, you know, we’ll be taking up that sort of thing in processing—in the directprocessing. We’ll be taking that up more directly.” That shuts it off. You will, too, becauseinevitably, if they’re going to talk about it that much, they’re sort of hung in it. But this is notan auditing moment of running engrams. This is not the engram situation that you are runninginto.All right. Now, what do we have here essentially? What do we have as we go down this linebut data? And that data can be confused with the auditor— isn’t ordinarily; auditors do well"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"filling these things out. But an auditor’s natural impulse is to take these things up with the PC.Well, don’t take them up with the PC while doing such a form. That’s all. Just don’t take themup, that’s all. Forget it. Acknowledge it and get off of it and get on to the next line—you gotthe idea?—without creating an ARC break.Now, sometimes that is neat. Sometimes you have to be very neat in order to get off of asubject and shut a PC off, because, you see, an ARC break is composed of “not able to talk tothe auditor.”But if you’ve ever watched a PC talk his havingness down, you’ll agree with what I am tellingyou. They can tank their havingness straight out the bottom, just as nice as you please. Down itgoes with a dull thud.They talk themselves right down the Tone Scale: enthusiasm, and the next thing you know,they’re a little antagonistic; and the next thing you know, they’re crying; and the next thing youknow, they’re not talking.You can watch them. They’ll slide right on down the Tone Scale if you don’t hold up this. Soit’s best, in entering these, to tell the PC—this is Accidents, Illnesses and Operations I’m stilltalking about, E, F and G on this form—it is best to say, “Now, I just want to know thesethings very briefly; exactly what these things were, very briefly.” And you sort of emphasizethis “very briefly,” and you won’t run into him talking himself straight back into an engram andfinishing his first auditing session with a Christ-awful somatic he doesn’t know where the hellit came from. Got the idea? That’s a good prevention.Remember that a PC can talk down his havingness. If you’re accustomed as an auditor to everletting a PC run on and on and on and never stopping him from talking, you are doing him anunkindness. And don’t think you’re doing him a kindness, because you’re not. You’re doinghim an unkindness. The best thing you can do is to get on with the auditing, but this cansometimes create an ARC break, and so you have to handle it carefully.And the best way to handle it is to pre-organize it. Don’t try to handle it after the fact if it’sgoing to be difficult. Handle it before the fact. So that part of your auditing statement is “Nowin the next minute or so, I want you to list for me all of the accidents you have had.” You getthat kind of a trick? “In the next minute or so,” you see?Oh, well, he’s put in a sort of a little games condition now, and it’s how fast can he do it, andhe says, “Well, let’s see, there were fifteen automobile accidents and twenty-five bicycleaccidents and seventeen times when I fell off of railway bridges. I always seem to be falling offrailway bridges. And uh . . . let’s see. And that’s about all. Ha-ha, I beat you. It didn’t eventake me a minute, you see?”Bang. Fine. You got all your data. You write it down.Any kind of trickery like that is better than letting a PC talk his havingness down. You got theidea? So you get the data without the ARC break.Present Physical Condition: Once more I refer you to the letters which you might see comingfrom the Bible belt. This is one of these marvelous subjects.“Well, I have misery. It’s—misery has been going on for a long time.” And you very often willsee a PC, very often, just sit back and heave a long sigh, and you’re just setting in for a longchat. This is going to be a nice, quiet afternoon we’re going to spend And that’s not what we’rethere for at all.Once more, the “briefly,” the this and that, the inference that we’ve got to get this listed so thatwe can get on to the next item. You know, the next item is something else, and we don’t carewhat the next item is, you see? Briefly, you know: “Let’s get this briefly so that we can get on"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"to the next item. Now what is your present physical condition?”And they say, “Long after . . . Oh, no. He—uh—she—she really wants to know. (sigh)Terrible.”“All right. Now how is it terrible? All right. Where are the pains exactly? Inform me exactlywhat parts of the body,” and so forth.“Oh, well,” she says, “all over my eyes, my head, my back, and I have athlete’s foot,” and soforth, and so on, and et cetera.Now, you remember that the PC is on a meter. So at this point, it’d be an artfully good time tolook at that E-Meter. Now, we’re not interested much in the E-Meter except for the tone arm,up to the point we get to this H. Is there a withheld physical condition? That we’re terriblyinterested in. And so we read the needle. And you can put right opposite that H that it’s a littleold needle-reading stunt right here.And you want to know if there are any illnesses the PC hasn’t told anybody about, if there areany worries about health the PC has not imparted to anyone.PCs sometimes go around thinking they’re dying of some dreadful disease and they never letanybody in on it because it’d be too terrible for others to know—all that sort of thing. Andalso, and very, very much to the point, “Are there any diseases you would hate to have peopleknow about?” Ah, and you’re liable to collide with a freight train, where it can save yourselfone God-awful amount of dodged processing. Just get it right there. Let’s just get any possiblewithhold on the subject of present physical condition off of this case now. And you’ll saveyourself a lot of trouble, because a withhold about present physical condition is one of the mostserious withholds there can be on a case.All right. We come to section I. And section I is Mental Treatment. And it says “List anypsychotic, psychoanalytic, hypnotic, mystical or cult exercises, or other mental treatment whichPC has had, the date of the treatment and the E-Meter reaction.” And you could very well addto that “any treatment he is now receiving,” and you would get yourself something else.Now, this, too, you want to shake down with the needle. You want to get any withhold in thearea of mental treatment off, off, off.You know, a person who is withholding the fact that he has been adjudicated as stark, staringinsane, is of course sitting on the one withhold that can stop his processing in its tracks. And,right here on this course, there has been an instance or two of somebody continuing treatmentwhile training. And evidently this was not shaken down well, because you find no trace of it intheir Preclear Assessment Form in the beginning of their folder. The auditor just did not find it.Those things are important. Those things are very important during auditing. They’re veryimportant in an HGC. The person gets auditing all day and then has somebody cracking hisspine all night while they’re hypnotizing him or something, and you’re going to get no place,man. He’s going to be out of session every morning, going to have a high tone arm everymorning. And then it takes about the middle of the morning to get the tone arm down. And thenthe next morning he comes in and he has a high tone arm again. And about the third time thishappens—that he goes off with a low tone arm and comes back with a high tone arm—you cansuspect that there’s a withhold on present physical condition or mental treatment, or currenttreatment. That is the most fruitful source of that particular activity. There is something wrong.There is something going on here. The person is doing something else and they don’t want youto know about it.Although running Prehav Scales, of course, puts up the tone arm, the usual cause of high tonearms . . . It’s not that a tone arm must not be high. As a matter of fact, they can’t run thePrehav Scale properly without getting high tone arms, you understand; but I’m talking about"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"the mechanism of the PC is always showing up with a high tone arm. You know, you processa PC for a week, and then all of a sudden for a week the PC only has a reading of five and ahalf. Well, there’s just something wrong in this division. The PC is either physically ill anddoesn’t want to tell you, or the PC has some bug on the subject of the mind and doesn’t wantto tell you, and so on, or the PC is actually getting treatment in between your treatments anddoesn’t want to tell you. So if you shake those things down during the Preclear AssessmentForm to get the withholds off . . .Now, this is not a chatty afternoon over a cup of tea. You’re just going to go right to it andyou’re going to get the withholds off on this subject. Now, he actually won’t mind you gettingthe withholds off on this subject. Be kind of a relief to him, as a matter of fact. If he does havewithholds on this subject and if he doesn’t get them off, you won’t be his auditor. That’s it.But if he does have withholds on this subject and you do get them off, then you of course arehis auditor. Obviously. You know about these withholds and nobody else knows about them,so therefore you must be his auditor. Follows, doesn’t it?You know things about him, now, that other people don’t know, so therefore that follows,then, that you are the person’s auditor. You’ll find in-sessionness increases very well if you dothat.Now Compulsions, Repression’s and Fears doesn’t necessarily follow in that same category atall, and we just couldn’t care less. It’s going to be of no value to you to know of hiscompulsions, repression’s and fears to amount to anything, except as a gauge of how daffy heis or isn’t. And that’s the only gauge you’re going to get out of that. It’s just a measure, andyou can already read that off the graph. So you go over that rather rapidly.And you get down to Criminal Record, and this, too, is a matter of grave interest to us.Because people who have criminal records and don’t want us to know about it: that can make abad show in auditing. So let’s, when we get to K, let’s once more bear down on the needle,and let’s examine that needle very carefully on this interrogation on the subject of crimes,prison sentences, and so forth. And let’s make sure that we’ve got that thing showing up.It’s interesting that I had a letter from a preclear that has gone through London HGC on severaloccasions over a period of time, and he’s complaining about his case gains. He is; he’s notblaming anybody. He’s not mad at anybody or anything, but he’s just written me a letter andasked me to please, can’t I tell him why, or do something about it.And the side note that appears on this thing, of course, is the man has a record as long as yourarm. Now, we know that here, but does his auditor know it there? See, that could just accountfor no case gain, right there in a lump sum, bang! Well now, if each new auditor he hag hadhas not done a Preclear Assessment Form, then he feels he has a withhold to some degree fromthat auditor, and maybe nobody has ever dug this up in this particular fashion. I haven’tfollowed back the other data concerning this, but that is just of interest, in point.I very seldom get such letters. My letters are usually quite the reverse. They’re “Dear Ron, Ijust this and so on, and wonderful processing and I feel better, and so on.” But this chap—he’sjust worried about himself, that’s all. So we would also have found him under Present PhysicalCondition, and we would also have found him under Compulsions, Repression’s and Fears,and we might have found him under Other Mental Treatment. See, it would all have droppedout of the hamper on the Preclear Assessment Form, had we done one properly and if everynew auditor that had the case had done one for himself.Although I have said you have to write on this legibly, remember it is for you, the auditor, tofacilitate your auditing of the case.All right. Now we get down to one that we couldn’t care less about: Interests and Hobbies.This will have no great bearing on a case. It’d be very unusual. Once in a blue moon, he has"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"the hobby of “killing little girls in dark woods” or something like that, but it isn’t often, and ithas very little case bearing. It, however, can serve as a cross-index to his goals terminal. Notvery important.Now we have Previous Scientology Processing. And this is far too specific When we list theauditors, the hours, and the E-Meter reaction, and everything else, in the HGC or theAcademy. This is just too confoundedly specific. Now, we don’t have to be this specific.There isn’t any reason to be this specific.The number of auditing hours he has had, he will seldom recall. The auditors you want to getto on the case will be buried, for the purposes of this preclear assessment. So we press himvery lightly in this particular line. Very, very lightly.So, you would do much better to ask him a general idea. A general idea is what you want, andthat’s all. Otherwise, you’re going to plow up all of his auditing, restimulate all of his auditing;you’re going to have to take up all of his ARC breaks; you’re going to have to take up all of hisARC breaks and failures with past auditors; you’re going to have to take up all of hissuccesses. And you’ve got another afternoon’s activity all mapped out in level M, unless yousay, “Well now, briefly, and just in general—just give me some sort of an idea: When wereyou first processed—some date? And . . . yes. And you had some organization processing,and you had . . . All right. And field auditors?” so on. “All right. That’s good,” and so on.“Thank you.” You know, it’s very brief.The best way to get this data is to run the ARC break process on the PC. And you’re notrunning it at this time. And you’ll find all their auditors, and he’ll find the auditors that areaberrative, and so forth. But you just want to know how long this fellow has been inprocessing. And this fellow tells you he’s been in processing now for 8,642 hours and soforth. Well, you know he’s lying. He hasn’t lived long enough. I think it takes one lifetime toget that many hours of processing at some fantastic figure per week.Now, when you say “List briefly the processes run,” man, that’s a grim one. You takesomebody that’s been around since 1951—the number of processes run. In the first place, thePC almost never remembers them, and you’ve got a big hang-up there, and so forth. So Iwould say, instead of that—instead of that sort of thing—I’d want to know, “What’s been runon you, more or less, that made a change in your case?”Oh, they’ll tell you those glibly, and very rapidly; they can remember those. But those thingsthat have made no change on his case, we couldn’t care less. But at the time this thing was firstcompiled, it was important to know what engrams had been started and hadn’t been started,you see? And then this was taken off the earlier form, so it has arrived that way.And “List the goals attained from such processing.” Well, now you’ve asked him the samething, if you just asked the one I just gave you. You said, “What processes have given you achange?” you see? Well, that just write them diagonally across the (2) and (3) all at once.And “goals not attained from such processing” is an adventurous question to ask a PC, butshould be asked. And it’d be a very good thing to find out what he has not been able to doabout processing; because you’ll be able to refer to that later on, and it’s part of the O section.It gives you a clue of coordination. You want to know what he’s been trying to do withprocessing that he hadn’t done. He might even give you a hidden standard.All right. The Present Processing Goals. Now, he’s going to give you some brief goals of onekind or another. These are not very important at this particular stage, but you want to knowwhat he’s trying to do with processing. But very often at this stage of the game he just givesyou a social response: “Well, I would like to be better,” and that sort of thing. Well, you don’twant anything more than that."},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Now, we have a whole section here, which is the ne plus ultra of the whole thing, and we getto what makes this a Problems Intensive. We get to section O.Now, that was where we wanted to get; that was “where, at, to” we wanted to arrive. And thiswe are going to do now with the greatest of care. We are going to write this up ad infinitum,and if there are not enough spaces, we’re going to make some more.Here we have “O. Life Turning Points: List each major change the PC has experienced in life.”And that means his whole life, ever since he was a very small boy or girl.And of course, you’re going to have the PC giving you—you’re going to see the perfectexample of cyclic recall as you do this. So don’t try to ask for a certain period at any giventime, because you’re going to get near present time ones, then you’re going to get middlerange, and then you’ll get early, and then you’ll get near present time ones, and then you’ll getearly ones, and then you’ll get middle, and then you’ll get near present time, and it’ll just goback up and down this way.But you want to list each one of these carefully, because you are now going to use these forassessment, so they have to be listed with precision They have to be listed with great precision.Now, what precision? Well, it’s going to be so that you can say it easily on an assessment.You’re going to have to say this several times. So we don’t want it long, lengthy and long-winded. We want a precise statement, so that’s what we keep asking the PC for.Major change the PC has experienced in life. And the PC may want to know what you mean bya major change. “Well, when you didn’t any longer do what you were doing and started doingsomething else; when you didn’t any longer live where you were living and moved elsewhere;when you didn’t any longer have that state of health but had another state of health.”“Ah, well, oh, well, you mean—you mean . . .” and he’ll tell you something else.All right. Well, we’ll get those changes and you take that up very carefully and then get thesechanges this way:“Uh . . . well, after I had an operation for goiter, I found out that I couldn’t go out as much.”So you put down “operation for goiter.” That’s all you write. Major change point. Then, “Allright. What was another major change point?”“Well, um . . . uh . . . it was when I . . . it was when I uh . . . finished my first year incollege. Uh . . . uh . . . I had to leave.”“Oh? Well, did you go back?”“No. No. Never went back. Yeah. First year in college.”So that’s what you want. So it’s “leaving college” is a very, very excellent way of expressingthat, see? So that’s expressed very briefly. Your next point. Express them briefly, succinctly.Now, each one of these is followed by a date. And his idea of the date is going to be thewildest scramble you ever heard of. So don’t press him for an accurate date, particularly, anddon’t go pushing on it, because the person will do enough hemming and hawing here to last alot of people a long time, and the dates you get aren’t going to be very accurate unless you sitdown with an E-Meter and go through a timing exercise of putting the things on the time track.And we’re not asking you to do that, particularly. So “ten years ago” is good enough. Butwrite down something like “around 1948.” See, that’s plenty good. Anything the PC tells youis the date."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"And we go on down the line and we fill out all these major changes. Now, you may findyourself needful of more space in order to get all these major changes, and if you do, you justclip another piece of paper up at the top of page five on this assessment form. And you justkeep writing them in the same wise. PCs might have lots of them. This would be fairlyadequate for the usual case, but you might find somebody with a lot more.Now, he’s probably missed a great many of these changes. He probably hasn’t looked at theseother things as changes at all. So you continue the list with specific requests. You want toknow when the PC newly joined any religious group. That’ll be a major change point in aperson’s life, you see? And the PC didn’t. All right. He didn’t.Now, “When did the PC start going to church again?” Of course, that’s a major change point.Ha-ha. Start going to church again: well, that tells us something.If I had been doing this on an archbishop in northern Greece one night down in Athens—if Ihad been doing just this—I would have pulled half of his aberrations by asking him why hejoined the church when he was nineteen in New York City. Because his sole goal was to dieand go to heaven. He did have a psychosomatic goal, which was to keep himself from goingblind. But he gave me the whole story about, he was in a terrible upset and so he joined thechurch, and here he is at 70 or 80 or 205 or something like that—there he was, and he’s stillriding the same stable datum.This, by the way, is interesting. Maybe in the National Geographic, sometime or another,you’ve seen a picture of a monastery in northern Greece, where the people can’t ever walk inand out of the place. They have to be lifted in baskets. And they’re lifted up the face of the wallin a basket.This was the archmadrid [archimandrite] I think, of that particular monastery. And he had comedown to—he’d heard of Scientology, and they had a couple of sisters with him. I could havepulled his whole case right there —clank! Interesting. Because the major “When did he startgoing to church again?” would in this particular case have become “When did he become amember of the church?”Well, he became a member of the church after a long period of confusion back in his middleteens. And that was almost sixty years before. Interesting. And he’d been riding the sameconfusion, and he was sitting right there on the same chronic somatic. Fascinating.“When did the PC subscribe to a fad?” Now, he’s liable to give you anything, and even insultyou with saying Dianetics is one, or something like that; we don’t care what the PC said. Butwhen we say “fad,” we mean anything everybody else was doing with enthusiasm. But wealso mean food fads or clothing fads. He joined the Edwardians; he became a Teddy boy.Anything like this, you see? He joined up into something or other, but it will indicate a change.“When did the PC begin dieting?” And the PC’s normal first response is to tell you that henever did. And you should be very careful about that particular point—ha-ha—because after amoment or two, he’ll find a dozen periods of his life when he had to change his eating habits.Well, he was in the army. And yes, well, he did start dieting, “if you want to call it that.”You’ll get that kind of response, you see? He couldn’t stand Spam. He just couldn’t standSpam, and he stopped eating Spam, and he hasn’t been able to eat meat of that composite typeever since. And he Won’t eat meat of that composite type ever since. That’s it. “That—if youwant to call that a diet, fine. All right. That’s a diet. But they just served me one more piece ofSpam and they would have had it.” That was a diet. It’s a negative diet.Of course, at that particular level, you write down when it was, and you want to know what itwas. So you’d say “1943, Spam.” That would be your notation.“All right. What other diets have you started off on?”"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"“No other diets. I’m not dieting. I’m no vegetarian, or food faddist, or anything like that. Ihave no other unusual diets of any kind whatsoever.”Well, this one has to be followed up. You have to get a little bit clever.So you have to ask a question like this: “Well, do you eat differently, or have you ever eatendifferently from other people that were around you?”“Oh, well, you put it that way, yes, they eat these poisonous meats all the time, and uh . . .they eat these meats, and they didn’t care what meat it was and what meat it wasn’t, and soforth. And actually, for some years, I haven’t eaten any meat.” But you see, this, to the PC, isnot a diet. He doesn’t define it as such because that is ordinary, that is usual. And the thing heis doing ordinarily with food is the thing to do with food. It isn’t what everybody does on thesubject of food. He never notices that.All right. He’s liable to give you some answer and say, “Well, I was out on the China coast,and all the Chinese were eating rice, and who the devil could live on rice all the time, but Imanaged to get some food. And I was eating differently than other people then—verydifferently from the other people that were around me then. They were all eating rice, and Iknew you couldn’t live on rice, and so forth. And I had to eat other food from that, and therewas a lot of trouble getting other food at that particular time.”You say, “When was that?” And you put down “1948, China.” Not “rice.” That will all giveyou clues, clues, clues. Something was happening there. Something weird was going on. Hislife was changed. That won’t be much of a point, but this is liable to liven up the next point,you see?“Well now, did you have any other food changes, any other diets or anything like that?”And he all of a sudden tells you for the first time, “Well, my family only eats kosher food.”“When is the first time you had any difficulty eating kosher food or finding kosher food, andso forth?”“Oh, well, you want to know that, that was when I joined the army. Had a lot of trouble. Had alot of trouble.”Put down “kosher food” and some sort of a date. There’s upsets associated with all this sort ofthing, but those are not as important as this one: He said, “Well, uh . . . I uh . . . started to uh .. . eat . . . live on lettuce and uh . . . muldeberries—dried muldeberries and lettuce uh . . . inurn . . .1951.” That’s right out of the blue, you see? There’s no explanation to this of any kindwhatsoever. You don’t say “Well, you did?” you know?You better write down “dried muldeberries and lettuce”, 1951 right there—bang! Because,boy, be must have run into a freight train.If you look back of this, you see, you look back here, you won’t find anything else happeningin 1951, you don’t think, you know? You look back here and Mother’s death, Father’s death—1951? Where the hell is 1951? Nothing happened in 1951. Nothing. That is just a stroke out ofthe blue, and you’ll get it on such things as diets and fads and that sort of thing, much morerapidly than you’ll get it on something else.All right. “When did the PC leave a job?” And, of course, this may get very lengthy, but youbetter take down every one of them. Much more important than the auditing he’s had is howmany jobs has he left? How many, how many, how many, how many, how many? And youget some sailors, for instance, and they never show you all their discharges. But they were on aship in 1949, and they were on a ship for two months in 1955 and they were on a ship for one"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"month in 1958.“What have you been doing the rest of the time?”“Well, I’ve been going to sea.”What the hell goes on, you see? There’s holes all up and down the line, don’t you see? Andsomething going on during that period; it’s all a big not-know as far as you’re concerned. Andas far as the PC is concerned, it’s just all a big withhold.So when the PC starts to give you his job lines and there’s something going wrong with this,you want to start asking, “How long did you hold that job?” And get his job record so that it’ssomewhat chronological. Find out his leaving points, and at these leaving points . . .He says, “Well,” he’ll say, “I left a job . . . I left a construction company in 1951. And I leftthe uh . . . yes, and I left uh . . . the uh . . . merchandising uh . . . department of Taylor &Sanford’s in 1955.”You say, “That’s good.” Now, you’ve made an unreasonable assumption: You think that from1951 to 1955 he was in the merchandising establishment at Taylor & Sanford’s. He wasn’t.There had been about eight job changes in the middle of the thing, see?So always find out how long he kept the job. That is the only keynote there. Find out how longhe kept that job, and then you will see where the missing links are.Now, because the changes are sufficiently interesting in that particular line, you had better E-Meter needle it. “Any other jobs you’ve left?”—blang! “What was that one? Any other jobs youleft?”—blang! “What was that one? Any other jobs you left? What was that?”—blang! And soforth. And you get a pretty good employment record, just as number 13’s number of linesimply. Because every one of those, he was in co-action with a group. And a person who hastoo many jobs is having difficulty with co-action, mutual motion. He’s having great difficultywith mutual motion.And this lends itself peculiarly to the development of tremendous overts and withholds. Overtsand withholds all stem from mutual motion—that is, the whole theory moves out of thatparticular field. And job and employment and work are things which notably milestone a man’sdecline and aberration, and that sort of thing.It’s not that they’re aberrative in themselves, but he is in mutual action with some group, andthen finds himself in violent disagreement with some group. And then he’s in mutual actionwith another group, and finds himself in violent disagreement there. Well, there must havebeen some confusions; some hidden confusions are in that period. And by getting a job record,you can spot a lot of hidden confusions.Now, supposing the person is not a working person at all. Then you change the question overto “When did the PC leave a certain type of activity?” And you’ll find out she was a housewife,and then she was a club member, and then she was a this, and then she was a that. And you’llget a type of “job record” which is just an activity record. But this whole number 13 of sectionO is devoted to spotting departed areas of co-, or mutual, motion on the third dynamic. Youwon’t have much other record if you don’t make a full one here.Now again, that all has to be written in such a wise that you can easily assess it later becauseyou’re going to use this and use this and use this data.Unlike everything up to and including M and N. you’re going to use the O section till youpractically wear out the paper. So do your best writing in this particular area; make sure thatyou can read your own writing. That would be a good thing to be able to do, because you’regoing to assess it and assess it and assess it and assess it."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"All right. “When did the PC have to take a rest?” Ah, that’s splendid. That’s real good. Andthose are marvelous, because you’re going to find those are the points just before which therewere prior confusions of magnitude.So you’re going to find out all these points when he had to take a rest, and you’re going towrite all those down.And “When is the time the PC noticed a body difficulty?” Well, you’re going to write all thosedown, but this is going to be awful comm-laggy. Going to get all that straightened out.Now, “When did the PC decide to go away?” Now, of course, you get wives, husbands, littlechildren, almost anybody, subscribes to this one, and of course, it is always preceded by anarea of confusion. So here’s a very fruitful source of confusions.Now, if these things suddenly start, about this stage of the game, to be the same areas asyou’ve already recovered, don’t worry about it. Just keep writing them down, see? Don’t callthis to the PC’s attention at this stage and say, “Well, I see that you left a job in June of 1955;you left a job June of 1955, and you started going to church again in June of 1955, and youdecided to take a rest in July of 1955. Well, what about that?”Well, you’re jumping the gun. You are jumping the gun. That’s the sort of thing you do insection P. So let’s not take up anything here but data. You just want data from the PC, datafrom the PC. And you’ll find out soon enough that it adds up and cross-checks and does allthat sort of thing.Now, the catastrophe for this whole procedure would be if the PC gave you nothing under thesun but the same date and the same incident. Of course, a PC doing that would be nuts. But aninstitutional case would do that. And you have one thing to assess.All they talk about is when they brought them to the institution, or something like this, you see?That would leave you with just one thing to assess. But people that you ordinarily audit aren’tthat daffy. But remember that if you did that, you’d have to, next time, fill out another O form.If you haven’t got enough data on the O form, you fill out another O form after you’ve handleda P form.All right. “When [Whom] did the PC decide to leave and when?” Now that’s almost the samequestion, but not quite: “decide to leave.” He didn’t leave. He decided to leave.After you’ve got all the departures, then you find out that there were eighteen periods ofdeciding to depart and not departing. And what are you running? You’re running leave and thenfailed leave. Ask him questions about leave and then questions about failed leave. Simple.Now, “When did the PC start being educated in some new line?” That is doubled over with“What have you taken up?” “What have you taken up?” “When did you take up a course in this,a correspondence course in something else?” you see? “When did you start to study somethingelse?”Now, I just had a maintenance man out here suddenly take up pottery. Hadn’t studied anythingfor years and he’s suddenly taken up pottery. I know there’s been a catastrophe and aconfusion in his life someplace. Isn’t any reason for him to take up pottery. He’s had littleconnection with pottery around here to amount to anything. But that’s Mr. Jenner’s job.That’s very interesting, isn’t it? He’s suddenly moving over into another field from carpentry,over into masonry, you know? And what’s happened? Well, I also notice he looks a littleupset. Now, I haven’t interrogated him in any way, but I’m just giving you something therethat is a cross-question."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Now, it isn’t anything wrong with taking up new lines. Isn’t anything wrong with studyingsomething new. But it might be an indicator. It might be.That’s true of most of these things, is the bulk of them are might-be’s.Now, “When did the PC’s physical body change characteristics?” Getting this out of women,you will have to take the E-Meter and beat them over the head. A woman at 110 will neveradmit that her body changed anything from that of a beautiful 16-year-old girl, or somethinglike that, you know? It’s just things they won’t talk about. So you have to pull that the hardway. Go ahead and grab it.Now, “When did the PC collapse?” They’ve probably omitted telling you anything about thisup to that point.And “When did the PC start a new life?” That’s just the same question over again in some otherline, but this is with magnitude. They may have omitted any of those.And then “When did the PC stop going to parties?” Most girls tell you this, they look very sad,and they say, “Well, I met . . . I met Bill, and uh . . . he was a stay-at-home type, and uh . . .so forth. And so we stayed home thereafter.” Well, I’ll let you in on something: That wasn’tthe reason they stopped going to parties. You’ll run into it in the P section, if this ever assessesout.They did various things. There were various things occurred about parties. There were variousheartbreaks and upsets. Because stopping a girl going to parties is only done with sixteen-inchguns! You can just mark a big underscore under that. They don’t easily stop going to parties.Might have been last lifetime, but it took something to stop them.Now, “Who has the PC never seen again?” Now, you notice this is down toward the end of theO section, so that if we have to send for the fire department and so forth, and get them to damup the grounds because of the resultant flood, the end of this is very much in view, because thePC is liable to spill a grief charge. Because you’ve shaken the PC up considerably by this time,you see?You ask him for change, change, change, change, change; you’re auditing him like crazy allthrough this O section. Now all of a sudden you say—all of a sudden you say, “Who have younever seen again?”“Waah! “And we finally finish up, “what does the PC now consider his or her major life change?” Andwe don’t care what the PC said it was. We just don’t care, but it’s a good thing to ask.All right, let us go back now; let us go back now to what we are going to do with all of thisdata. We have now assembled the doggonedest potpourri of data that was ever recorded, and ifemployment offices ever interrogated employment sheets to the degree that we have shaken thisone down, don’t you see even though we did it fairly rapidly—man, would they knowsomething about their applicants.Miss Jones comes in, applies for a job as a typist. “Where did you work last, Miss Jones?”Lie. “Why did you leave?” Lie. Here it is, you see? “Is there any reason you would not be ableto continue long on this job, Miss Jones?”“Well, no reason at all, except the doctor has only given me two months to live.”You know, you’d have the lot.So we’re going to take the O section. We’re not interested in any other part of this now except"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"as a review and a cross-coordination. And we’re going to tackle the P section.Now, if you are very wise, you will have stopped at the end of the O section and you will havetaken a break. Because you didn’t start this thing with rudiments, and the P section has to bestarted with rudiments.So you either finished that whole thing off and ended the session and that was the auditing forthat day or something of the sort, or that morning, and you start up the P section again, so itmight take a little bit of interesting timing to get this thing straight.Now, this, bluntly, starts an assessment of the PC’s major life changes. But you start it inModel Session, and you start right going here with Model Session, and you want to clear therudiments. You want to know if anything upset them, you know, about what you just coveredwith them. You kind of aim the rudiments, you know, a little bit in the direction of what you’vejust been doing earlier.And if you’ve only got fifteen minutes left of the session, and I find out that you started a P-section with fifteen minutes left of the session, I will be upset. You could possibly get awaywith a rapid assessment, but you certainly couldn’t bank on the assessment and so forth.Now, if you had a half an hour or an hour left of your auditing period, well, by all means doyour assessment, but don’t go any further. Don’t try to do anything with it. And the best thingwould be to have them in completely different assessment periods, because you’re going toshake this person up like mad doing an assessment. They’re going to be in a fit state to beaudited, let me tell you.Now, you’re going back here to O, and I don’t care how many doodledaddles or code marks orsymbols you put on the side of this. You could put “1.0 divisions,” you know, “fall,” orsomething like that. You could make little notations. But all you’re going to do is read themthis.Now, you go down the line. You make that notation: fall, rise—don’t ever note rise. Just fall,theta bop, whatever it is, how much. And you’re going to make it, and this time I’m going toask you to get clever.It doesn’t matter much if you assess this wrong. But this is a wonderful opportunity to getclever on a one-pass needle judgment. After you’ve finished up reading through this thingonce, your record and recall and so on are quite adequate to tell you which change point of theperson’s life registered most. You just read it through once, rapidly.Now, of course, you can do that by saying to the PC, “You don’t have to say a word while Iam doing this. You just sit there and hold those cans, and I am going to read all of this off”—you’ve got him in session, your rudiments are in and so forth—”and I’m going to see what thisis all about.”And you simply read this thing off, each one, and note the reactions that greet each one of thesechange points. When you get over here, you will be able to say that it is number 13 somethingor other was what assessed. That’s good. That got the most reaction on the needle.Now, that completes step one. Step one consists of that reading, it consists of youradjudication of picking out from the E-Meter reaction, needle reaction, which one of those lifechanges that you have gone over in O produced the greatest needle response—not just fall, butwhat had produced the greatest needle response.Ordinarily, that needle response will be much bigger than the remainder, and it will not beunusual for it to be a theta bop. A nice, wide, staggering theta bop—if you found somethinglike that, you’re right on his rock chain, and it audits like mad."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"All right. You’ve got to note that down and square that around.Now, this is a disposable form, this form P on page seven. And you notice it’s just on one sideof the piece of paper only. And in mimeographing this thing and repeating its mimeographs,that format should be followed, because that’s —this is disposable. This is “add-it-able.” Afteryou’ve done this, this gets added to the PC’s record. And then without throwing awayanything from one to six pages, you get another form P. See, and you just keep running a newform P. and it’s just on one page, one side of the paper. (Very well done here, thismimeographing job) And of course you look straight at the PC and you say to the PC verymeaningfully, now that you’ve got the point. . . It was their leaving Taylor & Sudrow’s,biggest change in their life, you see? That’s the most reaction. And you ask the PC, “Whatproblem existed . . .” This is very meaningful. It’s just, you plow that question right into him.Everything else has been rather conversational, don’t you see, and this and that, but you justplow this one into him hard. And you say, “What problem existed immediately before you leftTaylor & Sudrow’s?”All right. He’s going to tell you. Now, he may give you a fact. And if he only gives you a fact,you say, “Yes, yes. All right. That’s fine. Good. But state that as a problem. Now what wasthe problem connected with this? What was the problem? The problem connected immediatelybefore you left Taylor & Sudrow’s?”“Uh . . . well, it was that I did the accounts wrong.”“Yes. Good. All right. What was the problem?”“Oh. Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah . . . I ah . . . I—I see. I—I see what you mean. You wantto know what the problem was. I didn’t like my boss.”“All right. Good. Thank you. Now state that as a problem.”“How to keep from going to jail.”Ba-bang! You see? That’s a problem, but it’s the first problem they actually state as a problem.Now, they may be mystified as to why you won’t accept these as problems, because they seemgood enough problems to them. But you could even say to them, “A problem is who, when,what, where, how. There’s some question about a problem. There’s something undecidedabout a problem. We want the undecided thing, you know, the thing that was worrying you,the thing you were anxious about, before you left Taylor & Sudrow’s.”“Oh, well. Uh-huh-huuuuuuu, well, that’s different. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Oh, well, you ask methat way. I didn’t like my boss.” You know?“Yeah. But what anxiety did you have about it?”“How to keep from going to jail.” So you write it down.Now comes a little bit of a problem: “How to keep from going to jail.” Now, how do youphrase a rudiments thing? You’ve got to do a shakedown on this sort of thing. You’ve got todo a little assessment here sometimes You got to find out what this was all about. But it’s notmuch of an assessment, because it’s obviously jail that is a worry here.So your with would have to be changed to about, you see? And you’d say, “What wasunknown about that problem . . .” “What was unknown with that problem about jail?” You’vegot to change the about to with and change it around. “What was unknown with that problemabout jail?” Any such phrasing that gets it across to the PC so that you’re running an unknownon it."},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Now, if he gives you some significance—”How to keep from worrying.” Oh, man, that’s arough one because there’s no target. You’re not running any kind of a terminal.Now, how do you state this around so that you run about “What was unknown about thatproblem with worrying?” Man, that is not going to be any process that makes any sense toanybody. Are you going to say “Just worrying? Worrying? Is that what it was? Worryingabout what? How to keep from worrying—worrying about what?”“Oh, just worrying.”Boy, you’re really getting a defeat here, you see? A problem just about worrying.“I just found myself worrying. All the tome I just found myself worrying and worrying.”All right. In the last moment of defeat, you can give up and say, “What was unknown aboutyour worrying?” Because that’s as far as you’re going to get.In other words, don’t cave the PC in and don’t abandon it. Just try, successfully if possible, tofind a proper terminal to add into this problem. If you can’t find a proper terminal, you canmove off a bit and say what it was. Because you’ve got to have the thing run as the PC has it.There is no sense in doing anything else. And he could have a problem just about worrying,you see?So if you can’t get him to state a noun, or get him to state something else about this problem, orif you don’t get a noun out of him, you will have to use the exact thing that he said.“Oh, well, worrying,” but this is liable to be your response: “How to keep yourself fromworrying. Yeah, well, all right. How do you keep yourself from worrying? Were youworrying about something specific?”“Well, of course. Of course, naturally. Bill.”“Well, what is the problem then?”“Well, how to keep from worrying about Bill, naturally, naturally. I mean, idiot!” You know,that kind of reaction.All right. So your process is “What was unknown about that problem with Bill?” See, you’vegotten the terminal out of the thing. But the PC could have a problem just about worrying. ThePC knows that people who worry go to pieces. And the PC finds himself worrying. And that isthe most problem the PC has got. And that’s as close as he can come to any terminal. And youactually would defeat your purposes by being too forceful about giving him a terminal. Thereare times to be reasonable about this sort of thing.Try to get a terminal if you can. If you can’t get a terminal, run the condition. And you’ll stillmake it.But if you do, you better watch your havingness. And when you finish up that session withModel Session, just hardly ask him if it’s all right with the room. Just run TR 10. Because ifyou’re running a conditional problem, his havingness is going to go down. It can be done, youunderstand, but his havingness is going to go down, and in end rudiments you’re going tohave to run some havingness.All right. Let’s take up the next brutal step here rapidly. “What was unknown about thatproblem?” has got to be flattened on the tone arm. It’s got to be flattened on the tone arm. Andthat may take a long time, and it may take a short time, but you’re going to get the tone armaction out of it and going to get the twenty-minute test on it and so forth, because thatproblem— you’re really going to take it up and beat it to death."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Now he’s in a position to answer number 5. We’ve got to “locate the confusion before thatchange (as [per] number above)”—not before the problem but before the change. And nowyou’re going to “list the persons present in the confusion.” And this is going to give you somedifficulty because there will be innumerable persons missing. So you got to shake thatassessment down on the E-Meter needle.“Were there any more people in that confusion?” And you keep reading that until you no longerget a needle reaction. You’ve shaken all the people out of that. And the most important personto the whole confusion will be the person who comes up last. Just take that as a generalrunning rule and you’ll be safe.All right. You make a list of those persons, and then let’s just read that list off, as you’vewritten it right here on the form—don’t write it anyplace else than on the form—and you run arapid assessment which just gets your most needle reaction, not by elimination, and you writedown the name of the person who reacted most on the needle as you read that list.And now you’ve got to get the withholds off, from that person. Now, that means that youmight have an additional piece of paper. That means that you might have written up anadditional withhold section. It might mean that you have used a standard form to get thewithholds off, or it might mean that you just sat there and got the withholds off.“What were you withholding from that person?” “What had you done to that person?” “Whatwere you doing at the time, that you didn’t tell that person about?” And we want to get the basicwithholds off that person.But we’re not going to do a fantastic hour-after-hour grind to get the withholds off of thatperson. We’re just going to get the major withholds off of that person. You’re going to try toclean that person up till that person doesn’t react. And that’s as far as we want it cleaned up.We say the person’s name. We don’t get a meter reaction. And then we’re going to assess thelist again, leaving the person’s name in. We don’t take names off as we clear them up. We justkeep leaving their names in because they will turn up again. That tells you why we’re not beingterribly thorough.So you run down the list, get the most reaction, and you get the withholds off, from thatperson. You get what the person has done to them, what he hadn’t told them, what he wasunable to tell them. Remember the three classes of withholds, see, involuntary withhold—theunintentional withhold, rather. All of those things. We get that off, and we’ll find out thatwe’ve eventually—when we’ve taken care of all these people and none of these people reactanymore on the needle, we’ll have cleaned up the confusion.But the end of that is when the needle does not react while you read the list, with the rudimentsin. And you don’t get a reaction. All right. Great. Great. That’s the end of that confusion as faras you’re concerned,-and that is it.Now, you’ve just—run that again. And then you—again, as it says it in 9 and 10—you know,just keep repeating the same thing till you get all that, the people in the confusion, off. Andnow, you return to the O assessment and do all of P again, which is to say that you take this Pform as complete and you file it with the person’s record, and you make out a brand-new Pform in exactly the same way. And you go over that thing exactly as you did before.Now, that is the extent of a Problems Intensive. How long does it take? I don’t know how longit’ll take you to do this on how many PCs. But I know that this is terribly productive. And thiswill get out all the hidden standards, and it’ll straighten up all the present time problems of longduration. You’ll have all kinds of interesting things occurring as a result of it.It becomes better when you get the Havingness and Confront Process of the PC and run at thesame time. You could do a lot of things. They could get a lot more complicated, and so forth."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"But if you just do this, just as it says through here, and keep up until you finish every one ofthese change points of a person’s life, you’ll find the last ones are going just fast, fast, fast.They’re just disappearing quickly. He gets the problem, and he finds a confusion, bang! Andhe finds the withholds on it, boom!Don’t be too surprised if the person goes terribly backtrack. Let them go backtrack all theywant to while you’re running the problem. But that they went back running the problemdoesn’t let that lure you into getting the confusion before the engram. No, we want theconfusion before the change in this life, always. And we never wander on to the backtrackfrom a standpoint of getting off the confusion.But they will of course run into engrams while they’re being audited on the problem. And wedon’t upset them by trying to get them off of it. We just audit them.But we want the confusion prior to that change in this lifetime. So that this thing—we don’tprevent them from going backtrack—but this thing basically, mainly handles, and is onlydesigned to handle, the present lifetime.Okay?Well, I wish you lots of luck with it. I think you’ve got a piece of dynamite in your hands thatwon’t pre-explode in your face. I think it’ll do your PCs a lot of good.
