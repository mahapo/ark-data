Within5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. “Quickie grades”entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this PolicyLetter are HIGH CRIMES resulting in Comm Evs on ADMINISTRATORS and EXECUTIVES. It is not“entirely a tech matter” as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a 2 year slump. IT IS THE BUSINESS OFEVERY STAFF MEMBER to enforce it.ALL LEVELSKEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKINGHCO Sec or Communicator Hat Checkon all personnel and new personnelas taken on.We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technology.The only thing now is getting the technology applied.If you can’t get the technology applied then you can’t deliver what’s promised. It’s assimple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what’s promised.The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is “no results”. Troublespots occur only where there are “no results”. Attacks from governments or monopolies occuronly where there are “no results” or “bad results”.Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if thetechnology is applied.So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P,the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied.Getting the correct technology applied consists of:One: Having the correct technology.Two: Knowing the technology.Three: Knowing it is correct.Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Five: Applying the technology.Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied.Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology.Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications.Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology.Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application.One above has been done.Two has been achieved by many.Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper mannerand observing that it works that way.Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world.Five is consistently accomplished daily.Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently.Seven is done by a few but is a weak point.Eight is not worked on hard enough.Nine is impeded by the “reasonable” attitude of the not quite bright.Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity.Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area.The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Threeabove can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too-bright havea bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shutoff from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselvesagainst anything they confront good or bad and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks toknock out the good and perpetuate the bad.Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight,Nine and Ten.In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide openfor research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of Century hasthoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only ahandful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long run value and none were major or basic; andwhen I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I repented andeventually had to “eat crow”.On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions andwritings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction ofall our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and howinsane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology”. By actual record the percentages areabout twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to destroygood technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had better steel"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attackedas “unpopular” “egotistical” and “undemocratic”. It very well may be. But it is also a survivalpoint And I don’t see that popular measures, self- abnegation and democracy have doneanything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorse degradednovels, self- abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses,and democracy has given us inflation and income tax.Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had nosupported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that in itsformative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume,will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done.There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which willbe valuable-only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applications.The contributions that were worth while in this period of forming the technology werehelp in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, ofadvices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are,appreciated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discoverycontribution was not however part of the broad picture.We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank.We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact-the group left to its own devices would nothave evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called “new ideas” wouldhave wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workablemental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve-psychiatry,psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infinitum.So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense,and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlesslyfollowed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish.So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I havenot failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’s not goodenough for just myself and a few others to work at this.Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight. Nine and Ten has been relaxed the wholeorganizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.l., Wichita, the early organizations andgroups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, whenthey were all messed up you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. But ahead of that theyceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons.The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks havedifferent responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bankprinciples. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual andseldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid cravingfor agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement hasbeen what has made Earth a Hell-and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it wouldcertainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the greatgovernments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on theplanet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasantthings on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow gotten by theGroup Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by “public opinion” media.Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves.Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group offreed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that isdestructive."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bankdominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it,(b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and(d) encourage incorrect application.It’s the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the Bank thatsays we must fail.So just don’t play that tune. Do Seven. Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out ofyour road all the future thorns.Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pcspin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C.Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak on Threeabove and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the CaseSupervisor “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly at each of One toSix above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door tothe introduction of “new technology” and to failure.What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s all thathappened. This is what he should have done: Grabbed the Auditor’s report and looked it over,When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the restmissed: that. Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but thatnear session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while itstill gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B’s own manufacture, which nearlyspun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A wasfound to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The CaseSupervisor was found to be “too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases”.All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven,Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That process X didn’twork.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s your auditor’sreport for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stoppedProcess X. What did you do?” Then the Pc wouldn’t have come close to a spin and all four ofthese would have retained certainty.In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct processrecommended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one had (a)increased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable.Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process crackedthe case. Yet they were reported as not having worked!Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every timeinstruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the auditor,is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten areeven more important in a course than in supervision of cases.Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “because hegets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisions asession are reported. “Of course his model session is poor but it’s just knack he has” is alsoincluded in the recommendation. A careful review is undertake because nobody at levels O toIV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read anE-Meter dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered thathe “overcompensated” nervously swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed togo to place the needle at “set”. So everyone was about to throw away standard processes andmodel session because this one student “got such remarkable TA”. They only read the reportsand listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were makingslightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hidden under a lot of departuresand errors.I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot ofoff-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The academy students were in a stateof electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought under control andthe student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck.Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wifedied of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough instructor at that moment couldhave salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to dowhatever they pleased.Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes aboutfrom non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but someearlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood.When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can becounted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came fromorgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology under instruction inScientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And theorgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened outeasily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. hence, adebacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So properinstruction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must bemerciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student,dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be thecause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology gothome to him.With what we know now, there is no student we enrol who cannot be properly trained.As an instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the sluggards insideout personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeve rolled up can crack theback of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole classonly. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don’t wait untilnext week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him. If you can’t graduate them with theirgood sense appealed to and wisdom shining graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll havenightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three inthem and they’ll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing.When somebody enrols, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of theuniverse- never permit an “open-minded” approach. If they’re going to quit let then quit fast. Ifthey enroled, they’re aboard, and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the same terms as the restof us- win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. Thefinest organizations in history have been tough dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pambybunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It’s a tough universe. The socialveneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive-and even they have a hard time. We’llsurvive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly hebecomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scaredto enforce, we don’t make students into good Scientologists and that let’s everybody down.When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in he eye into afixed, dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. Theproper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist Now we’re going to makeyou into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you dead that incapable.”Fitting that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the crosswe have to bear.But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and timewe will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow. Fast. And as wegrow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less.So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s ourpossible failure to retain and practise our technology.An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of“unworkability”. They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or notdone.If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all therest.We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to do forlack of something better.The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and yourown destiny for the next endless trillions of years depends on what you do here and now withand in Scientology.This is a deadly serious activity.

The pressureexerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly answered byjust not delivering.The correct way to speed up a student’s progress is by using 2 way comm and applyingthe study materials to students.The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going onto the next and repairing them when they do not.The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirelyanswered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materialsand actions.Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to anyrecovery.The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs. When theproduct vanishes, so does the org. The orgs must survive for the sake of this planet.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:nt.rdCopyright © 1970by L.

When it is neglected the org will soon experience atechnical dropped statistic and lose income and personnel.The most attacked area of an org is its Tech and Qual personnel as these produce theeffective results which make Scientology seem deadly to Suppressives.The Suppressive is TERRIFIED of anyone getting better or more powerful as he isdramatizing some long gone (but to him it is right now) combat or vengeance. He or sheconfuses the old enemies with anyone about and looks on anyone who tries to help as aninsidious villain who will strengthen these “enemies”.Thus Tech and Qual personnel are peculiarly liable to covert, off line, off policyannoyances which in time turn them into PTSs.

Inmates ofinstitutions commonly trace their state back to contact with such personalities.Thus, in the fields of government, police activities and mental health, to name a few, wesee that it is important to be able to detect and isolate this personality type so as to protectsociety and individuals from the destructive consequences attendant upon letting such have freerein to injure others.As they only comprise 20% of the population and as only 2l/2% of this 20% are trulydangerous, we see that with a very small amount of effort we could considerably better the stateof society.Well-known, even stellar, examples of such a personality are, of course, Napoleon andHitler. Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Christie and other famous criminals were wellknownexamples of the anti-social personality. But with such a cast of characters in history we neglectthe less stellar examples and do not perceive that such personalities exist in current life, verycommon, often undetected.When we trace the cause of a failing business, we will inevitably discover somewhere inits ranks the anti-social personality hard at work.In families which are breaking up we commonly find one or the other of the personsinvolved to have such a personality.Where life has become rough and is failing, a careful review of the area by a trainedobserver will detect one or more such personalities at work.As there are 80% of us trying to get along and only 20% trying to prevent us, our liveswould be much easier to live were we well-informed as to the exact manifestations of such apersonality. Thus we could detect it and save ourselves much failure and heartbreak.It is important then to examine and list the attributes of the anti-social personality.Influencing as it does the daily lives of so many, it well behooves decent people to becomebetter informed on this subject.ATTRIBUTES"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The anti-social personality has the following attributes:1. He or she speaks only in very broad generalities. “They say ...” “Everybodythinks...” “Everyone knows...” and such expressions are in continual use, particularly whenimparting rumor. When asked, “Who is everybody . . .” it normally turns out to be one sourceand from this source the anti-social person has manufactured what he or she pretends is thewhole opinion of the whole society.This is natural to them since to them all society is a large hostile generality, against theanti-social in particular.2. Such a person deals mainly in bad news, critical or hostile remarks, invalidation andgeneral suppression.“Gossip” or “harbinger of evil tidings” or “rumormonger” once described such persons.It is notable that there is no good news or complimentary remark passed on by such aperson.3. The anti-social personality alters, to worsen, communication when he or she relaysa message or news. Good news is stopped and only bad news, often embellished, is passedalong.Such a person also pretends to pass on “bad news” which is in actual fact invented.4. A characteristic, and one of the sad things about an anti-social personality, is that itdoes not respond to treatment or reform or psychotherapy.5. Surrounding such a personality we find cowed or ill associates or friends who,when not driven actually insane, are yet behaving in a crippled manner in life, failing, notsucceeding.Such people make trouble for others.When treated or educated, the near associate of the anti-social personality has no stabilityof gain but promptly relapses or loses his advantages of knowledge, being under thesuppressive influence of the other.Physically treated, such associates commonly do not recover in the expected time butworsen and have poor convalescences.It is quite useless to treat or help or train such persons so long as they remain under theinfluence of the anti-social connection.The largest number of insane are insane because of such anti-social connections and donot recover easily for the same reason.Unjustly we seldom see the anti-social personality actually in an institution. Only his“friends” and family are there.6. The anti-social personality habitually selects the wrong target.If a tyre is flat from driving over nails, he or she curses a companion or a non-causativesource of the trouble. If the radio next door is too loud, he or she kicks the cat.If A is the obvious cause, the anti-social personality inevitably blames B, or C or D.7. The anti-social cannot finish a cycle of action."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Such become surrounded with incomplete projects.8. Many anti-social persons will freely confess to the most alarming crimes whenforced to do so, but will have no faintest sense of responsibility for them.Their actions have little or nothing to do with their own volition. Things “just happened”.They have no sense of correct causation and particularly cannot feel any sense of remorseor shame therefore.9. The anti-social personality supports only destructive groups and rages against andattacks any constructive or betterment group.10. This type of personality approves only of destructive actions and fights againstconstructive or helpful actions or activities.The artist in particular is often found as a magnet for persons with anti-social personalitieswho see in his art something which must be destroyed and covertly, “as a friend”, proceed totry.11. Helping others is an activity which drives the anti-social personality nearly berserk.Activities, however, which destroy in the name of help are closely supported.12. The anti-social personality has a bad sense of property and conceives that the ideathat anyone owns anything is a pretense made up to fool people. Nothing is ever really owned.THE BASIC REASONThe basic reason the anti-social personality behaves as he or she does lies in a hiddenterror of others.To such a person every other being is an enemy, an enemy to be covertly or overtlydestroyed.The fixation is that survival itself depends on “keeping others down” or “keeping peopleignorant”.If anyone were to promise to make others stronger or brighter, the anti-social personalitysuffers the utmost agony of personal danger.They reason that if they are in this much trouble with people around them weak or stupid,they would perish should anyone become strong or bright.Such a person has no trust to a point of terror. This is usually masked and unrevealed.When such a personality goes insane the world is full of Martians or the FBI and eachperson met is really a Martian or FBI agent.But the bulk of such people exhibit no outward signs of insanity. They appear quiterational. They can be very convincing.However, the list given above consists of things which such a personality cannot detect inhimself or herself. This is so true that if you thought you found yourself in one of the above,you most certainly are not anti-social. Self-criticism is a luxury the anti-social cannot afford.They must be RIGHT because they are in continual danger in their own estimation. If youproved one WRONG, you might even send him or her into a severe illness."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Only the sane, well-balanced person tries to correct his conduct.RELIEFIf you were to weed out of your past by proper search and discovery those anti-socialpersons you have known and if you then disconnected, you might experience great relief.Similarly, if society were to recognize this personality type as a sick being as they nowisolate people with smallpox, both social and economic recoveries could occur.Things are not likely to get much better so long as 20% of the population is permitted todominate and injure the lives and enterprise of the remaining 80%.As majority rule is the political manner of the day, so should majority sanity express itselfin our daily lives without the interference and destruction of the socially unwell.The pity of it is, they will not permit themselves to be helped and would not respond totreatment if help were attempted.An understanding and ability to recognize such personalities could bring a major changein society and our lives.THE SOCIAL PERSONALITYMan in his anxieties is prone to witch hunts.All one has to do is designate “people wearing black caps” as the villains and one can starta slaughter of people in black caps.This characteristic makes it very easy for the anti-social personality to bring about achaotic or dangerous environment.Man is not naturally brave or calm in his human state. And he is not necessarilyvillainous.Even the anti-social personality, in his warped way, is quite certain that he is acting forthe best and commonly sees himself as the only good person around, doing all for the good ofeveryone—the only flaw in his reasoning being that if one kills everyone else, none are left tobe protected from the imagined evils. His conduct in his environment and toward his fellows isthe only method of detecting either the antisocial or the social personalities. Their motives forself are similar—self-preservation and survival. They simply go about achieving these indifferent ways.Thus, as Man is naturally neither calm nor brave, anyone to some degree tends to be alertto dangerous persons and hence, witch hunts can begin.It is therefore even more important to identify the social personality than the anti-socialpersonality. One then avoids shooting the innocent out of mere prejudice or dislike or becauseof some momentary misconduct.The social personality can be defined most easily by comparison with his opposite, theanti-social personality.This differentiation is easily done and no test should ever be constructed which isolatesonly the anti-social. On the same test must appear the upper as well as lower ranges of Man’sactions."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"A test that declares only anti-social personalities without also being able to identify thesocial personality would be itself a suppressive test. It would be like answering “Yes” or “No”to the question “Do you still beat your wife?” Anyone who took it could be found guilty. Whilethis mechanism might have suited the times of the Inquisition, it would not suit modern needs.As the society runs, prospers and lives solely through the efforts of social personalities,one must know them as they, not the anti-social, are the worthwhile people. These are thepeople who must have rights and freedom. Attention is given to the antisocial solely to protectand assist the social personalities in the society.All majority rules, civilizing intentions and even the human race will fail unless one canidentify and thwart the anti-social personalities and help and forward the social personalities inthe society. For the very word “society” implies social conduct and without it there is nosociety at all, only a barbarism with all men, good or bad, at risk.The frailty of showing how the harmful people can be known is that these then apply thecharacteristics to decent people to get them hunted down and eradicated.The swan song of every great civilization is the tune played by arrows, axes or bulletsused by the anti-social to slay the last decent men.Government is only dangerous when it can be employed by and for anti-socialpersonalities. The end result is the eradication of all social personalities and the resultantcollapse of Egypt, Babylon, Rome, Russia or the West.You will note in the characteristics of the anti-social personality that intelligence is not aclue to the anti-social. They are bright or stupid or average. Thus those who are extremelyintelligent can rise to considerable, even head-of-state heights.Importance and ability or wish to rise above others are likewise not indexes to the anti-social. When they do become important or rise they are, however, rather visible by the broadconsequences of their acts. But they are as likely to be unimportant people or hold very lowlystations and wish for nothing better.Thus it is the twelve given characteristics alone which identify the anti-social personality.And these same twelve reversed are the sole criteria of the social personality if one wishes to betruthful about them.The identification or labelling of an anti-social personality cannot be done honestly andaccurately unless one also, in the same examination of the person, reviews the positive side ofhis life.All persons under stress can react with momentary flashes of anti-social conduct. Thisdoes not make them anti-social personalities.The true anti-social person has a majority of anti-social characteristics.The social personality has a majority of social characteristics.Thus one must examine the good with the bad before one can truly label the anti-social orthe social.In reviewing such matters, very broad testimony and evidence are best. One or twoisolated instances determine nothing. One should search all twelve social and all twelve anti-social characteristics and decide on the basis of actual evidence, not opinion.The twelve primary characteristics of the social personality are as follows:"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"1. The social personality is specific in relating circumstances. “Joe Jones said...” “TheStar Newspaper reported...” and gives sources of data where important or possible.He may use the generality of “they” or “people” but seldom in connection with attributingstatements or opinions of an alarming nature.2. The social personality is eager to relay good news and reluctant to relay bad.He may not even bother to pass along criticism when it doesn’t matter.He is more interested in making another feel liked or wanted than disliked by others andtends to err toward reassurance rather than toward criticism.3. A social personality passes communication without much alteration and if deletinganything tends to delete injurious matters.He does not like to hurt people’s feelings. He sometimes errs in holding back bad newsor orders which seem critical or harsh.4. Treatment, reform and psychotherapy particularly of a mild nature work very wellon the social personality.Whereas anti-social people sometimes promise to reform, they do not. Only the socialpersonality can change or improve easily.It is often enough to point out unwanted conduct to a social personality to completely alterit for the better.Criminal codes and violent punishment are not needed to regulate social personalities.5. The friends and associates of a social personality tend to be well, happy and ofgood morale.A truly social personality quite often produces betterment in health or fortune by his merepresence on the scene.At the very least he does not reduce the existing levels of health or morale in hisassociates.When ill, the social personality heals or recovers in an expected manner, and is foundopen to successful treatment.6. The social personality tends to select correct targets for correction. He fixes the tyrethat is flat rather than attack the windscreen. In the mechanical arts he can therefore repairthings and make them work.7. Cycles of action begun are ordinarily completed by the social personality, ifpossible.8. The social personality is ashamed of his misdeeds and reluctant to confess them. Hetakes responsibility for his errors.9. The social personality supports constructive groups and tends to protest or resistdestructive groups.10. Destructive actions are protested by the social personality. He assists constructive orhelpful actions."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"11. The social personality helps others and actively resists acts which harm others.12. Property is property of someone to the social personality and its theft or misuse isprevented or frowned upon.THE BASIC MOTIVATIONThe social personality naturally operates on the basis of the greatest good.He is not haunted by imagined enemies but he does recognize real enemies when theyexist.The social personality wants to survive and wants others to survive, whereas the anti-social personality really and covertly wants others to succumb.Basically the social personality wants others to be happy and do well, whereas the anti-social personality is very clever in making others do very badly indeed.A basic clue to the social personality is not really his successes but his motivations. Thesocial personality when successful is often a target for the anti-social and by this reason he mayfail. But his intentions included others in his success, whereas the anti-social only appreciatethe doom of others.Unless we can detect the social personality and hold him safe from undue restraint anddetect also the anti-social and restrain him, our society will go on suffering from insanity,criminality and war, and Man and civilization will not endure.Of all our technical skills, such differentiation ranks the highest since, failing, no otherskill can continue, as the base on which it operates—civilization—will not be here to continueit.Do not smash the social personality—and do not fail to render powerless the anti-social intheir efforts to harm the rest of us.Just because a man rises above his fellows or takes an important part does not make himan anti-social personality. Just because a man can control or dominate others does not makehim an anti-social personality.It is his motives in doing so and the consequences of his acts which distinguish the anti-social from the social.Unless we realize and apply the true characteristics of the two types of personality, wewill continue to live in a quandary of who our enemies are and, in doing so, victimize ourfriends.All men have committed acts of violence or omission for which they could be censured.In all Mankind there is not one single perfect human being.But there are those who try to do right and those who specialize in wrong and upon thesefacts and characteristics you can know them.

They include:(a) Persons intimately connected with persons (such as marital or familial-ties) of knownantagonism to mental or spiritual treatment or Scientology. In practice such persons, even whenthey approach Scientology in a friendly fashion, have such pressure continually brought to bearupon them by persons with undue influence over them that they make very poor gains inprocessing and their interest is solely devoted to proving the antagonistic element wrong.They, by experience, produce a great deal of trouble in the long run as their own conditiondoes not improve adequately under such stresses to effectively combat the antagonism. Theirpresent time problem cannot be reached as it is continuous, and so long as it remains so, theyshould not be accepted for auditing by any organization or auditor.(b) Criminals with proven criminal records often continue to commit so many undetectedharmful acts between sessions that they do not make adequate case gains and therefore should notbe accepted for processing by organizations or auditors.(c) Persons who have ever threatened to sue or embarrass or attack or who have publiclyattacked Scientology or been a party to an attack and all their immediate families should never beaccepted for processing by a Central Organization or auditor. They have a history of only servingother ends than case gain and commonly again turn on the organization or auditor. They havealready barred themselves out by their own overts against Scientology and are thereafter toodifficult to help, since they cannot openly accept help from those they have tried to injure.(d) Responsible-for-condition cases have been traced back to other causes for theircondition too often to be acceptable. By Responsible-for-condition cases is meant the person whoinsists a book or some auditor is “wholly responsible for the terrible condition I am in”. Suchcases demand unusual favours, free auditing, tremendous effort on the part of auditors. Review ofthese cases show that they were in the same or worse condition long before auditing, that they areusing a planned campaign to obtain auditing for nothing, that they are not as bad off as theyclaim, and that their antagonism extends to anyone who seeks to help them, even their ownfamilies. Establish the rights of the matter and decide accordingly.(e) Persons who are not being audited on their own determinism are a liability as they areforced into being processed by some other person and have no personal desire to become better.Quite on the contrary they usually want only to prove the person who wants them audited wrongand so do not get better. Until a personally determined goal to be processed occurs, the personwill not benefit.(f) Persons who “want to be processed to see if Scientology works” as their only reasonfor being audited have never been known to make gains as they do not participate. News reportersfall into this category. They should not be audited.(g) Persons who claim that “if you help such and such a case” (at great and yourexpense) because somebody is rich and influential or the neighbours would be electrified shouldbe ignored. Processing is designed for bettering individuals, not progressing by stunts or giving"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"cases undue importance. Process only at convenience and usual arrangements. Make noextraordinary effort at the expense of other persons who do want processing for normal reasons.Not one of these arrangements has ever come off successfully as it has the unworthy goal ofnotoriety, not betterment.(h) Persons who “have an open mind” but no personal hopes or desires for auditing ofknowingness should be ignored, as they really don’t have an open mind at all, but a lack ofability to decide about things and are seldom found to be very responsible and waste anyone’sefforts “to convince them”.(i) Persons who do not believe anything or anyone can get better. They have a purposefor being audited entirely contrary to the auditor’s and so in this conflict, do not benefit. Whensuch persons are trained they use their training to degrade others. Thus they should not beaccepted for training or auditing.(j) Persons attempting to sit in judgement on Scientology in hearings or attempting toinvestigate Scientology should be given no undue importance. One should not seek to instruct orassist them in any way. This includes judges, boards, newspaper reporters, magazine writers, etc.All efforts to be helpful or instructive have done nothing beneficial as their first idea is a firm “Idon’t know” and this usually ends with an equally firm “I don’t know”. If a person can’t seefor himself or judge from the obvious, then he does not have sufficient powers of observationeven to sort out actual evidence. In legal matters, only take the obvious effective steps— carry onno crusades in court. In the matter of reporters, etc., it is not worth while to give them any timecontrary to popular belief. They are given their story before they leave their editorial rooms andyou only strengthen what they have to say by saying anything. They are no publiccommunication line that sways much. Policy is very definite. Ignore.To summarize troublesome persons, the policy in general is to cut communication as thelonger it is extended the more trouble they are. I know of no case where the types of personslisted above were handled by auditing or instruction. I know of many cases where they werehandled by firm legal stands, by ignoring them until they change their minds, or just turningone’s back.In applying a policy of cut-communication one must also use judgement as there areexceptions in all things and to fail to handle a person’s momentary upset in life or with us can bequite fatal. So these policies refer to non-Scientology persons in the main or persons who appearon the outer fringes and push toward us. When such a person bears any of the above designationswe and the many are better off to ignore them.Scientology works. You don’t have to prove it to everyone. People don’t deserve to haveScientology as a divine right, you know. They have to earn it. This has been true in everyphilosophy that sought to better man.All the above “Sources of Trouble” are also forbidden training and when a person beingtrained or audited is detected to belong under the above headings (a) to (j) he or she should beadvised to terminate and accept refund which must be paid at once and the full explanationshould be given them at that time. Thus the few may not, in their own turmoil, impede service toand the advance of the many. And the less enturbulence you put on your lines, the better, and themore people you will eventually help.L.

That is a full auditingcommand cycle. Don’t forget it and expect a process to work, it won’t. The roughest spot inmost auditors is TR 2, not so much how to acknowledge but when.An auditor running into this with a pc should handle it this way.Auditor:“What could you say to your father?”Pc:“I could say, ‘Are you feeling well?’ “Auditor:“Did that answer the question?”Pc:“Well, no. I could say, ‘Are you feeling well enough to go fishing?’ “Auditor:“Did that answer the question?”Pc:“Yes, I guess it did. He always liked fishing and sympathy.”Auditor:(sure pc is through) “Good!

It comes fromcomputer technology where all data is in a “bank”.)The difference between auditors is not that one has more data than another or more tricks.The difference is that one auditor will get better results than another due to his stricter adherenceto procedure, better TRs, more confident manner, and closer observance of the Auditor’sCode.No “bedside manner” is required or sympathetic expression. It’s just that an auditor whoknows his procedures and has good TRs inspires more confidence. The pc doesn’t have to puthis attention on or cope with the auditor and feels safer and so can confront his bank better.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH:cs.ei.rdCopyright © 1969by L.

Flunks are given if thestudent does more than 1. Understand; 2. Acknowledge; 3. Return pc to session.Coach may throw in remarks personal to student as on TR 3. Student’s failure to differentiatebetween these (by trying to handle them) and coach’s remarks about self as “pc” is a flunk.Student’s failure to persist is always a flunk in any TR but here more so. Coach should notalways read from list to originate, and not always look at student when about to comment. ByOriginate is meant a statement or remark referring to the state of the coach or fancied case. ByComment is meant a statement or remark aimed only at student or room. Originations arehandled, Comments are disregarded by the student.HISTORY: Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in April 1956 to teach auditors to stayin session when preclear dives out. Revised by L.

All grades below that are subjectto overrun.Life subjects are subject to overrun before Scientology. The mechanism is this: oneconceived a purpose. He or she succeeded in it, then kept on and overran it. In auditing onehits the purpose and the overrun of it and gets a free needle on it. That doesn’t mean the personwas a release then. It means that the spotting of the purpose and the overrun by auditingproduces a free needle today.It may be necessary to find whole track overruns on some pcs in rehabilitation of grades.If a lot of levels have been run past free needle it may be necessary to take apart the mess like abundle of yarn to get the first free needle. In such a case one rehabs any grade the pc has beenrun on that the pc can remember. One handles this briefly until the pc is happy but notnecessarily to free needle. One then finds another overrun, does the same. One goes on and onlooking for moments the pc felt good about processing at one or another time. If you keep thisup, suddenly you will see a free needle on the pc! Establish what grade it is free on, thenquickly get the needle free on the remaining overrun grades (but not grades pc was never runon). It may be necessary to take into account a whole track overrun of a purpose or even thepurpose to get release, clear or OT.It is all very quick, deft auditing, very much on procedure using standard rehab tech—butno repetitive grind.--------------You won’t see a freeing up of a needle unless you set your sensitivity on a Mark V to astiff needle for the pc. You can increase sensitivity or decrease it as the pc progresses but bysetting the sensitivity so the needle is pretty still and stiff you will see easily a freeing up of theneedle and then a free needle. Using sensitivity 128 will obscure every free needle as the needleis too loose already for the auditor to see any change.--------------Pcs are most apt to go free needle after a big cog. So don’t be so engrossed in looking atthe pc during cognitions. Keep an eye on that needle. And if it goes free, don’t ask anythingelse. Just gently give the pc a “That’s it” and without a chop of comm, ease the pc off to“Declare?” in Qual.

It shows in Dianetics that basic on that chain and flow has beenerased, and in Scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run. A new flowor a new process can be embarked upon, of course, when the END PHENOMENA of theprevious process is attained.DIANETICSFloating needles are only ONE FOURTH OF THE END PHENOMENA in all Dianeticauditing.Any Dianetic auditing below Power has FOUR DEFINITE REACTIONS IN THE PCWHICH SHOW THE PROCESS IS ENDED.1. Floating needle.2. Cognition.3. Very good indicators (pc happy).4. Erasure of the final picture audited.Auditors get panicky about overrun. If you go past the End Phenomena the F/N will packup (cease) and the TA will rise.BUT that’s if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena, not past a floating needle.If you watch a needle with care and say nothing but your R3R commands, as it begins tofloat you will find:1. It starts to float narrowly.2. The pc cognites (What do you know—so that’s . . .) and the float widens.3. Very good indicators come in. And the float gets almost full dial, and4. The picture, if you inquired, has erased and the needle goes full dial.That is the full End Phenomena of Dianetics.If the auditor sees a float start, as in 1, and says, “I would like to indicate to you your"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"needle is floating,” he can upset the pc’s bank.There is still charge. The pc has not been permitted to cognite. VGIs surely won’t appearand a piece of the picture is left.By being impetuous and fearful of overrun, or just being in a hurry, the auditor’spremature (too soon) indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pc’s end phenomena.SCIENTOLOGYAll this also applies to Scientology auditing.And all Scientology processes below Power have the same end phenomena.The 0 to IV Scientology End Phenomena are:A. Floating needle.B. Cognition.C. Very good indicators.D. Release.The pc goes through these four steps without fail IF PERMITTED TO DO SO.As Scientology auditing is more delicate than Dianetic auditing, an overrun (F/N vanishedand TA rising, requiring “rehab”) can occur more rapidly. Thus the auditor has to be morealert. But this is no excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena.The same cycle of F/N will occur if the pc is given a chance. On A you get a beginningF/N, on B slightly wider, on C wider still and on D the needle really is floating and widely.“I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating” can be a chop. Also it’s a falsereport if it isn’t widely floating and will keep floating.Pcs who leave session F/N and arrive at Examiner without F/N, or who eventually do notcome to session with an F/N have been misaudited. The least visible way is the F/N chop, asdescribed in this session. The most obvious way is to overrun the process. (Running a pc afterhe has exteriorized will also give a high TA at Examiner.)In Dianetics, one more pass through is often required to get 1, 2, 3, 4 End Phenomenaabove.I know it said in the Auditor’s Code not to by-pass an F/N. Perhaps it should be changedto read “A real wide F/N”. Here it’s a question of how wide is an F/N? However, the problemis NOT difficult.I follow this rule—I never jolt or interrupt a pc who is still looking inward. In otherwords, I don’t ever yank his attention over to the auditor. After all, it’s his case we arehandling, not my actions as an auditor.When I see an F/N begin I listen for the pc’s cognition. If it isn’t there, I give the nextcommand due. If it still isn’t there, I give the 2nd command, etc. Then I get the cognition andshut up. The needle floats more widely, VGIs come in, the F/N goes dial wide. The real skill isinvolved in knowing when to say nothing more.Then with the pc all bright, all end phenomena in sight (F/N, Cog, VGIs, Erasure orRelease, depending on whether it’s Dn or Scn), I say, as though agreeing with the pc, “Yourneedle is floating.”"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"DIANETIC ODDITYDid you know that you could go through a picture half a dozen times, the F/N gettingwider and wider without the pc cogniting? This is rare but it can happen once in a hundred. Thepicture hasn’t been erased yet. Bits of it seem to keep popping in. Then it erases fully andwow, 2, 3 and 4 occur. This isn’t grinding. It’s waiting for the F/N to broaden to cognition.The pc who complains about F/Ns is really stating the wrong problem. The actualproblem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and themeter a moment too soon.The pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward.Charge is then left in the area. A pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often willbegin to refuse auditing.Despite all this, one still must not overrun and get the TA up. But in Dianetics an erasureleaves nothing to get the TA up with!The Scientology auditor has a harder problem with this, as he can overrun more easily.There is a chance of pulling the bank back in. So the problem is more applicable to Scientologyas a problem than to Dianetics.But ALL auditors must realize that the END PHENOMENA of successful auditing is notjust an F/N but has 3 more requisites. And an auditor can chop these off.The mark of the real VIRTUOSO (master) in auditing is his skilled handling of thefloating needle.  L. RON HUBBARD  FounderLRH.jz.ei.rdCopyright © 1970by L.

As onehas DONE the lists without F/Ning each item, one now has the mystery of what is wrong?The error is reading items from Ruds or prepared lists cleaned to no read but not carriedto F/N.This action (amongst many such refinements) is what makes Flag auditing so smooth andindeed makes it Flag Auditing.When an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible.Yet it is simplicity itself. If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find anearlier item if something does not release. What has been found as a read on a prepared listwould F/N if it were the basic lock. So if it doesn’t F/N, then there is an earlier (or an earlier oran earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/Ning.So the RULE:NEVER WALK OFF FROM A READING ITEM ON A RUDIMENT OR APREPARED REPAIR LIST BEFORE YOU CARRY IT DOWN (EARLIER SIMILAR) TOAN F/N.Example: ARC Brk reads. Pc says what it is, Auditor does ARCU CDEI. If no F/N,Auditor asks for an earlier similar ARC Brk, gets it, ARCU CDEI, etc until he gets an F/N.Example: PTP reads. Carry it E/S (earlier similar) until a PTP F/Ns.Example: L4B: Has an item been denied you? Reads. Answered. No F/N. Is there anearlier similar denied item? Answered. F/N. Go on to next reading item on the list.Example: GF assessed once through for reads. The next C/S must take every item on itthat read, by 2wc or other process, to an F/N.So there is a much more general rule:EVERY ITEM THAT READS MUST F/N.In Dianetics you get the F/N when you run E/S secondaries or engrams to an erasure,F/N, Cog, VGIs."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"In Rudiments, every out rud you get a read on is run E/S to F/N.On a prepared list you take each read to an F/N or E/S to F/N.On an LX list you run each flow chain to an F/N.On GF you get by whatever process an F/N.On Listing by the Laws of Listing and Nulling, your eventual item listed must F/N.So another rule:EVERY MAJOR AND MINOR ACTION MUST BE CARRIED TO AN F/N.There are NO exceptions.Any exception leaves by-passed charge on the pc.Also, every F/N is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained.You take too soon an F/N (first twitch) you cut the cognition and leave by-passed charge(a withheld cognition).I could take any folder and simply write out the ruds and prepared list reading items andthen audit the pc and carry each one to F/N and correct every list so disclosed and wind up witha very shining, cool calm pc.So “Have reading items been left charged?” would be a key question on a case.Using lists or ruds on high or low TAs that are not meant for high or low TAs will getyou reading items that won’t F/N.So, another rule:NEVER TRY TO FLY RUDS OR DO LIB ON A HIGH OR LOW TA.One can talk the TA down (see HCO B on Talking the TA Down).Or one can assess L4B.About the only prepared lists one can assess are the new Hi-Lo TA HCO B 13 Mar 71and possibly a GF+40 once through for biggest read. The biggest read will have a blowdownon it and can possibly be brought to F/N. If this occurs then one also handles all other itemsthat read.The most frequent errors in all this are:Not taking a read earlier similar but just checking it and leaving it as “clean”.Not using suppress and false on items.And of course leaving a pc thinking things are still charged by failing to indicate the F/N.Indicating an F/N before Cog.Not going back through the folder to handle ruds and items that read but were called“clean” or were simply abandoned."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"A pc audited under tension of poor TRs has a hard time and does not F/N sometimes,inviting overrun.The rules then to happy pcs are:GOOD TRs.F/N EVERYTHING FOUND ON RUDS AND LISTS.AUDIT WITH TA IN NORMAL RANGE OR REPAIR IT SO IT IS IN NORMALRANGE.L.

Misapplication of this definition can result in underrunand overrun processes or actions and the pc snarled up with BPC.TYPES OF EPsIn Power Processing the auditor waits for a specific EP and does not indicate an F/Nuntil he has gotten the specific EP for the process. To miss on this in Power is disastrous, thusPower auditors are drilled and drilled on the handling of Power EPs.In Dianetics, the EP of a chain is erasure, accompanied by an F/N, cognition and goodindicators. You wouldn’t necessarily expect rave indicators on a pc in the middle of an assist,under emotional or physical stress until the full assist was completed though. What you wouldexpect is the chain blown with an F/N. Those two things themselves are good indicators. Thecognition could simply be “the chain blew”.In Scientology, End Phenomena vary with what you’re auditing. An ARC Broken pc onan L-1C will peel off charge and come uptone gradually as each reading line is handled.Sometimes it comes in a spectacular huge cog and VVGIs and dial F/N, but that’s usually aftercharge has been taken off on a gradient. What’s expected is an F/N as that charge beinghandled moves off.In Ruds it’s the same idea. When you’ve got your F/N and that charge has moved off,indicate it. Don’t push the pc on and on for some “EP”. You’ve got it.Now a major grade process will run to F/N, Cog, VGIs and release. You’ll have anability regained. But that’s a grade process on a set up flying pc.F/N ABUSEMistakenly applying the Power EP rule to Ruds will have the pc messed up by overrun. Itinvalidates the pc’s wins and keys the charge back in. The pc will start thinking he hasn’tblown the charge and can’t do anything about it.In 1970 I had to write the HCO B “F/Ns and End Phenomena” to cure auditors ofchopping pc EPs on major actions by indicating F/Ns too soon. This is one type of F/N abusewhich has largely been handled.That bulletin and Power EP handling have been in some instances misapplied in thedirection of overrun. “The pc isn’t getting EP on these chains as there’s no cognition, just ‘it"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"erased’,” is one example. Obviously the C/S didn’t understand the definition of cognition orwhat an EP is. Another example is the pc spots what it is and F/Ns and the auditor carries on,expecting an “EP”.OTs and EPsAn OT is particularly subject to F/N abuse as he can blow things quite rapidly. If theauditor misses the F/N due to too high a sensitivity setting or doesn’t call it as he’s waiting foran “EP”, overrun occurs. It invalidates an OT’s ability to as-is and causes severe upsets.This error can also stem from auditor speed. The auditor, used to auditing lower level pcsor never trained to audit OTs, can’t keep up with the OT and misses his F/Ns or reads.Thus overruns occur and charged areas are bypassed.This could account for those cases who were flying then fell on their heads with the sameproblems that blew back again.REMEDYThe remedy of this problem begins with thoroughly clearing all terms connected withEPs. This is basically Word Clearing Method 6, Key Words.The next action is to get my HCO Bs on the subject of EPs and also related meteringHCO Bs fully understood and starrated. This would be followed by clay demos of various EPsof processes and actions showing the mechanics of the bank and what happens with the pc andmeter.TRs and meter drills on spotting F/Ns would follow, including any needed obnosis drillsand correction of meter position so that the auditor could see the pc, meter and his admin at aglance.Then, the auditor would be gradiently drilled on handling the pc, meter and admin atincreasing rates of speed including recognizing and indicating EPs when they occurred. Whenthe auditor could do all of this smoothly at the high rate of speed of an OT blowing things byinspection without fumbling, the last action would be bullbaited drills like TRs 103 and 104, ona gradient to a level of competence whereby the auditor could handle anything that came up atspeed and do so smoothly.Then you’d really have an OT auditor. And that’s what you’ll have to do to make them.SUMMARYOverrun and underrun alike mess up cases.Both stem from an auditor inability to recognize and handle different types of EPs andinexpertness in handling the tools of auditing at speed.Don’t overrun pcs and have to repair them.Let the pc have his wins.L.

A process isconsidered “flat” when it produces no more than .25 div of TA in 20 minutes. The auditor can’trecheck the last 20 minutes because he has no time noted and no Tone Arm notations.Therefore he or she audits by guess and leaves process cycles of action on the case either unflator overflattened. This alone is enough to upset pcs.Further, when two processes have been run in a session and only a counter was used, anauditing supervisor has no idea at all of whether one was flattened before the other was begun.Also “TA” for a session can be a gross error by reason of poor handling of the ToneArm. If an auditor fails to set the Tone Arm accurately each time the needle moves from “set”on the dial, less TA is shown for the session.If the auditor habitually overworks the Tone Arm, setting it further than it should havegone to bring the needle to “set”, either up or down, then the TA Counter will show far moreTA for the session than really happened.The way to handle this dilemma is to use the TA Counter only for a rough estimate of TAfor a session (or process) and to continue to record Tone Arm action at Levels III and IV. (Oneis too busy at Levels V and VI and by that time should be able to rely on the counter as TA insuch sessions is very large.)The Tone Arm is never touched during sneezing, body motion, etc, and no recording ismade. But if the TA blew down because of it, the fact is noted in the worksheet column and thenew reading entered.All meter auditing below Level V should be recorded by Time and Tone Arm position.To so record TA it is not necessary to use several pounds of Auditor’s Report forms. Oneuses one Auditor’s Report form to report on the session and similar sized rough work sheets torecord Time, TA position and what is going on. These rough work sheets are divided into twoor three vertical columns with a ball-point pen and each one of these is split in half vertically. Inthe first column enter time, in the second enter TA notes of where the Tone Arm is at that time.Take Tone Arm readings only with the needle at “set”. If something noteworthy occurs write itacross these two columns, using the spaces of Time and TA position for a brief note and belowit going on with the Time and TA position notes.One writes down the TA position with the time it happened only when the Tone Armneeds to be moved to bring the needle back to “set”. A needle that moves but comes back atonce (within 1 or 2 seconds) to “set” is not recorded. Point One (.1) division changes are notrecorded as too minute."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"One fills up these three double columns, turns over the sheet and does the same on theback.Printed Auditor’s Reports are never used as work sheets. They give the details of thebeginning of the session, condition of pc, what’s intended, the wording of the process, etc.Then one goes to work sheets and only returns to the Auditor’s Report, which is half empty, tocomplete the session and end it off with pc goals and gains and all that. The TA Counter is thenread and written on the report.This is all so written that one can see the whole session at a glance, including TA total,just by looking at the one side of the Auditor’s Report form. On that one side the sessionbegins, ends, and by seeing how the pc was at start and is at the end, and the TA Counter read,what was done and the success or failure of the session is grasped at a glance.In trying to analyze the session and help the pc more, one inspects the work sheets.When the session is completed, the work sheets are put in proper sequence (sequencequite visible because of the time notations), the Auditor’s Report is put face up on top and thelot are all stapled together by the left-hand corner. If an ordinary stapler won’t do it easily for a21/2 hr session, far too many notations are being made, for no III or IV pc is that active.Faults of Tone Arm handling (over or under setting of it by the auditor) show up, processflattening can be traced, changes of process can be seen and the auditor or the auditingsupervisor can find out what really happened.I myself wouldn’t know how to guide the next session at Levels III and IV if I didn’thave a record of TA of the last session to inspect, whether the session were mine or another’s.Such delicate judgements as “was the TA just working into the process” or “was the processingdying down” or “was it being overflattened” just can’t be answered by the auditor himself,much less an auditing supervisor if no Time-TA record exists.Also, don’t take a Tone Arm reading “every 2 minutes” or “every minute”. That’s poorbecause such timed readings tell nothing. When the TA has to be moved more than .1 divisionsto keep the needle at set, one notes Time and the new Tone Arm reading. That’s the onlyanswer to how often one reads and notes TA action.Changes of process are noted across both Time and Tone Arm columns but also atsession ending noted on the Auditor’s Report. One doesn’t often change processes and onlywhen the old one has (1 ) had time to get the TA worked into it (2) had the TA worked out of itand (3) the old one produces only .25 divisions of TA action in a consecutive 20 minutes ofauditing.The Tone Arm Counter is a must or one spends ages adding up his session TA when heneeds lunch or a break. But it jolly well never can supplant a work sheet. Automation can onlygo so far. Tone Arm Counters can’t think. The Auditors I train can.LRH:nb.cden L. RON HUBBARDCopyright © 1964by L.

The unwise supervisor will actually furnish “extraordinary solution”after “extraordinary solution” “to handle this different case”. It may be John Jones who “cannotthink of any changes in his life” or it may be Mary Smith who “just doesn’t respond to SecurityChecking”. And the supervisor burns the midnight oil and gives the auditor some new involvedsolution. Then as often as not, the auditor comes back the day after and says, “That didn’twork either.” And the supervisor goes a quarter around the bend and again burns the midnightoil .... If this seems familiar to you as a supervisor, know you should have asked, “Whatdidn’t work?” Usually the auditor can’t even recall the solution—it was never used. Or it wasapplied in some strange fashion.For today, the reasons for failure all lie under the heading “Gross Auditing Error”.Such an error would be, the auditor never arrived for the session, the E-Meter wasbroken throughout, the pc hadn’t eaten or slept for three days, the din from construction nextdoor made it impossible to give commands or hear answers. The auditor didn’t run any knownprocess. That is the order of magnitude of a “GROSS AUDITING ERROR”. It is never, the pcwas unhappy, the pc has difficulty remembering, etc. In supervising auditing, always look forthe gross auditing error and never give out with an extra-ordinary solution.Well, taking my own advice, when I saw some tricky elements in new clearing processestaking far too much time, I didn’t look for “different” pcs, I looked for the gross auditing error.And found it.The auditors who were having trouble couldn’t read an E-Meter.Impossible as that may seem, it proved to be true. I put Mary Sue on this at once andHerbie Parkhouse carried through. The errors found in E-Meter reading where there had beentrouble, were so huge as to have been missed on any casual inspection.The errors went like this:1. The auditor believed the E-Meter could not be read while the needle was swingingaround. The auditor was waiting until it stopped every time before asking aquestion.2. The auditor believed the needle had to be exactly at “set” on the dial before it couldbe read.3. The auditor did not know a rising needle could be read by stopping the rise with a"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"question or making the needle twitch.4. The auditor had not done the body reaction drills in E-Meter Essentials and wasreading only body reactions and ignoring all others.5. The auditor thought an E-Meter could not be read if it showed breathing or heartbeat.6. The auditor always looked at the pc for a few seconds after asking the question,then looked at the meter, and so missed all but latent (non-significant) reads.7. The auditor sat staring at the meter for twenty seconds after the reading hadregistered.8. The auditor thought E-Meters could be fooled so easily, it was more reliable tomake up his own mind about what the pc’s item or guilt was.9. An auditor thought that if the needle rose on a rudiment question, the rudiment wasout.These and many, many more panned out to be:IF A SECURITY CHECK OR PROBLEMS INTENSIVE WAS PRODUCING NORESULTS, IT WAS BECAUSE THE AUDITOR COULD NOT READ AN E-METER.That’s the gross auditing error.In this bulletin, I am not trying to give you any methods to remedy this. I am just callingit widely to everyone’s attention.The fact is big enough to merit study by itself.And to get cases started by no other mechanism than learning to really read an E-Meter orby teaching people to read it.This one point remedied could change the entire future of Scientology, an organization oran auditor.

An instant read may be anychange of characteristic providing it occurs instantly. The absence of a read at the end of themajor thought shows it to be nul.All prior reads and latent reads are ignored. These are the result of minor thoughts whichmay or may not be restimulated by the question.Only the instant read is used by the auditor. Only the instant read is cleared on rudiments,What questions, etc.The instant read may consist of any needle reaction, rise, fall, speeded rise, speeded fall,double tick (dirty needle), theta bop or any other action so long as it occurs at the exact end ofthe major thought being expressed by the auditor. If no reaction occurs at exactly that place (theend of the major thought) the question is nul.By “major thought” is meant the complete thought being expressed in words by theauditor. Reads which occur prior to the completion of the major thought are “prior reads”.Reads which occur later than its completion are “latent reads”.By “minor thought” is meant subsidiary thoughts expressed by words within the majorthought. They are caused by the reactivity of individual words within the full words. They areignored.Example: “Have you ever injured dirty pigs?”To the pc the words “you”, “injured” and “dirty” are all reactive. Therefore, the minorthoughts expressed by these words also read on the meter.The major thought here is the whole sentence. Within this thought are the minor thoughts“you”, “injured” and “dirty”.Therefore the E-Meter needle may respond this way: “Have you (fall) ever injured(speeded fall) dirty (fall) pigs (fall)?”Only the major thought gives the instant read and only the last fall (bold-italic type in thesentence above) indicates anything. If that last reaction was absent, the whole sentence is nuldespite the prior falls.You can release the reactions (but ordinarily would not) on each of these minor thoughts.Exploring these prior reads is called “compartmenting the question”.Paying attention to minor thought reads gives us laughable situations as in the case,written in 1960, of “getting P.D.H.ed by the cat”. By accepting these prior reads one can proveanything. Why? Because Pain and Drug and Hypnosis are minor thoughts within the major"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"thought: “Have you ever been P.D.H.ed by a cat?” The inexpert auditor would believe such asilly thing had happened. But notice that if each minor thought is cleaned out of the majorthought it no longer reacts as a whole fact. If the person on the meter had been P.D.H.ed by acat, then only the discovery of the origin of the whole thought would clean up the wholethought.Pcs also think about other things while being asked questions and these random personalrestimulations also read before and after an instant read and are ignored. Very rarely, a pc’sthinks react exactly at the end of a major thought and so confuse the issue, but this is rare.We want the read that occurs instantly after the last syllable of the major thought withoutlag. That is the only read we regard in finding a rudiment in or out, to find if a goal reacts, etc.That is what is called an “instant read”.There is a package rudiment question in the half truth, etc. We are doing four rudimentsin one and therefore have four major thoughts in one sentence. This packaging is the onlyapparent exception but is actually no exception. It’s just a fast way of doing four rudiments inone sentence.A clumsy question which puts “in this session” at the end of the major thought can servethe auditor badly. Such modifiers should come before the sentence, “In this session have you........?”You are giving the major thought directly to the reactive mind. Therefore any analyticalthought will not react instantly.The reactive mind is composed of:1. Timelessness.2. Unknownness.3. Survival.The meter reacts on the reactive mind, never on the analytical mind. The meter reactsinstantly on any thought restimulated in the reactive mind.If the meter reacts on anything, that datum is partly or wholly unknown to the preclear.An auditor’s questions restimulate the reactive mind. This reacts on the meter.Only reactive thoughts react instantly.You can “groove in” a major thought by saying it twice. On the second time (or third timeif it is longer) you will see only the instant read at the exact end. If you do this the prior readsdrop out leaving only the whole thought.If you go stumbling around in rudiments or goals trying to clean up the minor thoughtsyou will get lost. In sec checking you can uncover material by “compartmenting the question”but this is rarely done today. In rudiments, What questions, et al, you want the instant readonly. It occurs exactly at the end of the whole thought. This is your whole interest in cleaning arudiment or a What question. You ignore all prior and latent reactions of the needle.The exceptions to this rule are:1. “Compartmenting the question”, in which you use the prior reads occurring at theexact end of the minor thoughts (as above in the pigs sentence) to dig up different data notrelated to the whole thought."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"2. “Steering the pc” is the only use of latent or random reads. You see a read the sameas the instant read occurring again when you are not speaking but after you have found a wholethought reacting. You say “there” or “that” and the pc, seeing what he or she is looking at asyou say it, recovers the knowledge from the reactive bank and gives the data and the wholethought clears or has to be further worked and cleared.You can easily figure-figure yourself half to death trying to grapple with meter readsunless you get a good reality on the instant read which occurs at the end of the whole expressedthought and neglect all prior and latent reads except for steering the pc while he gropes for theanswer to the question you asked.That’s the whole of reading an E-Meter needle.(Two Saint Hill lectures of 24 May 1962 cover this in full.)L.

This is not a prior read. Preclears poorly in session, being handled byauditors with indifferent TR One, anticipate the instant read reactively as they are under theirown control. Such a read occurs into the body of the last meaningful word in the question. Itnever occurs latent.In other words all reads occurring when the major thought has been received by thepreclear must be taken up and cleaned. This does not mean all needle reactions occurring whilequestion is being asked must be cleaned, but it does mean that the instant read is often to befound before the last meaningful word is spoken fully, and it is catastrophic not to take it upand clean it.Goals and items are however read only when the read occurs exactly at the end of the lastword.This will give you cleaner sessions and smoother needles.

The coach’s needle is dirty. The student’s out comm cycle has cut his comm insome way, but PRIOR to that the coach failed to flunk the part of the comm cyclethat went out. Correct flunking by coaches equals students with no dirty needles.2. If a coach’s TA starts climbing on a drill and the needle gets sticky, it means that thestudent’s comm cycle has dispersed him and pushed him out of PT. The coach iseither (1) not flunking at all (2) flunking the incorrect thing.3. The correct flunking by the coach of an out comm cycle, which has dispersed himand pushed his TA up, will always result in a TA blowdown. If there is noblowdown, the coach has flunked the wrong thing.4. Needle not responding well and sensitively on assessment drills, although theneedle clean. Coach has failed to flunk TR 1 (or TR0) for lack of impingement andreach.5. Coach reaching forward and leaning on the table, means TR 1 is out with thestudent.6. Student asking coach for considerations to get TA down, but TA climbing on theconsiderations—the coach is cleaning a clean, instead of flunking the out commcycle, which occurred earlier and pushed his TA up.7. Student getting coach’s considerations off to clean the needle, but needle remainingdirty—student is cutting the coach’s comm while getting the considerations off andthe coach is not picking this up.8. Students shouting or talking very loudly on assessment drills to try and get theMeter to read by overwhelm. The reason for this is invariably—”but I’m assessingthe bank!” They haven’t realized that banks don’t read, only thetans impinged uponby the bank—therefore the TR1 must be addressed to the thetan. The meterresponds proportionately to the amount of ARC in the Session.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH:emp.rdCopyright © 1965by L.

But just as amatter of record, the following session must-nots should be taught in letters of fire to any newauditor.INEVER tell a pc what his present time problem is.The pc’s PTP is exactly and only what the pc thinks or says it is.To tell a pc what his PTP is and then audit what the auditor said it was will inevitablyARC Break the pc.This of course is under the heading of Evaluation in the Auditor’s Code and is one way ofevaluating, a very serious way too.IINEVER set a goal for a pc.Don’t set a session goal, a life or livingness goal or any other kind of a goal.Auditors get tangled up on this because everybody has the same R6 goals and when youcall out the next goal from the list it appears you are giving the pc a goal. But an R6 educated pcknows that and it isn’t evaluation.Other goals are highly variable. The pc’s life and livingness goals and session goals areespecially variable pc to pc and even within one session on the same pc.To tell a pc what goals to set for a session or for life is to upset the pc.If you don’t believe it, trace some pc’s upsets with their parents and you will find theseusually trace back to the parents’ setting life and livingness goals for the child or youth.The pc’s session and life and livingness goals are the pc’s and for an auditor to deny,refute, criticize or try to change them gives ARC Breaks; and for an auditor to dream up a brandnew one for the pc is especially evaluative.IIINEVER tell a pc what’s wrong with him physically or assume that you know.What’s wrong with the pc is whatever the pc says or thinks is wrong physically.This applies of course only to processing, for if you weren’t auditing the person, and ifthe person had a sore foot and you found a splinter in it and told him so, it would be all right."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"But even in this case the person would have had to tell you he had a sore foot.The main reason society has such a distaste for medical doctors is the MDs’ continuous“diagnosis” of things the person has not complained of. The violence of surgery, thedestruction of lives by medical treatment rather educates people not to mention certain things.Instinctively the patient knows that the treatment may leave him or her in much worse conditionand so sometimes hides things. For the medical doctor to cry “Aha” and tell the person he orshe has some undefinable ill is to drive many into deep apathy and accounts for the highfrequency of operational shock wherein the person just doesn’t recover.So NEVER tell a pc what is physically wrong with him. If you suspect something isphysically wrong that some known physical treatment might cure send the pc for a physicalcheck-up just to be safe.In the field of healing by mental or spiritual means, the pc is sick because he or she hashad a series of considerations about being sick. Deformity or illness, according to the tenets ofmental healing, traces back to mentally created or re-created masses, engrams or ideas whichcan be either de-stimulated or erased completely. Destimulation results in a temporary recoveryfor an indefinite period (which is nonetheless a recovery). Erasure results in permanentrecovery. (De-stimulation is the most certain, feasible and most rewarding action below LevelVI; erasure below Level VI is too prone to error in unskilled hands as experience has taughtus.)The reality of the auditor is often violated by a pc’s statement of what ails him. The pc isstone blind—but the pc says he has “foot trouble”. Obviously, from the auditor’s viewpoint, itis blindness that troubles this pc. BUT IF THE AUDITOR TRIED TO AUDIT THEAILMENT THE PC HAS NOT OFFERED, AN ARC BREAK WILL OCCUR.The pc is ailing from what the pc is ailing from, not from what the auditor selects.For it is the statement of the pc that is the first available lock on a chain of incidents and torefuse it is to cut the pc’s communication and to refuse the lock. After that you won’t be able tohelp this pc and that’s that.PERMITTED AUDITOR STATEMENTSThere are, however, two areas where the auditor must make a statement to the pc andassume the initiative.These are in the OVERT—MOTIVATOR SEQUENCE and in the ARC BREAK.AWhen the pc is critical of the auditor, the organization or any of many things in life, this isalways a symptom of overts priorly committed by the pc.The pc is looking for motivators. These criticisms are simply justifications and nothingmore.This is a sweeping fully embracive statement—and a true one. There are no criticisms inthe absence of overts committed earlier by the pc.It is quite permissible for the auditor to start looking for the overt, providing the auditorfinds it and gets it stated by the pc and therefore relieved.But even here the auditor only states there is an overt. The auditor NEVER says what the"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"overt is for that’s evaluation.You will be amazed at what the pc considered was the overt. It is almost never what wewould think it should be.But also, an auditor whose pc is critical of him or her in session who does not say, “Itsounds like you have an overt there. Let’s find it,” is being neglectful of his job.The real test of a professional auditor, the test that separates the unskilled from the skilledis: CAN YOU GET AN OVERT OFF THE PC’S CASE WITHOUT ARC BREAKING THEPC AND YET GET IT OFF.The nice balance between demanding the pc get off an overt and getting it off anddemanding the pc get off an overt and failing to get it off but ARC Breaking the pc is the borderline between the unskilled and the professional.If you demand it and don’t do it you’ll ARC Break the pc thoroughly. If you fail todemand it for fear of an ARC Break you’ll have a lowered graph on the pc. The pro demandsthe overt be gotten off only when necessary and plows on until it’s gotten off and the pcbrightens up like a lighthouse. The amateur soul-searches himself and struggles and fails innumerous ways—by demanding the wrong overt, by accepting a critical comment as an overt,by not asking at all for fear of an ARC Break, by believing the pc’s criticism is deserved—allsorts of ways. And the amateur lowers the pc’s graph.Demanding an overt is not confined to just running O/W or some similar process. It’s abackbone auditing tool that is used when it has to be used. And not used when it doesn’t haveto be.The auditor must have understood the whole of the overt-motivator theory to use thisintelligently.BIndicating by-passed charge is a necessary auditor action which at first glance may seemevaluative.However, the by-passed charge is never what the pc says it was if the pc is still ARCBroken.By-Passed Charge is, however, found by the meter and the pc has actually got it or itwouldn’t register. So the pc has really volunteered it in a round-about way—first by acting likehe or she has by-passed charge and then by bank reaction on the meter.Always indicate to the pc the by-passed charge you find on the meter.Never tell a pc what the by-passed charge is if you don’t know.A Class VI auditor knows all goals but the goals are wrong and often sloppily just tellspeople at random they have “a wrong goal” knowing this to be probable. But it’s very risky.If you find it on the meter, telling the pc what the by-passed charge is is not evaluation.Telling the pc “what it is” without having found it is evaluation of the worst sort.

We call this a “dangerous auditor”.There are certain exact specific actions or omissions that make such an auditor dangerous.These are:1. Breaks the Auditor’s Code or ignores it as “only applying in certain cases”.2. Audits past floating needles or directs additional auditing on that process when afloating needle has occurred.3. Ceases to audit a process before the needle has gone free.4. Starts a new grade of release without rehabilitation or making sure at least by recordthat an earlier grade has been rehabbed and was not overrun.5. Does not locate the right SP on S & D but over or under lists or misses whileassessing.6. Goes on auditing the pc after an ARC Break without caring for the ARC Break (andbelieves it possible or usual to continue past one).7. Consistently has hostile and derogatory opinions about his pcs.These are the really dangerous points that make an auditor who does them dangerous.(This list is composed by tracing back upset cases to the errors which made the upset.)An auditor who merely makes the five Gross Auditing Errors is just a bad auditor. (SeeHCO B 21 Sept 65 “Out Tech”.)A dangerous auditor often seems to be quite accomplished, but does the above. On somepcs he seems to get away with it and so will argue the virtue of his approach or violations. Buton the next pc he doesn’t and has a mess on his hands.A “careful” auditor is not necessarily not dangerous. One doesn’t audit carefully. Oneaudits with a relaxed competence that follows the rules and avoids the errors listed above.There is no compromise for knowing one’s business.Most auditors, when they are trained and no longer make the 5 Gross Auditing Errors,become very excellent auditors and do a fine job and I am proud of them.LRH:ml.cden L.

The basic answer to aquestion is, obviously, a question if one follows the duplication of the Comm formulacompletely. See Philadelphia Congress 1953 tapes where this was covered very fully. A laterdefinition was “Questioning the pc’s Answer”. Another effort to overcome it and explain Q &A was the Anti-Q and A drill. But none of these reached home.The new definition is this:Q AND A IS A FAILURE TO COMPLETE A CYCLE OF ACTION ON A PRECLEAR.A CYCLE OF ACTION IS REDEFINED AS START—CONTINUE—COMPLETE.Thus an auditing comm cycle is a cycle of action. It starts with the auditor asking aquestion the preclear can understand, getting the preclear to answer it and acknowledging thatanswer.A process cycle is selecting a process to be run on the preclear, running the Tone Armaction into it (if necessary) and running the Tone Arm action out of it.A programme cycle is selecting an action to be performed, performing that action andcompleting it.Thus you can see that an auditor who interrupts or changes an auditing comm cycle beforeit is complete is “Q and A-ing”. This could be done by violating or preventing or not doing anypart of the auditing cycle, i.e., ask the pc a question, get an answer to a different idea, ask thedifferent idea, thus abandoning the original question.An auditor who starts a process, just gets it going, gets a new idea because of pccognition, takes up the cognition and abandons the original process is Q and A-ing.A programme such as “Prepcheck this pc’s family” is begun, and for any reason leftincomplete to go chasing some new idea to Prepcheck, is a Q and A.Unfinished cycles of action are all that louse up cases.Since Time is a continuum, a failure to carry out a cycle of action (a continuum) hangs thepc up at that exact point.If you don’t believe it, prepcheck “Incomplete actions” on a pc! What Incomplete action"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"has been suppressed? etc, cleaning the meter for real on every button. And you’d have aclear—or a pc that would behave that way on a meter.Understand this and you’ll be about ninety times as effective as an auditor.“Don’t Q and A!” means “Don’t leave cycles of action incomplete on a pc.”The gains you hope to achieve on a pc are lost when you Q and A.LRH:dr.rd.cden  L.

Italso means not getting compliance with an order but accepting something else.Example: Auditor: Do birds fly? Pc: I don’t like birds. Auditor: What don’t you like aboutbirds? FLUNK. It’s a Q and A. The right reply would be an answer to the question asked andthe right action would be to get the original question answered. TR 4 (handling origins) canapply here. The moment TR 4 is violated (Ack and return the pc to original Question) and theoriginal unanswered question is not again asked the Auditor just drifts along with the pc.Things get restimulated, nothing gets really handled or run.In Administration the same thing can happen. The executive gives an order, the juniorsays or does something else, the executive does not simply TR 4 it and get the original orderdone, and the result is chaos.Executive: Phone Mr. Schultz and tell him our printing order will be there this afternoon.Junior: I don’t know his number. Executive: Don’t you have a phone book? Junior: The phonecompany didn’t send one this year as our bill was overdue. Executive (the fool) goes toAccounts to see what about the phone bill.

Executive:What happened to them? Junior: Mimeo goofed. Executive: I’ll go see Mimeo ....DISPERSALQ and A is simply Postulate Aberration.Aberration is non-straight line by definition.A sick thetan who is all caved in can’t direct a postulate at anything. When he tries, he letsit wobble around and go elsewhere.The difference between a Degraded Being and an OT is simply that the DB can’t put out apostulate or intention in a direct line or way and make it hold good.The insane are a great example of this. They are insane because they have evil intentions.But they can’t even make these stick. They may intend to burn down the house but they usuallywind up watering the rug or do some other non sequitur thing. It’s not that they don’t messthings up. The whole point here is that they can’t even properly destroy what they intend todestroy. Even their evil intentions wobble, poor things."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"But not all people who Q and A are insane.When a person is running at effect he Qs and As.He is confronted by life, he does not confront it.He is usually a bit blind to things as his ability to look AT is turned back on him by hislack of beam power. Thus he gives the appearance of being unaware.His emotional feeling is overwhelm.His mental state is confusion.He starts for B, winds up at—A.Other not too well intentioned people can play tricks on a Qer and Aer. When they don’twant to answer or comply they artfully bring about a Q and A.Example: Bosco does not want to staple the mimeo issue. He knows his senior Qs andAs. So we get this. Senior: Staple that issue with the big stapler. Bosco: I hurt my thumb. Qand A Senior: Have you been to see the Medical Officer? Bosco: He wouldn’t look at it. Q andA Senior: I’ll go have a word with him. (Departs.) Bosco gets back to reading “Jesse JamesRides Again” humming softly to himself. For HIS trouble is, he Qs and As with the MestUniverse!BODY Q AND ASome people Q and A with their bodies. The body is, after all, composed of Mest. Itfollows the laws of Mest.One of these laws is Newton’s first law of motion: INERTIA. This is the tendency of aMest object to remain motionless until acted upon by an exterior force. Or to continue in a lineof motion until acted upon by an exterior force.Well, the main force around that is continually acting on a human body is a thetan, thebeing himself.The body will remain at rest (since it is a Mest Object) until acted upon by the thetan thatis supposed to be running it.If that being is an aberrated non-straight line being THE BODY REACTS ON HIMMORE THAN HE REACTS ON THE BODY. Thus he remains motionless or very slow.When the body is in unwanted motion, the being does not deter the motion as the body is actingupon him far more than he is reacting on the body.As a result, one of the manifestations is Q and A. He wants to pick up a piece of paper.The body inertia has to be overcome to do so. So he does not reach for the paper, he just leavesthe hand where it is. This would be no action at all. If he then weakly forces the motion, hefinds himself picking up something else like a paper clip, decides he wants that anyway andsettles for it. Now he has to invent why he has a paper clip in his hand. His original intentionnever gets executed.Some people on medical lines are just there not because of actual illness but because theyare just Qing and Aing with their body.People also Q and A with themselves. They want to stop drinking and can’t. They wantto stop or change something about themselves or their body and then disperse off ontosomething else."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Freud read all sorts of dire and awful things into simple Q and A.

All Freud succeeded in doing was making theperson introspective looking for wrong whys.The right why was simple—the person could not go in a straight line to an objectiveand/or could not cease to do something he was compulsively doing.The very word ABERRATION contains the idea of this—no straight line but a bent one.THE CURE FOR THIS SORT OF THING (Q and A with a body) IS OBJECTIVEPROCESSES.And a very willing and bright thetan CAN simply recognize it for what it is—not enoughpush!And instead of going to the MO for a slight ache, he just pushes on through.As the ache is a recoil of body Q and A in a lot of cases, the ache itself goes away as soonas one simply pushes through.Painters and artists buy the idea they are benefited by aberration. “Be glad you areneurotic” was a trick being played by the late and unlamented psychiatrists on artists.One paints because he can push into execution what he visualizes. The best painters werethe least aberrated.Greenwich Village or Left Bank artists, when they don’t paint, never suspect it’s becausethey just can’t overcome hand inertia to push a paint brush!People live Q and A lives. They never become what they desire to be because they Q andA with life about it.Schopenhauer, the German philosopher of doom, even had a dirty crack about being ableto do things: “Stubbornness is the will taking the place of the intellect.” By this, one is“intellectual” if he Qs and As.SUMMARYPeople who can’t get things done are simply Qing and Aing with people and life.People who CAN get things done just don’t Q and A.All great truths are simple.This is a major one.

And it may take hours to do a touchassist on an accident victim. What characterizes an assist is that it is done rapidly and informallyand anywhere.“Coffee Shop Auditing” isn’t really an assist as it is usually done over coffee too casuallyto be dignified by the name of auditing. The pc is never informed at all of the existence of asession.The pc, in an assist, is however informed of the fact and the assist is begun by “This isthe Assist” and ended by a “That’s it”, so an assist, like a session, has a beginning and an end.The Auditor’s Code is observed in giving an Assist and the Auditing Comm Cycle isused.As an Auditor one sets out in an Assist to accomplish a specific thing for the pc likerelieve the snivels or make the ache in the leg better. So an Assist also has a very finitepurpose.SECONDARY STYLESEvery level has a different primary STYLE OF AUDITING. But sometimes in actualsessions or particularly in Assists this Style is altered slightly for special purposes. The Style"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"altered for assists is called a SECONDARY STYLE. It doesn’t mean that the primary style ofthe level is merely loosely done. It means that it is done a precise but different way toaccomplish assists. This variation is called the SECONDARY STYLE of that level.REMEDIESA Remedy is not necessarily an Assist and is often done in regular session. It is theRemedy itself which determines what auditing style is used to administer it. Some Remedies,as well as being used in regular sessions, can also be used as Assists.In short, that a process exists as a Remedy has no bearing on whether it is used in anAssist or a Model Session.GUIDING STYLEThe essence of Guiding Style is:1. Locate what’s awry with the pc.2. Run a Repetitive Process to handle what’s found in 1.In essence—steer the pc into disclosing something that needs auditing and then audit it.GUIDING SECONDARY STYLEGuiding Secondary Style differs from proper Guiding Style and is done by:1. Steering-the pc toward revealing something or something revealed;2. Handling it with Itsa.Guiding Secondary Style differs from Guiding Style only in that Guiding SecondaryStyle handles the matter by Steer + Itsa. Guiding Style Proper handles the matter with Steer +Repetitive Process.DEFINITIONS PROCESSINGDefinitions Processes, when used as Remedies, are normally processed by GuidingSecondary Style.Both Remedies of The Book of Case Remedies A and B are Guiding Secondary Style intheir normal application.One would expect them to be used by a Class II Auditor.One would expect the Assist to last 10 or 15 minutes, perhaps more, but less than aregular session would take.One would expect that any case in a PE class, any student that was getting nowhere,would be handled by the Instructor with Guiding Secondary Style using Remedies A and B asprecision processes.REMEDY A PATTEROne would not expect the person or student in trouble to be turned over to another studentfor handling. It’s too fast, sharp and easy to handle that trouble oneself if one is Class II or"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"above and far more certain. You can do it while you’d be finding another student to do theauditing. It would be uneconomical in terms of time not to just do it right then—no meter—leaning up against a desk.The auditor’s patter would be something like what follows. The pc’s responses and Itsaare omitted in this example.“I am going to give you a short assist.” “All right, what word haven’t you understood inScientology?” “Okay, it’s pre-clear. Explain what it means.” “Okay, I see you are havingtrouble, so what does pre mean?” “Fine. Now what does clear mean?” “Good. I’m glad yourealize you had it mixed up with patient and see that they’re different.” “Thank you. That’s it.”In between the above total of auditing patter, the student may have hemmed and hawedand argued and cognited. But one just steered the pc straight along the subject selected and gotit audited and cleaned up. If the student gave a glib text book definition after challenging theword preclear, we wouldn’t buy it, but would give the student a piece of paper or a rubberband and say “Demonstrate that.” And then carry on as it developed.And that would be Remedy A.You see it is precision auditing and is a process and does have an Auditing Style. And itworks like a dream.You see this is Steer + Itsa as to its style. And that it addressed the immediate subject.What makes A Remedy A is not that it handles Scientology definitions, but that it handlesthe immediate subject under discussion or study.REMEDY BWhat makes Remedy B Remedy B is that it seeks out and handles a former subject,conceived to be similar to the immediate subject, in order to clear up misunderstandings in theimmediate subject or condition.Remedy B, run on some person or student, would simply be a bit more complex thanRemedy A as it looks into the past.A person has a continuous confusion with policy or auditors, etc. So one runs B like this(the following is auditor patter only):“I’m going to give you an Assist. Okay?” “All right. What subject were you mixed upwith before Scientology?” “I’m sure there is one.” “Okay. Spiritualism. Fine. What word inSpiritualism didn’t you understand?” “You can think of it.” “Good. Ectoplasm. Fine. Whatwas the definition of that?” “All right, there’s a dictionary over there, look it up.” “I’m sorry itdoesn’t give the spiritualist definition. But you say it says Ecto means outside. What’s plasm?”“Well, look it up.” “All right. I see, Ecto means outside and plasm means mould or covering.”(Note: You don’t always break up words into parts for definition in A & B Remedies.) “Yes,I’ve got that. Now what do you think spiritualists meant by it?” “All right, I’m glad you realizethat sheets over people make ghosts ghosts.” “Fine, glad you recalled being scared as a child.”“All right, what did the spiritualist mean then?” “Okay. Glad you see thetans don’t need to becased in goo.” “All right. Fine. Good. You had Ectoplasm mixed up with engrams and younow realize thetans don’t have to have a bank and can be naked. Fine. That’s it.” (Note: Youdon’t always repeat after him what the pc said, but sometimes it helps.)Student departs still cogniting. Enters Scientology now having left Spiritualism on theback track. Doesn’t keep on trying to make every HCO Bulletin studied solve “Ectoplasm”, theburied misunderstood word that kept him stuck in Spiritualism."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"DEFINITIONS PURPOSEThe purpose of definitions processing is fast clearing of “held down fives” (jammedthinking because of a misunderstood or misapplied datums) preventing someone getting onwith auditing or Scientology.Remedies A and B are not always used as Assists. They are also used in regular sessions.But when so used they are always used with Guiding Secondary Style—Steer + Itsa.As a comment, people who seek to liken Scientology to something, “Oh, like ChristianScience,” are stuck in Christian Science. Don’t say, “Oh no! It isn’t like Christian Science!”Just nod and mark them for a fast assist or a session the moment the chance offers if they seemvery disinterested or aloof when asked to a PE Course.There’s weapons in that arsenal, auditor. Use them.As Remedies A and B stand as the first and second given in The Book of Case Remedies,so before a large number of potential Scientologists stands the confusion of definitions.We have made Scientology definitions easy for them by compiling a dictionary, usingwords new to people only when useful.But those that don’t come along at all, are so wound up in some past subject they can’thear or think when that earlier subject is restimulated. And that earlier subject is held down onlyby some word or phrase they didn’t grasp.Some poor pawn howling for the blood of Scientologists isn’t mad at Scientology at all.But at some earlier practice he got stuck in with mis-definition of its terms.You see, we inherit some of the effects of the whole dullness of Man when we seek toopen the prison door and say, “Look. Sunshine in the fields. Walk out.” Some, who needRemedy B say: “Oh no! The last time somebody scratched the wall that way I got stupider.”Why say, “Hey. I’m not scratching the wall. I’m opening the gate”? Why bother. He can’t hearyou. But he can hear Remedy B as an assist. That’s the channel to his comprehension.UNDERSTANDINGWhen a person can’t understand something and yet goes on facing up to it, he gets into a“problems situation” with it. There it is over there, yet he can’t make it out.Infrequently (fortunately for us) the being halts time right there. Anything he conceives tobe similar presented to his view is the puzzle itself (A=A=A). And he goes stupid. Thishappens rarely in the life of one being, but it happens to many people.Thus there aren’t many such messes in one person in one lifetime that have to be cleanedup. But there are a few in many people.The cycle of Mis-definition is:1. didn’t grasp a word, then2. didn’t understand a principle or theory, then3. became different from it, commits and committed overts against it, then4. restrained himself or was restrained from committing those overts, then5. being on a withhold (inflow) pulled in a motivator."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Not every word somebody didn’t grasp was followed by a principle or theory. An overtwas not committed every time this happened. Not every overt committed was restrained. So nomotivator was pulled in.But when it did happen, it raised havoc with the mentality of the being when trying tothink about what seem to be similar subjects.You see, you are looking at the basic incident + its locks as in a chain of incidents. Thecharge that is apparently on the lock in present time is actually only in the basic incident. Thelocks borrow the charge of the basic incident and are not themselves causing anything. So youhave a basic misunderstood word which then charges up the whole subject as a lock; then asubject charging up similar subjects as locks.Every nattery or non-progressing student or pc is hung up in the above 1, 2, 3, 4, 5cycle. And every such student or pc has a misdefined word at the bottom of that pile. If thecondition is new and temporary it’s a Scientology word that’s awry. If natter, no progress, etc,is continuous and doesn’t cease when all is explained in Scientology or when attempts tostraighten up Scientology words fail, then it’s an earlier subject at fault. Hence, Remedies Aand B. Hence Guiding Secondary Style. Hence, the fact that Definitions Processes areprocesses. And VITAL processes they are if one wants a smooth organization, a smooth PE, asmooth record of wins on all pcs. And if one wants to bring people into Scientology who seemto want to stay out.Of course these Remedies A and B are early-on processes, to be audited by a Class II orabove on a Level 0 or I pc or student. However, some in Scientology, as of this date, arestudying slowly or progressing poorly because A and B haven’t been applied.One expects that very soon, now that auditors have this data, there will be nobody atupper levels with his definitions dangling.

Here theyare given names and assigned to Levels so that they can be taught moreeasily and so that general auditing can be improved.(Note 2: These have not been written before because I had notdetermined the results vital to each Level.)There is a Style of auditing for each class. By Style is meant a method or custom ofperforming actions.A Style is not really determined by the process being run so much. A Style is how theauditor addresses his task.Different processes carry different style requirements perhaps, but that is not the point.Clay Table Healing at Level III can be run with Level I style and still have some gains. But anauditor trained up to the style required at Level III would do a better job not only of CT Healingbut of any repetitive process.Style is how the auditor audits. The real expert can do them all, but only after he can doeach one. Style is a mark of Class. It is not individual. In our meaning, it is a distinct way tohandle the tools of auditing.LEVEL ZEROLISTEN STYLEAt Level 0 the Style is Listen Style Auditing. Here the auditor is expected to listen to thepc. The only skill necessary is listening to another. As soon as it is ascertained that the auditoris listening (not just confronting or ignoring) the auditor can be checked out. The length of timean auditor can listen without tension or strain showing could be a factor. What the pc does isnot a factor considered in judging this style. Pcs, however, talk to an auditor who is reallylistening.Here we have the highest point that old-time mental therapies reached (when they didreach it), such as psychoanalysis, when they helped anyone. Mostly they were well below this,evaluating, invalidating, interrupting. These three things are what the instructor in this styleshould try to put across to the HAS student.Listen Style should not be complicated by expecting more of the auditor than just this:Listen to the pc without evaluating, invalidating or interrupting.Adding on higher skills like “Is the pc talking interestingly?” or even “Is the pc talking?”is no part of this style. When this auditor gets in trouble and the pc won’t talk or isn’tinterested, a higher classed auditor is called in, a new question given by the supervisor, etc.It really isn’t “Itsa” to be very technical. Itsa is the action of the pc saying, “It’s a this” or“It’s a that.” Getting the pc to Itsa is quite beyond Listen Style auditors where the pc won’t. It’sthe supervisor or the question on the blackboard that gets the pc to Itsa."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"The ability to listen, learned well, stays with the auditor up through the grades. Onedoesn’t cease to use it even at Level VI. But one has to learn it somewhere and that’s at LevelZero. So Listen Style Auditing is just listening. It thereafter adds into the other styles.LEVEL ONEMUZZLED AUDITINGThis could also be called rote style auditing.Muzzled Auditing has been with us many years. It is the stark total of TRs 0 to 4 and notanything else added.It is called so because auditors too often added in comments, Qed and Aed, deviated,discussed and otherwise messed up a session. Muzzle meant a “muzzle was put on them”,figuratively speaking, so they would only state the auditing command and ack.Repetitive Command Auditing, using TRs 0 to 4, at Level One is done completelymuzzled.This could be called Muzzled Repetitive Auditing Style but will be called “Muzzled Style”for the sake of brevity.It has been a matter of long experience that pcs who didn’t make gains with the partiallytrained auditor permitted to two-way comm, did make gains the instant the auditor wasmuzzled: to wit, not permitted to do a thing but run the process, permitted to say nothing butthe commands and acknowledge them and handle pc originations by simple acknowledgmentwithout any other question or comment.At Level One we don’t expect the auditor to do anything but state the command (or ask thequestion) with no variation, acknowledge the pc’s answer and handle the pc origins byunderstanding and acknowledging what the pc said.Those processes used at Level One actually respond best to muzzled auditing and worst tomisguided efforts to “Two-Way Comm”.Listen Style combines with Muzzled Style easily. But watch out that Level One sessionsdon’t disintegrate to Level Zero.Crisp, clean repetitive commands, muzzled, given and answered often, are the road out—not pc wanderings.A pc at this Level is instructed in exactly what is expected of him, exactly what the auditorwill do. The pc is even put through a few “do birds fly?” cycles until the pc gets the idea. Thenthe processing works.An auditor trying to do Muzzled Repetitive Auditing on a pc who, through past “therapyexperience”, is rambling on and on is a sad sight. It means that control is out (or that the pcnever got above Level Zero).It’s the number of commands given and answered in a unit of auditing time that gets gains.To that add the correctly chosen repetitive process and you have a release in short order, usingthe processes of this Level.To follow limp Listen Style with crisp, controlled Muzzled Style may be a shock. But theyare each the lowest of the two families of auditing styles—Totally Permissive and TotallyControlled. And they are so different each is easy to learn with no confusion. It’s been the lackof difference amongst styles that confuses the student into slopping about. Well, these two are"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"different enough—Listen Style and Muzzled Style—to set anybody straight.LEVEL TWOGUIDING STYLE AUDITINGAn old-time auditor would have recognized this style under two separate names: (a) Two-Way Comm and (b) Formal Auditing.We condense these two old styles under one new name: Guiding Style Auditing.One first guides the pc by “two-way comm” into some subject that has to be handled orinto revealing what should be handled and then the auditor handles it with formal repetitivecommands.Guiding Style Auditing becomes feasible only when a student can do Listen Style andMuzzled Style Auditing well.Formerly the student who couldn’t confront or duplicate a command took refuge insloppy discussions with the pc and called it auditing or “Two-Way Comm”.The first thing to know about Guiding Style is that one lets the pc talk and Itsa withoutchop, but also gets the pc steered into the proper subject and gets the job done with repetitivecommands.We presuppose the auditor at this Level has had enough case gain to be able to occupy theviewpoint of the auditor and therefore to be able to observe the pc. We also presuppose at thisLevel that the auditor, being able to occupy a viewpoint, is therefore more self-determined, thetwo things being related. (One can only be self-determined when one can observe the actualsituation before one: otherwise a being is delusion-determined or other-determined.)Thus in Guiding Style Auditing, the auditor is there to find out what’s what from the pcand then apply the needful remedy.Most of the processes in the Book of Remedies are included in this Level (II). To usethose, one has to observe the pc, discover what the pc is doing, and remedy the pc’s caseaccordingly.The result for the pc is a far-reaching re-orientation in Life.Thus the essentials of Guiding Style Auditing consist of Two-Way Comm that steers thepc into revealing a difficulty followed by a repetitive process to handle what has been revealed.One does expert TRs but one may discuss things with the pc, let the pc talk and in generalone audits the pc before one, establishing what that pc needs and then doing it with crisprepetitive auditing, but all the while alert to changes in the pc.One runs at this Level against Tone Arm Action, paying little or no heed to the needleexcept as a centering device for TA position. One even establishes what’s to be done by theaction of the Tone Arm. (The process of storing up things to run on the pc by seeing what fellwhen he was running what’s being run, now belongs at this Level (II) and will be re-numberedaccordingly.)At II one expects to handle a lot of chronic PTPs, overts, ARC Breaks with Life (but notsession ARC Breaks, that being a needle action, session ARC Breaks being sorted out by ahigher classed auditor if they occur).To get such things done (PTPs, overts and other remedies) in the session the auditor must"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"have a pc “willing to talk to the auditor about his difficulties”. That presupposes we have anauditor at this Level who can ask questions, not repetitive, that guide the pc into talking aboutthe difficulty that needs to be handled.Great command of TR 4 is the primary difference in TRs from Level I. One understands,when one doesn’t, by asking more questions, and by really acknowledging only when one hasreally understood it.Guided comm is the clue to control at this Level. One should easily guide the pc’s commin and out and around without chopping the pc or wasting session time. As soon as an auditorgets the idea of finite result or, that is to say, a specific and definite result expected, all this iseasy. Pc has a PTP. Example: Auditor has to have the idea he is to locate and destimulate thePTP so pc is not bothered about it (and isn’t being driven to do something about it) as the finiteresult.The auditor at II is trained to audit the pc before him, get the pc into comm, guide the pctoward data needful to choose a process and then to run the process necessary to resolve thatthing found, usually by repetitive command and always by TA.The Book of Remedies is the key to this Level and this auditing style.One listens but only to what one has guided the pc into. One runs repetitive commandswith good TR 4. And one may search around for quite a while before one is satisfied he has theanswer from the pc needful to resolve a certain aspect of the pc’s case.O/W can be run at Level I. But at Level II one may guide the pc into divulging what thepc considers a real overt act and, having that, then guide the pc through all the reasons it wasn’tan overt and so eventually blow it.Half-acknowledgment is also taught at Level II—the ways of keeping a pc talking bygiving the pc the feeling he is being heard and yet not chopping with overdone TR 2.Big or multiple acknowledgment is also taught to shut the pc off when the pc is going offthe subject.LEVEL IIIABRIDGED STYLE AUDITINGBy Abridged is meant “abbreviated”, shorn of extras. Any not actually needful auditingcommand is deleted.For instance, at Level I the auditor always says, when the pc wanders off the subject, “Iwill repeat the auditing command” and does so. In Abridged Style the auditor omits this when itisn’t necessary and just asks the command again if the pc has forgotten it.In this style we have shifted from pure rote to a sensible use or omission as needful. Westill use repetitive commands expertly, but we don’t use rote that is unnecessary to thesituation.Two-Way Comm comes into its own at Level III. But with heavy use of repetitivecommands.At this Level we have as the primary process, Clay Table Healing. In this an auditor mustmake sure the commands are followed exactly. No auditing command is ever let go of until thatactual command is answered by the pc.But at the same time, one doesn’t necessarily give every auditing command the processhas in its rundown."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"In Clay Table Healing one is supposed to make sure the pc is satisfied each time. This isdone more often by observation than command. Yet it is done.We suppose at III that we have an auditor who is in pretty fine shape and can observe.Thus we see the pc is satisfied and don’t mention it. Thus we see when the pc is not certain andso we get something the pc is certain of in answering the question.On the other hand, one gives all the necessary commands crisply and definitely and getsthem executed.Prepchecking and needle usage is taught at Level III as well as Clay Table Healing.Auditing by List is also taught. In Abridged Style Auditing one may find the pc (being cleanedup on a list question) giving half a dozen answers in a rush. One doesn’t stop the pc fromdoing so, one half acknowledges, and lets the pc go on. One is in actual fact handling a biggerauditing comm cycle, that is all. The question elicits more than one answer which is really onlyone answer. And when that answer is given, it is acknowledged.One sees when a needle is clean without some formula set of questions that invalidate allthe pc’s relief. And one sees it isn’t clean by the continued puzzle on the pc’s face.There are tricks involved here. One asks a question of the pc with the key word in it andnotes that the needle doesn’t tremble, and so concludes the question about the word is flat. Andso doesn’t check it again. Example: “Has anything else been suppressed?” One eye on pc, oneon needle, needle didn’t quiver. Pc looks noncommittal. Auditor says, “All right, on “ andgoes on to next question, eliminating a pc’s possible protest read that can be mistaken foranother “suppress”.In Abridged Style Auditing one sticks to the essentials and drops rote where it impedescase advance. But that doesn’t mean one wanders about. One is even more crisp and thoroughwith Abridged Style Auditing than in rote.One is watching what happens and doing exactly enough to achieve the expected result.By “Abridged” is meant getting the exact job done—the shortest way between twopoints—with no waste questions.By now the student should know that he runs a process to achieve an exact result and hegets the process run in a way to achieve that result in the smallest amount of time.The student is taught to guide rapidly, to have no time for wide excursions.The processes at this Level are all rat-a-tat-tat processes—CT Healing, Prepchecking,Auditing by List.Again it’s the number of times the question is answered per unit of auditing time thatmakes for speed of result.LEVEL IVDIRECT STYLE AUDITINGBy direct we mean straight, concentrated, intense, applied in a direct manner.We do not mean direct in the sense of to direct somebody or to guide. We mean it isdirect.By direct, we don’t mean frank or choppy. On the contrary, we put the pc’s attention onhis bank and anything we do is calculated only to make that attention more direct."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"It could also mean that we are not auditing by vias. We are auditing straight at the thingsthat need to be reached to make somebody clear.Other than this the auditing attitude is very easy and relaxed.At Level IV we have Clay Table Clearing and we have Assessment type processes.These two types of process are both astonishingly direct. They are aimed directly at theReactive Mind. They are done in a direct manner.In CT Clearing we have almost total work and Itsa from pcs. From one end of a sessionto another, we may have only a few auditing commands. For a pc on CT Clearing does almostall the work if he is in session at all.Thus we have another implication in the word “direct”. The pc is talking directly to theauditor about what he is making and why in CT Clearing. The auditor hardly ever talks at all.In assessment the auditor is aiming directly at the pc’s bank and wants no pc in front of itthinking, speculating, maundering or Itsaing. Thus this assessment is a very direct action.All this requires easy, smooth, steel-hand-in-a-velvet-glove control of the pc. It lookseasy and relaxed as a style, it is straight as a Toledo blade.The trick is to be direct in what’s wanted and not deviate. The auditor settles what’s to bedone, gives the command and then the pc may work for a long time, the auditor alert, attentive,completely relaxed.In assessment the auditor often pays no attention to the pc at all, as in ARC Breaks orassessing lists. Indeed, a pc at this level is trained to be quiet during the assessment of a list.And in CT Clearing an auditor may be quiet for an hour at a stretch.The tests are: Can the auditor keep the pc quiet while assessing without ARC Breakingthe pc? Can the auditor order the pc to do something and then, the pc working on it, can theauditor remain quiet and attentive for an hour, understanding everything and interrupt alertlyonly when he doesn’t understand and get the pc to make it clearer to him? Again without ARCBreaking the pc.You could confuse this Direct Style with Listen Style if you merely glanced at a sessionof CT Clearing. But what a difference. In Listen Style the pc is blundering on and on and on.In Direct Style the pc wanders off the line an inch and starts to Itsa, let us say, with no claywork and after it was obvious to the auditor that this pc had forgotten the clay, you’d see theauditor, quick as a foil, look at the pc, very interestedly and say, “Let’s see that in Clay.” Orthe pc doesn’t really give an ability he wants to improve and you’d hear a quiet persuasiveauditor voice, “Are you quite certain you want to improve that? Sounds like a goal to me. Justsomething, some ability you know, you’d like to improve.”You could call this style One-Way Auditing. When the pc is given his orders, after thatit’s all from the pc to the auditor, and all involved with carrying out that auditing instruction.When the auditor is assessing it is all from the auditor to the pc. Only when the assessmentaction hits a snag like a PTP is there any other auditing style used.This is a very extreme auditing style. It is straightforward—direct.But when needful, as in any Level, the styles learned below it are often also employed,but never in the actual actions of getting CT Clearing and Assessment done.(Note: Level V would be the same style as VI below.)"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"LEVEL VIALL STYLESo far, we have dealt with simple actions.Now we have an auditor handling a meter and a pc who Itsa’s and Cognites and getsPTPs and ARC Breaks and Line Charges and Cognites and who finds Items and lists and whomust be handled, handled, handled all the way.As auditing TA for a 2l/2 hour session can go to 79 or 125 divisions (compared to 10 or15 for the lowest level), the pace of the session is greater. It is this pace that makes perfectability at each lower level vital when they combine into All Style. For each is now faster.So, we learn All Style by learning each of the lower styles well, and then observe andapply the style needed every time it is needed, shifting styles as often as once every minute!The best way to learn All Style is to become expert at each lower style so that one doesthe style correct for the situation each time the situation requiring that style occurs.It is less rough than it looks. But it is also very demanding.Use the wrong style on a situation and you’ve had it. ARC Break! No progress!Example: Right in the middle of an assessment the needle gets dirty. The auditor can’tcontinue—or shouldn’t. The auditor, in Direct Style, looks up to see a-puzzled frown. Theauditor has to shift to Guiding Style to find out what ails the pc (who probably doesn’t reallyknow), then to Listen Style while the pc cognites on a chronic PTP that just emerged andbothered the pc, then to Direct Style to finish the Assessment that was in progress.The only way an auditor can get confused by All Style is by not being good at one of thelower level styles.Careful inspection will show where the student using All Style is slipping. One then getsthe student to review that style that was not well learned and practice it a bit.So All Style, when poorly done, is very easy to remedy for it will be in error on one ormore of the lower level styles. And as all these can be independently taught, the whole can beco-ordinated. All Style is hard to do only when one hasn’t mastered one of the lower levelstyles.SUMMARYThese are the important Styles of Auditing. There have been others but they are onlyvariations of those given in this HCO Bulletin. Tone 40 Style is the most notable one missing.It remains as a practice style at Level One to teach fearless body handling and to teach one to gethis command obeyed. It is no longer used in practice.As it was necessary to have every result and every process for each Level to finalizeStyles of Auditing, I left this until last and here it is.Please note that none of these Styles violate the auditing comm cycle or the TRs.LRH :jw.rd L.

Noauditor would be able to stand up to that. We realize that you see? These crimes are soinnumerable because they cover such a long period of time. That’s the main thing.So I'm not talking to you from the viewpoint of sinlessness. And you must get your point ofview oriented there. If I were talking to you from the point of view of total sinlessness . . .This is an optimum state which, religiously, people get into. They somehow or another lay theright pennies on the right altar and at that moment they become totally sinless. Then they cancondemn everyone. And this gives them the right to condemn everyone, you see? And theycan’t approach this subject objectively. Unlike various people of the past who have said“Repent ye. Repent ye. Ye Kingdom of Heaven is at ye hand,” something of that sort, peoplewho do have sins, you see, find it much easier to talk about the subject. They have some realityon the subject. And let me assure you that from my point of view, if I had it all to do all overagain, I would probably do the same things.So I don’t want to give you the false impression that I give you any lecture on the subject ofSecurity Checking from the basis that my security, unlike yours, has been pure for twohundred trillion years. That would make a very great unreality. No, amongst us boys, us girls,what we have all been up to only could not bear the light of day because we think it couldn’tbear the light of day.Now, it’s funny that every group that has sought to enforce sinlessness on one and all, with thestake vast punishment, condemnation, assignment to hell—that is the primary mechanism: theygive you a ticket straight to hell.Doesn’t work sometimes, by the way. There was a rash of murders—I've told you this storybefore, I'm sure but there was a rash of murders up in the Eskimo tribes. And the RoyalNorthwest Mounted Police went up there to get their man, and they found out that there hadbeen a missionary in the area. And the missionary had told all the Eskimos what was right andwhat was wrong and had convinced them, of course, that if they murdered anyone, they wouldgo straight to hell and burn forever. And the idea of being warm enough for any length of time. . . So, you see, lecturing from the high platform of sinlessness, you very often run into thecreation of more sin than you get rid of. And what’s interesting is that any group which wishesto blow itself to flinders simply has to engage upon an activity of making everybody guilty oftheir sins. It’ll hang together for a little while, and everybody will be miserable while it does,but it’ll eventually blow up.Why? Because it now gives people a complete map on how to accumulate withholds. Thegroup mores defines what is a withhold. It says you must not be guilty of such sins and suchsins and such sins, and therefore and thereby blows itself to pieces, of course, because it sayseverybody that has committed these sins should withhold them, even though they are saying atthe same time “You must confess them.” But they make confession, you see, rather rigorous.Now, we have to understand this at the outset of Security Checking. Thou, the auditor, are notsinless. That’s what we have to understand about it. And thou art not an enforcer of a publicmores while thou art being an auditor. Thou art simply a Security Checker, period. You got it?"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"You’re not the avenging angels of the Mormon church or something like this, see, while you’resecurity checking. You’re simply a person who is skilled in certain technology to attain a betterframe of mind and actually a much greater honesty and decency on the part of somebody else.You have the weapon in your hands with which to attain a greater decency, a greater state ofhealth, a greater efficiency, a greater ability, higher ability for ARC. You’ve got the weapon inyour hands with which to do this. There is the E-Meter and there is the Security Check, andthere is you and your technology. So you are going to be able to accomplish what groups havebeen trying to accomplish for a long time. You are going to be able to make an honest man oran honest woman. You have the weapon with which to do this. That’s very important for youto realize, because all of these other mechanisms—such as “make the person guilty,” “show theperson the right way,” you see, “and the error of his ways,” and frowning upon him andpunishing him in some fashion or other because he’s just gotten off a withhold —aremechanisms of older groups by which they sought to enforce their mores. Because they had noway to make honest people that was positive and lasting, then they used these very poormechanisms of “make them good and guilty,” “punish them ‘ “show them what will happen tothem if they do that again.” -All of these other things are added in. But what are those?- Those are the security mechanisms of yesteryear. Those are yesterday’s tools. So you don’tcombine Scientology with other therapies. And that is all that you would be doing if you weretrying to make somebody guilty and so forth, and doing something else with a Security Checkrather than just getting off withholds.So let us get down to a simplicity. You, the auditor, may have successfully waded throughinnumerable Sec Checks and be in good shape, and so forth. That doesn’t necessarily meanthat “thou hast been without sin all the days of thy life.” That hasn’t anything to do with it, yousee? It simply means that technically you’ve gotten up on the step. You were lucky. You cametwo hundred trillion years along the track with red hands and black heads, and finally got outanyhow.Well, that’s beside the point. This point is important because if you, the auditor, are stillworried about your own withholds, or if you are trying to put up the presence of being—because you are a Scientologist and an auditor and maybe a Release or something like that—ifyou’re trying to put up the attitude, you see, that you yourself are sinless, then you willsometimes Q-and-A and avoid the other fellow’s withholds. In other words, you let the public sell you the idea that because you are 8 Scientologist, youshould never have any sins. You get the idea? What have they done, in essence? They havemanaged to bottle you up just like putting a cork in a bottle. Now you don’t ever dare get offany withholds, you think, maybe, you see?You can get into all kinds of odd cull-de-sacs, because we are still crossed up with the oldertherapy of condemnation and punishment. And that was unworkable. Let me point out thatthere are several people in prisons in the world. There are lots of people still doing penance inreligious groups in the world. And if we add this up and recognize it clearly, we won’t putourselves in the same category. The old processes haven’t worked. & don’t let them work onyou in reverse.Don’t ever get into a state where, because you are in a district or an area where you are holdingthe fort and keeping the torches burning, you never dare get off any withholds. You’vepermitted yourself to be sent on the road to hell. Do you see that? And your Security Checkingwould deteriorate. Inevitably your Security Checking would deteriorate. You would be afraidto ask people questions. You would start tacit consent. You’d start mutual avoidance of certainsubjects. You get what I’m talking about, don’t you?The most serious barrier that an auditor has to overcome in Security Checking is not necessarilyhis own case, but a courage to ask the questions. You know, that’s kind of a raw, mean,brassy sort of a thing to do."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"You sit down: Here’s this nice young girl. Everybody knows she’s a virgin —everybodyknows this. And you’re in very good ARC with her, and everything is going to go along One.And then you say to her, crassly and meanly, “Have you ever committed any carnal sins of anycharacter or another? Have you ever been to bed in the wrong place at the wrong time with thewrong man?” And put it mildly, this is a startling question. But since I’ve started SecurityChecking, I haven’t found any virgins.Well now, it requires a certain amount of brass, it requires a certain amount of nerve, to sitthere and ask all these fantastic questions, you know? “Have you ever: rob, murder, burn,slain, gutted, lied?” You see? And yet it sounds like you must be sitting there running off acatalog of the penal codes of French Guyana or something, you know? And here you go! Well,that’s rough enough. If all of your withholds are off, that’s rough enough. You sit down—perfectly inoffensive person—and you all of a sudden start asking him this sort of thing, youknow?Well, if you’ve got a whole bunch of withholds that you yourself are very afraid somebody isgoing to get nest to, you will back straight off of the whole subject of Security Checking. Andthat is the only thing I see in the future of Scientology that could happen: is all auditors become“without sin”—they have never had any sin—and because they are Releases or Scientologistsor something, you see, then they never dare get off their withholds because the students in theAcademy might hear about it and all sorts of catastrophic actions might occur, and theirreputation is utterly smashed and ruined, you see? So therefore, the best thing to do, youknow, is just kind of avoid the whole subject. And that’s what they’ll finish up doing, too—avoiding the whole subject.They won’t have that additional élan necessary to ask this poor little innocent girl “Have youever raped your baby brother?” you see? You know, it’s just something that they would notbring themselves to be able to do, providing they themselves were actually withholdingwithholds. Do you see the point I’m trying to make with you here?So you could get a broad and general disintegration if you permitted the public at large to insistthat because a person was a skilled Scientologist and in good case shape, he had never done anything wrong. You see how that could be added up onyou?Now, you’ll find some instructor in an Academy here and there, and he’s thinking to himself,“Uuughh, if the students ever heard about this . . .” And you think—somebody in the HGC,and he’s saying, “Well, I don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know. Last year . . . Here here’sthis whole subject of Security Checking coming up again, and if they found out last year thatafter I audited that girl, why, that happened . . .” And he sits there and he starts sweating overthis thing: “What would the D of P think? What would other auditors think? What would theorganization think?” So on. And the nest thing you know, he’s sitting in session and thequestion comes up. He has too make the decision whether to security check this person or goon running the level. Oh, he will go on running the level every time. He’ll avoid SecurityChecking.That person who is avoiding Security Checking in his own life will avoid Security Checking ofother people. And you can just mark it down that if you find somebody who is duckingSecurity Checks in all direction, you have somebody who will not Security Check.You would be amazed how your Security Checking improves to the degree that you yourselfhave gotten through the Security Checks. It is absolutely fabulous. You can almost tell whetheran auditor has withholds to the degree of skill that he security checks. And the worse hisSecurity Checking is, the more certain you become that he has withholds. That’s an interestingcoordination, isn’t it? And yet it’s a visible one.So that going up the line and on the long haul in Scientology, you actually could get to a- pointwhere the public insists that those people who are carrying along . .; Because Scientology is"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"getting more and more important, more and more- important,. you could actually get peoplerunning an operation on you: They just start running this old therapy, you see? Because you’rethe leading auditor in an area, or something of the sort, you therefore must never have doneanything in your whole life. Doesn’t follow. But what it operates as is an ought-to-be. And youcould surrender to this ought-to-be and therefore never permit yourself to be security checkedbecause somebody might talk.Do you realize that that action alone would slow down the whole forward impulse ofScientology by putting in lousy case shape every important auditor and person in Scientology?It could be done. And that is the Achilles’ heel of Scientology. That is it. That we become soimportant that we must therefore— it follows in some peculiar way—be without sin, withoutmishap, without ever taking our finger off our number in life, and without ever forgiving it ifsomebody has. If we ever got into that state, we’d be finished. We’d be finished.But we don’t have to get into that state because we’ve got the tools which keeps a grouptogether without the whip. See, the whip has become a useless and antiquated object. Like theelectric-shock machine, it can be dedicated to the museums of tomorrow. Someday we’re goingto take one of these prisons here and set it up with dummies just as a showpiece of what manused to do. That’s the only use you’ll have for it.You know, I think I ought to at this moment probably make you all members of a very secretsociety. Speaking of withholds, there is a very secret society. It doesn’t do much withholding,but it is very secret, mostly because nobody recognizes it as an actual society. They all thinkit’s a joke, see?The society is the SPG. And the SPG. And I’m now going to make you all members of theSPG. It’s the Society for the Prevention of Government. An interesting society. All you haveto do to be a member of it is say you are. You know, I don’t think a single revolutionary chargeof any kind whatsoever could be filed against a member of this organization, becauseeverybody prevents government to some degree, you see? It’d just be to what degree are we preventinggovernment? The only thing governments get upset about is the overthrow of government byforce, which means, of course, the setting up of another government on top of an existinggovernment. And we aren’t interested in doing that. We’re just interested in preventinggovernment.But anyway, the mechanisms by which man has been governed had in it the idea that man wasevil and therefore had to be held in line by evil practices. And if man was evil, then he had to beheld in line with evil. And they never noticed that the evil in the world stemmed totally fromholding man in line. That was the fascinating part of it.You have to have been a member of a police force to recognize that the police create crime.They do it quite unintentionally, but they do create crime. They get a game caller cops androbbers going. And this game— every criminal busily plays this game. If there wasn’t thatmuch to it, why, there they’d be.Well, for instance, there’s some young fellow was walking down the street one day, and besuddenly read his name in the newspapers and reported to the police. And for the next six oreight days he was sitting under the hot lights, and they were questioning him and throwing himinto cells and being mean to him and so forth. Actually, he hadn’t done a thing. He hadn’t evenbeen there. He hadn’t even been present. And they turned him loose after a while. He’s veryrelieved to have been turned loose.What do you think his ideas are going to be on the subject of police now?Now, we start building it up from there. A society without ARC is a society which inevitablywill have crime. Man is good, but he is only good to the degree that he’s in ARC withexistence. And when you throw him out of ARC with sections of society or whole"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"governments at one fell swoop, he gives the appearance of being very bad. Actually, all he’strying to do is survive and protect himself and keep the thing from going all to hell. He has hisown peculiar notions about how he does this, and the primary mechanism he uses is withhold.That’s how he thinks he can hold everything together—by withholding everything. Theprimary mechanism.So the police are dedicated to making everybody withhold, till the mores of the criminal mainlyconsists of “You must not talk to the police.” Well, that’s quite interesting. “You mustn’t talk tothe forces of law and order.”- Ah, well, that’s interesting. Well, that necessarily forcessomebody further out of communication with law and order.And if you think criminals are without government, you’re mistaken. They have their owngovernment. And a very wild, gruesome government it is, too.But the society is forced apart to the degree that people are made guilty.Now, why does a man wind up as a murderer? Well, he has long since resigned from thehuman race. Long since. If you want to prevent a murder, you don’t hang murderers. Youmake it unnecessary to resign from the human race. That’s easy.I’ll give you a murder where the law was definitely at fault. Washington, D.C., a taxicabdriver—if I remember the story right—had a wife and this wife kept going off with anotherman. And he had a hard time of it because he tried to take the matter to court, he tried to get adivorce, he tried to quiet it down, he tried to hold the home together—he took every measure hecould possibly take, but of course there was no law that would back him up. You see, he didn’thave any “evidence,” and he didn’t have vast slims of money, you see, to buy detectives toaccumulate this and that, you know? And there was nobody he could go to. And he got moreand more and more seething about this, because he was basically out of communication, and hefinally killed both of them. But what was interesting to me about this particular case is that for two years this fellow hadhad some sort of a grievance, and there was no agency in society to remedy any part of thatgrievance. There was nothing he could do about it. So he finally did the last desperate jump.Now, of course, he himself had various withholds, but were these withholds actual orunintentional? And now we get to a very interesting subject: the unintentional withhold.This is where you get your new ARC break process, by the way, in the rudiments—is theunintentional withhold. So it’s quite important, this unintentional withhold. I mentioned to youyesterday that a person very often finds himself in a position and then considers he’s guiltybecause he’s in that position. He finds himself outside the group, so therefore he feels he musthave done something to be expelled from the group, which is quite remarkable.Well, this unintentional withhold is the same thing. The person is not able to tell anybody.Now, it might be that there is nobody there to tell it to. He’s not able to tell anybody. It’s notthat he wouldn’t tell anybody if he could, but he can’t tell anybody because there isn’t anybodyto tell it to or nobody will listen. And you’ll find these all over insane asylums. You’ll findpeople sitting around with unintentional withholds because nobody will listen to them.They say, “Well, these bugs, they just keep crawling all over me,” and the psychiatrist andeverybody says, “Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. We know, we know, we know. Yes, yes, yes,yes, yes, yes “ And the person just knows he isn’t reaching anybody, and he just gets moreand more fined and obsessed with his idea of these bugs crawling over him, because it’s anunintentional withhold. He doesn’t intend to withhold it, but he finds himself in the position ofdoing so because nobody will listen. -So you must take into account this as a factor. It is a very important Actor or r wouldn’t haveput it in your rudiments processes. “What weren’t you able to tell an auditor?” Well, that makesa withhold. Well, you weren’t unwilling to tell the auditor you see? You were trying"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"desperately to tell the auditor, but the auditor never listened.And when you run this ARC break process, you are really knocking out unintentionalwithholds. And the results that you get from that particular ARC break process are quite similarto the results of a Security Check. But in this we’re addressing some other subject. TheSecurity Check is addressed to the more or less intentional withhold. But that ARC breakprocess is addressed to an unintentional withhold. It is a withhold.Now, there’s many a criminal has walked in and said, “I've just murdered my wife,” and thedesk sergeant has swatted a couple of more flies and paid no attention to him. And he’s walkedoutside, and he’s gone up to the cop on the beat and he said, “I just murdered my wife,” and soforth. And nobody paid any attention to him and nobody ever found the wife. And he wasperfectly willing to take the penalties of society, but nobody believed him. And you get themost peculiar kind of withhold there is. You mustn’t overlook this as a withhold in SecurityChecking. The unintentional withhold.So that is, you might say, about the lowest rung of withholds. It’s unintentional, he- didn’tmean to withhold it, but nobody will listen.All right Now we get the intentional withhold, which is a withhold because he would bepunished if he admitted it And we get a different type of withhold, although it has the samemechanism and produces the same actions.And then there is another withhold: He must withhold it because it will damage his beingness—in other words, his reputation. Those are reputational withholds. He’s got an idea of whatpeople think his beingness should be, and he’s upholding his beingness by not admitting tocertain withholds because other people might get another notion of him than the notion whichhe is trying to broadcast. So therefore he mustn’t have reputational rumors and gossips and things of thischaracter. So therefore and thereby it’s a reputational withhold. He hasn’t really done anything.Well, actually, his family came from the lower marshlands of the Thames or something, downin the mud flats of Southampton or something. you know? And he just—well, he just wouldn’trather this be known, you know? His family, by advertisement, always came from UpperBerkshire. It’s quite interesting.Nova, familial connections aren’t the least of it, you see? People are always trying to representthemselves as a little bit better. Well, that’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it resultsin a bunch of reputational withholds.Now, between the last two categories there’s a borderline category of things which, if theywere out, people would think much less of him—you know, that kind of thing. He reallywouldn’t be punished, he isn’t worried about it on account of beingness; he’s just thinking,well, people wouldn’t talk to him or something like that if they knew this sort of thing.Well, if you’ll notice, all these things add up to cut communication. And a group is basedbasically on communication. So a group falls apart to the degree that there is nocommunication, and these are the three broad categories: the unintentional withhold, thewithhold for fear of punishment, and the withhold in its various grades that protect beingness.And these three things, of course, are all shattering to groups. They knock a group apart in ahurry, but in fact, up to a certain point, appear to cohese a group.I don’t know if you’ve ever been on Fifth Avenue or upper Fifth Avenue or in Hollywood orsomething like that and listened to what went on in lieu of reputation. It runs on something onthe order of fifteen or twenty lies a minute when they’re talking, you see? It’s almostimpossible to keep up with. And there’s the most fantastic unreality about those particulargroups. They are very unreal. And you get near those people, you see, and around in thosegroups, and you think, “Ooooooooo, I don’t know,” you know? It’s... You don’t quite knowwhat’s going on. You’re just not quite sure what is wrong there. But there just is something"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"wrong. Well, what is wrong is that it’s a group with totally cut communication lines.Well, how can you have a group with totally cut communication lines? Well, I guess they’re theonly people who will listen to each other’s lies, so they stay together. Something on this order.Now, a Security Check, or any method by which you are overcoming withholds, is dedicatedto the restoration of communication. And it happens that if communication is totally restored,you see—if man knew what he was doing when he made people withhold slightly—withcommunications totally restored in any past group of which the fellow is no longer part, he willno longer be hung up in that group. See, if you just restore his communication— it’s just theability to communicate; that’s all you’re restoring—why, you’ll get this phenomenon of him nolonger being parked on the track with that group. And that’s the only thing you’re basicallydoing. And those things, which exist in present time of course, prevent him from becoming apart of any group to which he is attached and so give him a basic isolation.And, of course, the basic group with which you are working is not necessarily the group calledScientologists—which in itself is a powerful enough group and it has enough group to it, byfar. But the group in which you are doing the withhold is a group called a session: auditor andPC. You see, now, that is a group.And when the individual is too individuated and when he develops an unintentional withhold inthat group, or the auditor conducts himself in such a way as to bring about punishment becauseof a withhold or a crime, or the auditor demands specious reactions from the PC, the auditorhas shot the group. It is a group. It’s a group of two. Auditing is a third-dynamic activity—even though sometimes it deteriorates into a second. And now and then deteriorates into a first.You burn your finger, and there’s nobody around and you stand there and run it out.Now, there, all three of these things must be pretty well patched up before you get a goodgroup called a session. You’ve got to have the unintentional withholds off, that’s for sure.Do you know, the only thing that can deteriorate a profile, in twenty-five hours, is ARCbreaks? Now, if you’re interpreting profiles—you find a profile and here it is, there it is, andthe profile has dropped. Now, it is true that profiles move and they are pictures of valences,and they do come on at the bottom and go to the top—all of that is also true. But theparticularity we’re speaking of now is, where the person didn’t do well and dropped, you canassume the PC was being operated with an ARC break.Now, the basis of an ARC break is being made to have an unintentional withhold from thatimmediate group. And that, actually, apparently, from the immediate empirical results whichone observes, is more serious than an actual withhold, intentional An unintentional withhold inan auditing session reflects more seriously on the auditing group and on the results ofprocessing than an intentional withhold. This is very interesting.And now we move into another category. rd hardly dignify the person with the title of auditorwho pulled this one, but we have an enforced withhold on the basis of improved state. Andyou’ll find this happens every once in a while. Some person who is pretending to audit gets noresults whatsoever, and then he shakes his finger in the PC’s face and seeks to convince the PCthat the PC has been much bettered by it all and is now Clear or something And the PC thinkshe had better not say anything to the contrary of this, and you’ve got that third grade ofwithhold. You’ve got something there which is protecting beingness.You see, he’s now got a withhold. His withhold is he really didn’t get any improvement, andyet the auditor has forced him to admit that he got improvement. But actually what he’swithholding is the fact that he didn’t get any improvement, and if he said he didn’t get anyimprovement, this would hurt his new statusWell, you just finish auditing the fellow, and you take him out in front of the PE and you say,“He’s Clear.” So now the fellow doesn’t dare break down and say he’s abetted as hell, and so"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"you get one of these reputational withholds.So all three kinds of withholds can occur in an auditing session. The unintentional, theintentional and the reputational. These three things can all occur as a result of an auditingsession.You very, very seldom find the third one occurring, because very few auditors are that bad.But you sometimes find a PC who is trying to propitiate, and who is trying to tell the auditorthat he feels much better now—while his head is falling off—because he doesn’t want to makethe auditor feel bad. You know the mechanism. So, they don’t want to make the auditor feelbad so they say they feel better, and they don’t. Well, now they’re sort of protecting theirbeingness in some fashion or other by a projection. They’re protecting the auditor’s beingnessby not feeling any worse.You’ll find all of these mechanisms can be present in an auditing sessionSo where you get the idea of Security Checking—and very odd, we very often develop a wordin one field, you see, in one field of endeavor; and then we, because we have an agreement onthat word, we develop a special term which is thereafter more or less meaningless to one andall. But we all know what a Security Check is. A Security Check is something you do inprocessing to make the PC better.Well now, how did that happen? Well, basically a Security Check was developed in order toweed out personnel and keep randomity from occurring in Central Organizations. And thenArea Secretaries and Association Secretaries began to find that this made people much better.And the Area Secretary would be busy spending morning, noon and night and all the weekendtrying to catch up with his Security Checking, because sometimes they took, for one SecurityCheck, twenty hours—that we’d get down to the reductio ad absurdum that Smokey told meabout the other day: somebody actually turned in a whole bunch of overts, on a writtenquestionnaire, against the Area Secretary in order to get another Security Check.So 1 would say that at that point the idea of creating security with a Security Check was a—nota very useful nor workable activity. And yet we have this word. And I’ve two or three timeshalfheartedly started to change it over to the idea of “processing check,” and started to call it aprocessing check, and so forth. But it still remains a Security Check.Now we do have a Security Check, which is Form 7. There is an actual Security Check now inexistence. So what do we call this Security Check? And l find myself, in writing a bulletin,getting into the interesting state of—I write: “Now, you should security check all . . .” “TheArea Sec should security check. . .” And then, well, how do I say this? So, the best way to sayit is underscore secants So you have a Security Check and you have a Security Check. Soanyway, we’ll let it ride, let it ride. Won’t pull anything down if it stays that way.So here we have—here we have this thing called B Security Check. Well, basically, it’s tryingto establish a group which ~ engage in assistance. And no assistance can occur if there is nogroup there on the auditor to PC. So you have right in your rudiments there a method of gettingaround this. And you are asking the PC for all of his unintentional withholds when you say,His there something that you haven’t been able to tell an auditor?” And you are really running aSecurity Check right at that point.Now, of course the basic reply to it is “What didn’t an auditor do?” which would be the games-condition response that occurred at that moment. So these two questions go together ratherpowerfully. One of them is asking for an unintentional withhold, and the other is asking for anauditor in a games condition. And they go bing, bing, bing, bing. And I think you’ll find thatsince I dreamed up these new rudiments and tested them out, that you’re doing much better.I’ll make a remark in passing about those new rudiments. There is an assessment that has to bedone for the present time problem. l never bothered to remark on it. I thought you’d latch that"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"as you went by.It says, “What is unknown about that...” (or some such wording) “ . . . problem with(blank)?” Now, you can’t run a condition as the blank.The PC says, “Oh well, I'm terribly worried. I'm terribly worried about the airiness ofeverything.”Well now, the auditor then can’t put the thing together as What is unknown about that problemwith the airiness of everything?” You’ll find this is non-functional.What you’ve got to do is do a little assessment and get him to state the problem more exactly.And you do the assessment on the meter. And you try to find the terminal that is airy or theterminal that is everything. And you shake that down and you do 8 little bit of a terminalassessment, and he suddenly comes up and he says, Well, the airiness of the room ‘ orsomething of that sort, or “The airiness of any car. It hasn’t any hood anymore.” And you would run it—if you had to, by that time . . . You see, you only run those thingswhich you can’t get rid of with two-way comm or assessment. You realize that, don’t you—that running is the way you take care of the things that didn’t blow. So you always be preparedto have an ARC break, a present time problem or anything else blow before you had to run it.You just start doing an assessment on one of these undifferentiated problems, and you’ll find itdoesn’t react anymore.You repeat the question, “Well, do you have a present time problem now?” you see? You hadsome enormous surges on the meter and so forth. And you say, “Well, do you have a presenttime problem now?” before you settle down to run the thing and you can’t even get a quiver onit, see? You’ve blown it by assessment.All right. Now, the PC who has a present time problem that the auditor will not take up is beinggiven a withhold. So there is another source of withholds that cross at the present time problemlevel. But at the same time, the PC will very often try to withhold present time problemsbecause he’s afraid the auditor will take them up and waste session time. Because auditing isvery valuable. All PCs consider auditing time very, very, very, very, very, very valuable.There just isn’t enough auditing. That’s it.And this gets so catastrophic that a PC will force auditing where it shouldn’t occur in somedirection: He wants the auditing that is necessary to resolve his case, not the auditing which isjust fooling around with those fool rudiments, you see, and will actually sometimes attempt towithhold a present time problem for fear that the auditor will take it up.All right. Now, the action of running a Security Check is a relatively simple action It requires ahigh degree of familiarity with the meter so that you aren’t fumbling with the meter It requires avery definite, positive knowledge of the E-Meter. It requires, in addition to that, a knowledgeof whether or not the needle is reacting on the question or on the parts of the question. Youhave to know how to compartment a question. You have to know how to make the E-Meter tellthe truth. And that is sort of high-school E-Metering.People who didn’t know much about E-Meters . . . I think there was somebody in—I think itwas almost into Canada (someplace in the United States; they were just about as close to notbeing in the United States as they could be), got the idea that everybody had been PDHedthroughout the United States by everybody else. And this became ridiculous in the extreme.And they were going all over telling everybody how everybody was PDHing everybody, andthey were just having a marvelous time. And they were getting out magazines about the subject,and so on.And the most awful quiet ensued. There was a quiet where you could have heard an engramdrop, you know? Because after I explained compartmentation in an article in Ability magazine,you know, we’ve never heard another word. It is the most profound silence. It is a sort of a"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"negative silence. It has texture.Well, that’s because of this. That whole nonsense took place because somebody couldn’t reallyhandle an E-Meter, they didn’t know how to compartment questions. So if you ask anybody ifhe had ever been the victim of pain-drug-hypnosis, well, of course you were going to get a fall,a fall, a fall and a fall, because you get falls on just the word victim you get falls on just theword pain, you get falls on just the word drug, and you will occasionally get falls on just theword hypnosis. And if a person has withholds on somebody else, you will get a fall on thatother person’s name if you got withholds and overts on some particular line. So there’s asource of five falls in one question..“Have you ever been a victim of pain-drug-hypnosis from President Eisenhower?” Five falls.You see, it’s falling on the words of the question. It isn’t falling on the question. And the way you do that is you take the question apart. Youknock out—just say the word, “Victim,” and you get a fall. You say, “What was that?”“Well, victim. Well, what not?”“Well,” you say, “what about victim?”“Well, I always hate to be a victim.;’“Well, what the heck? Have you ever made any victims? Have you ever accused anybody ofbeing a victim?”“Oh, yes, my wife. She’s being a victim all the time, all the time, all the time. Always a victim.Yes, yes, yes, yes, always a victim. And she says so, what’s more.”“Oh, is that so? Victim.” No reaction. Ah, we got that word cooled. “All right. Pain.” Clang!goes the needle, you see? You say, “Well, what about pain?”“Oh, I’ve always been afraid of pain.”“Well, what about the word pain?”“Well, oh, the word pain. Oh-ho. Oh, you mean the word pain.”“Yeah. Well, what about the word pain?” No reaction. Okay. Drug. Have you ever takendrugs? You ever give anybody drugs? Are you afraid of drugs? Anything wrong with drugs?Have you ever given anybody any drugs illegally?” Clang! “When did that happen?”“Oh, well. My mother was very sick and I forged a prescription.”“Oh, is that so? Oh, how interesting. All right. Now, when was that?”“Oh, such and such a time.”“All right. Thank you very much. Drug.” No reaction. See?“President Eisenhower.” Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang. What about PresidentEisenhower?”“Oh, nothing. I was part of a ban-the-bomb march, and we said we’d dance on his grave.Yeah. That’s what that was. Yeah.”“Is that all there is to that?”“Well, yes. I've been violently opposed to that particular activity. Oh, yeah.”"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"“All right. How often have you done that?”“Oh, lots of times. Lots of times.”“All right. How about President Eisenhower? Okay.” No fall.“Now, have you ever been the victim of pain-drug-hypnosis from President Eisenhower?”Now, if the person has, you will now get a fall on the question. And if you want to beabsolutely sure, go back all through all the words again and compartment them.Now, there is more to it than this on compartmentation. I noticed the other day one of the boysdidn’t have it quite straight. And that is, you compartment the phrases in addition to the words.You take the words and get the charge off them. And then you take the phrases and read thephrases out and see if each phrase is clean. And then when you read the whole question, let meassure you that if there is a fall, it is true. There is no withhold or charge on it unless it is true.And there won’t be a single needle quiver. And that is the proper way of compartmenting aSecurity Check question. And you’ll find you very often have to compartment them quitepainfully. Otherwise you’ll make some fantastic error.Now, the first and foremost method of preventing yourself from making an error is to forget allabout two needle phenomena. One of the needle phenomena you should forget about is thelatent read. Just ignore all latent reads. Have nothing to do with a latent read. If the readoccurred more than half a second after you finished the question read, ignore it. Just ignore it.Just drop it. Because it’ll be on somebody else or is on another Security Check question. Itisn’t on the same question or it didn’t happen to them. Now, that’s how come you sometimes wind up getting off other people’s withholds. Otherpeople’s withholds will give you a latent read. So you are buying latent reads. You asksomebody, “Well, did you ever drown a cat?”“Well, my aunt Mamie drowned a cat once.”This would be the response. Now, that would be a latent read. You would get that as a latentread. And every time you pick up a latent read on a Security Check question, you can expectthat you haven’t got a withhold, you’ve got a red herring. And you can go chasing all over thebank looking for this red herring. And you waste more time on latent reads than any othersingle action in auditing.That read—if the person has a withhold on it, let me assure you the question does not wear out.If the person is still holding on to a withhold on that question, and it’s not on one of the wordsof the question, it’s not on one of the phrases of the question—nothing of that sort—but is onthe question, the more you ask it and the more he withholds, the more instant the read. It getsso that he just realizes you’re going to ask the question again, you get the read. There isn’t atenth of a second lag.You read the question—pang! It’s acting. You read the question—bang! It’s acting. Read thequestion—bang! It’s acting. You see, the reactive mind is an instantaneous mind. All time isnow. And if it’s a really reactive mind, of course, the closer it is to reactivity, the more rapidand instant the read will be. And it’s as simple as that. It is very simple. And if it is notreactive, the read will be latent. It will wait before it falls. It’ll wait for half a second. It’ll waitfor a second. >And an auditor who sits there and asks the question “Have you ever drowned a cat?” watchingthe E-Meter, and then gets a reaction, and then says “What was that?.” is going to find AuntMamie drowning a cat. And it was something the PC didn’t do, and it was something the PCnever has withheld. You can just count on that.One of the tricks of reading—one of the bad tricks of reading—on latent reads, is to look at themeter, then look at the question, then read the question, then look at the PC, then look at the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"meter. You’ll catch more latent reads that way, and boy, will you miss more instant reads. Youwill just miss them left and right. Why? Because your eye isn’t on the E-Meter at the momentyou ended the question. And your eye must be on the meter needle the instant that you end thatquestion. Otherwise, you’re going to miss the twitch. So what you do is, the sequence isalways: question, look at the meter and speak the question, and then look at the PC. Paper,meter, PC.Paper: you see that the question is about rape. You don’t care whether the question is exact ornot. That is to say, Have you ever raped anybody?”—you can ask that in a thousand differentways. “Have you ever contemplated rape?” “Have you ever had ideas of rape?” “Have you everremembered anything odd about rape as something odd to you like this?” And you’re going toget down to some kind of a withhold if there is one. So you look at the question, and then youlook at the meter and you say the question, and then you can look at the PC all you care to. Andyou won’t get into this nonsense about latent reads.The way I see auditors doing this is they look at the paper and they read the question, and thenthey look over at the E-Meter and then they wait, and they wait, and they wait, and they wait,and they wait, and they wait, and they wait.And the question is, what the hell are they waiting for? Because it would have occurred in atenth of a second. If you’re going to follow it through, it would have occurred in a tenth of asecond. And that’s the way you security check. Man, you can really tear down the line if youdo that. Yeah. You can really rip up a Security Check—whammity, whammity, whammity, wham. PC doesn’t evenhave to speak. You look at the paper: “Have you ever raped anybody?” ‘Nothing. That’s all.Now, if you want to go at this a little more academically, you never look at the meter at all untilthe PC says no. The Security Check can be totally without the meter right up to the pointwhere-he says no, at which time you repeat the question looking at the meter. And that makesfor very good sessioning. When you find you’re doing this easily, oh man, it just goes on andon and on.Why are you looking at the meter if you’re not trying to catch him out? See? You’re trying tofind out if something is reactive. That’s why you’re looking at the meter. Well, if the guy isgoing to tell you his withholds, why are you looking at the meter? That’s what it amounts to.You say, “Well, have you ever robbed a bank?”And the PC says, “Well, if you put it that way, yes. I uh . . .uugh, yes, I robbed a bank,” andso forth.And you say, “When was that?” and so on, so on, 80 on, so on, so on. You can go a littlefurther. “Who you been withholding it from?”“Oh, I've been withholding it from everybody ‘ and so forth. “My fellow bank robbers. Ididn’t want them to know that . n SO forth, and then, et cetera, yap-yap, and so on. They got itall—they get it squared around. Good.You say, “All right. Now, have you ever robbed any other banks?”- “‘Uh . . .yes, I did,” and so forth. “And that was pretty bad,” and uh .-. . and so forth, and etcetera. ~ -; And you say, Okay. Well, have you ever robbed a ban’s?”PC says, “Aside from those, no.”You say, “Good. Have you ever robbed a bank? Yes, what’s that? What’s that nest one?”"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"“Oh, well, that’s just that little old bank down in Joliet. That’d hardly count.” Got the idea?Then you finally ask him again, “All right. Have you ever robbed any other banks?”“cost.”You look back at the meter, you say, “Well, have you ever robbed any other banks?” Meter’squiet. Go on to the nest question.You never look at the meter until he says no. You’ll find out that really holds them in session,man. That’s very good sessioning when you can do it this way.Now, the only bug that occurs when you do this is that you’re repeating the question andapparently calling him a liar slightly. But you’ll find out this isn’t very damaging. He’s alreadytold you no, and so you confirm it.Now, leaving a question hot is another very damaging action on an E-Meter. That’s a verydamaging thing to a session. Oh, that is something you mustn’t do—leave a question withreaction on it. Don’t ever go to the nest question as long as a question is reacting. And don’tever go on to the next question unless you’re absolutely sure that the question you are on hasno further instant actions in it. Remember, we care nothing about the latent action.If there’s no instant action left in a question, you can go on. And if there is, don’t you dare!Because if anything is calculated to throw a PC out of session from there on out, man, let metell you, it is leaving a question hot.You know, there’s been considerable randomity occurred because of this occasionally. HGCPC, and end of session comes along and. . . One girl ran all over town telling everybody bowScientologists were all frauds and they were bums, and bow they were all trying to rape herand shoot her and so forth. And she actually blew the HGC, and wrote letters to everybody that night before theycould finally get bold of her. And finally they trailed her down. And they heard the rumorsgoing around, and they wondered what all this was about, so they traced them back down andthey found this one girl. And they got her down, and the question was something like “Haveyou ever committed adultery?” And boy, it was just falling off the pin. It wasn’t an instantread. It was just—it was blowing up before the auditor could open his mouth, you know?Bang! Bang! And they got these fantastic withholds off of her, and that was it.“Oh,” she said, “I guess I committed an awful series of overts,” and she hurriedly did a volte-vis and tried to straighten up everything she’d been doing.But look at that. Isn’t that interesting? It just—one question, and I think it was an end-of-intensive question. And the auditor just foolishly said, “Well, it’s the end of the intensive, andthat’s it.” Never flattened the question. I haven’t got that particular particularity, but I do knowthat the rest of it did happen. They had about ten people running all around trying to round upwhat all this was about. It was just an unflat Security Check question. And you just mustn’tleave questions unflat. Sure, take them up in the next session— you’ve got to sometimes,because one question can go five hours—has done so.The fellow is the father of eight children. And you ask him the question “Have you everspanked a child?” And he already feels awfully guilty about this, and he’s left his family, andthis is a great point of disturbance with him, and the punishment of children is a very hotsubject and so forth. And, man, you can just go on and on and on and on with this particularsubjectHe’s just getting off withholds and getting off withholds and getting off withholds. No onecares how long it takes to clear a question as long as the auditor is working on the clearance ofa question, not getting off somebody else’s withholds through the PC, not trying to find out"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"what the PC thought or heard or did about somebody else. We’re interested in the PC’swithholds. And as long as the auditor is getting actual withholds off the PC on instant reads,continue with the question.The only way you can waste auditing time on the thing is to just wait there for the latent readand then take that latent read. Read occurs two and a half, three seconds after you’ve read thequestion. You read the question . . . fall. You say, “What was that?” You knucklehead!You’re immediately going to get something like this: “Well, r just thought it was gettingawfully late.” That’s true. That’s what it fell on. Didn’t have anything to do with the question.Or, “Oh well, yes. That made me think of a book I read once that I wasn’t supposed to read.”Look, this is a question about stealing, see? “Have you ever stolen anything?” See? Wait, wait,wait, wait, wait—clang. “Well, what was that?” you say on the latent read.“Oh, well, that was a book, I guess. I—I was thinking about this book.”“What about this book?”“Well, I read this book. Uh . . . well, it would . . . it talked about stealing.”“Uh . . . well, what about that?”Well, look, knucklehead, nothing about that, you see? I mean, there just isn’t anything. Itdoesn’t have anything to do with-it except the PC’s mind was out of gear for the moment. It’slike finding the gear wheels disengaged, you see? And you sit there and wait, and eventuallythe PC is going to think about something, isn’t he? And if you wait long enough, you’ll alwaysget a reaction, even if it’s just on the ARC break of “Why are you so damn quiet?” - - It’s factual, and it follows through. Serious withholds or withholds that should be gotten offthe case, or that have anything to do with a case, and all the things that the person himself havedone, are as a result of an instant read. And you must follow through on that particular basis.All right. The next thing that you should pay attention to, besides clearing every question as itgoes on down the line—the next thing you should pay attention to is selecting the type ofSecurity Check. This is very important.There is no sense in security checking somebody on something he has nothing to do with. Thatis rather frightful. Let’s say that we have a special Security Check on the subject ofboilermakers, see? So we get this girl who is a milliner. And we run a Security Check onboilermakers on this milliner. And we say, “Well, she’s got clean hands because she didn’thave a single fall.” Well, that’s for sure.Similarly, it is equally an error to take a generalized Security Check when you know very wellyour PC has a particularized professional or action area. If this PC is living by some particularframework of mores... Well, let’s say you’re security checking a person who professionally,this life, right now, is a bank teller. Well, all right. That might go along all right and so forth.But you just never seem to get around to writing up some additional questions to give him as aSecurity Check. And, of course, you’ll miss it every time. You just give him the generalizedform of the check, and it only hits banks on about three questions.Nov. you yourself have to be able to project your imagination and initiative with regard to thatsituation. You’d say, “What would be the withholds of a bank teller? What would they be?”And, of course, it turns up at once what they would be. We’re liable to find something like this:he has to stand in back of this cage all the time and he hates people. And the word of the bankis that you must be pleasant to all the customers as you take in the money. And you must stand"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"there with a smile on your face, you see, and take in the money and pay out the money. Youjust can’t figure out what’s wrong with this guy’s job, see? He’s unhappy and he isn’t doingwell and nothing is going on and so we give him a general Security Check and it goes on andon, but it never takes into account what the man does in life. You get the idea? That is a boob.That is—comes under the classification of a boob.We do put one together around what we think a bank teller might possibly have as withholds,and we find all sorts of very interesting things. He has held a deposit for twenty minutes so oneof his customers, you see, wouldn’t be overdrawn. Interesting thing. Nothing very much, butit was something to him, because, man, are you supposed to have those deposits right into thedrawer, and they’re supposed to pass down the endless belt and go into the machines and soforth, and so on.And he actually has, on his own initiative, which is just—that’s pretty adventurous—hasactually put his fist into the machinery of the bank, and he has held it for twenty minutes. Andthat is a withhold to him.And then you find maybe he’s standing there with all kinds every time a customer comes up hehas a game that he plays on—something on the order of an unkind thought. And he just hasnothing but long streams of unkind thoughts. Every time somebody comes up—bzzzzzzz, gotthis long thing.And you ask him the right question—you say, bank teller. Well, all right, bank teller—he musthave customers. And you say, “Well, have you ever had an unkind thought about a bankcustomer?” And you’re liable to run into an avalanche.And it’d just sit on that case till the end of time unless you yourself security checked against thereality of the PC. That you must always do. Whatever else you do with Security Checks, also security check against the reality of the PC.And that takes into account the moral codes by which he lives.Now, you security check a Catholic sometime, or you security check a Baptist, and you’d havetwo different Security Checks. They’d be different. You security check an Afrikaner andsecurity check a Zulu. You’re going to have two different Security Checks, man. And they’realmost vis-a-vis different Security Checks. Almost everything one thinks is right, the otherthinks is wrong.Who’s to say who’s right or who’s wrong? That hasn’t anything to do with it, which is why Igave you a little bit about the moral note at the beginning of it. The rights and wrongnesses ofthings are what groups have determined on in order to perpetuate survival. And that’s therightnesses and wrongnesses of things. It’s what is survival to the group, not whether you areenforcing the mores of a group because you are so sinless. So you have to actually be able tosecurity check both sides of the fence.Now, security checking a cop would be quite different than security checking a criminal, ofcourse. Security checking a soldier would be quite different than security checking achambermaid. It would be different.So if you omit specialized Security Checking and putting together a list of questions thatconcern the activities of the person—if you omit this entirely— you’ve boobed.Another thing that you do, that you mustn’t do, is read a Security Check as a repetitivequestion. “Have you ever raped anybody? Good. Have you ever raped anybody? Go Have youever raped anybody? Good Have you ever raped anybody? Goods Have you ever rapedanybody? Good. Have you ever raped anybody? Good. Ever raped . . .?” Who are youauditing?Your job is not to run a repetitive question at all, but to get off withholds. The auditing consists"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"of getting off withholds.Well, how do you get off withholds on the subject of rape? Well, some fellow says, “Wellnow, I just don’t want to answer any questions about that at all. No, I just don’t think you’dbetter be asking me any question. Let’s go on to the next one. We’ll still be friends. But we’dbetter go on to the next question.”Well, how are you going to get around that? You can still ask the question “What have you gotagainst rape?”“Oh,” he’ll say, “well, it isn’t what I have against rape, it’s what other people have againstrape.”“Well, who has things against rape?”“Well! My mother and my father and the public and the preacher and the parson and—and thestate,” and so forth.“Well, when did all these come down on you on the subject of rape?”“Well, that was when I got in the newspapers on the subject.”“Oh, when was that?”That is what is known by pulling a withhold from the back door.Now, the nest thing you must remember is that a withhold is generally a withhold of an overtact against the mores of the group. Now, actually, the enforcement of the mores of the group tomake other people withhold is the overt act of withholds. You get the idea? You’re enforcingthe mores of the group against another person to make them withhold. It’s the overt act ofmaking people withhold, see? So you err whenever you don’t ask the make-guilty question.You can take every Security Check you’ve got and simply add an additional question beloweach level on “Well, have you ever made anybody guilty of rape?”You get this girl. She keeps telling you, “I have been aped. It isn’t that I am withholding raping somebody; I have been raped.” And the question is still hot.And you say, “How in the name of common sense am I ever going to clear this question? Howam l going to clear this question? How could I possibly clear the question? Because she justsays—and of course she’s an offended member—no, she hasn’t raped anybody. She’s beenraped.” Well, if you Q-and-A and just go off and say, “Well, we’re not security checking now.She has a bad engram, and vie might as well run this engram and find out all about all of thisrape, and when she was raped and so forth,” are you still security checking or are you doingsomething else? You’re doing something else. You are auditing processes, you are runningengrams, but you’re doing something else. You’re not security checking.So you don’t stop security checking and start doing something else. You go on securitychecking. In other words, get off the withholds. But, of course, the overt act of a withhold ismaking somebody else withhold. And, of course, the moment you ask the question “Well,whom have you made guilty of rape?”“Oh, well,” you get a nice big meter reaction, and “Him, of course, and him and him, and themand them and them, and them and them and them, and them and them,” and so forth.“Well, have you made anybody else guilty of rape?”“Yes. Well, them and them and them.”"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"“All right. Anybody else you made guilty of rape?”“Uh . . . well, no.”“Anybody else you made guilty of rape? What was that?”“Well, it’s just—I’m just restimulated by the whole thing.”“Well, have you—have you ever raped anybody?”“Yes.”In other words, the make-guilties all lay on top of an actual fact; She been raped all right, butShakespeare’s statement “Methinks the lady protest too much” can be Hobson-Jobsoned over:“Methinks the PC protest too much.” And whenever the PC “protest too much,” you arelooking at the boiling broth. And you might as well pick the pot up and look under it, becauseyou’re going to find fire.“You shouldn’t be asking me that question. It is insulting.” Oh, man. Why don’t they run up asignal halyard and By fifteen flags from it, you know; get blinking lights going in your face?Because that is the one question that is hot.And of course a person who has fantastic motivators which just keep rocking and rocking androcking... The person says “Well, I haven’t ever raped anybody; I have been raped. And that iswhy it is falling.”No, remember your original question was “Have you ever raped anybody?” and you got aninstant read. And the facts of the case are that the PC has, but the PC has tried to make otherpeople guilty to such an extent that this lies on the top of it as the overt from the withholdmotivator. You see? So there’s what you got.So you ask the made-guilty questions any way you want to phrase it. ‘“Have you everprotested against . . . ?” “Have you ever accused . . . ?” Do you see? This type of questioningfor each subject matter of a Security Check will be found to be very, very beneficial in freeingup a whole security question. Because, of course, it is making other people withhold, andwhen you get the overt off, then the PC gives up his withhold. It’s not actually, you see, anadditional question. It is another way of asking the same question.And then you come back and you always leave a Security Check question that has fell[fallen]—you always leave it with the same wording that you ask it in the first place thatproduced the fall. Never miss that. And that is usually, for your ease, the way it is written onthe paper. You’ve been asking all sorts of things about rape. You said, “Well, have you ever madeanybody guilty of rape? Have you ever . . . rape?” and so forth and 90 on. And “All right.Have you ever bad unkind thoughts about rapists? What have you done? Have you ever wishedyou were raped?” It doesn’t matter, whatever you were asking, you see? What produced thereaction—the reason you’re asking these questions—is “Have you ever been raped?” And thequestion you’re trying to clear is the one that produced the reaction. So you always repeat thatquestion in the same wording to see if there’s any additional reaction before you leave it. Andthen you’re sure that that question is clean. No matter how many other variations you ask—andyou should ask variations in order to get the thing cleaned up—you go back to the samequestion again before you leave it.In other words, always go out by the same door you entered. Don’t go ducking out the sidedoor. You’ve cleared up “Have they ever made anybody guilty of rape?” see? So you say,“Well, that’s it. We’ll go on to the next question.”Oh, you missed, and you will leave a question hot if you do that."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"All right. I’ve tried to cover here some of the elements of Security Checking. You can tailor upSecurity Checks any way you want to. You can always add to a Security Check. You canalways add to a Security Check. You may never subtract from one. The reason why we lay thatinjunction down is that somebody who has a withhold on a subject who runs into it on a listwill then not be tempted to avoid it.And you would be fascinated at some of the Security Check questions being made up by peoplewho have buttons on the subject. You never quite read as much of an avoidance as you getwhen you do that. You take somebody who’s sitting down here in Dartmoor Scrubs and havehim write a Security Check up on the subject of criminals, and you get a three-question checkBut you ask him to write—he has never been a soldier, and you ask him to write a SecurityCheck question on the subject of soldiers, and he writes you eighteen pages. It’s quiteinteresting.But people subtract from Security Checks where they have withholds. So you lay down thisinjunction; you say, “Always give the standard Security Check; add anything to it you please.Write up any special check you care to, as long as you give a standard check too.”And then that keeps anybody from ever indulging in tacit consent and avoiding Questionbecause “We know, of course, that this person has never stolen anything from theorganization. Of course we know that, so we just won’t ask that question.” And sometimes aperson does this in all innocence. It just seems to him like the question would not produce anyparticular result. That’s all there is to it. And then somebody asks him the question and it goeshotter than a pistol.And he says, “But I never have! I just never have.” And you go tracing it down, and he has.He actually doesn’t remember having done so. But the meter knows.And the one final injunction on this is please believe the instant read of the meter. A personwho is telling you a lie, a person who has a withhold, gets an instant read on the question. Andif they’re getting a read, a needle reaction, there is a withhold. And never buy anything else.I have seen a slug of hours of duration with the needle continuing to react and the PC saying noand almost in tears over it, because the PC cannot remember, the PC cannot differentiate it, thePC cannot tell what that withhold is. It just doesn’t seem to elude anybody. And for the auditorto leave it is a serious error, because at the end of those hours, so help me Pete, it was found,and it dad clear. Now, I’ve had people with some pretty nasty withholds, on the meter. And I’ve never failed tohave the meter react when the question was charged, 80 long as it was against the moral codeof the person I was checking. That was the important point. And it’s quite interesting to watchit. It will not wear out. The question will not wear it out. That is what is fascinating. You canask it, and ask it, and ask it, and ask it, and ask it, and ask it, and ask it—and it won’t wearout. It’ll just produce, if anything, a little faster reaction. Until the withhold is given up, theaction occurs.So don’t ever think your meter is busted. Make sure that your meter isn’t, before you start thesession. That’s the time to make sure the meter is all right, not in the middle of the session,thinking, “Well, it’s just reacting. This rock slam must be because some dust has gotten intoit.” No, the rock slam is coming from a withhold if you’re on a Security Check. Okay?Audience: Right.All right. Well, I hope this clarifies a few points for you OD the subject of Security Checking,because you’re going to find this is a very, very important subject. It’s going to be with us fora very, very long time. It’s one of the basic skills of the auditor and is the first thing that anauditor should know how to do very, very well. He should know how to security check well.Because you can do anything under the sun, moon and stars with a Security Check. You can"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"do anything with it. And the better you are at handling the basics and fundamentals of SecurityChecks, then the better you will be at making them work.Thank you."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"WHAT IS A WITHHOLDA lecture given on20 February 1962All right. This is Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. What’s the date?Audience: 20th.Thankyou. What’s the month?Audience: February. - Oh, thank you. What’s the year? Audience: A.D. 12.A.D. 12. All right. All right. We will let you away with that. Thank you very much.Okay. Now, I’m going to talk to you about withholds. And this is all about withholds, so arather—relatively brief lecture. I have now found the common denominator of withholds. Youdidn’t get an opportunity to see it in today’s demonstration, but that doesn’t make anydifference to that.What is a withhold? A withhold is something that a person believes that if it is revealed, it willendanger their self-preservation. In other words, a withhold is something that endangers theself-preservation of the PC. And that is a very important definition. It’s taken me a very longtime to get that definition. It gives us a new line for 3D Criss Cross, although this is not about3D Criss Cross.And it, worked back and forth, is an absolute killer, because this is the reason whole track isoccluded. This is where your whole-track memory went. And this is the button on which it issitting.So this is a very important discovery. Therefore, we would consider that that person who hadvery little whole-track recall would consider themselves in a very dangerous position.In other words, you’ve got a gradient here. The less whole-track recall, the more the personconsiders they are in danger, and the less likely you are to get a withhold off of them. The morefantastic the whole-track recall, the same thing. We are dodging here, somehow or another,with that.Now, that’s quite important to you, because it gives you and gives me ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha—theexact reason . . .This is why you get off such as I am now going to say, and call them withholds. These areactual student withholds.“I went outside and looked at the sky and felt strange.” And an auditor bought it as a withholdand worked it over.“I had a picture of my mother’s bedroom, and I don’t know why.” That is a withhold.“I spoke crossly to an instructor.” “George and Bill told me that they had heard that Agnes . ..” And that is a withhold. Why is that a withhold?All right. Let’s start with the first one first. Of course it’s safest to get off other people’swithholds. These are all safe withholds. They are so safe. And that is all students tend to getoff on each other, is safe withholds. I’m sorry to send that arrow so deeply. They get off safe"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"withholds. If they reveal these things, it’d be perfectly all right to reveal them, because it’sperfectly safe to reveal.Now, why do we get into a tacit consent of this particular kind? Very interesting why we do:overts on other people’s withholds. We take somebody’s withhold and we yap-yap at them,and we trip them up with it, and we make them guilty with it and we sort of punish them a littlebit for having gotten off a withhold—we yip-yap on the subject. And after that, we are a littlebit afraid to get off a withhold of ourself, because we have an overt against the other person’swithhold, so therefore, we don’t consider it safe to get off a withhold. Do you see what therationale of the overt is? We have an overt on other people getting off withholds, so we don’tget off withholds, you see? Because it isn’t safe to get off a withhold.Now, of course, the more unsafe you make it to get off a withhold, the battier it all becomes,until you get a civilization like this one.Now, the one thing by which the communist profits in Australia and Suid-Afrika are the lawsagainst perversion. The state, of all means, is regulating how you are going to perform thesexual act. I think that’s very interesting. I've seldom seen any police officers in my bedroom.And I’m afraid if I did they’d have short shrift.Of course, I have had the people the police officers are supposed to restrain trying to crawl intomy bedroom windows, and a few things like that, you know, but that, of course, theywouldn’t be interested in.Now, what are they doing? They’re just trying to invent some new withholds, aren’t they? Ithink that’s fascinating, because the communist uses blackmail of this particular kind as ameans of controlling heads of state.In other words, if the state itself lends its weight to punishment of withholds, see, it has justlaid itself out to be crazy. Because now, anybody in the state can be blackmailed so as tooverthrow the state, because the state will punish the overthrow or the withhold. Do youunderstand this? Or any part of this?Audience: Yeah.All right. Now, there it is on the third dynamic. The state makes it unsafe for anybody toconfess to anything. So everybody is withholding from the state. What happens if youwithhold from the state, or the state misses withholds on you? Of course, you begin to hate thestate, and that is the downfall of nationalism.Of course, this may be very fortunate. But nevertheless, they have sown the seeds of their owndestruction by the number of great laws which arise on how a person shouldn’t get offwithholds.Let’s apply that to an auditing session. The auditor upsets the PC or tries to make the PC guiltyevery time the PC gets off a withhold. Therefore, the auditor is making it unsafe for the PC toget off a withhold. All right. Or the auditor trains the PC not to get off unsafe withholds. Theauditor then trains the PC to get off only safe withholds. And we read on an auditor’s report, “Iwent out at night and looked at the sky and felt strange.” And that is a withhold. Great day inthe morning. That’s a safe withhold, isn’t it?Well, of course, the funny part of it is, there it is. It’s not a withhold. It’s not a withhold at all. So you can actually get into a games condition with your PC by punishing the PC for hiswithholds. You can actually get into a games condition where the PC will only try to get offsafe withholds. And there you go.Now, if a PC isn’t giving me withholds, I’m afraid that I would become persuasive. Awithhold is something that, if revealed, would be prejudicial to his survival."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"Now, naturally, his individuation comes from his withholds. This hyper individuation of thePC, this only-oneness, this withdrawal into only self—all of that—and withdrawal out ofgroups, and withdrawal here and there and so forth, all of these things stem exclusively, andonly and entirely from, of course, withholds which, if gotten off, the person believes wouldinjure their survival.Now, the funny part of it is, is this is not true. The person gets an aberrated idea of what wouldinjure his survival if be got it off, don’t you see? And it’s this aberrated idea of what they dareget off that brings about the condition of aberration. I think that possibly you’ve got one, two,or three apiece—some kind of an average like that—that if you revealed it h the wrong quarter,it’s factual that somebody would be likely to take action. See, if the state of New SouthGuinea, or something of this sort, found out about this, well—huh!—might be a poor show.You’ve all got some that were factual. There are some factual ones, see? Some real ones. Youget those real buried, and they get very encysted. And the other aberrated idea builds up onthose. And we get a build-up of that.Now, the punishment of our parents, of course, we feel offhand that—this comes from pastlife; 3D Criss Cross gets these areas cleaned up—but when we started this life, we already-hadthe idea that if we disclosed certain things to our parents, or we did certain things, or we didn’twithhold mean words and so forth from our fathers or something like that, we’d find ourselvessuddenly without food, clothing and shelter. In other words, we get this exaggerated idea.well, it’s built on our past-life structure. But that’s a bad enough basis.Now, we take off from there, and we move into areas and then do commit something which, ifrevealed, would be very upsetting, or would have been very upsetting. And then other littlethings start piling up on the top of that, and so on. And we get up to a point where we becomequite aberrated, quite individuated, and we get so we can’t even communicate with parts of ourbody.The result of all this, naturally, is a feeling of high antisocialness.Somebody comes close to these withholds, and we believe implicitly, you see, that if we gotoff this withhold, naturally we could just see the police running in. My God, the sirens aregoing in all directions, you see, and police by the squad coming bursting in the front door,probably with battering rams, you know? And they got handcuffs, and they’re all ready to putthem on you, you know, and drag you off. And naturally the cell they’re going to drag you tois not any of the modern jails, you know, which just dramatize withholds; it’s probably one ofthe old-time dungeons, you know, where they bury you up to the neck in water and leave youthere for forty years or something like this, you see? You get an aberrated idea of thepunishment in a jail, and this all of a sudden rekindles, you know? The auditor gets close toone of these things, and this idea, ooooooh! you know. Oooo-oooooo-ooooo-ooo, you know?At any minute this horrible series of circumstances are going to occur, and naturally weconsider the auditor dangerous.No, listen, the auditor is only dangerous if he doesn’t pull the withhold. And that is a recurringphrase that is starting to happen here in the school. There are certain auditors that we designateas dangerous auditors.Why are they dangerous? Because they will only tick and not pull a withhold. And we callthose people dangerous auditors. Why? Their PC’s are going to be mad at them, they arethemselves going to goof up and get lots of loses one way or the other, and they’re going toalways be involved in ARC breaks of some kind or another, they’re going to have people goingaround gossiping about how bad Central Organizations are, and how bad they are, and howbad everything else is and so forth. And they are dangerous.But from the PC’s viewpoint, the-person becomes dangerous the moment they might find outwhatever this thing is, you see? The auditor appears for a moment dangerous. The auditor"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"might find out. And the PC gets ARC breaky, however, only when the auditor fails to find out.The auditor has to go the whole way. And an auditor who won’t go the whole way, an auditorwho will only get off safe withholds off of a PC is dangerous. And that is today’s adjudicationon whether a person can audit or not: Are they a safe auditor or a dangerous auditor?Oddly enough, it’s a complete reversal. The auditor who gets off safe withholds is dangerous.And the auditor who will get off unsafe withholds is safe. You understand that?Now, you’ve got to bust through any feeling you have on this and look at this square in theteeth and follow it through, because actually, all of your activities as an auditor are totally, 100percent, based on this one little fact. It all cones down to this: An auditor who will not pulldangerous withholds Tom a PC is a dangerous auditor.You’re going to have an ARC-breaky PC, your PC is going to be upset with you. There areonly two or three ways you could possibly mess it up, but how could you fail to do this?One, you could fail to use an E-Meter. You could fail to make an E-Meter play any tune thatwas-ever written by Bach, Beethoven and Brahms, you see? You could just fail to make an E-Meter talk. In other words, you look at the thing and the needle falls off the pin, and so forth,and there it is, and the parts are all collapsing and so forth, and we say, “Well, that needle,that’s null. Ha-ha. That’s a null needle. Ha-ha.”Hm. God, man. Well, you don’t have to clean it up in one session, but you have to make surethat you’ve got another session.All right. But you go a whole intensive, and you never pull any of these things, and you neverask for missed withholds, and you never try to inquire any deeper into any of these things, andthat PC blows up in your face.Every ARC break you ever got off of a PC was due to missed withholds. Although missedwithholds is brand-new as a principle, it’s been functioning this whole time. And every timeyou fail to get off a withhold—you missed a withhold on the PC, you ticked it—you had anARC break. That accounts for every ARC break you have ever had with a PC, that accounts forevery PC who never wanted to be audited again by you, that accounts for all of your owndifficulties with PC’s, right there in one fell swoop.Now, you could accomplish it by not operating with an E-Meter. You could accomplish it by avery unreal or nasty auditing approach. Every time the PC said something, you say,“Nyaaaaa.” You know, something like this. You could accomplish it by just having yourtechnology all backwards and shuffled into another deck. You could accomplish it by just poorauditing. But in the final analysis, poor auditing only exists if a person is determined thatthey’re never going to help a PC by getting off any nasty withholds. They’re going to be niceto PC’s and they’re only going to get off safe withholds.You almost have to use sjamboks and clubs on some auditors. I’m not kidding you. Mymethod on the thing is just to stampede the auditor on the subject; there’s more than one herewho’s already been stampeded by me straight at the subject. You know?The only thing you should really worry about is when I give up on you. I’ve done that, too;just quit, you know? And then you get very nice auditor reports. You get an initial orsomething like that. I just won’t do anything more about it. Why? I know you won’t. But thatdoesn’t include very many, and the other one is you start missing withholds . . .PC goals and gains: “Well, l didn’t make any goals and I didn’t make any gains” and so forth.Well, it might as well have been printed in letters of fire’ “Auditor has missed withholds on thisPC. Auditor did not clean up things on this PC. Auditor read the E-Meter upside down.”Something wild went on here. That’s all. I mean, because frankly I have to tell you this. ButI’ve got you in a box right now with Prepchecking. You’re taped and targeted."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The auditor who cannot get a result with Prepchecking will not audit. Uuuhhrrr! It’s beenweaving closer and closer to this point, see? We’ve been converging on this point. Technologyhas been getting better and better and better and better, and here we sit looking at Prepchecking.Well, Prepchecking gets a little better. There was a little change the other day in 3D CrissCross.As soon as I found out that this applied to 3D Criss Cross, I realized that you can’t let a PCcross out anything on a list. That’s you, not me—because the PC says, “That’s prettydangerous. Let’s see, that’s pretty dangerous. Let’s see, that’s pretty dangerous. And I thinkthis . . . this item, I think that’s awfully dangerous. I think we ought to have that off the list,and that off the list, and that off the list,” and we just cross the whole list off. It’s all toodangerous. And then you have missed an item, which actually amounts to a missed withhold,and so the person gets upset with 3D Criss Cross.So we can’t allow the PC, once he has- put it on the list, after we’ve blackjacked him, trickedand hoodwinked him into getting it on to the list, we can’t let the PC take it off, even thoughthat makes more work on differentiation’s. I found this is the case I find PC’s will take liveitems off the list if you don’t watch them. So, there it is.So some of your lists are disappearing into smoke, and some of your items are being crossedoft because your PC has misgivings upon the safety with which they can be revealed, since allof these items went out of sight, to some degree or another, because it was very unsafe atsometime or another to reveal them.I’m looking at somebody right now that was going around with a very, very hot terminaltucked under her arm in a family who believed implicitly that the exact reverse of this terminalwas a way of life and how to be closer to God.And this PC just had to withhold this one like mad. And of course the whole—more the PCwithheld it and so forth, why, the hotter it got. This would have been heresy. It’s like the sonof a priest, you know; he wouldn’t believe in God. (Nobody gets that joke. Boy, you’re slowtoday. You’re very slow today. Wake up.) The son of a priest, and he has a terminal called“atheist.” See? That would be very upsetting, very upsetting. He’d have withholds. So wouldthe priest.But anyway . . . Well, let’s take an example. Well, let’s just call it out of thin air “embezzler,”or something like that, you see? And this fellow was born in a banking family where integrityis all, you see? And he hears from his father, and he hears from his mother, and he hears fromhis brothers and sisters in the business and so forth, and he’s got a hot terminal. He’s been oneof the best embezzlers that the country has ever had, don’t you see? Something like that.And here he has to live in this atmosphere with this terminal. Hot, you know! So all the timehe’s pulling this terminal back. (I’m not saying that’s the terminal but . . .) You get the idea?That’s a withhold! Man, would it be unsafe to be that embezzler. Right? And he mightdramatize it at any moment. And so he fights it and he fights it and he fights it, and then onenight he goes into the bank vault and he cleans out the whole thing and goes over the hill. See,the wrong time, wrong place, wrong terminal, see, for his environment.And when these things get badly restimulated and so forth, why, they’ve had it.All right. Now some auditor is auditing him, see, and we get down to this terminal. And,“Who or what would enforce an outflow from others?” see?And he puts down “An embezzler.”And he goes down the line, and the auditor goes down, and he had a little ARC break with theauditor, something of this sort. The auditor looked at him crosswise, or didn’t acknowledgehim just right—and it’s not really an ARC break; it was just that. And he clicks on that other"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"one, you see? “You know this . . . I don’t . . .”—auditor has already missed a withhold onhim, and so forth—and he says, “I . . . I don’t know.” He . . .We’re differentiating the list, and we get down to “embezzler,” and we . . . He thinks we bettercross that off, so he says, “Well, it . . . it really wouldn’t enforce an outflow. Cross . . . crossthat off the list.”Gives him a second thought, and we mustn’t let the PC have that second thought. So there’sthat little change in 3D Criss Cross. You see why it is?All right. Now let’s take up Prepchecking. These two things, you see, suddenly go hand inglove. In other words, we have one straight line. We have Prepchecking as a basic for thislifetime that keeps the PC in session, and then we have its extension, 3D Criss Cross, and bothof them are devoted to the same thing of letting the guy stand in the sun. They’re both devotedto the same thing, you see? Getting him over all of his oddball notions about how dangerous itwould be to reveal the fact that he had a crooked left ear. Nothing to it. I mean, he looks at thisafter a while and laughs. But he isn’t laughing at the time you start auditing him.You say, “All right, now. Okay. Now, what about that activity there that was going on inTacoma?”“(sigh) Now, let’s see. If I think of something else, or if I can get the auditor thinking ortalking about something else. . .” You know, this is all reactive, you know? So let’s move it allover onto some other perimeter. Then he says, Well, it has to do actually with uh . . . MexicoCity.” In other words, he’s trying to throw red herrings. He can get into a point of reactivelyregretting having mentioned it. And you’ll see him pass through that little band of regretting hebrought it up in the first place.Now, if the auditing is bad, he does this often. If the auditing is good, he only does it once in awhile. It is always present, no matter how good the auditing is.“I’m kind of sorry I brought this up. Now what is going to happen to me?” Of course, all thetime he’s being sorry he brought it up, you’re just crossing into the actual zone and area. Youactually have tremendous unknowns left on the whole subject. And the PC does not knowmuch, and a great deal, about this. That’s what the difficulty is. In other words, he still hastremendous unknowns.Now, in Prepchecking, also, there’s been a little discovery here about when the PCequivocates, you know you’re looking at the package. When he starts to explain. Watch whenthe PC starts to explain. At that moment add a What, One sub-three, or whatever it’s coming upthis time. And let’s find out what this little hot subject is he’s going over right this minute. He’sexplaining.Now, there’s a rule. There’s a rule about this, about asking What questions. And this isn’treally about What questions, but I’ll just show you what this is.The first rule is: When the PC gives you a motivator, you know you’re on hot ground; and soyou always ask a What question that’s rather overt.Says, “Well, my mother beat me every day.”My What question, I’m afraid, at the moment is “What have you done to your mother?” lwould not even monkey with this motivator, see? I wouldn’t fool with it at all.Now, the next gradient up, that would be the most certain ground to mine. Motivator,motivator, motivator—man, that just takes the What question and practically writes it in legiblescript in front of your face, you see?"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Your next one up the line from that is the person is critical. The person is being critical ofsomebody. Well, the criticalness—you can go on and pull criticism forever without gettinganyplace. You want to know what he did, did, did, did, did, done, done, done, done, action,action, action. There must be action back of that criticism. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have it,see? So, criticism is a sure indicator of an overt.Now let’s take the milder form of it, which is explaining why it happened. The PC startsexplaining, I don’t let the PC explain very long without giving him a new One sub-something-or-other on the What question. I give him a new What question to clean up.PC starts explaining and says, “Well, actually, the truth of the matter was that I was on theferryboat. I hadn’t uh . . . uh . . . I hadn’t actually uh . . . meant to be on the ferryboat, youunderstand, but I was coming down from the taxi rank, and I just saw the ferryboat there . . .”I’m liable to cut him off at that moment, on whatever we were tallying about, and ask a littlemore pinched-in-close What “What were you doing?” you know? Something like this -And he says, “Well, oh-oh. Oh, that!” And it alerts him.So you have these various indicators. They make a gradient. PC gives you a motivator; ohwell, that’s an absolute certain indicator, and you must pull the overt straight-away, justconvert the thing into an overt without any slightest . . .Person says, “Well, my . . . just my mother beat me every day, just on and on and on. Andbeat me every day and so forth.”It’s just a lead-pipe cinch. “What have you done to your mother?” I mean, it might as wellappear—be printed—on the auditor form, you know? I mean, it’d be that inevitable.Your nest one is criticism, criticism, criticism. Well, there’s a real overt back of this, and soforth.Now, we’re not going to dignify getting off other people’s withholds by even classifying it. Anauditor who would do that, oh, man. That’s very safe, but it’s so safe that they’re notwithholds. They’re not his withholds. What are you doing monkeying with somebody else’swithholds? They’re not this PC’s actions. Perfectly safe to reveal other people’s withholds,isn’t it? Or it might be, unless they find out about it.Then your area of explanation. And then there is the actual withhold. Now, of course, theactual withhold: the person says, “Well, I . . . I used to stand down OD the Battery and . . . uhbung paving stones through the windshields of cars ‘ see? And you’ve got your tailor-madeWhat question standing right in front of your face, because it’s not “What about bunkingpaving stones through windshields of cars on the Battery on July first, nineteen hundred andsixty-two?” or something like this, you see? That’s not the question. The question is, “Whatabout damaging cars?” or something. But there’s your What question. It’s tailor-made becauseit’s the withhold.Now let’s drop downstairs a little bit, and we find the PC is explaining something. So we getthe What question out of the bulk of his explanation.He’s saying, “Well, I actually . . . I actually would never . . . never really liked . . . liked uh . .. liked my wife, and I really never liked her, and uh . . . so forth. And this was easy tounderstand. I of course was . . . came home late and all that sort of thing, but she never keptherself up, and she never really did anything for me around the house. And she never reallypaid much atten . . .”Actually, he hasn’t given a motivator, you know, he hasn’t given an overt. It’s just anexplanation of how it was all messy. And you could just cut him short on his explanation, get"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"your new What.All right. So next indicator is the PC is being very critical about something or other. He’s beingvery critical of you, the auditor. That’s a very special case. If he’s being critical of you, theauditor, you have missed a withhold, and you better find out what it is. What should you havefound out about? “When did you think I was a fool?” Anything that you could possiblymention that would throw a missed withhold into view—that would be the stage at which youpulled this particular one. But it’s the criticism. You want to find out what has been done.The missed withhold underlies all of these things, by the way. But you can find an actualdoingness at the point of criticism. He’s saying, “Well, natter, natter, natter, and actually Ialways thought . . . always thought that he wore the wrong color ties. And uh . . . that waswhy I didn’t like him,” or something of the sort, and so on. Well, he’s done something to thatperson or done something to a person like that. So your What question is tailor-made out ofthat.And then there is: your fundamental fundamental is motivator. Man, red Rag! Let’s just findout what he’s done to the source of that motivator or the type of beingness of that motivator.Just overtly find out what he’s done. In other words, you’re getting off overts and so on.Now, if you look at this as a scale, you will find out that the withhold is measured by thedegree of danger—the only reason I’m giving you this scale; I’m not talking about how youask What questions—the degree of danger the PC conceives to be present on the subject ofgetting off the withhold.All right. If the PC doesn’t think it’s very dangerous, they give it to you directly and straight. Ifthe PC thinks it’s a little bit dangerous, they explain around the fringes of where it might lie. Ifthe PC thinks it’s rather confoundedly dangerous—it’s getting just a little bit grim, maybe onthe jail borderline on that chain—the PC will criticize. See, criticism enters.And if it is so dangerous that the PC believes—you understand I’m saying PC “believes”; I’mnot saying it’s factual—the PC is right up to the point where, with a jingle jangle the patrolwagon arrives, the officers pick up the battering ram, they knock down the front door, theycome crashing in with the handcuffs and leg irons, you see, and drag him screaming off, towedback of the Black Maria, you see? Something like this. And they can see this is going to happenif that withhold is missing; they give you the motivator. They always give you a motivator.Flat, flat, total motivator—a hundred percent.Now, how do you use this? Well, it gives you the gradient scale and indexes of all cases. Acase is not as bad off as he is crazy. A case is not as bad off as he is aberrated. A case is not asbad off as anything, except how dangerous he considers it would be if he revealed himself.And so you have from the top to the bottom, all cases on that gradient, just like you have theWhat questions and the degree of the withhold and the safety on that gradient, so you have allcases on that gradient. And the person who will die before he will reveal himself is also on thatscale.So you have them, from the case that you could audit to Clear in twenty-five hours. See, bang!You sneeze, the person is Clear. Well, this person has not had any great idea that it’d bedangerous to tell people things. That’s the index of that case.All right. Now, the person who went 150 hours to a Routine-3 kind of Clear, well, that persondoesn’t have very much he considers is—be all right. Pretty easy.Now we have the case that we went two hundred hours on only finding a goal and terminal.Well, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, that case has got quite a little hatfull. There is a nice little hatfull ofstuff that if the individual revealed any part of that, he thinks, he believes, that hmmm it wouldbe . . . well, it’d be rough. It would be pretty rough. He’d probably lose his family, and he’d"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"lose this and that, you see?And now you take the person who went five hundred hours with no goal and no terminal andno gain, and that sort of thing. Now, we know darn well this person has [is] moving up intothe perimeter of the police breaking in the front door, if it were learned about this person, see?And now we take the case that actually goes to the spinbin rather than reveal things. Well, man,that’s in extremis. Because insanity is the last protest against punishment. See, “I cannot feelyour punishment. I do not even know about it. I’m not even a rational being. You’ve driven meout of my mind.” You see, that’s a total motivator on the subject of punishment.So, where we go. Then you’ve got your whole thing. It’s just length of time in auditing. Yourlength of time in auditing is indexed by the danger the individual believes would be present ifhe revealed certain things. And danger to reveal is the direct index of length of time in auditing.There it is. Want to know how long it takes to clear somebody? Well, how dangerous does thisperson consider it would be to reveal certain things.Now, how could you cut down this length of time in auditing? Well, I’ve given you theanswer. Don’t pull safe withholds. Just move in and pull actual withholds. Don’t fool aroundwith it. And use Prepchecking. And you’ve got that, all right. Now, that gets this lifetime’sdanger out of the way.And I’ve even given you a new type of line and a slight change in 3D Criss Cross that does notpermit the person to escape once you’ve got the item on the list. And the type of line is—theline for 3D Criss Cross, of course is “What identity would it be unsafe for you to reveal?” orsome such wording. See? And they will blow into view. And “What identity would it be safefor you to reveal?” of course, could be a relief line, which would just be nonsense. But itwould sort of balance the thing off and throw the other one into view; in other words, just be atrick line.In other words, you could drag these things out, and you know now what the PC is doing, soit becomes relatively simple. That is what the PC is doing. While he is there sitting in front ofyou, he would like to reveal himself. He would like to reveal this, and he would like to get outof it, but he does not know how to get out of it. And the person is always hoping thatsomebody will come along and give him a shot in the gluteus maximus with some magic fluidby which he will not have to reveal a thing and become totally Clear.And any time anybody has ever proposed that to me, why, I've had an instinct on the subject.Now I know why! I should go back through the files and find out who’s proposed it, becausewe would have an index of some of our roughest cases. It’d be the person who wants to becleared without revealing anything.Now, the people who get spinny in processing, you must be falling right over something.Well now, Prepchecking will get it for you. There is no contest about it. This is a very easy,easy activity, because a person moves right up into it. But the basic Prepcheck question thatwould get them all would of course be one of these “unsafe to reveal” questions.Your Zero: “Have you ever done anything that might have been unsafe to mention?” See, thatwould be your Zero. “Is there anything you’ve ever done that would be unsafe to you if youtold about it?” ”If you reveal certain things about yourself, would it be unsafe to you?” Somesuch Zero, don’t you see? Doesn’t matter how it expresses to the PC. Then you get your Whatoff of what the PC said. Then you’d mine that down, you’d strip the whole bank. Interesting.“Safe to reveal.” This is the index on it.Now, you must figure it’s awful safe to show up with a MEST body, a meat body, you see;and then you get the idea that it’s unsafe, so you begin to take it down. That must be what old"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"age is. That must be the only thing old age is. So take heart, girls.Now, you just look at this, as the idea of apparency, appearances, disappearances, being there,not being there, well, it all passes over into the field of fact. Offering the fact is dangerous.Withholding the fact is apparently not dangerous. All it does is pull the person to pieces. That’sthe trick of the Body Builder. That is the basic trick of this universe. And the basic trick of thisuniverse is, if you withhold it, it won’t hurt you any. And of course, that is a stinking lie.So they get everybody to withhold things. They invent codes of law and that sort of thing, andthese things are all supposed to get everybody to withhold a thing, and then the thetan gets topacking up mass and occupying less space. And he occupies less space and less space, and hecan permeate less and less things, and here he goes. He’s got it made. Yeah. But who’s got itmade?Of course, that is a game nobody wins. Scientology is the only game where everybody wins.Now, there is your index of withholds. There is your. . . what they’re about. That is why yourPC won’t talk to you. That is why your PC reveals what he reveals. That’s why yousometimes look very silly writing down, “Well, the PC has a withhold that the PC has a benttoe,” and why, after you’ve prepchecked a bent toe for five or six sessions, there has been nogain on the part of the PC.You see? You see how this might work? Does this straighten out anything for you?Audience: Hm-mm.Now, you could use this principle, but if I give it to you, you’ll work it to death, instead ofusing it as a Zero, you can flip over, and you mustn’t work this to death.“Who would it have been dangerous to have revealed that to?” could be a version of the Whoquestion. But you get on some hot line, and the person is talking about having robbed everyrestaurant in the entirety of New York—and he’s robbed every restaurant in New Yorkpractically, and so forth, and he just keeps going on and on and you don’t seem to clean thisup—the W-ho that will clean it up is “Who wouldn’t it have been safe to have told about that,”and “Who didn’t find out about it?”And of course, he’d say, “Well, the restaurateurs”—and he’s been saying “the restaurateurs”all this time and all of a sudden he looks at you, and he says, “Well, all right. The police.”“All right. When did they fail to find out about it?” And we get the rest of the chain, and itblows. Do you see that?Now, there is your gradient of the value of the withhold to the PC. And I call very strictly toyour attention that I have said the PC “believes” it would be unsafe. And that is what is mostinteresting: “believes” it would be unsafe.And of course, these things . . . I think the crime you committed—I think they probably runout of witnesses. I don’t think the government would spend a cent trying to dig up enoughwitnesses, or even find the records, in order to prosecute you and so forth, particularly if it wasa real crime. The government is much more interested in minor crimes than real crimes.The essence of the situation, however, is one little thing like that gets stacked up on other littlethings, and something else gets stacked up on that, and the next thing you know a personbelieves it’s very dangerous to put his nose out-of-doors. Can’t! Can’t go outside. And there’syour “can’t go outside” thing. God-awful things are liable to happen to this person if they gooutside; liable to be recognized as the person who committed the murder, only they kind ofvaguely think maybe they have committed a murder, which is quite interesting ."},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"You have very few backtrack things on this that are hot, but every case must have a few on it.You suddenly say, “Oh man, I bet they’re still waiting for me. I bet they’re still looking for mesomeplace or another,” and the PC is liable to have his hair almost stand on end for a momentwhen he hits one of these things. And then he suddenly “Well, that’s nonsense. Been a longtime ago. Long, long time—I wonder if they are.”But this equally applies to 3D Criss Cross and to Prepchecking, but is most salient in your useof Prepchecking. And there is where you should use it. And I won’t get nasty or mean withyou, or anything. I will just forbid anybody to get off your withholds if I hear any moresession being spent on “I went out in the evening and looked at the sky and felt strange.” Iwouldn’t even try to make anything out of it, except that some PC had a hot area someplace andhad just thrown me a great big floppy, squishy red herring. And I don’t like red herring, so Iwould let that one drop.There are certain withholds you let go by. You just let them go by. You don’t do a thing withthem. And there are certain withholds that you hang to till grim death until they are all revealed,and you’ll just have to learn which ones. And the index of it is, what is it the PC consider itsafe to reveal? What does the PC consider it unsafe to reveal? And that unravels the wholeproblem for you.Thank you."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"MISSED WITHHOLDSA lecture given on22 May 1962Thank you.Lecture two. Saint Hill Special Briefing Course.May the—what did you say it was? Twenty . . . ?Audience: 22nd.22nd. I get so mixed up on this planet’s time. I don’t know this planet’s time at all. AD. 12.English weather.This is a lecture on the subject of missed withholds.Now, there’s a long and involved bulletin on the subject which I haven’t got in my hand, butsome of you may have.And this has to do with several bulletins, amongst them HCO Bulletin of May the 24th, alsoHCO Bulletin of May the 21st, and HCO Bulletin of May the 22nd. Last two are relativelyunimportant.Now, you’re going round and round about this proposition of TRs and how you ask for thisand that, and exactly how you do this. And this bulletin of May the 24th teaks about Q and A.And there has been a great deal of misunderstanding about Q and A, because there wasn’t a realhot communication on what Q and A was. See, there’s been a lot of talk about Q and A, but areal hot thing . . .Now it sounds like, when you read this bulletin, that I knew what Q and A was all the time,you see? And I’m talking to you—it doesn’t sound this way, but you could take it that I wastalking to you as “You dullard, why didn’t you know this?”Well, the truth of the matter is, there is at least a third of this data— probably the mostimportant third—was unknown. And I just recently discovered this thing. And the term Q andA fits in gorgeously if you interpret it as questioning the PC’s answer. So it really ought to beQ an A—no ‘d’ on the ‘and’. Question an answer.Well, if you apply that principle, question an answer, throughout here, you get all three types.You get double questioning. Well, that’s the PC says something and—he gives you a reply toyour question—and then you question his answer. . See? Well, of course, that’s noacknowledgment and that’s just a setup for an ARC break.And Q and A also would be changing because the PC changes. In other words, you run aprocess on the PC and then the PC answers up this process, nicely and neatly, by changing,you see? And right in the middle of the change, because he’s changed, you change. In otherwords, you give the PC what he’s giving you, you see? But you again are questioning the factthat he’s changing. His response to the process is being questioned.And then the nest thing is, following the PC’s instructions comes under this. Now you’ve got atotal reversal of the whole thing, and because the PC obviously knows far more about his casethan we do, or something of the sort, don’t you see, why, therefore it’s always best, you see,to do what he says. In other words, that Q and A hardly is the questioning of the PC. That is aQ and A of me, see? That’s questioning my answers to his case. That’s kind of stringing alongbow, but an amusing way to put it."},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"We got the answers. If you know them and you can apply them, why, you’ll get there. And ifyou keep finding holes in the line, why, we’ll find some more that we didn’t even knowexisted. But basically, an auditor must stay in control of the auditing session. There is no doubtabout this.Well, the way an auditor stays in control of the auditing session is to stay at cause over thesession and put the PC at cause over his case. And if we don’t stay at cause over the session,the PC cannot stay at cause over his case. He goes to effect. Because, you see, we’re raisingthe PC’s causativeness by making the PC confront. And if we don’t make the PC confront, thePC will just obey his bank. And his bank says “Don’t confront.”Now, a full cycle of action must exist with an auditing command—a full cycle of action. Andyou can’t have a muddy cycle of action.Well, this puts a tremendous responsibility on the auditor to ask the right auditing question.You say, “What should I be running on you today?” You have asked a wrong question.You can ask wrong auditing questions. You can say, “Have you had a motivator lately?” Andthat is a wrong auditing question.So there are two conditions which can exist here: is a wrong auditing question and a failure tolet a cycle complete itself. You can do these two things, both of them quite deadly.Wrong auditing question: “Have I missed a withhold on you?” Now, we didn’t know this waswrong a short time ago, but it is quite wrong because the PC can answer it with a motivatorresponse. You’ve managed to dig that up for me. PC’s were never ambitious enough to do thatfor me. They just took the easy route and did what I want, but it was they found by experienceit was easier to do that.But answering with a motivator has happened in many cases. So you mustn’t ask a middle-rudiments or a rudiment-type question which permits the PC to give a motivator response,because the PC is then throwing the end rudiments out.Now, you mustn’t throw your end rudiments out. This is the wrong auditing question. This isalso part of the wrong auditing question. You mustn’t permit the PC to throw his endrudiments out. You’ve got to keep his end rudiments in. And if you look over the endrudiments, you will see there are several that can go out. And if any of those end rudiments goout, the PC will go out of session. So if you ask an auditing question which permits the PC tolet his end rudiments go out, you cut your throat.Now, let’s get the middle rudiments in by throwing the end rudiments out, and then we’ve gota nice dog’s breakfast.Let’s say, “In this session have I missed a withhold on you?”“Yes. My PC—Eve been sitting here thinking how mean my PC has been to me in the last fewsessions.”Oh, man, you’ve had it. You’re in for a Q and A. Now, if you keep the end rudiment fromgoing out—this is the problem you’ve posed yourself—to keep the end rudiment from goingout you’ve got to Q and A. You can’t permit the cycle to be finished. He just got throughdamaging his own PC!Now, these two things have to be held in balance, don’t you see? This is a real crazy one. Barasking a wrong auditing question you will inevitably throw yourself into a Q and A, becauseyou’ve got to question the PC’s answer.You say, “Has anybody been mean to you lately?”"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"And the PC says, “Oh, yes! yes! yes! Herbie’s been mean to me and Reg has been mean to me.All say my fellow students have been mean to me.”(I’m not talking about any particular student.)All right. You’ve just thrown the end rudiments wildly out.Now, suppose you correct this: Supposing you ask some equivocal thing like “Have I missed awithhold on you?”“Yes. I was sitting here realizing that Mike has a deep sadistic tendency.”Well, you’ve had it here. Now what have you done? You see? You ask a question which wasequivocal. The PC gives you an answer which throws the end rudiments out. Now, the onlyway you can correct this is with a Q and A. You can’t buy this answer.This is the auditor’s dilemma that I am giving you here. You can’t buy this answer becauseyou’ve thrown the end rudiment out. You would question the answer in any event, even if yousaid promptly, “In this session have you damaged anyone?” The PC would still realize that hisanswer had been questioned. See, the auditor’s dilemma. You ask a wrong question, you willQ-and-A every time.So you’ve got to ask a type of question—well, I’m not giving you, now, words; I’ll give youthe principle back of such wording. You must ask a type of question which makes a Q and Avery unlikely. I will not use the word impossible.Now, you can judge whether or not the wording of a middle rudiment or a Prepcheck question,or anything else you could judge whether or not a question you’re asking the PC is right just onthat formula alone. Is it one which will lead to a possibility of having to question the PC’sanswer? And if it is, then it is to greater or lesser degree a wrong question, because he’s goingto give you a response which you then must question.You’re going to have to question his answer. And then he’s going to feel like he’s notacknowledged. And then he’s going to feel like he can’t talk to you. And then he’s going to goout of session. And there goes all of your beginning ruds and all the end ruds.Now, that’s where you should direct your consideration of what you are doing with the PC.You must not Q-and-A. To prevent Q and A, you must ask the right auditing question. What isa right auditing question? One that will produce an answer you do not have to challenge. That isthe perfect auditing question: a question that will produce an Answer from the PC that does nothave to be challenged or qualified in any way by the auditor, as you mustn’t question ananswer.Now, here’s a perfect Q and A, in case somebody came in late and doesn’t have a copy of thebulletin. Here’s a perfect Q and A:We run into Joe. We say to Joe, “How are you, Joe?”And Joe says, “Awful.”And we say, “What’s wrong?”Well, that’s very socially acceptable. You’ll hear it up and down the highroads and byways inevery language including the Chinese and Scandinavian. Everybody does it. It’s socialmachinery. It would be unsympathetic of us not to do it.We ask a question: We say, “Well, have you had a good day, Bill?” We meet Bill, you know?"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"And Bill says, “No”Inevitably, we have to amplify the thing, see? So we say, “Well, what happened?”That’s a Q and A. That questions the PC’s answer.Correct. This is correct:“How are you?”“Awful.”“Good.” (When you get an answer like that, it is much more polite to say “Thank you.”)Do you know, the funny part of it is, even in social concourse the fellow will feel better if youhandled it that way. He told you how he felt, so give him the cheery ack, man—the cheery ack.All right. Now let’s take the auditing question. Now, here’s where auditors tie themselves notjust into knots, but double carrick bends, bowlines on a bight and other unlikely cask hitches,and so forth.We’re doing rudiments. We say, “Do you have a present time problem?”“Yes.”“Well, what is it?”Flunk, flunk, flunk, flunk! He answered our question. So therefore there is something a littlebit phony with the question. See, that question is not the perfect auditing question. See,because it isn’t perfect it leads us into a Q and A.Now, the best question, of course, would [be] one which would require him to tell us. So youwould have to add to it “and if so, tell me what it is.”You don’t always run into this problem, but the proper non-Q-and-A response is “Do you havea present time problem?”PC says, “Yes.”You say, “Thank you. I will check it on the meter.”So therefore, the slightly offbeat question leads us into an inevitability of a Q and A because wewould be prompted to say, “Do you have a present time problem?”“Yes.”And the auditor would be prompted to say, “Yeah, well, what is it?”Hey, wait a minute! The guy did answer your auditing question. Your auditing question is “Doyou have a present time problem?”You cut his comm. It’ll throw him out of session. You’ve thrown the remaining rudiments out,don’t you see?The trick of keeping rudiments in is not throwing the others out while you’re getting one in.And in view of the fact that there are more you are not working than the one you are working,the probability of your doing this is great if you don’t know this rule about the perfect auditingquestion and what a Q and A is. You can throw these things out wildly if you don’t."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"And auditing is, of course, what you get away with and you don’t run into this in extremis.Most times it goes off just fine.You say, “Do you have a present time problem?”And the fellow says, “Yes. I had a fight last night with my auditor.”Your proper response to that is “Good” or “Thank you.”The Q-and-A response would be “What about?” And that just throws the comm straight out thewindow, you see, because it’s an incomplete cycle, you have not bought the PC’scommunication, the PC will go out of session and rudiments start shedding out of the sessionlike a white dog when you’re wearing a blue suit. There you are. You’ve had it, don’t you see?Now, auditors do these others, such as changing because the PC changes. An auditor whodoes this constantly after it’s been called to his attention just should be shot. I mean, there’s noother-cure for it. I see them keep it up, you know? Actually, it tokens tremendous impatience.That is all.This auditor is so anxious to do something for this PC that he’s got to do it all in the next tenseconds. And therefore, he won’t even run the full bracket. See, he’ll do something like this(actually, he’s trying to help the PC like mad, usually): “Think of a problem you couldconfront. Think of a problem you could confront. Think . . . How are you getting along on thatprocess? Think of a problem you could confront. Think of a pro—How—how are you gettingalong? Do you have problems now? You Clear yet? Oh well, we’ll have to do something else.Let’s see. Invent a problem. Invent a problem. That’s best. How are you doing? You Clearyet? Well, maybe we shouldn’t be running problems at all. Let’s—let’s get down to somethingmore fundamental. You used to talk about your mother an awful lot. Let’s see. Now, what hasyour mother done to you? Thank you. What has your mother done to you? Thank you. Whathas your mother done to you? Thank you. What has your mother done to you? Thank you. Wedon’t seem to be getting anyplace here. What has your mother done to you? Uh . . . well, let’sskip that.”Do you know auditors actually have done this? I’m not just joking something that has neverexisted. You see it less commonly that way. More commonly, they will change from session tosession. They won’t Batten what they did in the last session because it’s much better, whatthey thought of today, you see?So that type of thing, the auditor just simply needs training, but basically needs someconfidence. This auditor will also go off into extraordinary solutions very easily because hedoesn’t have any confidence in the ordinary doing anything, because he’s never done it.And as far as following the PC’s instructions, again, you get a PC who is blasty, who is upset,who is misemotional and so forth, and a lot of auditors just back out of it. And then they’ll dowhat the PC wants them to do. And it just about kills the PC. That’s the usual source of that.We’re not worrying about that right now, however. We’re worrying about this most basic andfundamental Q and A for which we do have an immediate and direct cure.The first cure is always ask the right auditing question. The right auditing question is onewhich prohibits a Q and A.There is no perfect right auditing question. You actually can get along with relatively sloppyones like “Do you have a present time problem?” Nobody has ever run into this so seriously onpresent time problems—Yes,” the PC says.But it’s a bad auditing question because it can be replied to so that you have to say, “Well, whatis it?” Ha-ha. Of course, that’s a Q and A. The PC answered it, and now you pretend that the"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"PC hasn’t answered it. But the PC did answer it. Well, the PC gets the idea that he hasn’tanswered it, so there, if he hasn’t answered it—you don’t think he’s answered it—then heknows what position he’s in. He knows he’s not in session because the auditor didn’t hearhim. So therefore he must be withholding, so therefore he must be a missed withhold. And ifhe’s a missed withhold, then the thing for him to be is mad at the auditor. Very logical. Butyou’ll find out that that is 100 percent just like that! The exact mental response of 100 percentof your PC’s, no matter whether they look nice about it or look happy about it or anything elsethat is the response of every PC who sits in front of you.If you want to drive . . . take the mildest, best, goodest, most educated PC you ever hadanything to do with—PC never really been in session, just sort of socially answers responses,you see, and tries to be nice about the whole thing, and you never really get a bite on his caseand he’s always sitting there and very quiet, charming, nice, never makes any changes. Youever see this PC? PC exists.Take this perfect PC who never has any changes and just start this racket on this PC: “Do youhave a present time problem? Have you ever had a present time problem in your whole life?Yes, I know, but uh . . . yes.” You say, “Yes, I know. But have you ever had a problem inyour whole life?”The PC answers something. You say, “Well, but . . . no, look, look. Look, listen now. Inyour whole life have you ever had a problem?” see?And the PC says, “Well, yes, I—I had appendicitis and—and so—so forth.”And you say, “Uh . . . now, look, I’m talking to you. Do—have you, see? Ha-have you,you—right there, you know?—have you ever had a problem in your whole life? I—I want . . .uh I want you to tell me now.”And the PC says, “Well, I did have . . . my back’s out and it gave me . . .”“When are you going to tell me? Now, just own up to it—a problem.”And listen, you keep up some kind of a racket like that—you could make it more flagrant thanthat—and do you know . . .You think a PC is peculiar who screams. You think this is a certain type of PC. Well, I assureyou that that is not a type of PC, that’s a type of auditor. Because you can drive that goodPC—that perfectly educated PC—you can drive them absolutely into a screaming funk that youhave just never heard the like of. You would just never dream that a human being could be thatupset. And you can do it to every PC you audit.And when this is done too much to a PC, when it’s done at the wrong moments, whenprocesses are also changed on the PC too often, and when the PC is also giving auditingdirections which have been accepted (and let’s composite the whole thing, you see) we getsomebody—all you have to do is look like you haven’t received the question, and thereafter theguy will start screaming. Just look like you haven’t heard him. You know? Be looking at thewindow when he speaks. You were going to come in right afterwards and say, “Yeah. Allright. Thank you.” You were going to do that, but you just paused for just a split second, andhe saw that you were looking at the window; he’ll start screaming.“Goddamn you! You ought to go back to the Academy. Jesus Christ, whoever the hell told youyou were an auditor? For Christ’s sake!” That’s it.In other words, you, the auditor, can create that state of mind You can create that situationmuch more easily than baking a birthday cake.Now, I’m not talking now—because I myself a few times have been driven into “Christ"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"almighty!” you know? I think poor Philip, one day—I only did once. He missed fifteen ortwenty. And the nest thing you know, helloing like this because I had said a couple of verymean things, which of course I didn’t mean. But the guy had just—I’m not always a good PCor a bad PC, but just all of a sudden the no acknowledgment, the no acknowledgment, the noacceptance of the answer, something like that, and you sit there in amazement.You sit back here. I got a good reality on it. And you sad “What the hell!” you know? You’resaying, “For Christ’s sakes, why don’t you get your mind on it!” you know? You sit back andlook at yourself—”Did I say that? Huh? Was that me? Who was that? Did I hear some noise inhere?” Because you’re in the irresponsibility, of course, of being a PC, and you just react.I did it to a PC, almost with malice, one time, but actually not on purpose. And that was when Ilearned exactly what the mechanism of it was. I had to look at exactly what had been going on.And I analyzed it and then I turned around and I did it again and brought the same response, ofcourse.Now, I’ve taken other PC’s, and I can start up the same response. Then I analyze any situationwhere that is occurring and I find the same response. That is it, man. Of course, the PC will gointo apathy, go into a complete funk.Now, there is an extreme action of questioning the PC’s answer. That is the extreme responseon the part of the PC to not receiving the PC’s answer, because of course the PC thinks he’swithholding.And that’s the whole mechanism—his replies have been missed. So therefore he is a missedwithhold. And he gets upset! Just as you will find missed withholds works on everybody, sothis mechanism will upset any PC.But now, look. Look. Now, listen to me very carefully. Do we have to produce the extremestate of screaming, of apathy, of making the PC ill, to have it in effect? I mean, is thereanything short of the extreme state? Oh, yes. Yes. There is a twilight zone of in session and outof session caused by the almost not-responded-to answer, the occasionally not-acknowledgedreply by the PC; this sort of thing causes a borderline of not being out of session totally and notbeing in session, but just being in a condition where all the rest of the rudiments keep going outall the time. Everything is sort of flying out, and you’re sort of keeping the PC in session, youknow, just—ha, just by gripping the table edge with your fingernails, you know? It’s justbarely keeping the PC in sessionWhat’s the answer to it? Is don’t Q-and-A. The PC says something, acknowledge it. Well,how can you keep from Q-and-Aing? Always ask the right auditing question. Of course, that’simpossible to bat one thousand on the right auditing question—so therefore, make up yourmind whether you’re occasionally going to accept some nonsense from the PC or drive the PCinto an ARC break. And actually if you ask the wrong auditing question, you are honor boundto buy the nonsense. But what if the nonsense throws out the end rudiments? Then you’veworsened the case. Then you have to get the end rudiments in. Now, we’ve got some kind of achain reaction going.You ask the wrong auditing question you cannot directly acknowledge the question because itisn’t the kind of answer that you want, or is a damaging answer to the PC, so this throws outthe end rudiments. Therefore, you have to get the end rudiments in, in order to get this otherrudiment in, and so forth. And then you ask this same question again, but of course the PCgives you the wrong response which throws it . . . Look at the chain reaction here. And thatPC will not be in session.That’s the only thing you can say about that—PC won’t be in session. PC will be half, three-quarters, out of session, all the time, all the time, all the time. Tone arm action is out and soforth. And then you have to become an absolute expert at putting middle rudiments in. Oh, youeven develop systems sometimes to keep your middle rudiments in and you get very arduous."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"And it all stems back So the wrong auditing question in the first place, which forces you into aQ and A.You say, “Do you have a present time problem?”He says, “Yes.”You say, “Well, what about?”What’s this, you know? So you’ve already driven it a little bit up the wall, see?The exact right response is “Do you have a present time problem?”“Yes.”“Thank you. I will check it on the meter.”Now, for Christ’s sakes, if you will pardon my French, don’t ask him this again. See, if this iswhere we are going to get with this particular question, we had better ask a question which isfar more intelligent, because there is an old, old datum that comes forward from 1950. And thatis, you can ask an auditing question once or twice without restimulating the PC. You canalways ask any process once or twice, even three times. But when you get up to three times,you’re on the border of . . . Now you’re got to flatten it, from there on, see? Do you see what Imean? So you can always ask a question, take the answer—it laid an egg. Well, let’s sort out whatwould be the proper question here, now, and ask the question, get the answer to that andacknowledge it. It will do the PC far less damage if we do it that way. Far, far less damage ifwe do it that way than if we shift in mid-flight and Q-and-A.“Do you have a present time problem?”“Yes.”“Well,, what is it about?” Oh, God. We’ve had it now. We’ve done a Q and A. PC will go justthat far out of session. Inevitably, although he looks still looks the same (you don’t see it, itdoesn’t get written on his forehead in letters of fire), he has still done it. An invariable rule,because it busts up the comm formula and does a lot of other things.All right. So how do we approach this problem? We ask a question. If it obviously is thewrong question to ask and doesn’t produce the answer, we back out of the same door we wentin, gracefully, by completing the cycle of action always. You’re always safer to complete thecycle of action.Now, there are several other things you could do. You can do an interim “I’m not asking youquestions. I am trying to find out what the responses are on this meter,” like you have to do inPrepchecking. You say, “All right, now. You don’t have to answer any of these, but I’m goingto ask you several little What questions about this thing and see what the best reaction we getnow. What about stealing vehicles? What about killing girlfriends? What about whatever it is.Yeah, well, what about stealing vehicles? Thank you. I got the What question now. All right.Now, let’s go back to this incident which you just had there. Good.”And we just prepcheck it. You see, there’s a fumble period. I suppose you couldn’t dignify itany more than call it a fumble period.You ask a middle rudiment. Here’s an example:“In this session have I missed a withhold on you?” Cheerily, cheerily, cheerily. See, veryhappy. Perfectly legitimate. You get away with it 89 percent of the time. Oh, more than that—"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"you probably get away with it 95% percent of the time, you see? It’s those other few percentthere. And you run into that one head-on, see?“Yes. I’ve been sitting here thinking what a rotten auditor you are. And how mean all theinstructors are to me.”And now, of course, you say, “Thank you. I will check that on the meter. In this session haveI missed a withhold on you?” Clank! Whew!You see, right there you’ve had it, see? You know you’re walking through the valley of death.You’re walking down the street at sunset let me put it that way—with Black Bart in town. Thisis a deadly activity in which you are involved.So you say, “All right. Thank you very much. Now, have I missed a withhold on you in thissession?”“Yes. I think you’re giving me a bunch of no-auditing. You know, I’ve had twenty auditorssince I’ve been here, and you’re the rottenest of the lot.”Damage, half-truth, untruth. See, we’re just compounding this felony, see, madly. So you say,“Good. Thank you. Have I missed a withhold—in this session have r missed a withhold onyou?” How far can it go?Well, you can not only take in all the end rudiments, you can also take in all the beginningrudiments. You can get them all out. See, that’s the auditor’s dilemma. Well, you’re asking thewrong auditing question. So it is much safer to do it this way.Oh, yeah, inevitably you will use something like “In this session have I missed a withhold onyou” for the excellent reason it lets him tell you the thinks and the other things. And you don’twant to prepcheck this guy and go back and find all the things he has done to you because hehasn’t done anything, really, in the session. He did something this morning that you missed inthe beginning rudiments, and so forth, and et cetera, ad nauseam. Yeah, all those things aretrue.But you’ll ask something like this, you see? And most of the time you get away with it. So yousay, “In this session have I missed a withhold on you?”“No.” Clank!“Thank you. I will check that on the meter. In this session have I missed a withhold on you?”Clank! And what are we going to do? Well, you just enter a fishing or fumble period. That’swhat you do.I’ve been trying to work out this data to a something or other, and I have a package questionwhich serves as a middle-rudiments. “in this session . . .” I won’t give you this packagequestion. Don’t start visiting it down. But it’d be something like this: “In this session have youwithheld, invalidated or suppressed any datum about listing, or anything about listing?” Youunderstand?I’m tallying about just giving an example of a package question. And you can name each one ofthese things as you go by, and you’ll get the fall, see? And you watch for the one that falls.That’s very smooth. Otherwise, you’re left in a fish-and-fumble period.But I don’t care how perfect you make auditing, you’ll still have fish-and-fumble periods. Yousay, “Well, just a minute. Let me check this over on the meter. Withhold, invalidation,suppression, untruth, half-truth, impression, impress, damage, command, and wrongcommand, haven’t answered a command, meter. Meter. In this session have I failed to find outsomething you were doing about a meter?” Clang!"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"And he says, “Well, yes. That was excellent. Yeah. I’m sitting here fiddling the cans so thatyou—so you’d get the goal ‘to have more women’ because I always get such a bang out ofrunning that kind of a stuff, you know?”And you say, “Well, thank you. Thank you very much. I’ll check that on the meter. Good. Inthis session have you tried to influence the meter?” whatever it is. “That’s clean.”In other words, there’s the fish-and-fumble period. You actually sort of run a little assessment.So you could have a package question in the middle rudiments which would run a niceassessment for you. But if it were too long, you’d get lost.Now, if you’re going to have such a package question, remember you’re going to have torepeat it. So it had better be fairly standardized.I’m telling you in this lecture how you figure these things out, rather than giving you a bunchof pat data, you understand?Now, there will always be a fish-and-fumble period in Prepchecking as far as I can figure itout. Otherwise, for the sake of smoothness and gallantry, you’re throwing away efficiency.You’re just discarding the possibility of getting the right What question.You sit there and look at Mr. Meter and you say, “Oh, let me test out a few questions herenow. What about throwing baseball bats at cops? What about throwing things at cops? Whatabout doing things to cops? That’s it, that’s it. What about doing things to cops? Now, youwere just telling me about throwing a baseball bat at a cop. All right. When was that?” See,that’s a fish-and-fumble period.Well, frankly, doing a list and nulling it is a fish-and-fumble period, isn’t it? Well, there’salways these areas in auditing when you’re trying to find something out. And the mark of agood auditor is that he goes ahead and finds these things out without throwing the rudimentswildly out.See, now you could p at this in such a way as to throw them wildly out. I’ll give you an idea:“Well, this listing isn’t going very well here, uh . . . because I don’t think you’ve given mevery many right items for this particular list. They don’t seem to really be the kind of item that Iwould expect on this list. So, this is sort of uh . . . of . . . uh . . . crude here, and uh . . .although we’ve listed twelve hundred and eighty-five items on this particular list and we onlyhave two items on these other three lists, uh . . . I—I think . . . I think what rd better do is uh .. . figure out some better wording for the goal we found, and uh . . . see whether or not wecan’t get this thing more adequately worded, because this thing doesn’t show a sign ofblowing. And we have twelve hundred and fifty items, you see, all on this one list, you see,and uh . . . shows no signs of anything happening.“So I think we ought to go about it that way. And uh . . . if that’s all right with you, why,we’ll go back to the Goals Assessment.“Now, uh . . . what have I done to you in this session that you are upset about? Good. Good.Uh . . . what was that? Yeah. Oh, I didn’t do that, you know, at the beginning of the session.”Well, I think by the time you had done all that, you would have the PC ready for his—bemeasured for his straitjacket. Particularly as that type of auditing would have gradually led upwith 825 withholds to the cubic withhold.That’d be very corny, wouldn’t it? But the funny part of it is, you can do some mighty wild,offbeat things in an auditing session if you do them very smoothly—particularly if they are inthe guise of letting you find out where you’re going—without giving the PC a bunch of missedwithholds or making the PC withhold madly. - ~"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"And the only thing you’ve got to avoid is committing yourself to a cycle of action you can’tcomplete. And if you commit yourself to a cycle of action you can’t complete, of course,you’ve had it. I’ll give you the crudest, oldest example. “What has your boss done to you?Thank you. What has your boss done to you? Thank you. What has your boss done to you?Thank you. What has your boss done to you? Thank you. What has your boss done to you?Thank you. What has your boss done to you? What’s the matter with you?”See, that has committed you to a cycle you dare not complete.I’ll give you another old-time process: “Mock up some unconsciousness. Thank you. Mock upsome unconsciousness. Thank you. (We’ll get you over being unconscious all the time.) Mockup some unconsciousness. Thank you. Mock up some unconsciousness. Thank you. Mock upsome unconsciousness. Thank you. What’s the matter with you?”In other words, that’s committing yourself to a line of action you can’t complete. Well,recognize that a question which lets the PC answer as a motivator in the middle rudiment issomething you actually can’t satisfactorily complete. It’s all going to be astray. Something likethis: You’re going to say, “In this session have I missed a withhold on you?”“Yes.”See, you sit there like an idiot, man.Now, the wrong way to weight the thing is to throw it over on to a Q and A. That is alwayswrong. No matter what you do, it is always wrong. Let that be your guiding principle.So you say, “Good. Thank you. I will check this on the meter. In this session have 1 missed awithhold on you? That’s dirty as a dishrag. Thank you very much.“Now, in this session have you been up to something I didn’t latch on to?”He says, “Yes.”“All right. Good. Thank you. I will check the meter on that. In this session have you been upto something- I didn’t latch on to? That’s dirty. Thank you. “Let’s see, now. All right. Whathave you been up to that 1 didn’t find out about? Ohhh! All right. Good. I will check that onthe meter. What have you been up to that I didn’t find out about? Thank you. That’s clean.”See, the mistake you make is always beginning a cycle which you feel would be veryunsatisfactory to complete. But the big mistake—the big mistake—would be failing to completea cycle you started.Don’t kid yourself. You’re going to find yourself in an old bunch of western tales by oldCharlie Russell, the western painter. He had an old plainsman named Bab, and Bab was talkingabout the time he was being chased by the Sioux Indians and he got into a canyon. And therewas ten thousand Sioux came boiling in through the front of the canyon, you know, filling itup from wall to wall. He kept backing up further and further into the canyon. He finally looksaround over his shoulder and it’s a box canyon—it’s totally cleaned off. Old Bab sits back andrelaxes and doesn’t go on with the story until somebody prompts him and says, “Well, Bab,what the hell happened?”“Oh,” he said, “they killed me.”That’s where you’re going to find yourself someday—back up that box canyon. There’s noway out of it.Well, let me tell you. The way you never get out of it is with a Q and A. You just never get outof it with a Q and A. Ask the right auditing question, is the way to prevent Q and A."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"And it’s all right for you to sit there and tell me, “All right, Ron, go on, invent the exact,perfect wording that always keeps us from never getting into a Q-and-A situation.” I don’tknow. I don’t speak Chinese. I couldn’t invent it in Chinese, so why do you demand I invent itin English?Now, the joke of the thing is that I can give you a good approximation; I can give you a goodcode situation. I can give you something that’s probably completely embracive about the thing.Well, let me tell you. Someday or another, you’re going to run into somebody who is doingsomething weird, because PC’s can invent them faster than you can cure them up, man. Andyou had better know the principles back of the auditing command—the “perfect auditingcommand”—as well as the command itself. Because you’ll find yourself in a situation wherethe perfect auditing command doesn’t pull the withhold!You say, where am I at? Well, you’re at a position where you have to develop an auditingcommand which does get the PC to give you whatever the PC is doing, and which gives you atonce the only real mistake that you can make, which is to fail to complete the cycle of actionand to do a Q and A. If you Q-and-A at that point, why, you’ve lost that much of the PC in thesession.Now, you don’t always notice that a PC has gone out of session, because they sometimes driftout of session little by little, tiny by tiny by tiny. And the total aggregate of it is, is the guy ismiles out of session, but he’s gone on such a gradient scale, hardly anybody noticed.It’s like the prisoner that escaped from the jail. Just every day they were supposed to be sittingon their bunks at the last inspection. And every night when the guard came by (this was anactual escape, by the way, from Alcatraz, of all places), the prisoner was an inch closer to thedoor. And he gradually built it up so that the guard got so used to that, that he had a prisoneractually standing at the door at the time when the last inspection was made, you see?And finally the prisoner was able to stand at the door and keep the automatic lock from goingshut, opened the door and walked out and swam to San Francisco. (I think they elected himmayor!) Anyway . . .A PC can drift out of session; you should know what he’s drifting on. He’s drifting on hisfeeling he cannot communicate to the auditor. That’s what he’s drifting out of session on. Anda way to throw somebody wildly and almost permanently out of session is just lower the barson him to prove to him conclusively and forever and aye, from there on out, that he will neverbe able to communicate to the auditor or he will never be able to tell any of his withholds.You start punishing somebody for getting off their withholds and you produce this immediateand direct result. The fellow feels, then, he can never be audited. Why? That is—you see,you’re dealing with the actual machinery of a mind. You’re dealing with the actual responses ofthe mind. We’re not playing with kid stuff here, you see? We’re not playing with psychologyor psychiatry or other dirty words, you see? We’re actually functioning right straight on themiddle buttons of the mind. And that is communication, withholds, missing withholds, thatsort of thing. And the person will stay in there and pitch and do almost anything under the sun,moon and stars for an auditor that he can communicate to. He’ll almost take anything off of anauditor he can communicate to.You see me run a session someday that looks awful rough to you and you wonder “How in thename of God is that PC still in session?” If you thought emotion, misemotion, argument,things of this character—if you thought these threw people out of session—and if you thoughtthat being kind and sweet and good as an auditor keeps somebody in session, you shouldwatch a good, knockdown-drag-out session by somebody who knows better than to miss awithhold. And that is a pretty fantastic session.I’ve done this, you see? I’ve asked an auditing question. The PC doesn’t speak Chinese, the"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"PC speaks English. I’ve asked an auditing question and I demand that that auditing question beanswered, and go on and on, demanding it be answered see, the PC is trying to answer someother question—and just never permit the cycle to shift in any other direction than to a perfectcompletion of the answer of that auditing question.Cheer the PC up. Say, “Yes, yes, you can talk to me about any of those things. That’s fine.I’m glad to hear about that. Fine,” and so forth. “But I asked you if you’d ever seen a rat. Andyou keep talking to me about hats!”The PC will even come upscale on something like that. They say, “What the hell do you know,this guy listens to me. You know, he listens. That’s true. I did talk to him about hats. He askedme have I ever seen a rat, and I said—I said ‘Girls in their teens wear thick hats.’ I did. I saidthat. And he heard it. But I heard him, and therefore I ought to tell him whether or not I haveseen a rat. And I can tell him that, because he’ll listen. Proves it, because he knows that I didn’tanswer the question.“Yeah, I’ve seen a rat!”There, that PC would be in session and come out the other end smiling. My God, you wouldhave thought for half an hour there was nothing but a confounded dogfight going on in theroom. That was because the perfect communication cycle was always insisted upon—that theanswer to the auditing question was given. But you have to be very, very smart and hear yourown questions because the PC very often answers your auditing question. And when you don’thear that exact answer and don’t realize it’s an exact answer and you refute it, well, you’ve hadit.But by permitting him to answer something else besides the question asked, you also throw therudiments out. And that’s not a Q and A. “I’ll repeat the auditing question. What have youdone, done, done-done? Not what have you thought about doing. t asked you somethingyou’ve done.”“Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah. You did, didn’t you? (Guy listens. Good auditor.)”Funny part of it is that the cycle, the completed cycle of action, must take place. The cycle ofcommunication must occur. It must go all the way through, but only on the subject which theauditor has introduced. Otherwise it’s a complete miscontrol and it isn’t a response to what was asked.So if you think you can sit there and be kind, and you say, “Hell, have you ever seen anyrats?”And the PC says, “Yes, I’ve s a lot of girls wear thick hats.”And you say, “Well, good,” because Ron always said that you mustn’t Q-and-A and you haveto accept the PC’s response.Don’t be surprised if at the end of a half an hour of doing this kind of thing your PC is not insession, because the withhold in this case you have created, and the withhold is the rightanswer to your auditing question. Yes, this thing falls on both sides of the fence. So thereforethere is a thing called control, there is a thing called the right answer, and so forth.So you must ask a question—this is the rest of it; you have asked a question that can beanswered—and then complete that cycle of action of getting that question that you askedanswered. And don’t buy any other answers.If you do that smoothly, man, PC’s will past do almost anything for you, including go Clear.But you see where the tightrope walk is—is how do you keep the PC in session while notpermitting the PC to give you the wrong answer to the auditing question. Well, you have to be"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"smart enough to know when he has given you the right answer, and when be has given you theright answer, that you buy it and you don’t challenge him.And I’ll say this at least once: you’re going to find yourself sitting there gaping. The PC isabsolutely right. He has answered the auditing question. And you have developed the wholething into a dogfight.You said, “Do you have a present time problem?”And the PC said, Yes.”You know, that kind of a situation. But it’ll be in some other guise. You’ll be prepcheckingsomebody and you’ll say, “Well, did you ever really know your mother?” Why you asked that,God knows, you see?And the PC says, “Well, I . . . uh . . . actually, actually, I don’t know.”Well, the question is, did the PC answer the cycle? Is it part of the cycle? Is that a right answer?And you go up in smoke. And then you finally look back at your question, and you realize thathe’s given you the only possible answer he could give you under the circumstances. And that isthe answer to the auditing question, and you’re the one who has thrown him out of session.But there’s two ways, now, he can go out of session: (1) is you “complete the cycle ofaction”—or the cycle of communication—on a wrong answer; of course, the right answer isnow a missed withhold. Or you fail to complete the cycle of action on a right answer and, ofcourse, now the right answer is a missed withhold. Now, that is the tightrope walk which youwalk, and you should know exactly what you’re doing with an auditing question.Now, when you see a session running off the rails, when you see a session doing peculiar andodd and strange things and the PC doesn’t look right with your auditing, don’t look at the PCas a peculiar ape. Don’t develop that. And neither develop a good communistic self-criticism.Don’t develop that either. Just look at the questions which you’re asking in a session and ask itto yourself if they are answerable by this PC and if you are accepting the right answers that thePC gives you here. Just look at the whole thing on a cycle of action on a communication line.See, a cycle of communication. Is it complete? Have you asked a question? Has the PCanswered the question? Have you then responded in such a way as the PC knew you the]answered the question? And have you straightened out what you were trying to straighten out?Well, if you’ve done all those things, and so forth, right, and the PC is getting worse, then I’lllet you in on something—something very, very tremendous: It must be his environment that iscaving him in.Now, the way it goes—what you’ve got to reconcile yourself to—is your PC drifts out ofsession, something is going wrong. You’re doing something that is failing to complete thatcommunication cycle. Doing something that appears to a Q and A. You’re doing something likethis.Could be in your earlier sessions that you’ve inherited a PC, of course, that has been muckedup with this kind of thing and you have to straighten out the PC’s communication cycle and thatsort of thing. But if you have to go on straightening out a PC’s communication cycle, if youhave to go on patching the PC up, if you have to go on crowding him in session, session aftersession, if you have to go on sweating blood over this PC, look at your own wording and yourauditing and this lecture and you will have the answer. You’ll be able to analyze it.It’s a very ordinary thing to analyze. I mean it’s a very easy thing to analyze. Funny part of itis, it’ll be as crazy when you finally see what you are doing as this business of “Since the lasttime I audited you, have I missed a withhold on you?” And, well, it isn’t quite a question,don’t you see?"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"So that has been followed by this, that and the other thing and drifted out. And then one day,all of a sudden, you get the right question. And the right question is “Since the last time Iaudited you, have you done anything that you are withholding?”And the PC says, “Bzrmrmrmz-zz-zz-zz-zz-zz,” and so on and so on.And you say, “My God, my God, my God!”Well, remember something, there’s- every period between session has been missed. You’vewalked into a lousy-auditing situation then, you see? There you’ve got a ghastly thing staringyou in the face. It’s always going to be coming back up and should be prepchecked. So youhave to prepcheck some rudiments. You see that?Mark my words, it’ll be something like that. It’ll be something the auditor is doing that the PCcannot respond on and the auditor isn’t finishing the cycle with or can’t finish the cycle with.If you get that down pat, you’ll be able to analyze your own auditing, you’ll be able to analyzeauditing in general, you’ll be able to tell why PC’s are improving or not improving.Only thing TRs do is get you to improve your skill in handling these things so you’re not takenby sudden surprise and so forth, so that these responses are very usual and natural. But Ialways think it’s best to know the principles underlying these natural responses, and there aresome very solid ones.Okay?Thank you. Thank you for staying over."},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE MISSED MISSED WITHHOLDA lecture given on1 November 1962Thank you. When you were building this country, why didn’t you fix up the weather? Youknow, really, I have my opinion of planet builders that go around designing weather like this,and that sort of thing. There’s a great deal to be said for rain, but it quickly becomeshyperbolical.Well now, tonight, I’ve made notes for lectures, so I probably won’t talk about that. And thisis the 1st of November, isn’t it? What year is it?Audience: A.D. 12.AD. 12. All right. Lecture number one.This is a brand-new subject to you. It’s an entirely new subject to you. You have never heardof this subject before. In fact, you have never run it or handled it or had it done. I want torecommend, then, this lecture to you very, very seriously. There have been several bulletinsout on it, but you apparently haven’t read those.Now, therefore, this is new material here. And I want you to take to heart what I tell you in thislecture.And the subject of the lecture is missed withholds.Now, it may surprise you that the first bulletin out on this particular subject of missedwithholds is February the 8th, HCOB February 8, 1962, and it’s marked, as a bulletin,“Urgent.” And it says, “The one item Scientologists everywhere must get an even greaterreality on is missed withholds and the upsets they cause.” That’s the first paragraph of this. Itsays, “Every upset with Central Orgs, field auditors, PC’s, the lot, is traceable to one or moremissed withholds.” That’s what it says.Well anyhow, on February the 12th, because nobody got it then, I issued another one, roteformulas for missed withholds, and so forth. That’s HCOB February 12th. It’s “How to ClearWithholds and Missed Withholds.”Well, they didn’t get it then, so we issued another one on February 22nd. And on February22nd, 1962, we had “Withholds, Missed and Partial ‘ see? And it has a lot to say on thatparticular subject. And it says, “I don’t know exactly how to get this across to you except toask you to be brave, squint up your eyes and plunge. I don’t appeal to reason, only to faith atthe moment. When you have a reality on this, nothing will shake it and you’ll no longer failcases or fail in life. But at the moment, it may not seem reasonable, so just try it and do it well,and day will dawn at last.”Well, day didn’t dawn. Well . . .So, on May the 3rd, 1962, you have the HCOB “ARC Breaks and Missed Withholds” and itsays, “How to use this bulletin. When an auditor or student has trouble with an ‘ARC-breakyPC’ or no gain, or when an auditor is found to be using freak control methods or processes to‘keep a PC in session,’ the HCO Sec. D of T or D of P. should just hand a copy of this bulletinto the auditor and make him or her study it and take an HCO Exam on it.“After some months of careful observation and tests, I can state conclusively that: All ARCbreaks stem from missed withholds”."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"“This is vital technology,” and so forth.It says also, “There are no ARC breaks when missed withholds have been cleared up.” And itgoes on, technically.Well, on May the 21st, we have one: “Missed Withholds, Asking About,” and so forth, butthat’s just a little more data.And on June the 28th, 1962, we have “Dirty Needles, How to Smooth Out Needles.” There itis, and it talks all about missed withholds and so forth. It’s not obviously and directly on thepoint, but it does mention withholds, missed withholds, overts and secrets and so forth.And on July the 4th we have “Bulletin Changes” which include missed withholds, and then onJuly the 12th, 1962, we have “Motivatorish Cases” and so forth, and that goes on talking abouthow to get missed withholds out of people.And then on August the 13th, we talk about “Rock Slams and Dirty Needles.” And there’ssome more about missed withholds then.And then on August the 30th, while I was stateside, why, Mary Sue got desperate and issuedsome bulletins. And of course the first subject that she picked up was missed-withholdhandling. Well now, that is a lot of bulletins. Let me call to your attention, there’s weight here,man. It has weight. There’s been a lot said on this subject, see?And it’s just about the most important subject in an auditing session and keeping the show onthe road. Short of actually clearing and helping people, you see, it’s just about the mostimportant subject there is. And there isn’t one here got it. None of you. You haven’t got it. SoI'm going to give you a lecture on it.And I might as well start this lecture with “the one item Scientologists everywhere must get aneven greater reality on is missed withholds and the upsets they cause.” Do you see? That’s outof the February 8th bulletin. And “I don’t know exactly how to get this across to you, except toask you to be brave, squint up your eyes and plunge,” on February the 22nd.Listen: All you’re doing, and all you go on doing, and all you keep on doing, and all you do,endlessly, every time you’re told to pick up a missed withhold, all you do is pick up awithhold. Honest. You’re picking up withholds. I don’t think you have ever picked up amissed withhold off of a PC in any session you’ve ever run. You’ve only picked up withholds.You ask the auditor to pick up the missed withholds and the auditor promptly picks up all thewithholds. You got the idea? Everybody says this, and I guess it’s because of the semantics ofthe word missed. It says they’re missed withholds, and by God, they are! Everybody missesthem! See?You see, it is so pat and is so plain to the naked eye that this is what happens: PC has awithhold and you haven’t picked it up—so therefore it’s a missed withhold. Ditto! That iswrong.So when I tell you to pick up the missed withholds, all you’re doing is picking up withholds.You say, “Well, he wants us to pick up the missed withholds, so therefore I better pick up thewithholds I've missed. So therefore, ‘Do you have a withhold?’” And sometimes you evensay, “Have I ever missed a withhold on you?” “Has anybody missed a withhold on you?” andthe PC gratuitously gives you withholds. Gives you more withholds and more withholds andmore withholds.No PC has ever given you a missed withhold. I’ll bet you you’ve never picked one up. Now, Imay be very harsh on this line, but let’s get down to tacks here, man—brass, iron andotherwise!"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"A missed withhold is a withhold that people nearly found out about, but didn’t. And you’reonly looking for the nearly-found-outs. You don’t give a damn what the guy did. You don’tcare what the person did. You only want to know what people almost found out!Honest! I’ve been talking since February, you know? I’m getting hoarse.You see, a withhold is something the PC did. That is something the PC did—do youunderstand?—that he isn’t talking about. See? He did it and he isn’t talking about it. Now, thatis a withhold, and that is all a withhold is. And please don’t keep saving also it is a missedwithhold just because you didn’t get it in a session.You see, it’s all very neat. You got it all figured out that if you didn’t get the withhold in asession, why, therefore, it’s a missed withhold. And that’s not what a missed withhold is’ Amissed withhold has nothing to do with what the PC said. Nothing! Not—not anything to dowith what the PC did and then withheld. It actually hasn’t a damn thing to do with what the PCis withholding.The missed withhold is something people nearly found out. It’s an other person action! Look:It’s not the PC’s action! It’s nothing the PC did or is doing! You keep trying to pick up missedwithholds by asking the PC what he’s withholding, you never get anything but withholds, andthen you miss some more of these and you’ve got a PC even further upset.Look, here are absolute pearls on a silver platter. They’re actually beyond price. And I’ve nevergot it across to you. A missed withhold has nothing to do with the PC—but clothing! It is another-person action and the PC’s wonder about it.I just know right now I'm not making any sense to you even this minute. I’ll betcha I’m notmaking any sense to you.It hasn’t a thing to do with what the PC is withholding. Let’s just sever the end off of the“missed.” Let’s forget that it is even a withhold.You’re looking for exact moments in the lifetime or lifetimes of this PC when somebody almostfound out, and he’s never been sure since whether they did or they didn’t. And we don’t carewhat they almost found out! We only care that they almost found out something!And that is the address to a missed withhold. It’s an other-person-than the-PC’s action. It’s another-person’s action.I really didn’t realize that I hadn’t gotten it across to you in bulk and in gross form till not toolong ago in a catch-as-catch-can session I said to a PC . . . This PC was going natter, natter,natter, natter, natter, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, natter, natter, natter, natter, natter, natter, natter,natter, natter, yap, yap, yap. So I just routinely was running a little bit of—I said, “Well, whathave you done?” “What have you withheld?” “What have you done?” “What have youwithheld?” “What have you done?” “What have you withheld?” “What have you done?” “Whathave you withheld?” you know, that sort of thing. And got stuck in this area of the track andstarted saying natter, natter, natter, and natter, natter, natter, and natter, natter, natter, andstarted giving me withholds and withholds and withholds and withholds out of that area of thetrack, and withholds and overts and withholds out of that area of the track, and they wouldhave been going yet if I hadn’t . . .That’s one of the dangerous things, is instructors are actually going to stop you sometimespractically right here. Because once you shove this down the PC’s throat, it looks just like a Qand A. It’s almost in the teeth of the laws about Q and A. You understand?But the PC isn’t clearing this. You’ve got this thing called a recurring withhold. Youunderstand? You run into these things all the time. You were auditing a PC, so they’re going torun some withholds, and they run the time that they locked their husband out. And you say,"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"“Ha, ha. Thank you very much.”And you note down this fact, and a few sessions later, they tell you they locked their husbandout, see, and they didn’t tell him that they were the person that had locked him out, you know?Never confessed to it since, and he got pneumonia, and it was all pretty rough.And so, a few sessions after this, you know, why, you’re running down the track, and theytell you they locked their husband out.A little while later some other auditor is auditing this same PC, and they tell him they lockedtheir husband out.Look: Sometime or another, won’t you get tired of hearing the same withhold? Isn’t it boring?It’s like watching a C movie that wasn’t very good in the first place for the tenth time. That is amissed withhold.Look: it has a very special anatomy. It isn’t the moment they locked the husband out; it isn’twhen they withheld it from the husband; it isn’t when they withheld it from you. These thingshave nothing to do with the reason this is charged up! That it is an overt, that it is a withhold—ahhh, yes. But there’s this special thing called a missed withhold, and it hasn’t got anything todo with either one of them. It merely uses them for fodder to feed on. And the overt and thewithhold won’t blow if a missed withhold occurs.Now, what is the missed withhold? The only thing you have to ask this recurring-withhold PCis “When did your husband nearly find out about it?” Not “When did he find out?” see, thatwould have blown—but “When did your husband nearly find out about it?”Now, here’s the actual mechanics of it. A few days later while he was lying there sufferingwith a fever of 118, why, his eyes opened slittedly and suspiciously and looked at her andglanced toward the lock on the door. Now, that was has action, not hers, see? That was hasaction. And ever afterwards she hasn’t known whether he knew or didn’t know ever afterward!She doesn’t know! And that’s why the recurring withhold hangs up.I lowered the boom on this PC, and I said, “All right. Fine. Thank you. Thank you. Good.Now, tell me the exact moment you suspected somebody knew what you are telling me.”“Ohhhh.” And that was dead easy. It was right there. The whole package blew, and that wasthat.Somebody had made a comment which might or might not have been interpreted as the fact thatthey knew about it. And the PC goes off in this fantastic confusion. Now, how can it be aconfusion? Well, it’s a confusion because there is an overt and there is a withhold. And theseare the primary mechanisms which sit back of all this. But they actually aren’t very serious untilthey get a mystery on top of them.Now, you take an overt, a withhold, plus a mystery, and you’ve got a missed withhold. It’s amystery! Now, did her husband know about it or didn’t he? “Did—did—did he find out? Didhe know—and is he withholding? And uh—uh—is he—did he as he was sitting there in a feverand so forth, did he really mean that look toward her and toward the lock of the door as anaccusation for having accidentally locked him out in the snowstorm? Or—or did he—did heever know, or—or—or wasn’t that? Or did it or didn’t it? Did he fi—no, he couldn’t haveknown about it. No, he he did.... No. No. He couldn’t have. He—he did, but still he lookedstraight at the lock of the door and he looked at me. He must . . . I—I—I don’t know.”Do you understand this? Now, that is a missed withhold, see? Had nothing whatsoever to do .. . You can say, “Now, what have you done?” And she says, “I locked my husband out in thesnow and he got sick with pneumonia, and he was sick for seventeen months and eighteendays. Lost his pension.”"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"Few sessions later, you say, “All right, rata-ta-tatta-ta-tatta. What have you done?”“Well. I locked me husband out in the snow and—and he got . . . he got sick. and—and hewas sick for eighteen months and eighteen days and he lost his pension.”You say “Good. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good.” (Maybe if I acknowledge it thistime, maybe the PC will find out that I heard it, see?) “Good. Thank you. Thank you verymuch. Thank you. Good. Good. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I’ve I got that. Iheard exactly what you said there. I heard exactly what you said. Thank you.”Next morning in session, you’re running some General O/W, see? “I locked my husband out in. . .”Now, of course, that isn’t as comprehensible as some offbeat—because this society is a bitoffbeat on the subject of the second dynamic, you get some juicy second-dynamic withhold ofsome kind or another. Get this girl, and she’s making love to a dog, you know? You get this,you know? And then you, the auditor, get pulled right in on this. You say, “Well, of coursethis is heavily charged! Of course the PC is having trouble getting this off. Of course, ofcourse, of course!”Don’t be so damn reasonable. There isn’t any reason why the magnitude of the overt hasanything to do with the readiness of its blowing. The magnitude of the overt has nothing to dowith the speed of its evaporation. I don’t care if you’ve blown up a husband or a planet. It’s anovert, and it—one doesn’t blow any harder than another.Well, therefore, we have to ask this question: “How come this doesn’t blow?” Don’t sit thereand say, “Well, because the society is rigged the way it is and because . . . so forth, and it’s onher terminal chain, and it probably is something that rock slams. It’s on the oppterm side. Dogsare oppterms, and uh—and so forth, and I’ll fix that. Actually she is stuck on the se . . . Andthat’s why that overt won’t blow, see?” Figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure,see? That’s why you get this second-dynamic overt ten minutes deep in every session, or everythird session. Or every Prepcheck, it comes up.Wouldn’t you be a little bit curious why this thing keeps recurring? Well, don’t be soreasonable. It is not recurring because it is badder than other overts, see? It’s not recurringbecause it weighs heavily on the PC’s conscience.I don’t know where people keep their consciences—lunch boxes or something like that.Obviously, it’s very dangerous to squash a conscience because things shouldn’t be kept on theconscience, and so forth. It’s all a very interesting mechanical problem to me, this wholeproblem of consciousness. Because you see, everything that is on a conscience is unconscious.It’s all confusing. And you can just figure yourself into a grave with this, if you don’t knowthis mechanism.One day they had this elderly man, and he came to the house for dinner And he had a ratherfalse smile He had false teeth, see? And he had—and he had a false smile, and he lookedstraight at this girl, and he says, You like dogs, don’t you?” And that’s the missed withhold,see? The PC that you’re auditing didn’t do it. And ever since then: “Did he know? Did he reallyknow? No, he couldn’t have known. Yes, he . . .”Now, you getting hold of the corner of this thing’s tail, huh?All right. Maybe I haven’t been as articulate as I could be.Actually, I figured and I figured and I figured and I thought and I looked at it and so forth. Andon this demonstration the other night, I actually couldn’t believe it when the PC said, “I neverthought you had to remember a specific moment in time to get off a withhold.” Even the PChad missed it, but the thing had evaporated. There was no more natter in that area."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"There were a whole bunch of overts and a whole bunch of withholds. But this was justpursuant with natter, until the exact moment when somebody was standing there see, this is themoment we had to find—and I said, “All right. Let’s look for it. This is the exact moment Iwant, see?” PC is just going off answering questions, answering questions, getting no place,see? I say, “This is the exact moment I want. Who almost found out you were doing that?”“Oh, well.”And we picked up this exact split instant in time, and it was just somebody making a casualremark that it indicated that they might know about these overts. You get the idea?—they mightknow. But they didn’t. But did they? See, there’s the mystery sandwich.If you want to see what is sticking a PC to something, always look for the mystery sandwich.Mystery is the glue which sticks thetans to things. Mystery is the glue. Even overts wind up inmystery. You shoot somebody: Now you don’t know whether you shot him or you didn’tshoot him, or if it was a lucky shot, or you should have shot him, or if he was a bad man, orif, if, if, if, if, if, if, or if you should have done it. So it’s the if-you-should-have-done-itwhich causes you to pull back the withhold and sort of withhold a further action like that.All things boil down to right conduct.Here is the crux of this situation. If you go on asking the PC, who doesn’t understand whatyou’re asking for, “Have I missed a withhold on you?” or “Have we missed a withhold onyou?” and the PC is glibly giving you withholds, you ain’t gettin’ no place. You is on theArkansas Special with its wheels locked, its brakes on and the rails torn up. You’re not goingdown any track anyplace.Now, you can take the edge off of a case. I salute the fantastic workability of General O/W,you see? See, it is—it’s the woof and warp of the GPM itself. And it’s right on down the line.That’s why it’s totally unlimited in the amount of run it can have. But I don’t think you’d liketo run out a GPM with General O/W. You’re perfectly welcome to try if you’ve got a fewcenturies.Numerically, to count up the number of withholds that the person has, pursuant to the numberof overts which they have committed, gives us some figure that if we were to write it up on thewall behind me in very tiny figures, starting at that corner and then just keep on writing acrossthe whole top of the wall with groups of three zeros, you see, and then without ending thenumber, come just down below it and start right straight across the wall again, and then comedown another quarter of an inch and start writing zeros there, you’d get some kind of an ideawhat this guy has done and withheld.Well, that many answers is not necessary to clear somebody. So although the overt is verypowerful in its ability to aberrate the individual—the withhold which follows it is locked up bythe overt itself, of course and although this mechanism is the mechanism underlying thegathering-up of energies which results in solid-mass terminals and gives you the game in thefirst place (see, the whole anatomy of a game is O/W), in spite of all that, why, you don’t havetime and the PC doesn’t have enough body years to run out all those overts, even if you couldkeep him in session that long, even if he could spot them all that long. And you don’t evenhave time to run them out for one lifetime. How do you lice that? And you haven’t got time tosit around watching a PC’s dirty needle go bZz, bZz, bZz, bZz, bZz, bzz, bzz, and try to settleit with General O/W. Recurring withholds will result.General O/W, of course, is enough to straighten out the thing, and get the session running, andall that sort of thing—a very valuable process; don’t think I’m running it down. I’m just goingto say it’s too lengthy for that sort of thing.And when I tell you to pick up somebody’s missed withholds, I want you to pick up anotherperson’s action and not the PC’s action. And it’s best characterized as “nearly found out.”"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"Don’t ask the PC for a missed withhold, because he obviously, I have learned lately, hedoesn’t know any more of what I’ve been talking about than you have. See, you’d have toexplain the whole anatomy to him. So there’s got to be a better thing, see?“What did we almost find out about you?” It’s got to be that “almost.” It’s got to be “mighthave.” It’s got to be some conditional word. And then you will see a case suddenly go sproing!on you, and pick up the funniest series of disrelated incidents that case had never looked atbefore, never had anything to do with it before. You’ll see the tone arm do peculiar things, andthe needle do peculiar things that you’ve never seen it do on O/W, because you’re running adifferent track. You’re running the “almost discovered” track.Now let me give you an example: Once upon a time I was up in the wilderness and wilds ofMontana, and for some reason or other, a wolf, gray timber wolf, showed up and I shot abullet over his head. I don’t know just exactly why I shot at him because I never have anytrouble with animals. I was very young at the time. And he heard this bullet go by over hishead, and be reached up and he snapped at the place where the bullet had been. And he decidedto come my way. It upset him to be missed.Honest, you never quite see anybody quite so upset as somebody who has been just barely-missed. Look at a pedestrian who was not hit. The examinations flunks which you’re mostupset about were those which you passed all except for the last half of the last question. See?That’s the nearness of the miss. In other words, missing things upsets things. It’s amisestimation of effort or thought or something of the sort.Now, a thetan’s main attention is on estimation of effort, estimation of thought, estimation oflook. He wants to know how much look is a look and so forth, and his certainties are all basedon proper estimation of how much look is a look and all that sort of thing. See, just look atyour Know to Mystery Scale, you see? How much knowledge is knowingness, see? That’s anestimation. University is very simple. University hands you an old school tie, and you nowknow that you have the knowledge necessary, see? You can wave a pennant with your righthand so many motions to the left under the sisboom-bah, and you’re all set in life. That’s howmuch knowledge, you see, is necessary to be knowledge. So that’s an estimation ofknowledge.Now, you can go right on down the scale and how much emotion does it take to be emotional?How much emotion is emotional? Well, you get lots of answers to that: enough to create aneffect on somebody. If you’re a TV actress, it’s very simple: enough to please the sponsor.You can go on down and take another one at random. What is a proper symbol? How proper isa symbol when it is a symbol, see?Well, you can estimate everything, except Show much mystery is a mystery?” And of coursethat’s a mystery. You’re into the no-estimation-of-effort band. No estimation of the think, noestimation of anything; it’s all mysterious. You don’t know. The not-knowingness of it all iswhat is upsetting.But now you take a not-knowingness which is probably known, and play it both ways. Now,they knew, but they didn’t or couldn’t have known, and you knew that they knew, but youknow they didn’t know.Now, let’s just get the four-way flows on a not-know, and you’ve got a missed withhold. Andit’s very painful to a thetan. So I really don’t blame you for avoiding it like a plague.See, the fellow walks up to the girl and he smiles and he looks at her in a sort of a false smile,and he says, “Well, little girl, I understand you like dogs.”Well, right away, her concept of him is “Did he know? Didn’t he know? He couldn’t haveknown ‘ she thinks to herself. “He must know.” But then complicated into this is the fact that"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"he looks like he knows, but he hasn’t said enough to indicate that he did know, so he doesn’tknow. It’s strictly ding-dingding, here comes the wagon, you know? Strictly. This is the stuffout of which insanity gets made, see?It’s a can’t-reach, not-reach, must-reach situation, and so forth, in the effort band. When youget insanity in the mystery band, it’s a did-know-but-didn’t-know-but-mustn’t-know, you see?But he must know, but he mustn’t know, you see, and it’s the sort of reach and withdraw,only it’s not a mechanical thing. And there it is and it’s just pure mystery mucilage. And athetan will stick right to it, man.Now, in trying to pull off the overt and the withhold in the presence of something that has amissed withhold on it does not accomplish an as-isness of the section of track in which the PCis stuck. Because the PC is not stuck with the overt and is not stuck with the withhold; the PCis stuck with the “almost found out.” So, of course, nothing anises and you get a recurringwithhold, see, became he isn’t looking at that section of track where he did it or where he’swithholding it. He’s only looking at that section of track where it was almost found out.And you ask him for what he did and what he withheld, you don’t as-is the section of trackhe’s stuck in. So therefore, it just perpetuates itself and goes on forever.And if you want to see something very remarkable in a PC, just very remarkable in a PC, justsit down in apropos of nothing, after you’ve got the PC in session and so forth, just startrunning, in any command sequence, Well, just get the idea of nearly being found out.” See, ithas to be nearly being found out, see? “Get the idea of somebody nearly finding out aboutyou.” “Get the idea of you nearly finding out about another”—that’s an unnecessary leg to thething, but you could make it up—and the nest thing, more track would be going by that thisperson had never heard of before. Didn’t matter what else you’d run. That’s got a brand-newtrack area. They’ve never seen this track before, and it’s been with them all the time. It’swhat’s stuck out in front of their noses. Directly in front of their noses.I could ask you at this exact instant to “recall a time you were nearly found out.” Now goahead, think of a time you were nearly found out.Having any trouble finding this time you were nearly found out?Well, I shouldn’t think so, because that’s the bulk of the stuff in front of your schnozzola.Most people can’t even find an engram, merely because there are so many missed withholds infront of their Aces. They can’t get any clear view of anything, because they got missedwithholds in front of their faces.“Did they really know or didn’t they? Was I actually discovered at that time or wasn’t I?” See,that is the question.“Who has nearly known about you?” Think that over for a while, you’ll come up with peopleyou have been leery of or felt nervous around.And when I tell you to pick up somebody’s missed withholds on Scientology, I don’t want youto pick up the overts that they have been withholding. See? I couldn’t care less about theseoverts, don’t you see, that they have been withholding. That they have been withholding them,oh, alto right, so they have been withholding them. You can get TA action by finding all thethings the fellow has been withholding. That’s good. That’s fine. But this is a junior action.That would be asking you to run General O/W on a PC. That’d have nothing to do with missedwithholds.Now, when I ask you to find out something about missed withholds, get this PC’s missedwithholds. Don’t you dare come up with any withholds. Just don’t you dare. I want the name,rank and serial number of the person who missed it. Ah, I couldn’t care less what was missed.you understand? I don’t want the PC’s actions, I want the PC’s guesses about the other gun"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"see? That’s what I’m asking you to find out.Now, this is very arduous to run, because sometimes you actually have to bear down on it ifyour command has not been sufficiently explicit. You have too direct the PC’s attention ratherheavily. Let’s sat you’ve run a lot of O/W and so forth. Well now, you think you’ve got this alllicked, you see? This person has been taking things from their company, you see? And you’verun this; and they’re taking things from their company and—stealing them, actually—and youthink you got it all licked. You’ve got the number of fountain pens and the number ofstenographers, and all these things they’ve stolen from their company, you see? And you thinkyou’ve got a tabulated list now and you say, “Well, that cured it” and so forth, and nest week,why, they take a typewriter.There’s something missing here, something—something went wrong. You got all of theoverts, and you got the fact they were withholding it. They’re not now withholding becausethey told you see, there’s the rationale. And so therefore it’s now all hunky-dory. And so theygo back and steal a typewriter, and the week after steal the boss’s secretary, see?They’re still nervous about the company. The person is not in a forgive-or-forget mood aboutthe company. See, just because they’ve gotten off these overts, why, you have a feeling, andyour feeling is quite right by the way— you’re not totally stupid—your feeling is quite rightwhen you suppose that when they’ve gotten this straightened out in their mind they’ll feel allright about the company. And they very often don’t. They feel propitiative, or they feel sort ofguilty, or they feel some other weird misemotional way about the target of these overts andwithholds, and you don’t feel this is right.And so you keep plunging and asking for something else they did. And if there’s anythingguaranteed to drive the PC round the bend, it’s after he has told you everything be has did, youinsist there must be something else the PC has did-did. You’re in essence cleaning a clean, see?Now actually, because you sense that this PC is still a little bit “nyah” about the company,why, then you assume there must have been some other overt. Well, he can always dig upanother one or two, or something like this, and the basic on the chain, and . . . And the troubleis you so often have a near win on this that you really never get your win. You sort of quiteating just before dessert.And there was a lot of people that were with us in ‘50, ‘51, that sort of thing, are starting towrite me now and they’re starting to get in contact again and that sort of thing.I just sort of laugh rather raucously, by the way. The last one that did, I said he quit beforedessert, you know? I realized after I had mailed the letter that I had missed a wonderful sort ofan epigrammatic sort of thing that he deserted before the dessert, you know, but it . . .Well, that’s what you’re denying yourself. You’re denying yourself a forkful of strawberriesand cream, see? You quit with the gravy and mashed potatoes, you know? There’s still more ofcourse.So, he stole a typewriter, and he stole an eraser, and be did this, and be withheld it from thisperson, he withheld it from that person, and he stole the boss’s secretary, and—yes, all fine.Yea And he’s withheld it all these years, and now you know about it, and that’s fine.And he’s sort of still kind of blowy and sort of nattery about the company a little bit. A week orso later, you see him; he really doesn’t feel good about the company, and so forth. Well, youjust quit before the desert was served, that’s all.You’ve got to find out who nearly discovered this, when and how often? And he’ll give youexact split instants Now. Now. Now. Now.

And you get a big dramatic sequence about the trial, you see, and hehas to have all of the bad things the company did to him, and how it’s actually one of the juniordirectors trying to cover up. See, he’s got to have ad the whole story manufactured for this, butis there any reason to manufacture the story? Did the Materiel Executive really know? See?Here we’ve got the trade that goes nowhere, don’t you see? And it could develop into track, butis it going to develop into. track or isn’t it going to develop into track? Here’s where this thing.. . Just as far as time is concerned, it becomes a mystery sandwich, and there’s no time in itbecause those events don’t take place.So therefore, there is no time track for it, so the which hangs it. it’s not spotted in time. Itdoesn’t fire off right, don’t you see? There’s nothing goes right about it at all because this isn’tany estimation of it. You can’t figure out what you would do, because it didn’t happen. Youcan’t figure out what you would have said, because nobody said it. You can’t figure out whatexplanation was the right explanation, because you never had to explain it. You see? But youshould have explained it, but you didn’t.So there’s just nothing known, and you just get this terrific area of just total—it’s not evenhardly a positive-negative. It’s just lyaah. And that’s a missed withhold.And the missed withhold depends on the other guy—the accidental action of another person.Sometimes it’ll be a niece of paper. or something like that. He’s sitting there. He’s sitting therein conference, and he suddenly notices that just showing in the boss’s in-basket is amemorandum with his own name just showing above the covering pieces of paper. Thatconference is ruined for him. You see, he never has another thing to say during the wholeconference. He sort of sits there and sweats, you know? But he really doesn’t quite realizewhat he’s sweating about. You see, there’s his name on a memorandum. He doesn’t knowwhat the memorandum is about, except that it concerns him in some way, and he can’t see whatthe subject of it is. You see?Now actually, three people are standing together in the hall, you come by and they shut up.There’s a very good missed-withhold situation.

And that is a missed withhold.It’s a should-have-known, as it has been described, but you will pick it up and be able to relayit much more ably if you call it a nearly-found-out. It’s a nearly-known, see? Nearly found out.Now, if you wished to clear up somebody’s missed withholds on Scientology and you said,“What have we failed to find out about you?” he would give you a whole string of withholds.And this would then go no place, see?No. You want another word, and this will clarify it to you and this will clarify it to the PC andeverybody will be happy as clambakes. “Now, what have we nearly found out about you andwhen did we nearly find it out?” comes much closer in to what you want, see?See, you want to know what.

See, “Well, my escapades with young boys,” see, orsomething like this, see, or wild women or something, see? “That’s what you failed to find outabout me,” you see? That’s what he kind of answers.“What did we nearly find out about you?”“My escapades with wild women,” see?Oddly enough, that doesn’t clarify the situation at all. That doesn’t make him like you anybetter, or anybody else. That doesn’t keep him from getting ARC breaks. You’ve got to followit up with a second question. Now you’ve got the missed withhold, see? You’ve merelyidentified what the missed withhold was about. You haven’t got the missed withhold. Takessome additional step. All right.“When did we nearly find out about it?” Now you could follow that through a little bit further ifit wasn’t blowing well with “who?” you see? “Who nearly found out about it?” “When wasthat?” You get the concatenation of questions, the series of questions, that would deliver all ofthis data into your hands.You’re looking for moments in the HGC’s—D of Ts office. You’re looking for the instantwhen the PE instructor all of a sudden paused. Fellow realized that he’d better cut this shortbecause actually, he’s going to miss his ride home, see? This thought suddenly strikes the PEinstructor, you see? He’s liable to miss his ride home, you know? So he’d better cut this short.So he’s looking over the class and he foes his beady eye on one person. Seems to lose track ofwhat he was saying, don’t you see?Said, “Well, all right. Now you understand ARC and we’re going to have to conclude the tackthis evening. Uh ....and so, good night,” and hurriedly walks out the door.Now, the person his eye accidentally lit on in those pauses goes “Eeenk,” see? Nearly foundout. “Did he know? Didn’t he know?” See? “Wa—wa—wa— was he on the ri—ri—ri—ub . .. uohbhb. What did he guess at that moment? What did he recognize about me at that moment?Which one of my various crimes?”You see, here’s something else; see? Now he doesn’t even know which one of his crimes havebeen identified. Maybe the instructor has been talking about the fact that people with big headshave more brains than people with little heads or something, you know? And this person getssome kind of a rationale about this thing.He couldn’t make up his mind whether he had lots of brains or little brains, because he’s"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"always realized that he had a medium-sized head.

He or she is unwilling to take responsibility for having been this or that otheridentity. This keys in in present time and closes one down every time one stops takingresponsibility for one’s fellows. Fighting ‘other identities’ in present time one ceases to beresponsible for other identities. Therefore those he has had in the past become ‘other people’and one dramatizes his own past identities because he cannot take responsibility for them.When one falls away from responsibility on the various dynamics he can then becomeless and less able to influence those dynamics and therefore becomes a victim of them. Onemust have done to other dynamics those things which other dynamics now seem to have thepower to do to him. Therefore one can be injured. One can lose control. One can become in facta zero of influence and a vacuum for trouble.The way one becomes separate from others is by his own overt acts against them. Theseovert acts become withholds and the person then individuates very strongly. You have seen thishappening in auditing. The more overt acts the Auditor pulls on the pc the less willing theAuditor is to audit that pc. Further, the more overt acts the pc pulls on the Auditor the lesswilling he is to stay in session. It only looks as though cause and effect is at work. Actually alllife consists of opposed causes where it is aberrated.The way a person blows out of session or blows out of an organization or blows out ofScientology is a simple one. He withholds information and hides his overts. After a while heblows himself off. Show me a pc blowing session and I will show you a pc who has notlevelled with his Auditor and who is guilty of undeclared overts against the dynamics and theAuditor. Show me a staff member who is blowing the Organization and I will show you a staffmember who is guilty of undeclared overts against the Organization.It is fatal to audit anyone unless full two-way comm is established between the Auditorand the pc. A person who goes on being audited without asserting his responsibility for whathe has done is a person who will make no auditing gains or whose auditing gains will slump.As most of the human race has undeclared overts this fact alone assumes gigantic proportionsin forwarding Scientology and for that reason alone we will have to give it a lion’s share ofattention from here on out.Of course you will see that many people at first will not come near us for fear of what wewill find out. But as this is better understood you will find that the people who come to us willcome with a willingness to bare their guilt to us and get it sorted out.As this is so much the case we must then therefore have amongst us none with undeclaredoverts against the dynamics which would prevent their getting gains in processing or whowould render a person’s confidences liable to use for less pure purposes."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Along with this technical discovery then goes the administrative must that our noses mustbe clean and our hearts cleared.

Man had it allexplained to his own satisfaction and yet his explanation did not cut down the amount oftrouble which came from the feeling of “having to leave”.For instance man has been frantic about the high divorce rate, about the high job turnoverin plants, about labour unrest and many other items all stemming from the same source—sudden departures or gradual departures.We have the view of a person who has a good job, who probably won’t get a better one,suddenly deciding to leave and going. We have the view of a wife with a perfectly goodhusband and family up and leaving it all. We see a husband with a pretty and attractive wifebreaking up the affinity and departing.In Scientology we have the phenomenon of preclears in session or students on coursesdeciding to leave and never coming back. And that gives us more trouble than most other thingsall combined.Man explained this to himself by saying that things were done to him which he would nottolerate and therefore he had to leave. But if this were the explanation all man would have to dowould be to make working conditions, marital relationships, jobs, courses and sessions allvery excellent and the problem would be solved. But on the contrary, a close examination ofworking conditions and marital relationships demonstrates that improvement of conditionsoften worsens the amount of blow-off, as one could call this phenomenon. Probably the finestworking conditions in the world were achieved by Mr. Hershey of Chocolate Bar fame for hisplant workers. Yet they revolted and even shot at him. This in its turn led to an industrialphilosophy that the worse workers were treated the more willing they were to stay which initself is as untrue as the better they are treated the faster they blow off.One can treat people so well that they grow ashamed of themselves, knowing they don’tdeserve it, that a blow-off is precipitated, and certainly one can treat people so badly that theyhave no choice but to leave, but these are extreme conditions and in between these we have themajority of departures: the auditor is doing his best for the preclear and yet the preclear getsmeaner and meaner and blows the session. The wife is doing her best to make a marriage andthe husband wanders off on the trail of a tart. The manager is trying to keep things going andthe worker leaves. These, the unexplained, disrupt organizations and lives and it’s time weunderstood them.People leave because of their own overts and withholds. That is the factual fact and thehardbound rule. A man with a clean heart can’t be hurt. The man or woman who must mustmust become a victim and depart is departing because of his or her own overts and withholds.It doesn’t matter whether the person is departing from a town or a job or a session. The causeis the same."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Almost anyone, no matter his position, can remedy a situation no matter what’s wrong ifhe or she really wants to. When the person no longer wants to remedy it his own overt acts andwithholds against the others involved in the situation have lowered his own ability to beresponsible for it. Therefore he or she does not remedy the situation. Departure is the onlyanswer. To justify the departure the person blowing off dreams up things done to him, in aneffort to minimize the overt by degrading those it was done to. The mechanics involved arequite simple.It is amazing what trivial overts will cause a person to blow. I caught a staff member onetime just before he blew and traced down the original overt act against the Organization to hisfailure to defend the Organization when a criminal was speaking viciously about it. This failureto defend accumulated to itself more and more overts and withholds such as failing to relaymessages, failure to complete an assignment, until it finally utterly degraded the person intostealing something of no value. This theft caused the person to believe he had better leave.It is a rather noble commentary on man that when a person finds himself, as he believes,incapable of restraining himself from injuring a benefactor he will defend the benefactor byleaving. This is the real source of the blow-off. If we were to better a person’s workingconditions in this light we would see that we have simply magnified his overt acts and made it acertain fact that he would leave. If we punish we can bring the value of the benefactor down abit and thus lessen the value of the overt. But improvement and punishment are neither oneanswers. The answer lies in Scientology and processing the person up to a high enoughresponsibility to take a job or a position and carry it out without all this weird hocus-pocus of“I’ve got to say you are doing things to me so I can leave and protect you from all the badthings I am doing to you.” That’s the way it is and it doesn’t make sense not to do somethingabout it now that we know.A recent Secretarial Executive Director to all Central Organizations states that before aperson may draw his last pay cheque from an Organization he is leaving of his own volition hemust write down all his overts and withholds against the Organization and its related personneland have these checked out by the HCO Secretary on an E-Meter.To do less than this is cruelty itself. The person is blowing himself off with his ownoverts and withholds. If these are not removed then anything the Organization or its peopledoes to him goes in like a javelin and leaves him with a dark area in his life and a rotten taste inhis mouth. Further he goes around spouting lies about the Organization and its relatedpersonnel and every lie he utters makes him just that much sicker. By permitting a blow-offwithout clearing it we are degrading people, for I assure you, and with some sorrow, peoplehave not often recovered from overts against Scientology, its Organizations and relatedpersons. They don’t recover because they know in their hearts even while they lie that they arewronging people who have done and are doing enormous amounts of good in the world andwho definitely do not deserve libel and slander. Literally, it kills them and if you don’t believeit I can show you the long death list.The only evil thing we are doing is to be good, if that makes sense to you. For by beinggood, things done to us out of carelessness or viciousness are all out of proportion to the evildone to others. This often applies to people who are not Scientologists. Just this year I had anelectrician who robbed HCO of money with false bills and bad workmanship. One day hewoke up to the fact that the Organization he was robbing was helping people everywhere farbeyond his ability to ever help anyone. Within a few weeks he contracted TB and is now dyingin a London hospital. Nobody took off the overts and withholds when he left. And it’s actuallykilling him-a fact which is no fancy on my part. There is something a little terrifying in thissometimes. I once told a bill collector what and who we were and that he had wronged a goodperson and a half hour later he threw a hundred grains of Veronal down his throat and waslugged off to hospital, a suicide.This campaign is aimed straightly at cases and getting people cleared. It is aimed atpreserving staffs and the lives of persons who believe they have failed us."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Uneasy lies the head that has a bad conscience. Clean it up and run responsibility on itand you have another better person, and if anybody feels like leaving just examine the recordand sit down and list everything done to and withheld from me ;and the Organization and sendit along.

And the next most fundamental element to know is that: A CASEWITH WITHHOLDS WILL NOT CLEAR. Perhaps, if this is repeated loud enough and longenough, not only Preclears, but perhaps even Auditors will realize that this is an absolute,unavoidable truth, one which can not be overlooked or neglected at any time, under anycircumstances.First of all, what is a withhold? A withhold is a no action after the fact of action in whichthe individual has done or been an accessory to doing something which is a transgressionagainst some moral code consisting of agreements to which the individual has subscribed inorder to guarantee, with others, the survival of a group with which he is co-acting or has co-acted toward survival.Because a withhold is a no action or a no motion after doingness, it naturally hangs up intime and floats in time due to the actions or the overts which preceded the no action or nomotion of the withhold. The reactive mind is, therefore, the combined withholds stocked upwhich the individual has against groups from which he feels that he is individuated but fromwhich he has not separated due to the fact that he has these withholds in his bank and also allthe combined agreements toward survival of all these groups, from which he is not separate,and which he uses reactively to solve problems now without inspection.Example: The individual belonged at some time to the Holy Fighters. One of the mores ofthis group was that all should be destroyed who do not accept the Word. The Holy Fighterswent out on a punitive expedition against a neighboring tribe who would not accept the Word,but accepted some other belief. There was a great battle with much killing; however, during thebattle, the individual took pity upon a helpless child and did not kill him, but took the child offthe field of battle, gave him food and drink, and left him, returning, himself, to the battle.After the battle was successfully won, the Holy Fighters had their usual service duringwhich all spoke of how they had killed all non-believers. Our individual withheld from thegroup that he had not only failed to kill, but had saved the life of a non-believer. Thus we havethe no action of the withhold after the overt or action of saving the child, all of which added upto a transgression against the mores of the Holy Fighters.Because of such similar transgressions, the individual finally individuated from the groupof Holy Fighters and became a member of the Board of Directors of the Society for Kindnessto Humans, which itself had its own agreements to survival and with which the individualagreed; however, when difficulties or problems arose, the individual instead of treating all withkindness tended to covertly try to destroy all who would not accept the tenets of kindness. Sohe reactively was solving the problems of the Society of Kindness with a survival mores of theHoly Fighters. Due to all his transgressions and withholds of his destructive impulses while amember of the Society for Kindness, he finally individuated from this group."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Now he is a member of Anti-Emotions, Incorporated, but he finds that he can’t rule outall his emotions, but tends to be destructive and kind at the same time. So he is still solvingproblems not only with the mores of the Holy Fighters, but with those of the Society forKindness to Humans. And so it goes.Processing this individual we will find that he has all these withholds of overts against theHoly Fighters, the Society for Kindness to Humans, and Anti-Emotions, Incorporated. Afterwe have pulled all these overts, he will truly be separate from these groups and no longerreactively use their survival mechanisms as solutions to problems.Further the action of withholding is one point where the Preclear does what the reactivemind does. He withholds his own overts of transgressions against the moral code of a group inorder to avoid punishment, thusly enhance his own survival, and he withholds himself fromthe group finally in an effort to avoid committing further overts. So just as the reactive mindcontains all past survival agreements which are used to solve problems threatening the survivalof the individual, so does the individual decide to withhold transgressions, in order to survivehimself, and withholds himself from groups to avoid committing overts.Withholding and surviving occur at the same time. So the communication bridge betweenthe Preclear and the reactive mind is the withhold.The pulling of overts which have been withheld then is the first step towards getting thePreclear to take control of the reactive mind. The more withholds he gives up, the more the oldsurvival mechanisms of the reactive mind are destroyed.Further as a withhold of an overt creates a further overt act of not-know on the groupwith which one is co-acting toward survival along an agreed upon moral code, so we arerunning off all the ignorance created for others by an individual which results in ignorance tohimself. In this fashion, we are processing the individual up toward Native State orKnowingness.Therefore, in doing Integrity Processing on a Preclear, you are really attacking the wholebasis of the reactive mind. It is an activity which the Auditor should earnestly and effectivelyengage upon. In doing this the Auditor always assumes that the Preclear can remember hisoverts and can overwhelm the reactive mind. Just as with the CCHs so with ProcessingChecks, any objections raised by the Preclear as regards Integrity Processing are only aconfusion being thrown up by the reactive mind, but the individual is really trying to look forwhat is there despite the reactive mind’s doing this. This is why any failure to pull an overt isconsidered a crime against the Preclear. The Auditor in failing to pull an overt has given thereactive mind a win and the Preclear a failure, and has further given the Preclear another overtagainst the group he is now associated with, namely, that of Scientology, because he hassucceeded in withholding from it.So in Integrity Processing the Auditor must get the Preclear to answer the questionwithout developing meter-dependency. This creates confidence that the Auditor and the Preclearare really working together to overwhelm the reactive mind.If the meter gives an instant read to the question then the Auditor uses the E-Meter toassist the Preclear in pulling all further overts and takes it earlier similar to get an F/N ON THEQUESTION BEING ASKED.A stable datum as regards this is that if the question reacts, there are withholds there ornot all about a particular withhold was pulled. Never allow a Preclear to persuade you that it isonly already pulled withholds which are still reacting. A withhold pulled will not cause aquestion to still react; it can only be that not all about the withhold was pulled or that there arefurther undisclosed withholds on that question, or it is a false read (withhold of nothing) inwhich case the question will F/N on false."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"DO NOT LEAVE AN INTEGRITY PROCESSING QUESTION UNTIL THEAUDITOR, THE PRECLEAR, THE REACTIVE MIND, AND THE E-METER ARE IN ABSOLUTE AGREEMENT THAT THERE IS NOTHING MORE ON APARTICULAR QUESTION. THIS WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY THE EP OF F/N COGVGIs ON THE QUESTION.Remember the E-Meter is not bound by the Auditor’s Code. If it reacts on a question,then the Auditor must take that question to full EP with an F/N. A question, having once read,is NOT nulled to a no-read. It is audited to an F/N. Obtaining a read and taking the read to F/Ndepends on good Auditor presence and excellence of TRs, Basic Auditing and Metering.A Processing Check question must never be left without F/Ning. If the Preclear’sintensive is terminating, you must complete that question no matter how many extra hours youhave to put in on the Preclear. Do not end session without carrying the question you areworking on to EP. Any failure to pull an overt is a crime against that Preclear.Eliminate all “unkind thought” questions in Integrity Processing. Use “done anything to”type questions. Unkind thoughts are merely tags telling you that the Preclear has actually donesomething. Unkind thoughts are merely a mechanism of lessening the overt.In pulling overts, be careful that you do not allow the Preclear to give you hisjustifications for having committed it. In allowing him to give you motivators or “reasons why”you are allowing him to lessen the overt.You are only interested in what the Preclear has done, not what he has heard that othershave done. So never allow a Preclear to get off withholds to you about others, except in thecase where he has been an accessory to a criminal act.“Other people’s overts” are handled by asking the Preclear, “Have you ever doneanything like that yourself?”Remember that your duty as an Auditor is to simply employ your skill to obtain a greaterdecency, ability and integrity on the part of others. You do this by performing well yourfunction of clearing the meter and getting off all overts and withholds. An Auditor is not anenforcer of public morals. If an Auditor tries to make a Preclear guilty, he is violating Clause15 of the Auditor’s Code, which says: “Never mix the processes of Scientology with those ofvarious other practices”. Punishment is an old practice which is not part of our activities inScientology. Audit against the reality of the Preclear and his moral code and do not try to makehim guilty. The value of any withhold is only the value the Preclear puts on it.As a case improves, his responsibility level will increase, and if his responsibility level isincreasing he will get off further, new withholds. If an Auditor is not getting new withholdscoming off a Preclear, he had better look for a gross error in his auditing. He either isdisinterested and unwilling to help the Preclear, or he is technically unskillful on his TRs, BasicAuditing and the E-Meter, or he does not have the Preclear in session or he has withholdshimself. Only an Auditor with withholds will fail to pull them on others.The number of withholds a Preclear has available at any given time depends upon thosethat are available at that given time. To clarify this point, assume that all Preclears have thesame set number of withholds. Well, the number available within the realm of the Preclear’spresent state of reality and responsibility will naturally vary. Preclears with a high reality andresponsibility level will have more withholds available for pulling than Preclears with a lowreality and responsibility level. This is why it is so important that Processing Checks becontinued throughout auditing. His reality and responsibility level will increase throughoutprocessing bringing to light many new overts. If these are not pulled, the Preclear will beforced into unintentionally withholding them and his case will bog down and not progress."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"There are prepared Integrity Processing Forms to assist you in pulling withholds. Inusing these, an Auditor must never, never omit a question on any of these, but he can addquestions to them. Then there are specialized Integrity Processing Forms tailored to fit theprofessional or present activities of the Preclear, and special forms to cover the transgressionsof the Preclear against the moral code of any group with which he has co-acted. On the latter,as a person in one lifetime only has belonged to many different groups, you can see thetremendous possibility of Integrity Processing applied to the moral code of all groups on awhole track basis. Particular attention must be paid to the present group with whom he iscurrently co-acting, namely Scientology. This is why it is important to do the last two pages*of the Basic Integrity Processing Form and others specifically related to the subject ofScientology as applicable on all Scientologists first, because in the first place he is expectingsomething to help him against which he has overts and to that degree these overts are overtsagainst himself as they will, if not pulled, prevent him from being helped, and in the secondplace overts against current groups are most important, then overts committed in this lifetime,and then overts committed on the track, the reason being that he is still connected with thesecurrent groups and with this lifetime.Integrity Processing is a most fruitful source of cognition, because you are pulling off thePreclear’s not-knows on the Third Dynamic, which have kept others in ignorance and himselfin stupidity. Besides this, you tremendously increase the Preclear’s ability to communicate.And on top of all this you make a Preclear much easier to audit. And if all his withholds arepulled, he can be cleared.Pretty good gains to work for?Well then, let’s get busy.Compiled from LRH briefingsand materials byLt. Comdr.

The person with entheta hasMISSED WITHHOLDS. You don’t need policies and diplomacy to handle these people. Policyand diplomacy will fail. You need expert auditing skill and a British Mark IV meter and theperson on the cans and that person’s MISSED WITHHOLDS.A MISSED WITHHOLD is a withhold that existed, was tapped and was not pulled. Hellhath no screams like a withhold scorned.A MISSED WITHHOLD programme would not be one where an auditor pulls a pc’swithholds. A MISSED WITHHOLD programme would be where the auditor searched for andfound when and where withholds had been available but had been MISSED.The withhold need not have been asked for. It merely need have been available. And if itwas not pulled, thereafter you have a nattery, combative, ARC Breaky or entheta inclinedperson.THIS is the only dangerous point in auditing. This is the only thing which makes anoccasional error in the phrase, “Any auditing is better than no auditing.” That line is true withone exception. If a withhold were available but was missed, thereafter you have a bashed-upcase."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"HOW TO AUDIT ITIn picking up Missed Withholds you don’t ask for withholds, you ask for missedwithholds.Sample question:“What withhold was missed on you?”The auditor then proceeds to find out what it was and who missed it. And the Mark IVneedle is cleaned of reaction at Sensitivity 16 on every such question.Gone is the excuse “She doesn’t register on the meter.” That’s true of old meters, not theBritish Mark IV.And if the pc considers it no overt, and can’t conceive of overts, you still have “didn’tknow”. Example: “What didn’t an auditor know in an auditing session?”SAMPLE MISSED WITHHOLD SESSIONAsk pc if anyone has ever missed a withhold on him (her) in an auditing session. Cleanit. Get all reactions off the needle at Sensitivity 16.Then locate first auditing session pc had. Flatten “What didn’t that auditor know?” “Whatdidn’t that auditor know about you?”For good measure get the ruds in for that first session. In auditing an auditor, also do thesame thing for his or her first pc.Then pick up any stuck session. Treat it exactly the same way. (If you scan the pcthrough all his auditing ever from the cleaned first session to present time, the pc will stick in asession somewhere. Treat that session the same as the first session. You can scan again andagain, finding the stuck sessions and get the withholds off in that session and the ruds in asabove.)Clean up all sessions you can find. And get what the auditor didn’t know, what theauditor didn’t know about the pc, and for good measure, get in the other ruds.Cleaning up an old session will suddenly give you all the latent gain in that session. It’sworth having!This can be extended to “What didn’t the org know about you?” for those who’ve hadtrouble with it.And it can be extended to any life area where the pc has had trouble.SUMMARYIf you clean up as above withholds that have been missed on any pc or person, you willhave any case flying.This then is not just emergency data for use on flubbed intensives. It is vital technologythat can do wonders for cases.ON ANY CASE THAT HAS BEEN AUDITED A PART OF AN INTENSIVE,BEFORE GOING ON THE AUDITOR SHOULD SPEND SOME TIME LOCATING"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"WITHHOLDS HE OR SHE MIGHT HAVE MISSED ON THAT PC.Any pc that is ending a week’s auditing should be carefully checked over for withholdsthat might have been missed.Any pc that is ending his or her intensives should be most carefully checked out formissed withholds. This makes sudden auditing gains.Any case not up to recognizing overts will respond to “didn’t know about you” when thecase doesn’t respond to “withhold”.Any student should be checked weekly for missed withholds.Any person who is giving an auditor, the field, the Organization, a course or Scientologyany trouble should be gotten hold of and checked for missed withholds.It is provenly true on five continents that any other meter reaches only occasionally belowthe level of consciousness and the British Mark IV reaches deeply and well. It is dangerous toaudit without a meter because then you really miss withholds. It is dangerous to audit withoutknowing how to really use a meter because of missing withholds. It is dangerous to audit withany other meter than a British Mark IV. It is SAFE to audit if you can run a meter and if youuse a British Mark IV and if you pull all the withholds and missed withholds.EVERY blow-up you ever had with a pc was due ENTIRELY to having missed awithhold whether you were using a meter or not, whether you were asking for withholds ornot.Just try it out the next time a pc gets upset and you’ll see that I speak the usual sooth.

If the pc is in session the pcwill talk to the auditor. If the pc is not in session, the pc won’t tell the auditor a withhold. Inever have any trouble getting the pc to tell me a withhold. I sometimes have trouble getting thepc to find out about a withhold so the pc can tell it to me. If the pc will not tell the auditor awithhold (and the pc knows it) the remedy is rudiments. I always assume, and correctly, that ifthe pc knows about it the pc will tell me. My job is to get the pc to find out so the pc hassomething to tell me. The chief auditor blunder in pulling withholds stems from the auditorassuming the pc already knows when the pc does not.If used exactly, this system will let the pc find out and let the pc get all the charge off of awithhold as well as tell the auditor all about it.Missing a withhold or not getting all of it is the sole source of ARC break.Get a reality on this now. All trouble you have or have ever had or will ever have withARC breaky pcs stems only and wholly from having restimulated a withhold and yet havingfailed to pull it. The pc never forgives this. This system steers you around the rock of missedwithholds and their bombastic consequences.WITHHOLD SYSTEMThis system has five parts:0. The Difficulty being handled.1. What the withhold is.2.

RON HUBBARD.)____________Security Checking has an important part to play in modern auditing. We have the datumthat as a PC comes up in responsibility so does his recognition of overts. This factor canseriously hamper a PC’s progress. Security Checking is a case cleaning activity and it shouldbe thoroughly and competently applied. It is not something to be done just for form’s sake. It isdone to speed up the advance of the case. A PC who has overts ready to be pulled just cannotmake the rapid progress which modern clearing techniques make possible. So don’tunderestimate the value of Sec Checking. Learn to do it. Learn to do it well and when you doit, go in and do an expert and thorough job.Security Checking is a specialized type of auditing, and it takes a lot of skill and at timessome courage to do it well. Auditors must not be kind nor yet unkind. This does not mean thatyou steer a luke warm middle course between kindness and unkindness. Neither of these twoimpostors have anything to do with it. You Just go in and audit, you go in to find—and thatmeans dig for OVERTS. If you go in with PC’s needle clean and your questioning can get thatneedle to react, then you are winning.The success of an auditor can be measured by the extent to which he can get reactions onthe needle and then cleaning those reactions getting more reactions and cleaning those and soon. It’s a probing operation like probing for sore places on a body, locating them and thenhealing them. The skilled auditor, however, gets to the root of the trouble and clears up a wholebatch of overts at once.Security Checking is done in Model Session. The beginning rudiments are put in and bythe time you start the body of the session, in this case the security check, the PC should have anice clean needle. The next thing is to tell the PC that you are going to help him to clean up, andreally clean up, the questions on the Form that you are using. REMEMBER IT IS THEQUESTION YOU ARE GOING TO CLEAN—NOT THE NEEDLE. You’ve already got aclean needle and you could probably keep it clean by Bad TR 1, failure to dig, or just sheer badauditing. No, it’s the question you are cleaning, and in the process you are going to get a dirtyor reacting needle. So really get it over to your PC that you are going to CLEAN THEQUESTION.The next action is to announce the first question that you are going to clean. Theimportant thing at this stage is to groove in the question. There are a variety of ways to do this,e.g., ask what the question means. What period or time the question covers. What activitieswould be included. Where the PC has been that might be something to do with the question. Ifany other people are likely to be involved. In other words you are steering the PC’s attention tovarious parts of his bank and getting him to have a preliminary look. When this has been done,using very good TR l, you give him the question-OFF THE METER. You can forget your antiQ and A drill. You take your PC’s answer and bird dog him about it. If he gives you a generalanswer you ask him for a specific time (or a specific example) DON’T ACCEPTMOTIVATORS. If he gives you a motivator you say “OK, but what did you do there?” andyou want something before the motivator. Example:- PC: “I got mad at him because he kicked"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"my foot.” Aud: “What had you done before he kicked your foot?” In this case the PC is givingan overt “I got mad at him” but in fact he is cunningly selling the motivator “He kicked me inthe foot”. So the rule here is “go earlier than the motivator”. Similarly you don’t acceptcriticisms, unkind thoughts, explanations. You want what the PC has done and you want theTime Place Form and Event.When you have succeeded in this you don’t leave it there. You ask for an earlier time hehad done something like it and you keep going earlier. What you are after is the earliest time hestole, hit somebody, got angry with a PC or whatever is his “crime”. Get the earliest one andyou will find that the others will blow off like thistledown.Keep a sly eye on your meter and you can tell when you are in a hot area. Use it to helpyou to know where to dig, but don’t use it to steer the PC at this stage. This encourageslaziness on the part of the PC. YOU want him in there foraging about and digging up his bankin the process.Only when your PC is thoroughly and healthily exhausted do you check the question onthe meter. If you have done an excellent job the question will be clean.However if you get a read you steer your PC by saying “There”, “There” whenever yousee a repetition of the original read. When he finds it you repeat the procedure outline above.YOU don’t go back to the meter until you have really got all there is to be got. When you havegot a clean needle you put in your mid ruds on the session, and if these are clean and only ifthey are clean you go on to the next question. If the ruds do bring out something then you goback to the question and start over again. And so you go on cleaning question after question.The success of a Sec Check Session is not judged by the number of questions cleaned but bythe amount of looking you succeeded in making your PC do.If you do this properly, that is the whole outline, you will have a well satisfied PC. If heARC breaks then you have missed something, so pull your missed withholds. A Rising TA is aclue to something missed. If a PC isn’t happy—very happy—at the end of a question then youhave missed something. PC’s will tell you a hundred and one things that are wrong with yourauditing, the D of P’s instruction, the form of the question, etc., but they all add up to the samething-something has been missed.Finally do end Ruds and these should run quickly and smoothly. Run a bit of havingnessif necessary. Sharpen your pencil for the goals and gains and you’ll leave the session happyand satisfied because that’s how your PC feels.One word of warning. If you leave a question unflat, mark it on your auditor’s report andTELL YOUR PC it isn’t flat.Good digging.Issued by:Reg SharpeSHSBC Course SecretaryforL.

In Level III one can also direct attention to the various dynamics by firstassessing them and then using or preparing a list for the dynamic found.RESPONSIBILITYThere is no reason to expect any great pc responsibility for his or her own overts belowLevel IV and the auditor seeking to make the pc feel or take responsibility for overts is justpushing the pc down. The pc will resent being made feel guilty. Indeed the auditor may onlyachieve that, not case gain. And the pc will ARC break.At Level IV one begins on this subject of responsibility but again it is indirectly the target.There is no need now to run Responsibility in doing O/Ws.The realization that one has really done something is a return of responsibility and thisgain is best obtained only by indirect approach as in the above processes."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"ARC BREAKSThe commonest cause of failure in running overt acts is “cleaning cleans” whether or notone is using a meter. The pc who really has more to tell doesn’t ARC Break when the Auditorcontinues to ask for one but may snarl and eventually give it up.On the other hand leaving an overt touched on the case and calling it clean will cause afuture ARC Break with the auditor.“Have you told all?” prevents cleaning a clean. On the unmetered pc one can see the pcbrighten up. On the meter you get a nice fall if it’s true that all is told.“Have I not found out about something?” prevents leaving an overt undisclosed. On theunmetered pc the reaction is a sly flinch. On a metered pc it gives a read.A pc’s protest against a question will also be visible in an unmetered pc in a reeling sortof exasperation which eventually becomes a howl of pure bafflement at why the auditor won’taccept the answer that that’s all. On a meter protest of a question falls on being asked for: “Isthis question being protested?”There is no real excuse for ARC Breaking a pc by1. Demanding more than is there or2. Leaving an overt undisclosed that will later make the pc upset with the auditor.FORBIDDEN WORDSDo not use the following words in auditing commands. While they can be used indiscussion or nomenclature, for various good reasons they should be avoided now in anauditing command:Responsibility(ies)Justification(s)Withhold(s)Failed(ures)Difficulty(ies)Desire(s)HereThereCompulsion(s) (ively)Obsession(s) (ively)No unusual restraint should be given these words. Just don’t frame a command thatincludes them. Use something else.WHY OVERTS WORKOverts give the highest gain in raising cause level because they are the biggest reason whya person restrains himself and withholds self from action.Man is basically good. But the reactive mind tends to force him into evil actions. Theseevil actions are instinctively regretted and the individual tries to refrain from doing anything atall. The “best” remedy, the individual thinks, is to withhold. “If I commit evil actions, then mybest guarantee for not committing is to do nothing whatever.” Thus we have the “lazy”, inactiveperson."},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Others who try to make an individual guilty for committing evil actions only increase thistendency to laziness.Punishment is supposed to bring about inaction. And it does. In some unexpected ways.However, there is also an inversion (a turn about) where the individual sinks belowrecognition of any action. The individual in such a state cannot conceive of any action andtherefore cannot withhold action. And thus we have the criminal who can’t act really but canonly re-act and is without any self direction. This is why punishment does not cure criminalitybut in actual fact creates it; the individual is driven below withholding or any recognition of anyaction. A thief’s hands stole the jewel, the thief was merely an innocent spectator to the actionof his own hands. Criminals are very sick people physically.So there is a level below withholding that an auditor should be alert to in some pcs, forthese “have no withholds” and “have done nothing”. All of which, seen through their eyes istrue. They are merely saying “I cannot restrain myself” and “I have not willed myself to dowhat I have done.”The road out for such a case is the same as that for any other case. It is just longer. Theprocesses for levels above hold also for such cases. But don’t be anxious to see a suddenreturn of responsibility, for the first owned “done” that this person knows he or she has donemay be “ate breakfast”. Don’t disdain such answers in Level II particularly. Rather, in suchpeople, seek such answers.There is another type of case in all this, just one more to end the list. This is the case whonever runs O/W but “seeks the explanation of what I did that made it all happen to me”.This person easily goes into past lives for answers. Their reaction to a question aboutwhat they’ve done is to try to find out what they did that earned all those motivators. That, ofcourse, isn’t running the process and the auditor should be alert for it and stop it when it ishappening.This type of case goes into its extreme on guilt. It dreams up overts to explain why. Aftermost big murders the police routinely have a dozen or two people come around and confess.You see, if they had done the murder, this would explain why they feel guilty. As a terrorstomach is pretty awful grim to live with, one is apt to seek any explanation for it if it will onlyexplain it.On such cases the same approach as given works, but one should be very careful not tolet the pc get off overts the pc didn’t commit.Such a pc (recognizable by the ease they dive into the extreme past) when being auditedoff a meter gets more and more frantic and wilder and wilder in overts reported. They shouldget calmer under processing, of course, but the false overts make them frantic and hectic in asession. On a meter one simply checks for “Have you told me anything beyond what really hasoccurred?” Or “Have you told me any untruths?”The observation and meter guides given in this section are used during a session whenthey apply but not systematically such as after every pc answer. These observations and meterguides are used always at the end of every session on the pcs to whom they apply.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH: nb. cdenCopyright © 1964by L.

And remember that temporarysags in level can occur such as during ARC Breaks with the auditor or life.A process can be accusative because it is worded too strongly. It can be accusative to thepc because the pc feels guilty or defensive anyway.At Level I proper O/W processes can take up the troubles that are described as peculiar tosome pcs without getting too personal about it.Here are some varied Level I Processes:“Tell me some things you think you should not have done.”“Tell me what you’ve done that got you into trouble.”“What wouldn’t you do over again?”“What are some things a person shouldn’t say?”“What gets a person into trouble?”“What have you done that you regret?”“What have you said you wish you hadn’t?”“What have you advised others to do?”There are many more.These at Level II all convert to repetitive processes.At Level III such processes convert to lists.At Level IV such processes convert to how they weren’t overts or weren’t really done orjustifications of one kind or another.Care should be taken not to heavily run an out-of-ARC type process. This is thecommand which asks for out-of-Affinity moments, out-of-Reality moments and out of-Communication incidents."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"All after charge is based on prior ARC. Therefore for a withhold to exist there must havebeen communication earlier. ARC incidents are basic on all chains. Out of ARC are later on thechain. One has to get a basic to blow a chain. Otherwise one gets recurring answers. (Pc bringsup same incident over and over as you don’t have the basic on the chain.)You can alternate an ARC command with an out-of-ARC command. “What have youdone?” (means one had to reach for and contact) can be alternated with “What haven’t youdone?” (means not reached for and not contacted).But if one runs the out-of-ARC (not reached for and not contacted) process only the pcwill soon bog.On the other hand an ARC process runs on and on with no bad side effects, i.e. “Whathave you done?”“What bad thing have you done?” is a mixture of ARC and out-of-ARC. Done reachedand contacted. Bad wished one hadn’t.So solely accusative commands upset the pc not because of social status or insult butbecause a pc, particularly at lower levels of case, wishes so hard he hadn’t done it that a realbad done is really a withhold and the pc not only withholds it from the auditor but himself aswell.

A being appears to have a motivator.3. This is because of an overt the being has done.2. The being committed an overt because he didn’t understand something.1. The being didn’t understand something because a word or symbol was notunderstood.Thus all caved-in conditions, illness, etc, can be traced back to a misunderstood symbol,strange as that may seem.It goes like this:1. A being doesn’t get the meaning of a word or symbol.2. This causes the being to misunderstand the area of the symbol or word (who used itwhatever it applied to);3. This causes the being to feel different from or antagonize toward the user orwhatever of the symbol and so makes it all right to commit an overt;4. Having committed the overt, the being now feels he has to have a motivator and sofeels caved in.This is the stuff of which Hades is made. This is the trap. This is why people get sick.This is stupidity and lack of ability.This is why Clay Table Auditing works.Clearing a pc then consists only of locating the area of the motivator, finding what wasmisunderstood and getting the word made into clay and explained. The overts blow.

There were onlyso many anyway and it’s been done.But new ways to apply or disseminate what we’ve got are welcome, welcome, welcome.We’ve not nearly enough of those and we’ll be inventing or seeing them for the next umptytrillion years.So my hat is off to Beth Fordyce, HCO Area Sec Detroit, U.S.A., who informed us viaU.S. Continental of a new use for The Book of Case Remedies for which she’ll receive a bowand appropriate award, to wit her DScn.Here is her report.“At the January D.C. Congress, I had some interesting data about The Book of CaseRemedies that you (HCO Cont Sec U.S.) thought I ought to write up for Ron because you felthe’d be interested in it. Here it is.“We’ve had several instances where people have read the remedies and come in to tell methat certain ones ‘fit’ them. Then when they started to tell me which ones specifically, theycouldn’t remember them—or they would be able to remember only one. The book obviouslyindicates by-passed charge, and handles most of the problems. They find out what theirproblem actually is.“One fellow who has been ARC broken with Scientology for years (even before I heardof Scn), came in and I asked him to find himself in the remedies. He started reading them, andeach one seemed to fit him (except about 3 or 4 of them). I noted them down one by one, as hecalled them to me. When he finished, I said no more about it.“Later on—about 15 minutes—he decided he’d better look through those again becausehe ‘was sure that they didn’t all fit—maybe some of them have changed’. So he went throughthem again, one by one, and only 3 still seemed to apply—and only ONE of them wasstrongest, he felt. The other two seemed to have lost their punch.“He was quite different after that. I also did what the remedy called for, which cleaned itup. The last time I saw him—at our Congress—he not once mentioned the problem he’salways had with eye-spots. (And, frankly, I was afraid at that point to say ‘eye-spots’ to himfor fear he’d key it back in again, so I just settled for HIS not mentioning it ! )“As soon as we get our next batch of Remedies, I intend to send at least 4 of them as gifts"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"to people who are badly ARC broken with us.

If this is the case the TA will blow down. If it isn’tthe case the needle and TA remain unchanged. If the pc’s nattery or ARC Breaky conditioncontinues despite finding by-passed charge, then of course it is obviously a withhold.ARC Break finding does work. When the pc doesn’t change despite skillful ARC Breakhandling, locating and indicating, it was a withhold in the first place.The hardest pc to handle is the missed withhold pc. They ARC Break but you can’t getthe pc out of it. The answer is, the pc had a withhold all the time that is at the bottom of allthese ARC Breaks.Scientology auditing does not leave the pc in poor condition unless one goofs on ARCBreaks.ARC Breaks occur most frequently on people with missed withholds. \\-Therefore if a pc can’t be patched up easily or won’t stay patched up on ARC Breaks,there must be basic withholds on the case. One then works hard on withholds with any and allthe tools that we’ve got.ARC Breaks don’t cause blows. Missed withholds do. When you won’t hear what the pcis saying, then you have made him have a withhold and it responds as a missed withhold.In short, the bottom of ARC Breaks is a missed withhold.But an anti-social act done and then withheld sets the pc up to become “an ARC Breakypc”. It isn’t an accurate remark really since one has a pc with withholds who on being auditedARC Breaks easily. So the accurate statement is “the pc is a withholdy type pc that ARCBreaks a lot”. Now that type exists. And they sure have lots of subsequent ARC Breaks andare regularly being patched up.If you have a pc, then, who seems to have a lot of ARC Breaks, the pc is a “withholdypc” not an “ARC Breaky pc”. Any auditor miss causes a pc blow-up. The auditor by callingthis pc an “ARC Breaky pc” is not using a description which leads to a resolution of the case asthousands of ARC Break assessments leave the case still liable to ARC Break. If you call sucha case that ARC Breaks a lot a “withholdy pc that ARC Breaks a lot” then you can solve thecase. For all you have to do is work on withholds.The actual way to handle a “withholdy pc that ARC Breaks a lot” after you’ve cooled offthe last of his many ARC Breaks is:"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"1. Get the pc to look at what’s going on with his sessions.2. Get the pc in comm.3. Get the pc to look at what’s really bugging him.4. Get the pc’s willingness to give withholds up on a gradient.5. Bring the pc to an understanding of what he’s doing.6. Get the pc’s purpose in being audited in plain view to him or her.Those are of course the names of the first six grades. However, low down, these sixthings are all crushed together and you could really pursue that cycle in one session just to getthe pc up a bit without even touching the next grade up.Whenever I see a sour-faced person who has been “trained” or is being “trained” I knowone thing—there goes a pc with lots of withholds. I also know, there is a pc who ARC Breaksa lot in session. And I also know his co-auditor is weak and flabby as an auditor. And I alsoknow his auditing supervisor doesn’t shove the student auditor into doing the processcorrectly.One sour-faced student, one glance and I know all the above things, bang!So why can’t somebody else notice it?Auditing is a pleasure. But not when an auditor can’t tell a withhold from an ARC Breakand doesn’t know that continual ARC Breaks are caused by missed withholds on the bottom ofthe chain.I never miss on this. Why should you?The only case that will really “bug you” is the CONTINUOUS OVERT case. Here’s onethat commits anti-social acts daily during auditing. He’s a nut. He’ll never get better, casealways hangs up.Unless you treat his continual overts as a solution to a PTP. And find what PTP he’strying to solve with these crazy overt acts.You see, we can even solve that case.BUT, don’t go believing Scientology doesn’t work when it meets an unchanging orcontinually misemotional pc. Both of these people are foul balls who are loaded withwithholds.We’ve cracked them for years and years now.But not by playing patty-cake or “slap my wrist”.Takes an auditor, not a lady finger.“Mister, you’ve been wasting my time for three sessions. You have withholds. Give!”“Mister, you refuse just once more to answer my question and you’re for it. I’ve checked thismeter. It’s not a withhold of nothing. You have withholds. Give!” “Mister, that’s it. I amasking the D of P to ask the Tech Sec for a Comm Ev on you from HCO for no report.”If skill couldn’t do it, demand may. If demand couldn’t do it, a Comm Ev sure will."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"For it’s a no report!How can you make a man well when he’s got a sewer full of slimy acts.Show me any person who is critical of us and I’ll show you crimes and intended crimesthat would stand a magistrate’s hair on end.Why not try it?

I checked up on 21 cases who had never had any gainssince 1950. 17 turned out to be criminals! The other 4 were beyond the reach of investigation.That gave me my first clue.For some years then, I watched for no-gain cases and carefully followed up those that Icould. They had major or minor criminal backgrounds.This gave the 1959 breakthrough on the meter checks (Sec Checking).Following it further since 1959 I have finally amassed enough histories to state:THE PERSON WHO IS NOT GETTING CASE GAINS IS COMMITTINGCONTINUING OVERTS.While this sounds like a very good “out” for us, we assume that the auditor at least triedsomething sensible.Today—the running of a pc by grades is a saving grace for merely “tough cases”.Directors of Processing are doing well with the modern graded process approach, level bylevel, and the D of P Washington has just told me they were cracking cases with the lowestgrade processes DC had never been able to handle well before.So, given processing by Grades (the best case approach we’ve ever had), we crack therough ones.But will that be all cases?There’s still one.

Thischecks the performance of the continual overt long enough to let processing bite.Not everyone is a continuous overt committer by a thousand to one. But this phenomenonis not confined to the no-gain case.The slow gain case is also committing overts the auditor doesn’t see.Therefore a little discipline in the environment speeds the slow gain case, the one we’remore interested in.The no-gain case, frankly, is one I am not panting to solve. If a fellow wants to sell hisnext hundred trillion for the sake of the broken toy he stole, I’m afraid I can’t be bothered. Ihave no contract with any Big Thetan to save the world complete.It is enough for me to know:1. Where bottom is, and2. How to help speed slow gain cases.Bottom is the chap who eats your lunch apple and says the children did it.

And the fast gain case helps out and the fast gain case can be helped by a more orderlyenvironment. The good worker works more happily when bad workers see the pitfalls anddesist from distracting him.So we all win.The no-gain case? Well, he sure doesn’t deserve any gain. One pc in a thousand.

The actions and reactions of people on the subject are oftenvery falsified.People go about believing they were in an auto accident when in actual fact they causedone.Also people may believe they caused an accident when they were only in one.Some people, on hearing of a death, at once believe they must have killed the person eventhough they were far away.Police in large cities have people turn up and confess to almost every murder as a routine.One doesn’t have to be crazy to be subject to the Overt-Motivator sequence. It is not onlyused on him continually by others, it also is a basic part of his own “case”.There are two extreme stages of Overt-Motivator phenomena. One is a person who givesup only motivators (always done to him) and the other is the person who “has done only"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"overts” (done to others).In running engrams you will find1. All overt engrams that hang up (won’t audit easily) have also a motivator engram asthe same or different incident.2. All motivator engrams that hang up have an overt engram in the same or differentincident.The two types of engrams then are OVERT Engrams and MOTIVATOR Engrams.Example of Overt Engram—SHOOTING A DOG.Example of Motivator Engram—BEING BITTEN BY A DOG.The rule is that the SUBJECT MATTER MUST BE SIMILAR.They can be in different points in time.When you can’t run out (erase) a dog bite engram, why then you find the “shoot dog”engram.PSYCHOSOMATIC ILLS OR ABERRATIONS THAT DO NOT RESOLVE BYRUNNING ONE SIDE, USUALLY RESOLVE BY FINDING AND RUNNING THEOTHER.When you can’t erase an engram about shooting a dog, why then there’s a bitten by dog.It’s all very simple really. There are always two sides to the coin. If one won’t run, youtry the other.BASICSFinding the basic engram on a chain also applies to finding the basic overt or basicmotivator engram.Engrams then hang up (won’t run out) when(a) The other type needs to be run and(b) The one found has earlier engrams on it.NONEXTANT ENGRAMSAn “engram” sometimes didn’t exist. A pc can be trying to run being run over by a carwhen he never was. What needs to be done, when the incident won’t run, is get the pc’sincident of running over somebody. It also works in reverse. A pc can be trying to run anengram of running over somebody when he was in fact only run over himself and never didrun over anyone.So BOTH engrams can exist and be run or only one side exists and can be run or with aheavy foul-up on overts and motivators, one side can be non-factual and won’t run becauseonly the other side exists.It is easy to visualize this as a matter of flows. An overt of course is an Outflow and amotivator is an Inflow."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"SECONDARIESIt may never have been said that secondaries always sit squarely on incidents of actualpain and unconsciousness.Also secondaries can exist on the overt-motivator sequence pattern just as in engrams.This is the cause of frozen emotions or “unemotional” people. Also some peoplecomplain they can’t feel anymore.This works out by overt-motivator sequence. A person in grief over loss (grief is alwaysloss) who then can’t run it has caused grief and that overt-secondary can be run.Also a person misemotional over causing grief has been caused grief. It works both wayswith ALL POINTS ON THE TONE SCALE.The last is a newer discovery and wasn’t known to early Dianeticists.The Overt-Motivator Engram phenomena did not receive adequate dissemination. Theprinciple applied to secondaries has not before been released. It is basically Dianetic Engramrunning that resolves all cases in the end so one had better be pretty good at auditing Engramsand Secondaries, Motivator and Overt both.LRH:jp.nt.cden:jhL.

Men inuniversities and governments and other places from which it is difficult to view life (since thesituations are so lofty) took psychology and psychiatry at face value. Men were animals onetrained like dancing bears. In other words these subjects were political subjects aimed atcontrol. There was no thought of healing anything. “Treatment” meant, not heal or cure, buttrain by punishing “bad” characteristics. It is interesting that neither subject ever listed any goodcharacteristics. A typical “treatment” was to punish with electric shock a “bad habit”. Theywould give an alcoholic a taste of liquor and shock him so that he would feel the shock eachtime he thought of liquor.This is the Russian Pavlov at work in all American mental practice prior to Dianetics andScientology. Needless to say a great many people were injured for life but no one was cured ofanything.The psychiatrist and psychologist who did these things were themselves of a criminaltemperament and widely boasted they could not tell right from wrong. The ability to tell rightfrom wrong is the legal definition of sanity.The reason domineering politicians in government supported the psychologist andpsychiatrist with billions in funds and helped them destroy any potential rival was that certaintypes in government conceive it their duty to control populations. In their view populationswere merely a herd of animals to be managed and kept from committing anti-social acts as wellas milked for tax money or slaughtered.By making a totally confusing and violent environment and stripping the country of anyconstitutional safeguards the security of the individual was undermined to a point where he hadto be continually alert to immediate threat in his environment.This tended to pin people in close to present time. It inhibited any future, planning for thefuture or any long distance consequences in the future.Thus Russian mental “treatment” imported into the West actually did prevent the peoplefrom being able to predict—as they were continuously battered by government."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Thus crime rose to a fantastic level. The citizen, pinned into insecurity in the present byoutrageous economic, governmental and social duress, became much less able to predict andtherefore became oblivious of the consequences of his own acts.Most “criminal” types are completely unable to predict and thus have no fear of anyconsequences even when they are obvious to a more sane person.The case that is very bad off therefore does not register on a meter. Having no awarenessof good or evil due to his low case condition there is no apparent charge on overt acts ofomission or commission, regardless of who has been hurt.Man is basically good.When his level of awareness rises he begins to be able to predict and see theconsequences to himself or others of evil actions.The more he is freed and the higher his intelligence and ability rise the more “moral” hebecomes.Only when he is beaten down below awareness as a chronic condition does Man commitevil actions.It is not for nothing that soldiers have to be brutalized and stuck in the present by threatand duress to make them commit harmful actions.When a person’s awareness is improved he is also able to predict and can foreseeconsequences on the eight dynamics.Criminal governments and brutalizing societies are poor things to have around, they arenot “clever” enough to forecast their own demise. They engage in cold or hot wars instead ofworking out their problems. They buy Pavlov and dog technology to crush “bad traits” ratherthan cure and heal anyone. They work to decrease all liberty or abolish constitutionalsafeguards.True Sanity is that condition wherein one is sufficiently intelligent to solve his problemswithout physical violence or destroying other beings and yet survive happily and prosperously.The road from insanity to sanity is a road of recognition of the world around one, thefuture, and consequences of one’s own actions.Thus the principle of the overt motivator sequence will be found to explain and itstechniques remedy the brutality into which races fall.

Charley said you were insane.”Example: “Yes, I have a withhold. Mary Agnes has been in prison.”One also finds public pcs trying to do this occasionally.The facts of the case are that it doesn’t do anybody any good casewise to “get off” otherpeople’s withholds.Essentially, a withhold by definition is something the pc did that was an overt act, whichthe pc is withholding and thus keeping secret.Thus, getting off things that somebody else did is not helpful to a case as such thingsaren’t aberrative to the pc.But now let’s look at this more closely.If a pc is “getting off” other people’s withholds HE HIMSELF MUST HAVE A CHAINOF SIMILAR OVERTS AND WITHHOLDS that are his own. Getting off other people’swithholds is then seen as a symptom of the pc withholding similar actions of his own.Let us then complete the two examples above.Auditor: “Do you have a withhold?”Pc: “Charley said you were insane.”Auditor, correctly: “Do you have a similar withhold of your own?”Pc: “Er-uh—well actually I told the class you were crazy last month.”____________Auditor: “Do you have a withhold?”Pc: “Mary Agnes has been in prison.”Auditor: “Ok. Do you have a similar withhold of your own?”Pc: “Er-uh—well—I spent two years in a reform school and I’ve never told anybody. “You can assume that any pc who is trying to get off withholds someone else had ismaking a sort of out-of-valence effort to avoid giving his own withholds."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"This applies, of course, to all overts as well.

The natter is “other people’s overts”. Getting these off does not helpthe pc. Getting the pc’s off does. Never be misled by a nattering pc.

I must say that it requires a bit of confronting.The alleviation of the condition of insanity has also been accomplished now and thefootnote in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health concerning future research into thisfield can be considered fulfilled.The things a C/S should know about insanity are as follows:HIGHER PERCENTAbout 15% to 20% of the human race apparently is insane or certainly a much higherpercent than was estimated.The truly insane do not necessarily act insane visibly. They are not the psychiatricobvious cases who go rigid for years or scream for days. This is observed only in the laststages or during temporary stress.Under apparent social behavior the continual crimes knowingly committed by the insaneare much more vicious than ever has been catalogued in psychiatric texts.The actions of the insane are not “unconscious”. They are completely aware of what theyare doing.All insane actions are entirely justified and seem wholly rational to them. As they have noreality on the harmful and irrational nature of their conduct it does not often register on an E-Meter.The product of their post duties is destructive but is excused as ignorance or errors.As cases in normal processing they roller coaster continually.They nearly always have a fixed emotional tone. It does not vary in nearly all insanepeople. In a very few it is cyclic, high then low.All characteristics classified as those of the “suppressive person” are in fact those of aninsane person.The easiest ways for a C/S to detect the insane are:1.

They are involved in warfare with conflicts around them which are invisible toothers. One wonders how they can be so involved or get so involved in so muchhostility.TYPESThe German psychiatric 1500 or so “different types of insanity” are just differentsymptoms of the same cause. There is only one insanity and from it springs differentmanifestations. Psychiatry erred in calling these different types and trying to invent differenttreatments.DEFINITIONInsanity can now be precisely defined.The definition is:INSANITY IS THE OVERT OR COVERT BUT ALWAYS COMPLEX ANDCONTINUOUS DETERMINATION TO HARM OR DESTROY.Possibly the only frightening thing about it is the cleverness with which it can be hidden.Whereas a sane person can become angry or upset and a bit destructive for short periods,he or she recovers. The insane mask it, are misemotional continuously and do not recover.(Except by modern processing.)THE NATURE OF MANMan is basically good. This is obvious. For when he begins to do evil he seeks to destroyhis memory in order to change and seeks to destroy his body. He seeks to check his evilimpulses by inhibiting his own skill and strength.He can act in a very evil fashion but his basic nature then makes it mandatory that helessens himself in many ways.The towering “strength” of a madman is a rarity and is compensated by efforts at self-destruction.Man’s mortality, his “one life” fixation, all stem from his efforts to check himself,obliterate his memory in a fruitless effort to change his conduct and his self-destructive habitsand impulses and losses of skills and abilities.As this rationale proves out completely in processing and fits all cases observed, we havefor the first time proof of his actual nature."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"As only around 20% are insane, and as those who previously worked in the mental fieldwere themselves mainly insane, Man as a whole has been assigned an evil repute.Govemments, where such personalities exist, listen to the opinion of the insane and apply thecharacteristic of 20% to the entire hundred percent.This gives an 80% wrong diagnosis. Which is why mental science itself was destructivewhen used by states.TECHNIQUESThe only technique available at this writing which will benefit the insane is contained inall the overt-motivator sequences and Grade II technology.At Flag at this writing new improvement on this exists but it is so powerful that slighterrors in use can cause a psychotic break in the insane. It therefore will only be exported foruse by specially trained persons and this programming will require quite a while.MEANWHILE it helps the C/S to know and use these firm rules:ALWAYS RUN DIANETIC TRIPLES.Never run Singles. The overt side (Flow 2) is vital. If you only run Flow 1 Motivators,the pc will not recover fully. Further running Flow 1 (Motivator only) any psychotic beingprocessed will not recover but may even trigger into a psychotic break. If one never rananything but motivators, psychotic manifestations would not erase.DEPEND ON EXPANDED GRADE II TECHNOLOGY TO EASE OFF OR HANDLETHE INSANE.Don’t keep asking what’s been done to him as he’ll trigger.A new discovery on this is that when you run out the motivator the person gets a higherreality on his overts. If you ran out all his motivators he would have no reason for his overts. Ifthese are not then run out he might cave himself in.PATTERN OF BEHAVIORThe APPARENT pattern of insane behavior is to come in (ask for processing, go onstaff, etc) with the advertised intention of being helped or helping, then mess up either as a pcor on post, then state how bad it all is and leave. It looks obvious enough. He came, found itbad, left.That is only the APPARENT behavior. APPARENT REASONS.Based on numerous cases, this is the real cycle. Hearing of something good that mighthelp these hateful awful rotten nasty people, the psycho comes in, wrecks this, upsets that,caves in this one, chops up that one and WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS “NO!” the psychoticeither(a) Caves himself in physically or(b) Runs away.The psychotic is motivated by intent to harm.If he realizes he is harming things he shouldn’t, he caves himself in. If he is afraid he willbe found out, he runs."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"In the psychotic the impulse is quite conscious.CONCLUSIONNone of this is very nice. It is hard to confront. Even I find it so.Freud thought all men had a hidden monster in them for he dealt mainly with thepsychotic and their behavior was what he saw.All men are not like this. The percentage that are is greater than I supposed but is a longway from all men.Sometimes one only becomes aware of these when things are getting worked on andimproved. They stay on as long as it can be made bad or there is hope it can be destroyed. Thenwhen attention is given to improvement they blow.Artists, writers often have these types hanging around them as there is someone orsomething there to be destroyed. When success or failure to destroy or possible detectionappears on the scene they blow, often as destructively as possible.Orgs are subjected to a lot of this. A psychotic sometimes succeeds in blowing off goodstaff. And then sooner or later realizes how evil he is acting and sickens or leaves.The society is not geared to any of this at all. The insane walk around wrecking the placeand decent people think it’s “human nature” or “inevitable” or a “bad childhood”.As of this writing the insane can be handled. The proof of any pudding is the processing.And this is successful. It is also rather swift. But, as I say, it is so swift the special techniquehas to be done by the specially trained flubless auditor.For a long while I’ve realized that we would have to be able to handle insane people asthe psychiatrist is fading. I have had opportunity to work on the problem. And have it handled.Until it is fully released, the C/S will benefit greatly from knowing the above as these come onhis lines far more often than he has suspected.The insane can be helped. They are not hopeless.I trust this data will be of use.L. RON HUBBARDFounderLRH: rr.rdCopyright © 1970by L.

They mustNEVER ask for terminals or locations.EXAMPLE: “Who upset you?” in TWC causes the pc to give items. This is a LIST.“What are you upset about?” does the same thing. “Which town were you happiest in?” is alsoa LISTING question NOT a TWC question. Any of these results in the pc giving items.

We can make clears and OTs with it as you will find out. Ouronly remaining problem is getting it applied skillfully.This is why I started the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. The extremely high calibre ofauditor we are turning out is causing gasps of amazement whenever these fine graduates returninto an area. We are not trying for cases at Saint Hill. I can always make clears. We are tryingfor skilled auditors. But we are getting there on cases, too, faster than anywhere else on theaverage.This training has been almost a year in progress. I have learned much about training thatis of great benefit to all of us, without at the same time skimping the training of the Saint Hillstudent.Looking over incoming students I find we have, roughly, two general categories ofauditor, with many shades of grey between:1. The natural auditor.2. The dangerous auditor.The natural auditor ties right into it and does a workmanlike job. He or she gets lots ofbulletin and tape passes in ratio to flunks, absorbs data well and gets it into practice, does apassable job on a pc even at the start of training, and improves casewise rapidly under theskilled training and auditing at Saint Hill. This is true of the clears and releases that come oncourse as well as those who have had much less case gains prior to this training. These, thenatural auditors, make up more than half the incoming students.The other category we will call the “dangerous auditor”. The severe examples of thiscategory make up about 20% of the incoming students and are very detectable. In shades ofgrey the other 30% are also, at the start, to be placed in the category of “dangerous auditorunless tightly supervised”.At Saint Hill, with few exceptions, we only get the cream of auditors and so I would saythat the overall percentage across the world is probably higher in the second category than atSaint Hill.Thus it would seem we must cure this matter at the Academies and cure it broadlythroughout Scientology, and if we do, our dissemination, just on this effort alone, should leapseveral thousand percent. If all pcs audited everywhere were expertly audited, well, think ofwhat that would do. To accomplish this we need only move the dangerous auditor out of thedanger class.I have found out what makes a pc suffer a deterioration of profile (missed withholds) andhave found out why a dangerous auditor is dangerous. Therefore, there are no barriers to ourhandling the matter as even the dangerous auditor, oddly enough, wants to be a good auditorbut doesn’t quite know how. Now we can fix it up."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"The difference between a natural auditor and a dangerous auditor is not case level as wehave supposed, but a type of case.The earliest observation on this came in ACCs. About 1% of the students (say twostudents every ACC) could be counted on to be miserable if his or her pc made gains and happyif the pc was collapsing. This was an observation. What were these students trying to do? Whatdid they think they should accomplish in a session? They are an extreme case of “dangerousauditor”.This is how to detect a “dangerous auditor” in any shade of grey:Any auditor who (a) cannot achieve results on a pc, (b) who finds items slowly or not atall, (c) who gets low marks on tape tests, (d) who has a high flunk-to-pass ratio on taking testsfor classification, (e) whose own case moves slowly, (f) who does not respond well to a“think” process, (g) who chops a pc’s comm, (h) who prevents a pc from executing an auditingcommand, (i) who obsessively changes processes before one is flat, (j) who apologizes orexplains why he or she got no results session after session, (k) who tries to make pcs guilty,(I) who blames Scientology for not working, (m) whose pcs are always ARC breaking, or (n)who will no longer audit at all, is suffering not from withholds but from the reverse of thewithhold flow, “Afraid to find out”.The person with withholds is afraid he or she will be found out. The other type of casemay have withholds but the dominant block is exactly the reverse. Instead of being afraid he orshe will be found out, the opposite type of case is afraid to find out or afraid of what he or shemay find out. Thus it is a type of case that makes a dangerous auditor. He or she is afraid offinding out something from the pc. Probably this case is the more usual in society, particularlythose who never wish to audit.A person with withholds is afraid to be found out. Such a person has auditing difficultiesas an auditor, of course, because of restraint on their own comm line. These difficulties sum upto an inability to speak during a session, going silent on the pc, failures to ask how or what thepc is doing. But this is not the dangerous auditor. The only dangerous thing an auditor can dois miss withholds and refuse to permit the pc to execute auditing commands. This alone willspin a pc.The dangerous auditor is not afraid to be found out (for who is questioning him or herwhile he or she is auditing?). The dangerous auditor is the auditor who is afraid to find out,afraid to be startled, afraid to discover something, afraid of what they will discover. Thisphobia prevents the “auditor” from flattening anything. This makes missed withholds acertainty. And only missed withholds create ARC breaks.All cases, of course, are somewhat leery of finding things out and so any old-time auditorcould have his quota of ARC breaks on his or her pcs. But the dangerous auditor is neurotic onthe subject and all his or her auditing is oriented around the necessity to avoid data for fear ofdiscovering something unpleasant. As auditing is based on finding data, such an auditorretrogresses a case rather than improves it. Such an auditor’s own case moves slowly also asthey fear to discover something unpleasant or frightening in the bank.Today, the increased power of auditing makes this factor far more important than it everwas before. Old processes could be done with minimal gain but without harm by such anauditor. Today, the factor of fear-of-discovery in an auditor makes that auditor extremelydangerous to a pc.In Prepchecking, this becomes obvious when an auditor will not actually clean up a chainand skids over withholds, thus “completing” the case by leaving dozens of missed withholdsand an accordingly miserable pc.In Routine 3D Criss Cross this becomes obvious when the auditor takes days and weeks"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"to find an item, then finds one that won’t check out. An item every three sessions of two hourseach is a low average for 3D Criss Cross. An item a week is suspect. An item a month isobviously the average of an auditor who will not find out and is dangerous. The auditor whouses out-rudiments always to avoid doing 3D Criss Cross is a flagrant example of a no-discovery-please auditor.In the CCHs, the dangerous auditor is narrowed down to prevention of executing theauditing command. This, indeed, is the only way an auditor can make the CCHs fail. In any ofthe CCHs, the commands and drills are so obvious that only the prevention of execution canaccomplish not-finding-out. The dangerous auditor is never satisfied the pc has executed thecommand. Such an auditor can be seen to move the pc’s hand on the wall after the pc has infact touched the wall. Or the pc is made to do a motion over and over which is already welldone. Or the pc is run only on processes that are flat and is halted on processes that are stillchanging.The pc is never permitted to reveal anything by the dangerous auditor. And so “auditing”fails.The remedies for the dangerous auditor, by class of process, are:Class I—Repetitive Process, run in sequenceREVELATION PROCESS X1What could you confront?What would you permit another to reveal?What might another confront?What might another permit you to reveal?What would you rather not confront?What would you rather not have another reveal?What might another hate to confront?What might another object to your revealing?What should be confronted?What shouldn’t anyone ever have to confront?(Note: This process is subject to refinement and other processes on the same subject willbe released.)Class II—Prepchecking Zero QuestionHave you ever prevented another from perceiving something? (Other such Zero Questionsare possible on the theme of fear-of-discovery.)CCHs should be used if tone arm action during any Prepchecking is less than 3/4 of adivision shift per hour.Class III—Routine 3D Criss CrossFind Line Items as follows:Who or What would be afraid to find out? (then get oppterm of resulting item)Who or What would prevent a discovery? (then oppterm it)"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Who or What would startle someone? (then oppterm it)Who or What would be unsafe for you to reveal? (then oppterm it)Who or What would be dangerous for another to reveal?

The CCHs do a remarkable job in making a good auditor for variousreasons. The first CCH (Op Pro by Dup) was invented exclusively to make good auditors. TheCCHs 1 to 4 are run each one in turn, only so long as they produce change and no longer,before going on to the next. When is a CCH flat so that one can go on to the next CCH? Whenthree complete cycles of the CCH have a uniform comm lag it can be left. My advice instraightening out or improving any auditor is to first flatten the CCHs 1 to 4, and then flatteningall in one run Op Pro by Dup. This would be regardless of the length of time the auditor hadbeen auditing in Dianetics and Scientology. Then I would do the Class II and Class IIIprocesses above, preferably doing the Class III items first, then the Class II so it could gowhole track, or doing the Class II, then the Class III and then the Class II again.----------------SUMMARYFollowing out any part of this programme in any organization, in the field and on anytraining course will vastly improve the results of auditing and enormously diminish auditingfailures.

They have more trouble with creating than thinking andconcepts are more in kind with confronting than with creating. Making a pc invent answers is,of course, right on his worst button. Therefore Concept Help goes a long ways on a case. It isquite unlimited, no matter what form is run, so long as some attention is paid to flow direction.(A flow run too long in one direction gives anaten—unconsciousness, remember?)ALTERNATE CONFRONTConcept Help, however, has the liability of making things “muggy” at times because ofits indefiniteness.Aside from create, the primary button that is awry (but which cannot be directly attackedwithout often overshooting the case or involving it in heavy bank reaction), the next thingsmechanically wrong with a pc would be unconsciousness and confusion. Help, of course, isthe primary point of association and identification and is WHY things go wrong with a pc. Buta scale of WHAT is right with a pc in descending order of importance would be, as above: Creativeness"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":" Consciousness Order Controland these would be flanked by the things wrong with these items which make them decline:Create—IrresponsibilityConsciousness—Refusal to confrontOrder—Unwillingness to bring orderControl—Lack of control.Help fits in somewhat on this order. One creates to help (and fails). One goesunconscious to help or makes another unconscious to help him/her (and fails). One seesdifficulty for others in too much order, seeing that two systems of order clash, and lets downhis to help.One conceives that control is bad and ceases to control and resists control to help others.These are all wrong helps, apparently, and when done, bring about aberration.Aberration consists, evidently, of wrong-way assistance as follows:Optimum Condition -----> Response -----> Resulting ConditionCreativeness -----> Irresponsibility -----> Disowned CreationsConsciousness -----> Non-Confront -----> UnconsciousnessOrderliness -----> Unwilling conflict -----> ConfusionAbility to Control -----> Consequence of control -----> Mis-control.Confront is a remedy for the consequences of the first three conditions and alsocommunication. An auditing session itself by its TR mechanics, improves control andcommunication. Therefore Confront in one form or another is needed in routine sessions.Havingness is an objective and somewhat obscure method of confronting and using it aswe do objectively, it is a specialized form of confronting, possibly its best form, objective orsubjective, even though a series of subjective havingness in Washington in 1955 tended toshow that profile gains were not made by subjective confront, a conclusion still subject tofurther checking.Confront straightens out any “mugginess” churned up by Concept Help. No vast tonearm improvements should be expected from Alternate Confront, but even if it doesn’t workwell, like havingness, as a primary process, it has very good uses. Alternate Confront gives usa stabilizing tool. Pc feels weird = run Alternate Confront. He’ll feel saner. Following thissubjective process with the best objective process, havingness, we achieve stability for thegains reached by a help process.As a comment, beingness is more involved with havingness than with confront.Confront, on short test, can be run lop-sided, and does disturb the tone arm. “Whatwould you rather not confront?” run all by itself in one pc (a BMA type test series!) did verywell. “What can you confront?” of course did very well. Alternate Confront has enough wrongwith it to be poor as a process for getting gains but wonderful as a process for stabilizing acase. I’ll run some more tests on Negative Confront and let you know. But it is a fluke. Bytheory it is improbable as it is a cousin to the no-good “What could you go out ofcommunication with?” But “What could you withhold?” is the greatest IQ raiser known! And itworks. So perhaps Negative Confront, “What would you rather not confront?”, will work too.Of course it’s a fundamental button. All unconsciousness, stupidity, forgetfulness and enforcedbeingness result from problems in confronting."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"IDENTIFICATIONA=A=A=A is as true today as it ever was. The inability to differentiate is, of course, adecline in awareness. Identifying Joe with Bill or Rocks with Smoke is loony.This is identification, a word that is amusing semantically, as its exact opposite,“Identify”, is its cure, but is the same word!Association of things or thoughts into classes is considered all right and may even benecessary to “learn” things. But this is the middle ground, already half way to lazy thinking.Help, as assistance, is an identification of mutual interest in survival. Thus we have (1)possible confusion of beingness and (2) continuation. This makes help ripe for trouble. Whenone fails to help he keeps on helping! No matter how. He does keep on helping what he hasfailed to help. One of many mechanisms is to keep the scene in mock-up.Help is a fundamental necessity, it appears, to every person. But it is dynamite when itgoes wrong.As a symptom of its continuance (survival factor—see Book ONE) pcs running helpreadily get the idea that help on some terminal “will never flatten” even though it is flatteningnicely!To handle this as a special item, one can run the confront part of a session with“Continuous Confront”, the Alternate form of which is:(a) “What could you continue to confront?”(b) “What would you rather not continue to confront?”The positive form (a) can be run alone for case gain. And I am going to test the negativeform (b) as a single run to see if it can be “gotten away with”. In theory, as all anaten isunwillingness to confront and as all help is continuous survival, form (b), NegativeContinuous Confront, should do marvels for IQ and may become the proper companion forhelp processes if the session is ended with havingness.At the present moment auditing routine is: Pre-session Model Session Help Processes Alternate Confront Havingnessall in every session.

This process is not mixed with other processes, it is not part of any StandardOperating Procedure. It is not part of anything you would do ordinarily. It doesn’t particularlyapply to one case level or another case level. It is an independent process which in itself is verysimple to administer.The formula of this process is: All the definitions and Axioms, arrangements and scalesof Scientology should be used in such a way as to bring about a greater tolerance of suchviewpoints on the part of the preclear. That means that any scale there is, any arrangement offundamentals in thinkingness, beingness, could be so given in a straightwire process that itwould bring about a higher state of tolerance on the part of the preclear.To make this more intelligible you should understand what a great many preclears aredoing, and why an auditor occasionally has trouble with one preclear more than another. Agreat many preclears are being processed solely and entirely because they are unable to bringthemselves to tolerate an enormous number of viewpoints, and being unable to tolerate theseviewpoints they desire processing so that they can fall away from them and not have to observethem, and the auditor is auditing somebody who is in full retreat, and Scientology is beingasked to aid and abet the retreat by, for instance, taking the charge off an engram. The auditorat the same time, if he does this, gives the preclear something in the way of a change ofviewpoint in that he erases something so that the preclear doesn’t have to view it any more.Well, as you can see, this is a weak direction. What the auditor then is doing is to somedegree holding in question the ability of the preclear to tolerate viewpoints. Time itself mayvery well be caused by an intolerance of past viewpoints -- a person doesn’t want viewpoints inthe past, and so at a uniform rate he abandons past viewpoints, and when he no longer isfollowing this uniform rate but is abandoning them faster than the uniform rate, he starts to jamup in terms of time, and becomes obsessed about time, becomes very hectic, begins to rushtime, push hard against the events of the day, feels that he doesn’t have enough time toaccomplish everything he is supposed to accomplish, and this falls off on a very rapid curve toa point where an individual will simply sit around idle, fully cognizant of the fact that hedoesn’t have enough time to do anything. And so doesn’t do anything, but knows he shouldbe doing something but can’t do anything because he doesn’t have enough time. This is idiocyitself, but is the state in which you find a very great many people.Time is the single arbitrary entered into life and is well worth investigating on the partof an auditor. An unwillingness to tolerate viewpoints will cause a jam in time. The fewerviewpoints which an individual will tolerate, the greater his occlusion and the worse his generalstate of beingness is. As I said, an auditor can remedy this in various ways. He can eraselocks, secondaries and engrams (Lock, Secondary, Engram: A lock is a mental image picture ofa non-painful but disturbing experience the person has experienced and which depends for itsforce on an earlier secondary and engram which the experience has restimulated. A secondaryis a mental image picture containing misemotion [encysted grief, anger, apathy, etc.] and a realor imagined loss. These contain no physical pain -- they are moments of shock and stress anddepending for their force on earlier engrams which have been restimulated by the circumstancesof the secondary. An engram is a mental picture of an experience containing pain,unconsciousness, and a real or fancied threat to survival; it is a recording in the reactive mind ofsomething which actually happened to an individual in the past and which contained pain andunconsciousness, both of which are recorded in the mental image picture called an engram).And by erasing these, he can make it possible for the individual to “tolerate the view”, as hefinds it in his own bank. Or, an individual can be so processed, as in exteriorization, that he"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"can be caused to go around and look at various things and find out that they are not so bad.Now, let’s just take the mean between these two, and realize that a person who doesn’texteriorize is a person who does not want an exteriorized viewpoint. He does not feel he cantolerate an exteriorized viewpoint. He may have many reasons for this and one of the mainreasons he will give is the consideration that someone may steal his body. In other words hereyou have a tremendously valuable viewpoint which he’s likely to lose if he exteriorizes.Viewpoints then must be scarce, viewpoints are all obviously too valuable to be used. And thiscomes about by viewpoints becoming intolerable.Let’s take somebody standing and watching his family being butchered by soldiers orsomething of this sort, Indians or other wild people. He would go along afterwards sointolerant of this viewpoint that he would fixate on it. It’s the fact that he refuses to tolerate theviewpoint which makes him fixate on it. Now the reason for this lies in the various Agree-Disagree scales in the Philadelphia Doctorate Course lectures -- the fact that if you wantanything, in this universe, you can’t have it, and that if you don’t want it, you’re going to getit. This is an inversion, and when this inversion comes about, an individual finds himselfoverwhelmed each time on whatever his own determinism is. If he starts to desire somethinghe will find out immediately that he can’t have it. Actually, he himself will take steps to makesure that he can’t have it.When he wants something to flow in, it flows out, when he wants something to flowout, it flows in. There is nothing more pathetic, for instance, than watching a psychotic try togive up any material object -- trying to make them hand over or give up, or throw away onepossession, such as an old Kleenex, almost anything -- just try to make them give it up. No,no, they just won’t do it. They clutch it to them and I swear that if you handed them an adder,wide-mouthed and fully fanged, they would clutch it to their bosom. Anything that comes inthey immediately seize and that’s that.Now you as an auditor, every time you are trying to get someone to give up something,are asking them to give up a compulsive viewpoint. You will see that every time you asksomeone to give up something he is likely to hold it closer.Now there are many processes. There are a great many processes, there are all theStandard Operating Procedures, and in good hands they all work. There’s UniverseProcessing, there’s Advanced Course Procedure, there’s Creative Processing, on and on andon and on, a tremendous number of techniques, which can be applied with good sense topreclears. There are an enormous number of Straightwire processes, there’s old-timeStraightwire. The earliest Straightwire we had, which, by the way, was a marked advance onFreudian analysis, went like this: say we noticed that the preclear is afraid of cats. We wouldsay: “Recall a time when you were afraid of cats”, then: “Recall somebody who was afraid ofcats”, and then: “Find a time when somebody said you were like this person”. That wasapproximately its formula -- just Straightwire, and you sprung apart these valences very gently.However, it required a great deal of good sense on the part of the auditor.An auditor now and then would become a Straightwire expert, and by just askingsearching questions and causing the individual to recall certain things he would bring about agreat deal of relief on the case. Why did the relief take place? The individual has been goingalong in the full belief that he could not tolerate a certain viewpoint and the auditor has comealong and demonstrated to him that that viewpoint was in the past and therefore is tolerable.There, in essence, are the fundamentals of such Straightwire. You get key-outs (Key-out:Release or separation from one’s reactive mind or some portion of it) on this -- the individualcomes up to present time so that he isn’t looking in the past -- assuming a past viewpoint. Thatis a goal of a great many processes, and is quite different from “wipe out the past so he won’thave to look at it or experience it”.We have in Viewpoint Straightwire a very, very, new type of thinking. This is not tobe confused with what we have been doing for all these many years. It hasn’t any connection"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"with it. It has an entirely different goal from that of any process you’ve ever done on apreclear. It takes the benefit of exteriorization, and reduces it to Straightwire. We get anindividual to race around the universe to look at things observe things, experience things.That’s a Grand Tour (Grand Tour: The process R1-9, in The Creation of Human Ability by L.Ron Hubbard.) -- that sort of drill -- and here we reduce it right down to a Straightwire whichis done interiorized or exteriorized.One simply goes on the basis that the preclear is in the state he’s in because he’s nottolerating many viewpoints, and the entire goal of the process is to bring him to a point wherehe will tolerate viewpoints. That’s all there is to the process.The key wording of the process is “you wouldn’t mind”. Why do I announce this assomething important, something new, something that is very useful to you? There are manyvarieties of viewpoint. If we were to take Full Knowingness, and squash it, we would find wewere first getting into space, which would be perception. We have to perceive to know. Thisis the level of Lookingness. Now if we condense that we find out that we have to get Emote toknow. A person has to emote. We squash perception, and we go into Emotion to know.Now, if we squash down and condense even further, we get Effortingness, and if we condenseEffort even further, we get Thinkingness, and if we condense and package Thinkingness, weget Symbols. As an example of this, what is a Word but a package of thought, and if we wereto condense Symbols, we would get actually the wider definition of the symbol -- we wouldget animals. You are probably thinking of it in terms of a viewpoint of a body, if you don’t seethat clearly, but the definition of a symbol is a mass with meaning, which is mobile. That is asymbol and of course that is an animal, too. An animal has certain form which gives himcertain meaning and he is mobile, and if you see that the Thinkingness condenses, then, intoform, you will understand art. Just in so many words, a very simple thing.We have Thinkingness condensing into Symbolizingness, ideas condensing intoactually solid objects, and when these are mobile, we have symbols, and when these symbolsare observed, they are found to wind themselves up with other symbols and take an associate,they associate with one and another, and take things from one and another, and you getEatingness. That’s a big, big band we’re covering in there, that’s the whole business of: “Ihave an idea about a form in this space and matter, and I’m going to get it all together, and I’mgoing to make this all mass together.” Well, the second we’ve done that, something has beencreated. Now don’t expect that thing which has been created to create anything. This is a thingwhich isn’t creating, and therefore must subsist on an interchange of energy, and we get eating.Now we take eating and condense it down, that is to say, let’s make food scarce, and let’smake it very hard to get, and we get a condensation which completely escapes time itself, andyou go outside of time and you get Sexingness.That is to say that outside of present time, you get future time, which is sex.An individual is right straight off the time track between Eating and Sex, and there’snothing will float on a time track like a sexual engram. They just float all over the time track.They don’t nail down at all. They are very mobile. The individual, in Eatingness, starts toslide out of present time by this token alone, and people are terribly worried about how are theygoing to eat tomorrow, and when they have reduced this down to the reductio ad gastronomyyou get to a point where “I can’t solve this problem of eating tomorrow, therefore I’d better justleave it all up to somebody else,” and slide in on the genetic protoplasm line and go up the linea little bit, and get another form, and be that.That’s the best way to solve eating -- just to live tomorrow and maybe tomorrow therewill be more food.A very readily available test will demonstrate this. Notice those countries of the worldwhich breed faster and harder than other countries of the world. We find India and Chinadoing this. And we find that these are two countries which have extreme, chronic foodscarcity. Now we can say, well look, they have the greatest food scarcity because they keep"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"breeding people, and that eats up all their food. No, it’s the other way around. They eat up alltheir food, and so they breed like mad. This can be tested also with animals. If you starve ananimal, an animal will procreate faster. If you were, for instance, to give any family of homosapiens a carbohydrate diet with a very, very low protein content -- by the way this would be,you’d say, terribly unconducive to the production of estrogen, androgen. It’s proven to bevery unproductive of it -- but if you give them a high carbohydrate, very low protein diet, thenext thing you know they’ll start to get very anxious about breeding. That’s because you’retelling them in essence right where they can understand it in their stomachs that they are unableto obtain enough food today, and so must eat tomorrow. Therefore you get countries of theWestern hemisphere, which are very heavily starch dieted, and you find out that these countriesare the most anxious about breeding and about tomorrow. There is no reason to stand aroundand prove this for hours. It’s just the Know-to-Sex scale. Condensed knowingness.“I don’t know how I’m going to get along today therefore I’d better breed like mad andappear tomorrow and maybe I’ll know then,” is about the last ditch. Well, if you notice this,death must come, in this band, above sex. A person presupposes his own death to indulge inthe protoplasm line. And so we get people like Schopenhauer and The Will and the Ideaclosely associating sex and death, and we get certain animals and insects, which so closelyassociate sex and death that they have accomplished death when they have accomplished sex.Fear Merchants (Fear Merchants: The aberrative personality. This was an early description ofwhat is known as a Suppressive Person, or the Anti-Social Personality) like to tell you aboutthe black widow spider. I don’t know why the black widow spider is such an attractive beastto some people, but it is apparently so. I noticed that it exists mainly in California -- SouthernCalifornia. Lots of black widow spiders down there, and most California girls, if you get intoany kind of discussion on the second dynamic at all, will sooner or later inform you that thefemale black widow spider eats its mate after consummation of the sexual act. Anyway, themain thing here is that actually when you go down this scale, although it doesn’t belong on thescale, you’ll find death just before sex. Know, Look, Emote, Effort, Think, Symbol, Eat,Death, Sex. Death doesn’t belong there, but this shows you where this mechanism comes in.Now, beingness might also be on this scale somewhere. Beingness might be on thisscale, and if it were, you would have a tendency to look for it up toward the top, but the truthof the matter is, it’s all up and down the scale, and there is no beingness like that beingness atSymbols. You find the human race having been made into a form -- a mass, meaning,mobility. A mass with meaning which is mobile -- that’s a body, that’s a word in a dictionary,that’s a flag above a building, it can be moved around and it has meaning. You’ll find thathuman beings indulge very, very heavily in being symbols. Well, you’ll find people aroundbeing sexual objects too. So that this scale sort of interlocks on beingness. A fellow could besome effort -- and actually we don’t find beingness at the top of the scale at all, we find it downthere pretty low on the scale, so when an individual has gotten to a point where he has to besomething, he’s practically at bottom. A further examination would have to put beingness atleast at Symbols. A person becomes things at that level, and you will frequently find apreclear mainly being his name.Looking further, we find that there are different kinds of viewpoints. There issomething you might call a know-point. That would be senior to a viewpoint. An individualwould not have dependency on space or mass or anything else. He’d simply know where hewas. There would be a viewpoint, which is a perception point, which would consist of look,and smell, and talk, and hear, and all sorts of things could be thrown in under this category,viewpoint. Ordinarily we simply mean at that level of the scale, looking, but you can throw allthe rest of the perceptions in at that level of the scale.Going down a little bit from there we get something we could call an emotion-point. Itwould be that point from which a person emotes, and at which he emoted, and then therewould be something else called an effort-point, and the effort-point would be that area fromwhich a person exerted effort, and that area into which that person received effort. And as wewent down a little bit from that, we’d find we had a thinking-point, and there of course we getthe “figure-figure-figure”. The person is thinking there, not looking. And if we go down a"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"little bit further than this from a thinking-point, we get a symbol-point, and there, reallyproperly, we get words. And below that we get an eating-point, and below that we get a sex-point.If you considered each one of these points below known as an effort to make space, agreat deal of human behavior would make sense. Let’s take an individual who is simply tryingto make space with words. Words don’t make good space. So an individual who tries to makespace with words sooner or later gets into bad condition. Much lower than that would be aperson who is trying to make space with eating. Of course that’s inverted, isn’t it? And thenthere’s the person who is trying to make space with sex, and that is really inverted. That goesboth ways from the middle. The lowest part of the eating scale is excreta and urine. Peoplewill try and make space with that. Dogs, for instance, are always trying to make space thatway.There are people who are trying to make space with effort. This is the use of force, thisis Ghengis Khan riding out and slaughtering villages. He’s trying to make space. You noticethat the space had to exist before he could ride out any place.And we go up a little higher, and maybe you’ve known somebody who’s tried to makespace with emotion. And we go up a little higher and we get to the way you do make spacewhich is by looking. And actually you get to make space by knowing. If you just knew therewas some space, there would be some space, and that would be all there was to that. Just thatsimple. That’s an effective way to go about it, and looking is another effective way to go aboutit, and when we get down to emotion, that is getting ineffective. People who try to make spacewith emotion don’t get very far. That’s literally, actually, figuratively, or any other way youwant to look at it. It’s too condensed, and it kicks back. Yet that is above the individual whomakes space by working hard or by pushing hard or by exerting force.In other words we see that there is quite a little bit of band there, at effort, and you’llsee that they get less far than people who try to make space with emotion. And now we getinto the thinking band, and people who try to make space with thinking, which is about themost unworkable activity that anybody could engage in.When we get down to making space with symbols, here is a nation trying to fly its flagover all the world, which doesn’t make much space, and then we go into eating, and anindividual trying to make space by offering things to be eaten. A cattleman, for instance, isdoing this. He’s making space with cattle. And a fat man is trying to make space with food,and so on. Now when we get down into sex, of course, if an individual could breed fastenough and far enough he would wind up with all sorts of space, he thinks. Of course, hewinds up with no space. This is the most condensed activity you can get into: sex. You cansee somebody’s bank all short-circuited -- jammed on sex. But remember, we are looking at agradient scale that runs from Sexingness right on up through the levels to Knowingness.And if anybody comes along and tells you that sex is the only aberration, please laugh.You could answer, Yes, that was how we entered the problem, we found nut that people wereloopy on the subject of sex. So then we examined the problem further, and having examinedthe problem for many years, it was discovered that sex was part of a gradient scale of humanexperience which is basically an activity of trying to make space, and people try to make spacein various ways. And when they get down too low on the scale they are abandoning present-time life and at that point they have sunk to the level of Sexingness. They are trying in this wayto get some future up there on the track and it is a chaos. It is an attempt to derive experiencefrom external sources, and to pull experience in.Operation at the level of Sexingness is really a cave-in.When you examine this band and its inversions up and down the scale you see that itgives us an enormous number of Straightwire questions."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The basic question would reduce this first from the stand-point of viewpoint of thewhole scale, and that is where you catch your preclear most ably. You just take viewpoint ofthe scale, viewpoint of sex, viewpoint of effort, and so forth.The systematic questions that go into this line would be as follows: you ask thepreclear to give:“Something you wouldn’t mind knowing.”“Something you wouldn’t mind looking at.”“An emotion you wouldn’t mind observing.”“Some effort you wouldn’t mind observing.”“Some thinking which you wouldn’t mind observing.”“Some symbols which you wouldn’t mind seeing.”“Some eating which you wouldn’t mind inspecting.”“Some sex which you wouldn’t mind looking at.”Just as mildly and quietly as that.

It derives from a deteriorated willingness to duplicate. It isthe law of physics of Interaction—for every action there is an equal and contrary reaction.“Love thy neighbour”, when it is no longer a willingness, is enforced by the theory of O-W. “Love thy neighbour” can exist only when help, control and communication are high.When all these go, then O-W comes into vogue as a method of enforcing peace.O-W is a theory which sets in when aberration sets in. It is not a high natural law. It isjunior to the various laws of Communication, Control and Help.O-W can occur only when help has failed. Help is a co-joining of vectors of life. Whentwo beings who have joined forces to help fail each other, only then does O-W come intoexistence.The forces of two beings cannot come into dispute until after they have first joined. Thusthere is no war like that seen between brothers or husband and wife.The cycle is this: INDEPENDENT BEINGS COMMUNICATION MIS-COMMUNICATION CONTROL MIS-CONTROL HELP FAILED HELP OVERTS AND WITHHOLDS OVERTS AND WITHHOLDS BY TRANSFER WORRYING OTHERS WORRYING ABOUT OTHERS BEING CRITICAL BEING CRITICAL OF SELFBasically, O-W is an effort to regain the status of independent being without takingresponsibility for any of the intervening steps.The reason we run O-Ws is that most pcs are on O-W by Transfer, which is to say, whenthey kick George in the head they get a headache themselves. This makes them think they areGeorge. We use O-W since it explains phenomena found at a low humanoid level. We do notuse it because it is a senior governing law of the universe.When Help comes up, O-W as a mechanism drops out. We could run a full case, it wouldappear, with Help. However, in practice it is better to run lots of O-W with failed help as theycomplement each other and move the case faster. By running O-W we disclose many new"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"failed helps. Why? Look at the cycle above and see that O-W occurs only when Help hasfailed.Similarly, on the same cycle we see that worry undercuts O-W. But if it is run, it shouldbe worked with O-W. The worry cure has commands as follows:Get the idea of worrying something. Get the idea of not worrying something. Get the ideaof something being worrisome.People, animals, things can be used in place of “something”. The process, going rapidlyup toward failed help, is a bit limited and should be run with another process of the type of“Get the idea of attacking something” “Get the idea of not attacking something” to keep itgoing. The worry process bogs if run too long just by itself. It is a very valuable process as itexplains many reactions and undercuts many cases. Worrying something is close to the lowestlevel of overt. It is the lowest effort to individuate.But just as worry is not a way of life nor an answer to all of life, neither is the O-Wmechanism an end-all law.Many cases are not up to recognizing their overts. They will also have trouble recognizingtheir failures to help. Usually, then, they can recognize being worried or worrying people andthinking unkind thoughts and even attacking things.Failed help also lies as a harmonic below O-W and so runs on any case if assisted with O-W as in Formula 13 or assisted with the Worry Process as above.Worrying people is almost a way of life for the juvenile, just as O-W is with a criminal.People who feel childish or act that way are stuck in the violent motion of childhood andworrying others. Many pcs use their processing just to worry the auditor. Worry is the mosteasily dramatized O-W.O-W, whether as worry or being critical (unkind thoughts), is the result of failure to help.O-W is the reason one gets another’s valence. O-W is why pcs have somatics. But O-W is nota high order law.You will not always have to be careful not to bump Joe. It would be a horrible universeindeed if O-W was its senior law, for one could then never do anything.Fortunately, it drops out, both as a governing law and a necessity in life.  L.

For here is our roughestcase to audit, as well as our roughest auditor.Every case has a little of “afraid to find out”. So you may have taken HCO Bulletin ofMarch 8, 1962, more personally than you should have. BUT everyone’s auditing can beimproved, even mine, and adding a full willingness to find out to one’s other auditing qualitieswill certainly improve one’s auditing ability. Here probably is the only real case difference Ihave had. My own “afraid to find out” is minimal and so I had no reality on it as a broadly helddifficulty. Where I ran into it was in trying to account for differences amongst students and inauditors who sought to audit me. Some could, some couldn’t. And this was odd because myability to as-is bank is great, therefore I should be easy to audit. But some could audit me andsome couldn’t. Two different auditors found me reacting as two different pcs. Therefore theremust have been another factor. It was my study of this and my effort to understand “badauditing” on myself as a pc that gave us the primary lead in. I made a very careful analysis ofwhat the auditor was doing who couldn’t or wouldn’t audit me, an easy pc. The answer, aftermany tries and much study of students, finally came down, crash, to the “afraid to find out”phenomena. Thus my first paper on this (HCO Bulletin of March 8, 1962) enters the problemas a problem of auditing skill.THE ROUGH PCThe characteristic of the rough pc is not a pc’s tendency to ARC Break and scream, as wehave tended to believe, but something much more subtle.The first observation of this must be credited to John Sanborn, Phoenix, 1954, whoremarked to me in an auditor’s conference, “Well, I don’t know. I don’t think this pc is gettingon (the one he was staff auditing). I keep waiting for him to say, ‘Well, what do you know!’ or‘Gosh!’ or something like that and he just grinds on and on. I guess you’d call it ‘Nocognition’ or something.” John, with his slow, funny drawl, had put his finger on somethinghard.The pc who makes no gain is the pc who will not as-is. Who will not confront. Who canbe audited forever without cogniting on anything.The fulminating or dramatizing pc may or may not be a tough pc. The animalpsychologist has made this error. The agitated person is always to blame, never the quiet one.But the quiet one is quite often the much rougher case.The person whose “thought has no effect on his or her bank” has been remarked on by"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"me for years. And now we have that person. This person is so afraid to find out that he or shewill not permit anything to appear and therefore nothing will as-is? therefore, no cognition!The grind case, the audit forever case, is an afraid to find out case.We need a new word. We have withholds, meaning an unwillingness to disclose pastaction. We should probably call the opposite of a withhold, a “suppressor”. A “suppressor”would be the impulse to forbid revelation in another. This of course, being an overt, reacts onone’s own case as an impulse to keep oneself from finding out anything from the bank, and ofcourse suppresses as well the release of one’s own withholds, so it is more fundamental than awithhold. A “suppressor” is often considered “social conduct” in so far as one prevents thingsfrom being revealed which might embarrass or frighten others.In all cases a suppressor leads to suppression of memory and environment. It issuppression that is mainly overcome when you run havingness on a pc. The pc is willing to letthings appear in the room (or to some degree becomes less unwilling to perceive them). Theone-command insanity eradicator, “Look around here and find something that is really real toyou” (that sometimes made an insane person sane on one command), brought the person todischarge all danger from one item and let it reveal itself. Now, for any case, the finding of thesuppressor mechanism again opens wider doors for havingness processes. “Look around hereand find something you would permit to appear” would be a basic havingness process usingthe suppressor mechanism.Thus we have a new, broad tool, even more important in half the cases than withholds.Half the cases will run most rapidly on withholds, the other half most rapidly onsuppressors. All cases will run somewhat on withholds and somewhat on suppressors, for allcases have both withholds and suppressors.Withholds have been known about since the year one, suppressors have been whollymissing as a pat mechanism. Thus we are on very new and virgin search ground.----------------Additionally adding to the data in HCO Bulletin of March 8, 1962, another symptom of adangerous auditor would be (o) one who Qs and As with a pc and never faces up to the basicquestion asked but slides off of it as the pc avoids it and also avoids it as an auditor. Alldangerous Q and A is that action of the auditor which corresponds to the pc’s avoidance of ahot subject or item. If the pc seeks to avoid by sliding off, the auditor, in his questions, alsoslides off. Also, the auditor invites the pc to avoid by asking irrelevant questions that lead thepc off a hot subject.Also add (p) who fails to direct the pc’s attention. The pc wants to cut and run, theauditor lets the pc run.Also add (q) who lets the pc end processes or sessions on the pc’s own volition.Also add (r) who will only run processes chosen by the pc.Also add (s) who gets no somatics during processing.Also add (t) who is a Black Five.The common denominator of the dangerous auditor is “action which will forestall therevelation of any data”.Because the auditor is terrified of finding out anything, the whole concentration of theauditor is occupied with the suppression of anything a process may reveal."},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"Some auditors suppress only one type of person or case and audit others passably.Husbands as auditors tend more to fear what their wives may reveal to them and wives asauditors tend to suppress more what their husbands may reveal to them.

No. 146PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR’S BULLETINThe Oldest Continuous Publication in Dianetics and ScientologyFrom L. RON HUBBARDVia Hubbard Communications Office37 Fitzroy Street, London W.1_____________________________________________________________________15 October 1958PROCEDURE CCH(This lecture is a final summing up of the previous CCH PABs [interrupted at PAB No. 138] andshould be read after those have been digested. It was given by L. Ron Hubbard to the HGC staffauditors in Washington, D.C. on 23 August 1957.Thinkingness in general should not be suspected to be under anybody’s control. It isprobably more under the auditor’s control than it is under the preclear’s.When I say or ask “Is the preclear’s thinkingness under control?” I want you tounderstand that it is less under the preclear’s control at any time than under the auditor’s. Theauditor can certainly control the preclear’s thinkingness better than the preclear can. But beforeyou can do this you must first get the preclear’s body and attention under control.A condition to running Trio is: Is the person and attention under your control? To assumethat the power of choice is also under the preclear’s control—much less his thinkingness—is,of course, completely wrong.This condition then moves Trio way up on the present scale of processes. In order to givethe preclear some havingness after CCH 0 to 5 has been flattened, I have developed anundercut to Trio.Trio is a directive process and should be prefaced by “Get the idea of having thatclock.” “Get the idea of having that picture (indicated picture on the wall),”etc. That’s highly directive and would keep thinkingness of a rough case under control.The second version is: “Get the idea that it is all right to permit that (indicatedobject) to continue.” It is also just an indicating process.The third section of this trio is the clincher: “Get the idea of making that(indicated object) disappear.” One runs “disappear” instead of “dispense with” or “not-know.”Small objects are much easier for the preclear to make disappear than large ones. Youhave not told him to make it disappear but only to “get the idea of making it disappear.”Preclears usually literally interpret you and try like mad to make it disappear—and it usuallydoes for a short time.I have solved the enigma of exteriorization. Why doesn’t a preclear exteriorize easily andstay exteriorized? We ask the accompanying question: Why does a preclear get sick when oneasks him to conceive a static? Obviously we would have to get somebody to conceive a staticbefore he could himself stay comfortably outside his body’s head."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The answer to this problem is contained in the process “Recall a moment of loss.”Loss prevents the preclear from conceiving a static. He associates a static with loss. He says,“All right, if there is nothing there I’ve lost it,” or “I’ve lost something there, therefore I’dbetter not conceive a static.”Conceiving a static is therefore painful. The truth of the matter is whenever he lostanything, something disappeared. All right. The funny part of it is that he never noticed that hedidn’t lose totally every time. He still had other objects. He lost his tie pin, but he still has histie. He’s still got the floor, the room, this universe, space, etc., but he never realizes this inthese instances and that is why we run this process “Recall a moment of loss” to accustomsomebody to conceiving a static very directly on loss and to get him to exteriorize.An individual cannot conceive a static if he associates static with loss—if the loss ispainful. So we have to cure him of the painfulness of loss, consideration of, before we canexteriorize him easily.We do this by going back to automaticity. The universe has been taking things away fromhim. It has become an automaticity, and we find that the universe has an automaticity known astime and time itself is a consecutive series of losses. So we have to cure the preclear of lossesbefore we can get him to appreciate time, otherwise he would be so afraid of losing it that he’dstick himself on the track and we get the “stuck on the track” phenomenon.The process “Recall a moment of loss” aimed at this, but the third command of ControlTrio (as this series of processes had better be called), “Get the idea of making that(indicated object) disappear,” handles it very well. This gets the preclear to take over theautomaticity of all of the losses which he has unwillingly experienced.The universe has been taking the things away from him, and just spotting objects andgetting the idea that they are going to disappear or are disappearing takes over the automaticityof losses, and he becomes accustomed to it after a while.All of the invisible masses that preclears have around them are actually simply symptomsof mass—loss, mass—loss. When an individual has no visio the only thing that he is lookingat is a “stuck” loss. He is looking at the nothingness of something that was there.So one takes over that automaticity with the third command of Control Trio and onetherefore has a very highly directional, workable set of processes.Each part of that Trio would be run relatively flat and go on to the next part, and I wouldsay that one would run each part certainly not a hundred commands each and the auditor shouldendeavor to stay in that order of magnitude and just run it round and round.Take somebody with glasses, for example. His eyesight will do more tricks in less timeon this third command of Control Trio than one can imagine. Things will go black. Well, whydo things go black? Blackness makes things disappear and one takes over the automaticity ofblackness to make things disappear. Night grabs, the way of the universe, once in every 24hours on earth here. This is the process we have been looking for to turn on visio.If you want to turn on sonic with this you would have to go down to a noisy part of townand just run Trio on sound, but you wouldn’t dare run Control Trio on sound if the preclear didnot already have it flat on objects. Visio turns on before sonic.There are many things one could do with this process. People who have anaesthetizedareas in their body—like they have no chest, etc.—do weird things during this process.I wanted to tell you particularly about this particular process because it is a specific andwill be found to be very useful to you. We had to find out if one version of this would run"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"without killing a preclear and that is “Recall a moment of loss.” Actually “Recall a moment ofloss” should act as a havingness process because it as-ises all of the lost points on the track andit should be a havingness process all by itself; but we didn’t want to be so bold as to run it withno havingness.(Until I find out differently, this Control Trio and “Recall a moment of loss” are making abid for our chief exteriorization processes.)Now here is a process which is based on our old “Recall a secret.” The version isentirely straight wire. The auditor explains to the preclear that he is not looking for hidden datato evaluate it. He is only asking the preclear to look at the data. He then makes a list ofvalences, paying great attention to those the preclear considers “unimportant” or is very slow todivulge. Then the auditor takes this list and runs repetitive straight wire ( 1951 ) as follows:“Think of something you might withhold from (valence).”The auditor repeats this question over and over until no communication lag is present. Henever says “something else you might withhold from valence” because the auditor wants thepreclear to think of some of these many times.Before selecting another valence the auditor runs a little Locational or Trio. He then takesthe next valence the same way. The list is covered once and then the same list is covered again.The object is speed. Cover many people. Given time the auditor can do the same thing on alldynamics.There is a variation. Instead of a valence, body parts may be used. “Think ofsomething you might withhold from that (body part).” Leave sexual parts orobvious psychosomatic difficulties until last. Don’t begin on a withered arm, for example.It is amusing to realize that this process overlords all early psychotherapies, but they,using this effort to locate secrets, thought that divulgence and confession were the therapeuticagents. These have no bearing on workability. Further, early efforts naively thought there wasone secret per case. Actually there are billions. It is easy to get into past lives on this. A basicsecret is that one lived before.Whenever you run “withhold” on a valence you finish up with “can’t have” on thevalence and “have” for the preclear. It flattens off better that way.You will often find that it is more advantageous to run Locational Processing thanProblems of Comparable or Incomparable Magnitude at times. A Problem of ComparableMagnitude is all right, but it is a thinkingness process and on a case that is having an awful lotof trouble with it, it gives them hell to run Locational Processing, but nevertheless it does runout the present time problem, which is most fascinating.Any one of the Rudiments is an excellent process. Two-Way Communication is great anddoes not as-is havingness. You have to keep the reality of two-way comm very high, though,and be willing to interrupt obsessive outflows and silences of the preclear. It is establishing ahigh level of reality. It consists of the auditor feeding experimental data to the preclear to havehim look it over and decide about it one way or the other. You don’t let the preclear in Two-Way Comm as-is everything he knows, thinks, or wants to do.The latest addition to the Rudiments is “Clearing the Auditor.” Actually the crudest wayknown of clearing the auditor is “Who do I remind you of?” “Tell me something youlike about me.” The best way of clearing the auditor we know of is in Training 15, which is“Could I help you?” “How?” “Could you help me?” “How?” “Could I helpanybody else?” “How?” “Could you help anybody else?” “How?” “Do otherpeople ever help other people?” “Do women ever help women?” “Do men everhelp men?” “Do men ever help women?” etc. You beat it to pieces on a big longbracket."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"This goes so far that it becomes a fantastic process in itself. You take father and mothervalences and they are usually quite hot. You can run this on “Help.” This is usually quitenecessary on a case that is going to hang up because the only reason he is sitting there is towaste help.One has to understand that this case is trying to waste help, and it isn’t a matter of “Findthe Auditor” in the Rudiments today, but “Clear the Auditor” and the only point on which he iscleared is “Help”—”Can I help you? Can you help me?”We use Handbook for Preclears to give the preclear some homework at the HubbardGuidance Centers and it has been helping out just to the degree that it does some clarification ongoals and gets the preclear stirred up. It simply stirs up the case so that it will run out.I was running over a phrenological questionnaire, and it said people are never permittedto do anything they want to do and this is the best goal of discipline. I got this tangled out inone way or the other. I got thinking about it from the standpoint— this was about 20 yearsago—of “I wonder if there is anybody around that could articulate with great conciseness whathe would like to do?” And I have found on all hands a failure to articulate was the maindifficulty. A person had the feeling that he wanted to do something and that it would bewonderful, but it was all in a sensory capacity. If he could have been made to articulate this itwould really have been something. And I experimented on it a little bit and we see that today inthe Handbook for Preclears.If you can get a person to articulate in a session anything about the future you have wonthe subject of goals. But it must be in the alignment of this person’s frame of reference. It mustbe aligned with his life—not aligned with something we think he ought to live.So let’s take a look at the clearance of goals. Goals would not be likely to run on a highgenerality. In other words, they are specific, personal and intimate. It is “What do youthink? What do you want? What is aligned to your life?”Let’s look at Goals as a process. One could run Goals for 25 hours with the greatest ofease. One could run the Present Time Problem for 25 hours, and we just had a report of aterrific win here on a preclear who was run on Locational for 25 hours. So it looks as thoughthe Rudiments could be the session.We discover a preclear in the terrible condition of not wanting any auditing, not going anyplace and all of his goals being somebody else’s goals. Two things can be done immediately:Clear the auditor and then run Goals.Goals could be run with two-way comm in this manner. You ask the preclear what he isabsolutely sure would happen in the next couple of minutes, the next hour, a day from now, aweek from now, one month from now and one year from now. We want something that thepreclear is absolutely sure would happen.We are running right there the reverse process of atomic bombs which say “no future—no future—no future.” That is basically what is wrong with a person. Why does he get jammedon the track? It is because of “no future.” He had been denied to a point where his loss was sogreat that he dared not own.I had a case, by the way, which was one of the roughest cases I have ever run into. Heput on the total appearance of being sane—dramatized sanity—and yet the case would makeodd remarks like “I really think people are crazy.” “Well, why do you think people are crazy?”I would say. “Well, because people say they can tell right from wrong and you know there’sno difference.” It was fascinating. He would make odd remarks like this from time to time.One day he made a remark on goals: “Well, it’s really best to tell people that things cannothappen to them because otherwise they might hope they could and then they would be"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"disappointed.”This person was stark, staring mad and had no future of any kind. Five hours just thisone question, “Is there anything going to happen in the remainder of this afternoon?” “Willanything happen the rest of today?” “Is there anything going to occur any place in the world therest of today?” was run on him and his confident answer, with great certainty was, “No. No.No.”Finally we broke through it and I finally got the person to admit that there was someslight possibility that there would be a room here for the rest of the day. That busted the case. Itread from total no-future up.This case was an isolated one as we have had occasionally. Now and then an inspirationalsort of process cracked them through. Well, now we see this process of Goals on the basis offutures and a person without futures cannot have a fancy future called a goal and all a goal is isa fancy future determined by the person. If he has no future at all determined by anybody, thenhe isn’t going to go anywhere from that point and any goal he has is totally unreal.The best way that I know of to clear up a goal is as follows (with two-way comm): “Isthere anything that is going to happen in the next couple of minutes?” We getthis thrashed out until he has got some great big certainty that there will be something a coupleof minutes from now. Then we gradiently move it up and we get certainties at each one of thesestages and levels—regardless of on what.The person knows there is going to be a future there. Now let’s have him put somethingin this future he has now created. He has created a future and has certainty on it. Now let’s putsome desire in the future and we get a goal.“Now what would you like to have happen in the next couple of minutes?”or “What would you like to do in the next couple of minutes, tomorrow, nextweek, etc?” We will get weird things which have no desire in them; they will all be get-rid-of’s, and if you finally plowed him down on it he would get down to the bottom of the ladder,which is “Knock this body off right now.” And when he says, “I would like to get over myfear of darkness, I would like to get over feeling bad every time my mother screams at me,”these aren’t desires. These are run-aways, flinches. These are “Let’s not confront it,” “Let’s getout of the universe; let’s scram,” and the final result is the basic postulate, “If I could just getrid of this body right this instant I would be all right.”So that process doesn’t even vaguely get flat unless there is a real goal like “I’d like tohave a stick of candy.” That is a goal, a real goal.Preclears will modify their goals in some way or another: “Of course, I can’t because Ihave to work and I don’t have any money,” and “yak, yak, yak.” They are modified goals, andas long as they modify them they don’t have a goal because they are making a postulate and theMEST universe is kicking the postulate in on them. So we do this on a gradient scale of time sothat goals become real to them.  L.

These, coming after the confusion ofan overt, of course hang up on the track and tend to stop the pc in time. The overt is theforward motion, the withhold coming after it is the inward motion.While not ranking with the power of the O/W mechanism, there are, however, some veryimportant flows which could be released and which, if released from the bank, could assistSecurity Checking. These are “laudable outflows” and some others.The most important flows can be listed as follows:1. Outflow.2. Restrained Outflow.3. Inflow.4. Restrained Inflow.All ridges and masses develop around these flows.You recognize in 1, Outflow, the overt act, as its most important item. In 2, RestrainedOutflow, you recognize all withholds. In 3, Inflow, we have a less well studied flow and in 4,Restrained Inflow, we have a newcomer to Scientology.In that we have heretofore considered Inflow as Other-Determined it has not seemedaberrative on the basis that all acts that influence a thetan are done by himself.But Inflow and Restrained Inflow can be Self-Determined Actions, as well as Other-Determined and therefore merit study.Thus all four principal flows can be Self-Determined or they can be Other Determined.Thus all four flows can be aberrative.In an effort to speed up Security Checking as class of processes, I am now studying 3.Inflow and 4.

We don’t care about thembeing sequitur; any way you want to break it up, we don’t care.Now you ask a person to describe each one of these dynamics. You are watching an E-Meter for a change in pattern. Therefore, you have to carefully isolate the change of patternbefore you can tell whether or not the pattern’s changed on the E-Meter needle reading. Butmore important than that, you are looking for a dynamic that he makes mistakes on while he istrying to describe it, a dynamic he cannot describe, a dynamic that he won’t even approach, thathe is very leary of, and his statement is confirmed by the E-Meter reading. In other words, youhave got the statement of the pc in this particular analysis or diagnosis for DynamicStraightwire.All right, then, we go all the way through asking for a terminal on these dynamics and wefinally get a repeat. We will ask him for terminals on these dynamics; we’ll get the samedynamic to read again. Now the basic rule which sorts this out is—any dynamic which doesn’tclear by two-way comm has to be run. Simple as that. Any dynamic which doesn’t clear bytwo-way comm has to be run.Don’t run a terminal that is totally unreal to the preclear. Another stable datum whichcomes on top of it is: Never run a terminal that’s sensible. Never. If a terminal belongs on thedynamic you can almost say you’ll get nowhere running it. So, you are looking for terminalsthat they give you for a dynamic which don’t belong on the dynamic at all.Now, if that terminal is real to the pc you will get a tremendous change in the case. If thatterminal is totally unreal to the pc and if it does belong on the dynamic, why you’re not goingto get any change on the case, why run it? Might as well run some other process. It is neither along process nor an invariable process. Given enough skill you could undoubtedly find one ofthese on every case. Given enough skill. But it is limited by auditor skill. Furthermore, it givesauditors a chance to chop up pcs and it gives auditors a chance to write some script.You do not let the pc choose. You have auditors who actually believe that a pc ispermitted power of choice in an auditing session. That one’s a blinker.Where you find pcs out of session, it’s because nobody has trailed down a nuttydynamic.  L.

The whole bulletin applies except Engram Running.There will be a staff Theta Clearing Course, and those auditors who are on staff whohave not been trained by an ACC in Engram Running will have an opportunity to get thattraining; and not too many months will go by before they are up to this, too. So this will applyat that time. Maybe it will have shifted slightly by that time, but I don’t think very much.Now what you are looking at here is the aggregate know-how that was gained andassembled on the 21st American ACC.UNDERCUTTING CASES:Now the undercuts of cases became a vital necessity. This whole ACC was devoted to theR factor plus Engram Running. It was discovered that the thing that keeps individuals fromrunning engrams adequately was their R factor, and when their R factor was very poor theycould not run an engram adequately. Now the funny part of it is that an engram can becontacted and run and, if done persistently and well without ARC breaks, can run the followingScale of Confront. Here is the Scale of Confront, just to refresh your minds:DUB-IN: Lowest scale. This scale could possibly invert, and down below that youmight have a black dub-in. Once you had run blackness, you would find adub-in case. But the scale we are mostly interested in, because that is the onewe most commonly see, begins at the bottom with dub-in, runs up, turnsBLACK. Runs through blackness, turnsINVISIBLE. Runs from invisible toELSEWHERE—a desire to be elsewhere. The way they solve things is elsewhereness.Runs up from elsewhereness toABILITY TO CONFRONT. Runs from confront toEXPERIENCE or PARTICIPATE. And only then are you up toBEINGNESS.Now this is the Confront Scale, and it is the scale of disintegrating Reality. It is how aperson handles terminals or a situation. A person handles terminals and situations above all thisby not having to participate, by not having to confront, finding no necessity to do anythingabout it unless he chooses so on his own determination; and if he did so, could do so with nopersonal liability. He could experience or not as the case may be. Now you’ll find a lowerharmonic on this in some philosophic level of somebody saying, “Yap, yap, well, I could, or Icouldn’t, and that’s my choice,” etc, well, he hasn’t got any power of choice. He’s just usingthis as the final escape mechanism—a philosophic escape mechanism.If I said “bottom”—the bottom mechanism—it would be the one most commonlycontacted. But you are apt to get a mechanism which is philosophic, which is simply a figure-figure mechanism about a situation, and the individual feels that if he could just figure it out hewould be all right. In other words, this is a thought-thinkingness figure-figure, and he not-ises"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"by figure-figure. Such a case, not-ising by figure-figure, will turn into a dub-in case as soon asyou start curing his figure-figure; would turn into a black case; would turn into an invisiblecase; would turn into a confront case; would turn into an experience case. Which is quiteinteresting.Now it is true that an engram could be found, started, and, if the auditor were good andheld the individual right on the time period and had the time period well spotted, and had theovert and motivator, no matter how crazy they seemed or sounded, contacted, he couldtheoretically, just by running that engram, run a person through the totality of this RealityScale. See? So there’s another approach here. You get a guy who is figure-figure, find theengram necessary to resolve the case. First he figure-figures about it, and he’ll run it, and run itjust with the auditing commands—the five auditing commands to run an engram—he figure-figures about it, then after a while he dubs-in about it, then after a while it all goes black; andthen after a while it eases into an invisibility—it’s just not there—somatics are, and discomfortand other things are, but it’s not there—and its not-thereness suddenly turns into little flicks—little flicks of confront. And boy, he goes elsewhere. It just starts to turn on and he gets it forthe least little Flick and he goes elsewhere. And then pretty soon he can confront the thing; thenpretty soon he can participate—he can run it in valence, squarely in valence, right in its momentof time, at which time it becomes pretty damn real. And then he goes to being able to put itthere or not put it there, and its importance-unimportance factor flattens out so that it’s neitherimportant nor unimportant. And that engram is licked.Theoretically, this could happen. That is actually the way I run engrams. But you willfind in auditing in the HGC that the public expects of you a different thing than is expected ofyou by students. And that’s why I wanted to talk to you for a few minutes. They expect adifferent thing. They expect you to be interested in their case. And that is quite amusing—because it’s your job to get them interested in their case. But they want you to be interested intheir case. A11 right, any case is interesting, so that’s a pretty easy one. But you can get sointerested in their case that you do a lot of talking to them and burn up an awful lot of auditingtime. So there is some point where your interest becomes an indulgence, and on the happierside of that, where the pc is pleased you’re interested in his case, and that’s enough. Then youget him interested in his case.All right. Now, we have for a long time not used PT problems. I’ll tell you why verybluntly. It was not unusual for an auditor to burn up twelve and a half hours on a PT problem.It was not unusual. He did this with two motives: one just yak, letting the pc go on and on,poor control, not controlling the pc’s comm outflow, letting the pc get into non-essentials. Andthe other side of it: he was trying to run the whole case with the PT problem. Well,wonderful—you can run a whole case with a PT problem—but why? Since it’s slow freight.That’s a very slow way to go about it. So we take a PT problem now and handle the session inthis fashion:We establish the rudiments every time we establish a session. Find the auditor, find thepc, find the auditing room, establish a goal for the session. Do that rapidly. We don’t care whatgoal it is, so long as he has some kind of a goal. And then we ask for a PT problem. And wetake an E-Meter (up to that time we didn’t care whether the pc was handling the cans or not) butwe take an E-Meter, and we have this PT problem appear on the E-Meter, or we don’t run it.Got it? And we run the PT problem that appears on the E-Meter. So we get him to state thisproblem, and we don’t care how he states the problem, because all we want to know is “Did itdrop?” That tells you at once you won’t run a PT problem on a stage-4 needle. Didn’t drop-see,that’s all within the requirements—it didn’t drop, so skip it. It isn’t going to be real to the pcanyhow. You’ll have to do something else with this case. He’s probably got thousands ofproblems; probably all of life is a problem. Probably every time he walks in a room he installsan engram. You know, the furniture’s there—that’s an engram. Get the idea? So why worryabout a problem?But if you got a PT problem that drops, you should remove yourself at that moment fromall temptation. As soon as the problem drops, and as soon as he states that it is a problem to"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"him and is worrying him in present time, you take the cans away from him and put the thingaside. Just lay the E-Meter aside. You’re not interested in an E-Meter from there on. The reasonwhy is because you’ll increase the drop, you’ll increase more drop and more drop as you askhim about it. You’re already running it. And the problem is going to change. You have seenthis phenomenon. You’re not interested in a problem changing. The fact of your laying asidethe E-Meter will rather convince him that you have found it and that’s it. And you only want toknow this: the personnel associated with that problem. You don’t want to know more about theproblem. You just want to know the personnel associated with that problem. His wife, hismother, and his wife’s boy friend, or something of that sort. And that’s the personnelassociated with the problem. You just check that off.Now, I’m going to ask you to take a notebook and a ball-point into the auditing room,because you’ve got two or three things to do here that require a list. I want you to getaccustomed to establishing a list and then flattening it, not trying to run the case all over newagain every time the case changes. That’s one of the ways to waste time. You run one terminal,and of course the case changes, the problems change, everything changes on the case. If youre-assessed it at this time to find a new terminal, you’d for sure find new terminals. Well, thedevil with it. Let’s just flatten what we contact, and when we’re contacting and scouting andusing cans and the E-Meter, just write down what we find. Then put the E-Meter aside and runwhat we’ve found until we get rid of all of that. Now you’re going to do something new—givehim back the E-Meter cans. Got the idea?Pcs don’t much like to hold onto these E-Meter cans forever. Furthermore, they becomerestive, and they want to scratch their heads, and they want to do this, and they want to rasslearound, and most pcs you get are slightly nervous in this direction. Why should you worryabout it? Because the E-Meter is only going to give you a certain amount of the information thatis quite valid. Now, you’re going to write down the personnel connected with this PT problem.You’re going to take SELECTED PERSON OVERT-WITHHOLD on each one of thesepeople. And the commands for this are right here:“Think of something you have done to ( ),” and“Think of something you have withheld from ( ).”And you are going to run one of those commands and the next command, and then thenext command—first command again, then the second command, first command, secondcommand. In that way, you’ll never lay an egg on an unbalanced flow. No flow will unbalanceon you. They’ll always stay there more or less stable. The case won’t suddenly turn blackwhen it’s not supposed to turn black, and so forth. You won’t ever over-run a flow and the pcwill never get upset.Now, let’s look at this again. You have written down “wife”, “his mother”, and “hiswife’s boy friend”. Which one do you run first? You have to ask this question to establish thatterminal: “Which one of these things do you think is the most real to you?” The individual says,“Oh, Mother, of course.” Who cares? That’s what he says. All right, so that’s the first one youtake. Then you take the two remaining ones: “Which one is most real?” That’s the one youknock out. That leaves you one more person. Knock that one out.Now, there is something that is not stated here. I just typed this up rapidly for you—Ididn’t have a backing sheet, so there are typographicals because I couldn’t even see what I wastyping. This has a criterion, and it is an old criterion of all PT problems—it is, they are PTproblems. By definition, a PT problem must exist right now in the physical universe. Bydefinition. So therefore, the personnel involved in a PT problem must exist right now in thephysical universe. He will tell you halfway through the run, that “It was actually my motherwho influenced me this way”—ah skip it. That’s not a PT personnel in that problem. Hismother isn’t really part of, let us say—it was her mother that was part of the PT problem. Inother words, the people have to be actually associated with the problem and existing at this timein this pc’s life influencing that problem, for this to be a PT problem. So therefore, we don’tdive in any direction to pick up any new personnel we don’t care about."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"We get this problem flat. It is only flat if it answers this question: “Now, what do youhave to do about that problem now?” And the pc says, “Nothing.” It’s flat. For our purposes,it’s flat. The only reason we’re running it is we’re trying to get rid of the obsession he has tojump out of the auditing room and go do something about this problem. If he doesn’t have todo anything about it, it’s flat. But if he says, “Oh, it’s flat, because I could go and talk to mywife’s boy friend now, and I could handle him.” No. Start right back over from thebeginning—the first person you wrote down—and run that person again for a short time—nextperson for a short time—next person for a short time—on these exact auditing questions.“Now, what do you have to do about the problem?” He’ll tell you, “Well, I don’t have to doanything about it just now.” That’s enough. You consider that flat. Got it?All right. This will keep you out of all kinds of trouble. And it will keep the pc frombeing all hung up in trying to go elsewhere in an auditing session. So much for that.This is done at the beginning of every session. That first section there—it says,“STARTING A CASE: AND BEGIN EVERY SESSION”. Well, you not only start eachintensive with this, but you start every session with this, and you do the same thing.If it takes you two hours to flatten the PT problem, I will think something is hung up.This is a rapid one. This is not a slow one. If it takes a couple of hours, well, something’sreally haywire here. He didn’t say the problem, or he didn’t do something, or he’s holdingsomething back. But notice we have said, “Think of something you have done to” and “Thinkof something you have withheld from”. This will also get the pc talking to you, because it getsrid of the withhold. Got that? All right. So much for that.Now, DYNAMIC STRAIGHT WIRE you were taught in the 21st American, but thecommands for the general public were not given to you. And they are given to you here on thissheet, this HCO Bulletin. Now, the only thing you are looking for is a represented substitute.In other words, you’re looking for substitutes. You ask him for a substitute for himself, andyou ask him for a substitute on the basis of “Tell me something that would represent yourself.”And he says, “Represent myself? Oh, that’s very, very easy—a tree.” Get your ball-point busyat that point and put down “tree”. Got it? Now, if he even says “toothbrush”, get your ball-point busy. The proper answer, of course, is “Myself”. It’s just as simple as that. But the morea case is daffy on this line, the more attention you’re going to pay to it. So you just run thiswhole assessment right straight on through: Self, sex, family, children, groups, mankind, theanimal kingdom, birds, beasts, fish, vegetables, trees, growing things, matter, energy, space,time, spirits, souls, gods, God. Just one question. Each time you say this you just take one ofthose: “Tell me something that would represent, for instance, souls.” The individual says,“Running water.” Get the ball-point busy. Write it down. When you have got this whole listassessed, take the list you have written and run:“Think of something you have done to (a toothbrush).”“Think of something you have withheld from (a toothbrush).”You’ll be amazed, but they have actually done something to a toothbrush, and they haveactually withheld something from a toothbrush. This is pretty terrific. Quite amazing. But youare only looking for daffiness on this, and a sensible answer you don’t pay much attention to.You say, “Tell me something that would represent trees.” And the fellow says, “Leaves.”Now, there’s a matter of judgment involved here. What if he said, “Shadows”? Well, I don’tknow. That’s a matter of judgment. Try to run it or not try to run it, as the case may be. If itlooks daffy to you, run it. You’re the judge. Got the idea?Now don’t let it look daffy to you when you say, “Tell me something that wouldrepresent spirits,” and he says, “Souls.” When you say “souls”, he says “spirits”. That’s notdaffy.But how about this guy that gives you the perfect representation all the way down the linelike a little wound-up doll? You already, in looking him over, find out he has a sticky needle,"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"he’s registering at 6 on your E-Meter when you first put the cans in his hands, and he givesyou all the answers perfectly. That case is giving you an intellectual response which hasnothing to do with any reality under the sun, moon or stars. Something he read in a book and amachine is rattling it off. So you do the assessment again. The second time you go throughyou’re liable to trip him on something. Got the idea? So, if you get a perfect assessment, run itagain. I actually don’t care how many times you run it, but you’re apt to be wasting time,because by two-way comm and definition alone you may not get anywhere with a very badlymachined case. Nevertheless, a couple of times through, he should trip somewhere. Machinecase generally does.The rule governing Dynamic Straight Wire is: That which doesn’t fall out by two-waycomm just on assessment. He says it, and then it looks funny to him, and he laughs, and hethinks this is for the birds, and he says, “Oh, no, that wouldn’t be one-actually, a substitute fora tree would be a leaf, or a small tree,” or something like this. That’s fine. Nothing wrong withletting him correct himself, because you are actually auditing him just by asking him thequestion. People, when they straighten out things in their own categories, very often recoververy, very easily.All right. Let’s take up this next one here. That’s an easy way to run Dynamic StraightWire, isn’t it, huh? I would ask you to do this, however, in view of the fact that you are doinga professional job of auditing for the public mainly, and that is, I’d ask you to memorize thatlist—rather than hold a bulletin in your hand and read it.Now, the next thing we’re going to run into here is PAST AND FUTUREEXPERIENCE. This is a bid for two things: One, the lowest level case there is—becauseexperience, to him, is a dub-in, usually. Or it’s a figure-figure, or it’s something, so itcompares to the Reality Scale. His definition of experience compares with the Reality Scale.His definition of experience is a direct index to the Reality Scale, by the way. What doesexperience mean? He’ll say, “Experience—that’s very easy. To consider.” There you’ve gotyour figure-figure level. “What does experience mean?” Well, “To write about it or makesomething out of it—experience is that thing which you use to manufacture the future.” He’sdub. “Now, what is an experience?” “Well, experience is that which you try not to have.”That’s probably black or invisible. Or, “It’s the thing you forget,” would be blackness.“Experience is something you try to forget”— invisibility level. “Experience is something youhave to cope with.” Obsessive confront. “Experience is—ah—well, experience—that’s prettyhard to define—experience. I guess it’s to go through something.” You’re getting a fairly saneresponse—to go through something. To have an actual adventure, something of this sort.You’re getting a fairly sane reaction to experience.So don’t think that Past and Future Experience is pegging up at the highest level of theReality Scale. It isn’t. This process was found, in the 21st American, to be the undercutprocess. This was the lowest undercut process. And this is a killer, and it is very trying to anauditor. A very trying process, because it offers so many wonderful temptations. And that’swhat’s wrong with this process.Now, you run these two questions, one after the other, with no assessment, no E-Meter,nothing. You just put the E-Meter down after you’ve done the Dynamic Straight Wire thing,because on Dynamic Straight Wire, when you said, “Children,” the needle was going on agradual shift over here, and a little theta bop now and then. You said, “Children,” and it fell adial, or all of a sudden started doing a big theta bop in the middle. When you got off ofchildren, it settled down to the other pattern. That told you that you had something to be run onthe subject of children. That he will also, at the same time, give you a daffy reading, he will tellyou some daffy terminal to represent—so you needed the E-Meter there. But you don’t needthe E-Meter on Past and Future Experience, not even vaguely. You can just put the E-Meteraside and turn it off, and just run these two commands. Just clear them with the pc verybluntly. Say, “We’re going to run something about experience. Now, we’re going to see howyou get along with this little process, and here are the commands of it: What part of your life"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"would you be willing to re-experience? And the other command is: What part of the futurewould you be willing to experience? Now, here’s the first command: What part of your lifewould you be willing to re-experience?”The answer actually called for is a time, isn’t it? And this is a time process. But there arevery few preclears that will find this out for a very long period. They won’t give you anythingbut super-significances and ball-up, and the pc who is real bad off will give you a type ofexperience. You accept all these things. You say, “What part of your life would you be willingto re-experience?” He says, “Well, eating cake.” That’s an answer? That’s an answer. Andthat’s followed with this: “What part of the future would you be willing to experience?” Hesays, “Well, more cake.” That’s an answer. So you just accept any answer that he gives you onthe line. It gradually will boil down to a time answer. And it will gradually go back-track. Thelonger you run it, the more track you’re going to cover, the more future you’re going to cover.And there will be periods when the individual is absolutely sure that he is totally predicting thefuture. He gets into implants, let us say, that tell him what the future is all about. He’s stuck8000 years ago, but he’s telling you about the future. All kinds of odd phenomena show up.But engrams come up and slap you in the teeth, one right after the other.You run this for a while, and the individual says, “OOOh, well, you know I reallywouldn’t be willing—well, I would be willing—I don’t know—I would—oohh, well—I reallydon’t know—dental operation there, I was a young boy—I don’t know if I’d like to re-experience that—I guess I could re-experience sitting in the—no, no, no. I could re-experience—I could re-experience the next day after it.” You say, “That’s fine,” and just markit down with the ball-point: “Dental experience as a child.” That one he can’t confront. Now,you’re never going to run it as an engram, but you’re going to have some tag of it as anengram. See, it may show you something.As you go along and he runs into hot experiences, real, real hot experiences one rightafter the other, it is about time you put the E-Meter back in his paws. Get the idea? You don’thave to start it with the E-Meter, but if he starts running into hot experiences, or if he gets intoan engram and he can’t seem to get out of the thing, the thing to do is not run the engram butgive him an E-Meter and spot it in time for him. Get it spotted in time. If he’s running into themhot and heavy, one right after the other, just leave him with the E-Meter. But if there is onlyone you have to spot in time, and then in a little while he doesn’t seem to be running any more,take the cans away from him again and put the E-Meter aside. But if he starts running into onethat obsessively sticks with him, don’t let him flounder in the thing for an hour. Don’t let himwallow in this one. Because he will just wallow in it, and this is no process-this is not a goodprocess to run an engram with. So you let him out, OK? And the way you let him out is tolocate it in time with an E-Meter. And you go on running the process. Now, as I say, it offersenormous temptations to the auditor—beautiful temptations to run the things contacted. As yousit this out, you actually are going to change the characteristic of the engram you will ultimatelyrun on the case. But you keep listing engrams that he runs into. Keep listing engrams that heruns into, well knowing that he will favor motivators. For every one of those motivators thereis an overt. Now an engram that he consistently and persistently keeps hitting and hitting andhitting, you are going to find in that engram probably the engram you will run, eventually. Butnot until he is in PT, out of the engram, it seems to have dropped out, and so forth, and heseems to be all smooth on this thing, are you going to reach for that one again. You are goingto flatten the process and then go to the engram.Here we go. ENGRAM RUNNING. Of course, that is run all the way through with anE-Meter. Give him the cans and start out on this engram that you more or less found with Pastand Future Experience.Now, this is going to undercut cases, and I don’t care how long you run it. I don’t care ifyou run it for two weeks, because this is a very productive process. But if you are going to runit over that period of time, it isn’t noted here, but some THIRD RAIL had better be brought inhere some place. And he’d better be shifted up finally until havingness. And you put in PAST"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"AND FUTURE EXPERIENCE, right after that line, “COMBINE WITH THIRD RAIL IFRUN MORE THAN 8 HOURS”. If you run it eight hours, this guy’s havingness is going tostart dropping on him, and you are going to run into difficulties. You could get into difficulties.All right.ENGRAM RUNNING. Well, Engram Running, when the case has been prepared thisway, becomes very simple. A case will start running like a little typewriter, if you have got thisPast and Future Experience pretty flat.Once you have picked an engram, make sure you get its motivator not only its overt. Ifyou have got an overt, get the motivator. If you have got the motivator, get the overt. And onlywhen you have got that have you got an incident. Now, an engram that is having one side ofthe overt or motivator run will get sticky. You have got to find the other side, and you have gotto get both of these things in date. Normally, this will start showing up on Past and FutureExperience. Well, we are going to run this engram with an E-Meter, we are going to considerthat we have an incident when we have got both a motivator and an overt that fit together. Andif the thing is just awful sticky, and dubby, and shockingly poor, and a lot of other things, youjust started running it too fast, that is all.We have got several things you can do at this state of the case, and so forth. Probably thebest of them is go back to running Past and Future Experience. You didn’t flatten it.Now, here is this Engram Running. If you notice here, it says you run all the commandsthat run an engram twice. Run them all twice. That’s because “Find something unimportant inthat incident” is going to stir up stuff that newly has to be confronted.Once you have chosen an engram and you have begun to run it, you have had it. That’sit. That’s the engram you are going to run. So it has to be chosen with considerable care. Listento me now: If you re-assess the case after you have started an engram, you will get almost anyother incident that is hot to drop more than the engram you started, because most of the chargeis already dissipated. So if you keep re-assessing a case, thinking another engram would bebetter to run for the case, you are of course always going to find another engram. You willnever find the one you started to run again dropping with as much velocity. You see? That’ssomething you have to keep in mind. If you are going to run an engram, that’s the engram youare going to run. It’s got to have its overt or motivator; suppose you are running the overt sideof it, you have got to have the motivator side of it. So you really haven’t got an incident untilyou have got both of these things located. And once you have started to run that, you have hadit. Because it will discharge its charge and won’t register on a meter any more the way someother incident will.You can get a case just stirred all up and run all backwards and upside down, and that’sthe biggest mistake an auditor can make. I have given you the reason for the mistake-becausenow almost anything will drop better than the one you partially flattened.If in doubt, run the engram you were running. If you are not getting rapid recovery, goback to the first engram you ran and considered flat and run it again. Sometimes, it will onlytake you fifteen minutes to run all five commands. You do it very fast. But very oftensomething happened that it re-charged in some fashion. Very peculiar.If you leave about a third of an engram missing and unflat, the whole engram has atendency to charge up again. It is kind of funny. But you have got to flatten the engram youcontacted.Now the rule of the Last Largest Object is the only one I want you to pay any attention toin questioning the pc. Pc apparently is getting out of it. Change your auditing command. Youare running, “What part of that incident can you confront?” He says, “Well, I don’t know, it’spretty unreal to me, I don’t know whether this happened or not.” What was the last largest"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"object? If he said anything that was offbeat and showed an unwillingness to run any more ofthe engram, you want to find out at once what was the last largest object that you contacted inthere. And he says, “A house.” You are going to shift your auditing command now to: “Whatpart of that house can you confront?” And you are going to run that simply until he is back inthe incident, and then you are going to go off on to “What part of that incident can youconfront?” Doesn’t require any vast bridge. You just tell him you are going to shift.In that way, using that rule, you can actually pick up an engram where he was running asAbraham Lincoln, and in the engram he was shot in Ford’s Theatre—you know—and the dateis obviously correct. Dropped and everything. And then he runs John Wilkes Booth—no, hewasn’t Lincoln, he was John Wilkes Booth. And so help me God, you may find that he wasthe Secret Service Agent who had a couple of drinks that night and wasn’t watching. You don’tcare whether he runs it dub or not. Don’t give up because he’s running it wrong, because it’llcome out right.There was a joke on us in the 21st American. We had our paws on Bowie. He was JimBowie. And of course everybody doubted this, because it is a famous historical figure. Andthey tried to do everything under the sun to shake him out of this engram, and they finally wentback to running it, and it was the one that flattened out. The trouble was, he had dub on it,which made Bowie die the wrong kind of a death under wrong circumstances. But as he ran it,the more he ran it, the more he ran it, the more right the circumstances got. And it finally allcame out in the wash. He did run the death of Jim Bowie.Historical figures, however, are usually the yo-yo point used. The guy went out of hisown body at the death; there was some current historical figure; he said, “That is the identitynecessary to resolve this incident. That identity could handle it. So I will just be Catherine theGreat.” And he goes and runs Catherine the Great. The only mistake is to let him escape out ofthe time period. Maybe he did yo-yo right into the palace, maybe he did go right through herskull. But the right engram will shake out, because the Reality Scale is run by running anengram.Theoretically, you could clear a person just by running one engram well enough. Sonever get off onto quantitative engrams. An engram is merely something for him to get used toconfronting, and creating, and mocking up, and so forth. It’s just a playing field you are using.The significance, the amount of change he gets in his life, none of these things have anything todo with it at all. It is just how well he can handle a mental image picture, and you have chosen ahoney for him to handle. That is about all it amounts to. And when he finds out he can handlethis thing from A to Izzard and beginning to end, and he can do it well, then the next engram toresolve the case will run quite rapidly. And you will run on down and finally run his basic,earliest shift of identity, which is the rock. And formerly he said, “There is a beautiful, clearsphere—that’s the rock. And that’s all the rock.” Oh, heck. When you get several engrams runand get the rock as one of the engrams, you find out this beautiful, clear sphere was somethinghe customarily clamped around thetans as a trap, and they sometimes clamped it around him,and there were raiding parties, and there was all kinds of personnel and there is drama and thereis strain, and there is scenery and everything else. When you contacted the rock first and ranthe rock first, he was insufficiently able to contact things. The date when he was mocking upthis thing, he was so capable of mocking up that later on this poor, little, weak ole thetan, yearsand years and centuries and so forth afterwards going back to mock up this rock—uh-uh— it’stoo beefy. That’s too much engram for him to confront first off.So you choose the engrams—it doesn’t much matter what you choose. You will find thatevery sexual incident you contact is a bounce from a death. A little rule for you. So don’t let mecatch anybody in the HGC running prenatals, birth, conception, because that is a bounce.Those are all tied in with the death, and the death is the engram which is necessary to resolvethe case. So you keep running Past and Future Experience until you get them down to that—OK? Leave the second dynamic incidents severely alone.Now it can be that he died, and he died is followed by a conception sequence, and he"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"goes back to the old body to see if it is still decently buried—you know—and then he can’t findthe person that he thought he was going to be, get the next body from, and he gets allconfused. And mess-ups of this character can occur. But keep him on the incident. Is this partof the text? When you finish a death and go through the exteriorization sequence, right at theend of it there is a conception or a prenatal or a birth. They quite ordinarily bounce into it, andyou don’t want it. You want nothing to do with it. So you stop him when you have got all ofthe exteriorization run.There is a lot to know about engrams. You have been taught all this, but I am justshowing you what you can do to win in the HGC with Engram Running. This would be agood, clean job then.Every time you run an engram, now is the time to use some Not-Is Straight Wire, with itsordinary commands which you know. They are:“Recall something that you implied was unimportant.” “Recall something somebody elsethought was important.”Don’t ever let a pc run it in reverse, because it discharges havingness in about fivecommands. That is real rough the other way, too.All right. Now there we have a rundown that will get engrams run, that will get ordinary,run-of-the-mill cases squared around, and that will get a lot done. But what about people whowere not through the American 21st? And during that period of time up until they start in with aTheta Clearing Course, to run actual engrams on pcs, how about these people? Well, you haveSelected Person Overts, with the “withhold” command added, and you will have a new bulletinout on these things, and so forth. We want that auditing to be relatively muzzled. It will winand everything will go along just dandy. But if you have got some case (and this is more forD.O.P.s than anything else)—if you have got some case that was awfully hard to start, verylow random profile, you’d better turn it over to a graduate of the 21st American. And if youhave got some case that, after he ran along for a while and was getting up to a point where he’djust run engrams beautifully, and the whole track’s opening up, everything is going along justdandy, and it is certain that the engram necessary to resolve the case is just waiting, give him anauditor that can run it.In other words, you can run an HGC this way: You can get some auditors that set pcs upto run engrams. You got the idea? And then you can have some auditors that run engrams. Thisis not any real violation of the Auditor’s Code, because that will still give him the bestprocesses and the best treatment for the pc that can be given.Now there is no reason why, particularly after a staff Theta Clearing Course, thateverybody can’t run a regimen of this sort. But running it in the HGC, with all the profilesbeing submitted to me and all the Case Analysis Reports—the Case Analysis Reports now aremore vital than profiles, because R changed on a case does not necessarily change the profile atall. You should know about that. You can change the R of the case without changing theprofile. The person answered the same questions, only he answered them with Reality. This isquite remarkable. We need a brand new test. That test is in development right at this moment. Itis a confront test, and that test will be coming up, but there is no reason to rush it, particularly.Let’s just do it by Case Analysis.I will get out a Bulletin that will take care of auditors who were not trained to runengrams, what they will run. But you already have data and material on this, and it is just asbefore, what you have been running.Now, to start a case out with NOT-IS STRAIGHT WIRE is adventurous. That’s anadventurous thing to do. That’s a rough thing to do. We learned a great many things in the 21stAmerican ACC. Learned a great many things, and that was one of them. Selected PersonsOvert-Withhold is very, very superior in undercutting cases to Selected Persons Overts. The"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"only main change we have got is that we run Selected Person Overt-Withhold commands, justas it is given here in PT problem. That is a wonderful thing to do with a case, as long as theterminal is real to the pc. And there is no real reason that running a Scientologist, who knowswhat the command is, why ARC Break Straight Wire cannot be run on a person by an auditorwho has not been through an Engram Running Course. That’s a beautiful process.I want to tell you something else. Can I tell you something here? A lot of research wasdone in the 21st American ACC, and students didn’t see me as much as they thought theyshould, I suppose, but I was around. And I never saw so many flips and changes and vagariesin my life as I saw in that particular unit. The reports which I got were very—very helpful tome—very, very helpful to Scientology at large. There was a great deal done in that course. Ispent about three weeks of the course—did very rapid research just in catching up with some ofthese undercuts. Because, let me assure you, the R factor in most of the cases you approach isso low that it poses a problem of running greater than we had ever imagined. Therefore, theseare the processes that we are handing out.Now, these are a Not-Is type of process. Dynamic Straight Wire runs a straightidentification, but the rest of these things are Not-Is types of processes. To cure somebodyfrom not-ising. When a person can confront something, he no longer has to not-is it.But there was a funny command came up along the line, that I don’t fully understand yet,but it takes care of a theta body. Now this is part of the research that was never given to the21st American. And this is a peculiar darned thing. You can write it down on the back of thisBulletin, if you want to.It is:“Recall a time when you thought something bad was unimportant.”And that is just about the wildest thing you ever saw. Now that runs all by itself but canbe combined with:“Recall a time somebody else thought something bad was important.”And you will run all the newspapers off the case. The second command there is really notessential, but you just run this first command repetitively, and if it seems to run down orsomething bad happens, flip over to the other command. But you will as-is a theta body.This is the doggondest thing you ever saw. It is a perfectly wild pitch. I was just addingup all possible combinations and working in all possible directions, and this one fell out of thehamper, and it doesn’t integrate too well with the rest of your data. But this is the goofy one.Now, something else came up in the 21st American that I should tell you in the HGC,and that is: After nine years, we have found out WHY. We had nine years of HOW, and nowin the ninth year we find out why. Why people are aberrated. Why they are sick. Why they actthe way they do. Why individuation takes place. And that is all wrapped up with WITHHOLD.I had withhold earlier, but didn’t shake it all out of the hamper, because I didn’t have the overtsto go with it. We find out that an individual gets sick by having the overt impulse to makesomebody else sick and then withholds it, because it is less social to give people illnesses. Sohe gets them himself. This is Freudian transference, it is a whole number of things. So whenyou run these overts, run the withhold with it and the case will start finding out why.The theta body thing, and the masses and ridges, why, they run out when you ask aperson to recall a time when he thought something bad was unimportant, or recall—well, that isthe best command—recall a time when he thought something bad was unimportant. When yourun this, you evidently run the center pin of the withhold. But you will get his tolerance. Andthis is the first straight ethical process, evidently, we have. It raises a person’s ethics. It as-ises"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"a theta body. It takes demon bodies and things like that off cases. I tested it two or three timeshere, just monkeying around with this thing, and it is one of the wilder ones. This is a wildpitch, that particular process.So you could say that when a field doesn’t immediately disintegrate, when you can’t getan individual easily in the engram, when the field stays persistently black or something likethat, you have got another string to your bow, and I don’t care if you use it. But if you do useit, know this: It runs as an automaticity on such a demon case. He runs br-r-r-r-t—the last twothousand years he has been not-ising and saying it was unimportant that something was bad.And he will start coming up with, “Well, I should do something—no, I shouldn’t dosomething—well, what is this? I should do something about it. I shouldn’t do something aboutit. I have been very neglectful, but that really isn’t bad. Not really. Somebody dying from thebullet wound I gave ‘em—that really isn’t bad. But—” And he is stuck right with theconsideration on all of his overts—consequences of overts. They all must be unimportant. Andit reduces his ethical level. But I have now seen two demon bodies disintegrate just with thatone command just disintegrate—and this is the first time we ever had something that woulddisintegrate the astral body. So we find out at once that the astral body was an aberration. Itisn’t a necessary thing to make a thetan stick in the head at all.All right. Now I wanted to give you this rundown, because today you were having a littlebit of a rough time doing a transition from student to pro auditor, and I wanted to talk to you,even though it burned up some of your valuable time and mine. And ask you to sic sempertransit, huh?Now are there any questions? Yes, Jean.Q. I have two questions. In running of the engram, do you ignore what they wererunning in the ACC, or do you just go back and run them? My preclear has had severalengrams started.A. Now, if we look over this carefully, we see in running an incident: Find the engramnecessary to resolve the case. Once you have chosen it and have begun to run it, be sure youhave the motivator and the overt and then do not, do not, do not, do not, depart from thatincident to run another that “drops better” or comes up. Now look here. The engrams that wererun on them in the course are no longer going to fall. And an engram is not going to show onan E-Meter. And if there were several engrams run on somebody in the course, and the firstone wasn’t flattened, then whoever audited them ought to be hit in the head with a sledge-hammer. There’s only one or two cases that got by with this, that I have checked up on so far,and it is about the most serious blunder that could be made. Now, what you do in a case that’shad an engram already started is get a lie reaction check—that’s all you want—of some sort oranother, concerning this particular thing. You can put him on the E-Meter and ask him if it wasrun, and so forth, and ask him which one was the first one run. You could possibly get anocclusion, but usually the pc will tell you. There’s no particular reason to doubt the pc. Get thefirst one, and get that one flat, and then you have no choice but to pick up the next one andflatten that one.This applies without regard to how many auditors were on the case. This also, you willfind out, will sometimes apply to somebody who had an engram audited in 1950. The onlytrouble with a 1950 engram is that it is probably an operation in the current lifetime, or aprenatal in the current lifetime, and it was the wrong engram necessary to resolve the case, andyou won’t get very far running the thing. And we have no data at this time, whether it’s best topick that one up and run it or not. But I would say for sure that an engram that should havebeen run to resolve the case, such as a past death, if that was ever entered in all of those years,including 1950—it may no longer drop on the E-Meter, because some of its charge is gone.That is the engram necessary to resolve the case.Yes, got another one?"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"Q. Yes. The Dynamic Straight Wire—do you keep running this until you have picked upall the daffy terminals, then go through it several times and get the daffy ones each time?A. If you get a daffy one, if you get several daffy ones, you take those you got on thefirst run and run them. Don’t bother to go through again, because it will have straightened out.Enough will have straightened out to admit progress of the case. But if you don’t get any daffyones through once, then run it again. Any other questions? Dale.Dale: I just had a comment on that. One 1950 engram, in which the auditor blew sessionbecause it was whole track, was the engram necessary to resolve the case and finally showedup. The guy had been black since 1950.A. Good. Picked it up and flattened it. Well, that’s a good job. That tells you that a blackcase, then, doesn’t necessarily require five or six weeks of preparation before you run anengram. You pick up an engram as early as you can on a case and charge through. But itdoesn’t get you around starting a case. You have always got to start a case or start a session.Yes?Q. On this re-experience process, do I run it until I get 3-D pictures, and track?A. Yes. Oh, 3-D pictures and back in PT. Back in PT. I’ll give you an example of one ofthese. Here’s the pc. He is sitting in a terror charge, in a total black freeze, at 1500 AD. Onesecond later, everything went to hell. One second before, everything had gone to hell. And he’ssitting in this split second, at a rest point. Got it? Well, now, what do you think happens whenyou start asking him about future and past, alternately? He’ll move right off that rest point,won’t he? So this is an explosive, doggoned process. Now, I say you run it until he gets toPT. Some time or other you might find it impossible to get him to PT on the process. You justmight. But the experience that has been had with it so far is that it does eventually move him toPT. Now is the time to take him back, at the auditor’s discretion, and have him run that incidentin which he was stuck.By the way, “What part of PT are you willing to experience?” has on several casesexposed the engram necessary to resolve the case. It is the engram he’s sitting in, and it is theone necessary to resolve the case. Yes?Q. If you leave a process very unflat one afternoon, and come back in the morning andstart questioning the guy, and you pick up first of all present time problems. Now supposingthat process is the basic of his present time problem of the morning. Are he and you theterminals, the preclear and auditor the two terminals?A. Yes.Q. Do you run it that way?A. Oh, well, if he got a lot of ARC breaks, it would be a good thing to run it this way.That would clean up all the ARC breaks, wouldn’t it?Now I am going to give you that again on ARC breaks. This is the hottest one to runARC breaks on. Just pick up the auditor and pick up the pc, as the two people involved in thepresent time problem. I am glad you brought that up, Joe.This idea of throwing him back into session after you have ended a session the day beforeis another point of judgment. Just how do you smoothly get him into it? Usually he has piledup something on top of the engram. There is a process here, which is not really a very goodprocess, but which kicks them out, and it was not given in this ACC. That is Problems ofComparable Magnitude to that Engram, or that Incident. It will actually de-intensify an engram.You should have that as a little panacea."},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"That is an interesting one to wind up an intensive on. About noon of the last day you allof a sudden realize, “Boy, this man isn’t going to make it.” And you could run a problem ofcomparable magnitude to that engram and get it keyed out. However, you are better than that,and you will have had it flat by the last day of the last intensive he has, that’s for sure. Anyother questions? Don?Q. Is “recall something” preferred over “recall a time”? I have heard “Recall a time youdid something to somebody,” and also “Recall something you did to somebody,” which isslightly different.A. “Recall a time” is always a superior process, unless the individual is consistently notrecalling a time, at which time he is not obeying the auditing command. So you should say,“Recall something you have done to” to somebody who can’t spot something on a time track.Q. What’s the difference there?A. You are running really two processes with “Recall a time you did something,” and youare running only one process, “Recall something you have done.”Q. Can he continue to do that without recalling a time?A. Yeah. Definitely. Anything else?“Recall a time,” all by itself—you just sit down and say to a pc, “Recall a time. Thankyou. Recall a time. Thank you.” Some interesting things would happen to a case. Time, yousee, is the single aberration. Joe?Q. In running an engram, when you are tagging the engram for the first time, is itpossible to peg, say, a 2-ton motivator and a one-pound overt, and that’s the incident?A. Yes. Because until they get some of the overt flat, the motivator will come off. Theright one to run there, by the way, is the overt. You get that overt damn real, and all of asudden you’ll find the 20-tons have departed down to about 1 0-tons on the motivator. Nowthey’ll run on comparable lines. Yes.Q. Couldn’t you have, say, a 20-ton motivator, as he was saying, and twenty one-tonoverts tied to the same motivator, rather than one large overt?A. You could. You could. Nevertheless, you’ll find somebody getting all loused up onthis, and best remedy is just to play what overt you find against what motivator you find as theincident. And just keep playing them one against the other, back and forth, back and forth, andeventually the thing will come out right.There are many remedies, and one is Selected Persons Overt-Withhold Straight Wire onthe personnel of the incident. You could take any incident as a PT and run any PT process onthe incident. That’s a little rule. I don’t advise you doing it, however, but you can do it. It’svery interesting: “Find something unimportant about that executioner,” is just about the sameas, “Find something unimportant about this room.” If you want to get a reality soaring on a pc,just run “Find something unimportant about this room.” And he’ll start this not-is machinerygoing, you know, and he’ll run it out to some degree, and all of a sudden the room willbrighten up. Very interesting.“Think of something you did to an executioner” would be it, rather than, “Think ofsomething you did to that executioner.” And he will come up with the overt, and he will findout he was the executioner in the same castle for about three lifetimes before he suddenly cameback there and got executed. That usually is the way these things compare."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"Any other questions? There is a burning question that you should ask, is: “Are wesupposed to run these things muzzled?” Now, let me just say this, to do this for me: Let’s cutdown the unnecessary yak. And if the pc seems to be ARC breaking at all, you voluntarilymuzzle your auditing. You got it? Because what he’s got is an engram of being talked to orbeing interrogated in some fashion, and everything that he doesn’t consider exactly necessaryto the auditing session he resents. So if you find a pc is ARC breaking, you muzzle yoursession. Any other questions before we break this up?Thank you very much for your time, I appreciate very much your coming in. I know youhad a hard day getting on to a new routine, and you have got auxiliary duties. Several people inthe HGC have been split off of administration, and there are other things going on. Latch on to‘em, get wheeling, but let’s start making theta clears in this HGC and just make nothing elsebut theta clears. I have given you a pattern here that was thoroughly tested out in the 21stAmerican ACC, and you can make theta clears—there’s no great difficulty to it. Thank youvery much. L.

No. 155PROFESSIONAL AUDITOR’S BULLETINThe Oldest Continuous Publication in Dianetics and ScientologyFrom L. RON HUBBARDVia Hubbard Communications Office37 Fitzroy Street, London W.1_____________________________________________________________________1 March 1959PROCESSES USED IN 21ST ACCCompiled from the Research Material and Taped Lectures of L. Ron HubbardI want to take up here with great rapidity the processes from bottom to top that we haveso far found and that have been effective, and some additional data in running them.And first is the process Dynamic Straightwire. The way to do a survey on DynamicStraightwire is this: you ask the person to describe the dynamics from one to eight. We don’tcare about them being sequitur—change them round if you wish.Now, you ask a person to describe each one of these dynamics. You are watching an E-Meter for a change in pattern. Therefore you must carefully isolate the pattern, before you cantell whether or not the pattern has changed on the E-Meter needle reading. But, more importantthan that, you are looking for a dynamic the preclear makes mistakes about while he is trying todescribe it, a dynamic he cannot describe, or a dynamic he won’t even approach and is veryleary of, and his statement is confirmed by the E-Meter reading. In other words, you’ve got thestatement of the preclear in this particular analysis being stacked up against the E-Meter readingall the way through in an analysis or diagnosis for Dynamic Straightwire.All right. We go all the way through, asking for a terminal on these dynamics and wefinally get a repeat. We will ask him for terminals on these dynamics, and we will get the samedynamic to read again. Now the basic rule which sorts this out is: Any dynamic which doesn’tclear by two-way comm has to be run. Simple as that. Any dynamic which doesn’t clear bytwo-way comm has to be run.So, if you have two or three dynamics jammed up, you can hope that two of them willclear up, leaving you with the remaining dynamic.But this is not the complete criteria of what you run. There is another stable datum. Don’trun a terminal that is totally unreal to the preclear. Another stable datum, which comes on top ofit, is: never run a terminal that is sensible. Never. If a terminal belongs on the dynamic, youcan almost say you’ll get nowhere running it. So you’re looking for terminals that the precleargives you for a dynamic which don’t belong on the dynamic at all.Now, if that terminal is real to the preclear, you will get a tremendous change in the case.If that terminal is totally unreal to the preclear and if it does belong on the dynamic, why,you’re not going to get any change on the case, so why run it? Might as well run some otherprocess.So, we have several conditions by which the diagnosis on Dynamic Straightwire works.I’ve done enough of these now and run enough of them, isolated enough of them and gotten"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"conditions of change on enough of them, to realize that every time you changed a case you had(1) a person who couldn’t describe the dynamic accurately, or who made mistakes while tryingto describe it, (2) a person who gave you a non sequitur or erroneous terminal for thatdynamic—the terminal was fairly real to the preclear, although it didn’t belong there—and (3)you ran that, and it opened up track like mad.What have you got here? You have a terrific identification. You are trying to undoidentification that is lying right on the top. Well, this tells you, then, that it is neither a longprocess nor an invariable process. Given enough skill, you could undoubtedly find one ofthese on every case—given enough skill. But it is limited by auditor skill. Furthermore, it givesauditors a chance to “chop up” preclears and it gives auditors a chance to write some script, sothis one has liability. And auditors have been writing script like mad. We had one particularcase where the preclear couldn’t say any terminal on the seventh dynamic, so promptly theauditor jumps in and takes the nearest related thing to the seventh dynamic, the thetan, he couldget. This was A Head, and he ran A Head, and the preclear had nothing to do with it, and theywondered why the case didn’t advance.Now, you have auditors who are letting the preclear choose. In other words, there areauditors who actually believe that a preclear is permitted power of choice in an auditing session.And this is the biggest bug I have found existing at this instant on this ACC. That one’s ablinker. They are probably not telling you this, that they think a preclear has power of choice.They don’t know this: that it has to be nutty if you are going to run it—if it makes sense, whyrun it? They are looking for a wrongness in the preclear and they believe that the preclearknows all about his own case and could straighten it out all by himself. And that the auditor isan unnecessary adjunct. Now there are several people on this ACC who believe this and this isa great compliment to their faith in human nature, but it’s certainly of no value in an auditor.The preclear has no power of choice at all. The one the preclear would never choose is the oneyou run.An example: We had a preclear here who gave three terminals on the fifth dynamic. Oneof these was a mountain. So the preclear was given the power of choice as to which one to runand, of course, came up with a cat. So they sat there running cats. Well, a cat happens to beright for the fifth dynamic, so why straighten it out? The process is aimed at straightening outsomething. Obviously, the mountain was wrong. The preclear was totally stuck on the idea thatthere was a mountain in on this.We found a mountain on the eighth dynamic in another case that hasn’t been running.This case had been running metal on the sixth dynamic. So what? Metal belongs on the sixthdynamic—why run it? Get the idea? But this auditor had found a mountain on the eighthdynamic and ignored it. Of course, everybody knows God is a mountain—that’s obvious ....Now, this was the one to hit. And where you find these people out of session it isbecause nobody has trailed down a nutty dynamic. When they’re out of session on DynamicStraightwire, they’re not interested in it at all, they are just not running an identification.They’re running something reasonable, and at once the biggest liability of auditors is that theyare reasonable and that they write script and write in reasonable reasons for it all. And they’retrying to audit unreasonability out of people-and these two things just don’t go together at all.The next process up the line is Selected Person Overts. Select a terminal who is real to thepreclear and, as you undercut the process, it comes closer and closer to present time. Theperson chosen has to be closer and closer to present time the more you try to go downscale onthe process. But the person must be real, that’s a criteria in there. And the next thing about it is,you must flatten off several of these people. And the basic reason for this is to prepare anindividual to own up to some responsibility for his own actions. Unless he can assume someresponsibility for his own actions, he won’t do anything in an auditing session, so this is theone that cures.The auditing command for Selected Person Overts is “Recall a time you did"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"something to (the selected person’s name).” But that is undercut by the auditingcommand “Think of something you did to “ or “Think of something you havedone to .” Now, the reason you say “Think” is because these people are very chary ofowning up to anything or accepting any responsibility out in broad daylight in front of God andeverybody, so you run “Think” and you’ve got a lot of people who are having a rougher timewho won’t own up to their own lives and who can’t take responsibility for them on the thirddynamic, but can take responsibility for them on the first dynamic. And this is the dynamicselection. So “Think” undercuts “Recall. “The next one—General Overts—is much less effective when it has not already beenundercut by Selected Person Overts. The individual just goes on and on with sweetness andlight. The auditing command for General Overts is “Recall a time when you didsomething to somebody.” Now there are other phrases and so forth which could be usedfor this sort of process, but here we are interested mainly in people. We are not very interestedin MEST and the remaining four dynamics. They’d splatter all over the place. That’s why it’s“to somebody.” If you said “something,” you would get the remaining four, so there is analternate command in here if you wanted to run the other four dynamics. You would say,“Recall a time when you did something to something.”Now, the next one up the line from this is Not-Is Straightwire: “Recall a time whenyou implied something was unimportant.” And this, we find, is best run on analternate basis with the next auditing command, “Recall a time when somebody elsethought something was important.” These two commands are alternated, one after theother, and you get these cases that are in a jam.This is the direct cure of notisness; and where you have a case that is running a bad not-is, a process can evidently be invalidated or not-ised when the individual is out of session, orovernight. This is what Not-Is Straightwire cures. These are the people on whom a processworks once, and never works again. These people are not-ising so badly that they can’tduplicate—and not-is, of course, is a mechanism to prevent duplication. So you cure, notduplicate. And the cure for it is Not-Is Straightwire."},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICEWASHINGTON, D.C.HCO BULLETIN OF 3 FEBRUARY 1959HGC CURRENT PROCEDURESELECTED PERSONS OVERTS STRAIGHTWIREIf you want an undercut on Selected Persons Overts Straightwire, run people close topresent time and if you want to undercut it further, downscale its command to: “Think ofsomething you have done to ....” The preclear does not have to talk to run this process. He canjust think of something.Additional note: ARC Break Straightwire cannot be run on a case that is motivatorhungry. Overt acts must be owned up to thoroughly on the lower processes before you can getARC Break Straightwire to run properly. Bad auditing is much easier to do with ARC BreakStraightwire than the other two processes. Bad auditing is the limitation of ARC BreakStraightwire. It gives the auditor much more chance to make mistakes than either SelectedPersons Overts or Not-Is Straightwire.The two biggest single auditor crimes are:1. Rough and choppy auditing.2. Overestimating the level of case.When either of these two crimes is committed you get reduced profile readings. If aprofile reduces, the answer is in either one or two above.The remedy for rough auditing is muzzled auditing. This gives the auditor wins, thusimproving his judgement and gives the preclear wins.Muzzled auditing is best run on:1. Selected Person Overts Straightwire2. General Overts Straightwire3. Not-Is Straightwire.ARC Break Straightwire belongs between General Overts Straightwire and Not-IsStraightwire in the scale of things, but is generally omitted because it requires smooth auditing;however, it produces the best results if case reality is up to it.GRADUAL SCALE OF PROCESSESThe lowest is:1. Selected Person Overts Straightwire: “Recall a time you did something to2. General Overts Straightwire: “Recall a time you did something to somebody.”3. ARC Break Straightwire: “Recall an ARC Break.” “When?”"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"4. Not-Is Straightwire: “Recall a time you implied something was unimportant”alternated with “Recall a time somebody thought something was important. “5. Factual Havingness:“Look around here and find something you would permit to vanish.”“Look around here and find something you would continue.”“Look around here and find something you have.”The results to be achieved by the above scale compare favourably to the CCHs and arefaster.When part of the profile gain lags on the OCA or APA, the person is found to have adropped havingness, thus Factual Havingness (Third Rail—run 8-2-1) can be combined withthe above, using the third command, VANISH, first. In any event, the fifth process in theabove order is “Third Rail” (run 8-2-1 ) of Factual Havingness.I would like to see this run extensively by HGCs. I would like to see this gradient scalerun in full after every engram is flat, and before starting a new engram.This will keep auditors from being fooled by dub-in. Dub-in can occur in a differentlifetime, even when it was not present in the lifetime just run. Dub-in is a continuouscharacteristic of a person in a single lifetime and may not be present in the ensuing lifetime.  L. RON HUBBARDLRH:-.rdCopyright © 1959by L.

Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., 1957, for the 17thACC.CCH 3—A TYPE 3—DUPLICATION PROCESSNAME:Hand Space Mimicry.COMMANDS: Auditor raises two hands, palms facing preclear and says, “Put your hands"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"against mine, follow them and contribute to the motion.” He then makes asimple motion with right hand, then left. “Did you contribute to the motion?”“Thank you.” “Put your hands in your lap.” When this is flat the auditor doesthis same thing with a half inch of space between his and preclear’s palms.“Put your hands facing mine, about a half inch away, follow them andcontribute to the motion.” “Did you contribute to the motion?” “Thank you.”“Put your hands in your lap.” When this is flat auditor does it with a widerspace and so on until preclear is able to follow motions a yard away.POSITION:Auditor and preclear seated, close together facing each other, preclear’s kneesbetween auditor’s knees.PURPOSE:To develop reality on the auditor using the reality scale (solid comm line). Toget preclear into communication by control + duplication.TRAININGThat auditor be gentle and accurate in his motions, giving preclear Wins. TobeSTRESS:free in two-way comm. That the essential part of the auditing command is themotion, not the verbal patter. When it is necessary to physically assist preclearto do commands, use one-hand commands, putting preclear’s hand throughthe command with auditor’s free hand holding preclear’s hand by the wrist.Accept preclear’s answer to the question, “Did you contribute to themotion?”—his answers are accepted, whatever they may be. Auditor alwaysplaces his hands up before telling preclear to do so. Auditor tells preclear toput his hands in his lap and keeps his own up until preclear does so, allowingpreclear to break the solid comm line.HISTORY:Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, 1956, as a therapeutic versionof Dummy Hand Mimicry. Something was needed to supplant “Look at me.Who am I?” and “Find the Auditor” part of Rudiments.CCH 4—A TYPE 3—DUPLICATION PROCESSNAME:Book Mimicry.COMMANDS:Auditor makes a simple or complex motion with a book. Hands book topreclear. Preclear makes motion, duplicating auditor’s mirror image-wise.Auditor asks preclear, “Are you satisfied that you duplicated my motion?” Ifpreclear is and auditor is also fairly satisfied, auditor takes book back,acknowledges, “Thank you”, and goes to next command. If preclear says heis and auditor fairly sure he isn’t, auditor takes book back and repeatscommand and gives book to preclear again for another try. If preclear is notsure he duplicated any command, auditor repeats it for him and gives himback the book. Tone 40 only in motions. Verbal two-way comm quite free.POSITION:Auditor and preclear seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE:To bring up preclear’s communication with control and duplication. (Control+ duplication = communication.)TRAININGStress giving preclear wins. Stress auditor’s necessity to duplicate his ownSTRESS:motions. Circular motions are more complex than straight lines. The basic ruleon complexity in duplication processes is: Make the motions as complex as isnecessary to get the preclear’s interest and attention and no more.HISTORY:Developed by L. Ron Hubbard for the 16th ACC in Washington, D.C., 1957.Based on duplication developed by LRH in London, 1952."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"METHOD OF RUNNING CCH 1, 2, 3, 4.CCH 1 is run first and run to a flat spot. Then CCH 2 is run. If CCH 2 produces change,it is flattened and followed by CCH 1. Then CCH 2 and if it again produces change it isfollowed by CCH 1. This rule is followed throughout—when either CCH 2, CCH 3,CCH 4 produces change the process is flattened and followed by CCH 1. This series offour processes is left when they can be run, one after the other (1, 2, 3, 4) in the samesession without producing change.The four CCH processes are to be run on the following cases:INSANE:That is, a person who is extremely and obsessively unwilling to control hisbody, his attention and his thoughts.UNCONSCIOUS:Any person who is unaware, to a great degree.HOSTILE:Person who has appeared for processing but who demonstrates a completeunwillingness to accept order and to carry out an auditing command.CCH 1 “DON’T GIVE ME THAT HAND” version, is a specific process for a case whois dramatizing a heavy compulsive withhold condition.* * *ARC STRAIGHT WIRE—A TYPE 6—STRAIGHT WIRE PROCESSCOMMANDS: “Recall something that was really real to you.” “Thank you.” “Recall a timewhen you were in good communication with someone.” “Thank you.” “Recalla time when you really liked someone.” “Thank you.” The three commandsare given in that order and repeated in that order consistently.POSITION: Auditor and preclear seated facing each other at a comfortable distance.PURPOSE:To give the student reality on the existence of a bank. (When used as atraining drill.) This is audited on another and is audited until the preclear is inpresent time. It will be found that the process discloses the cycling action ofthe preclear going deeper and deeper into the past and then more and moreshallowly into the past until he is recalling something again close to presenttime. This cyclic action should be studied and understood and the reality onthe pictures the preclear gets should be thoroughly understood by the student.The fact that another has pictures should be totally real to the student undertraining.NOTE:It should be thoroughly understood that this is a valuable process and anexcellent step in preparation for running the heavier recall processes.HISTORY:Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in 1951 in Wichita, Kansas. This was once avery important process. It has been known to bring people from a neurotic toa sane level after only a short period of application. It has been run on a groupbasis with success but it should be noted that the thinkingness of theindividuals in the group would have to be well under the control of the auditorin order to have this process broadly beneficial. When it was discovered thatthis process occasionally reduces people’s havingness, the process itself wasnot generally run thereafter. It is still, however, an excellent process with thatproviso, a reduction of havingness in some cases. If this process is “policed” the auditor asks the preclear “when” before givingthe acknowledgement, as often as is necessary to maintain control of the"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"preclear—or as often as is necessary for the auditor to maintain his ownconfidence that the preclear is under control and doing the process. Thisprocess can be run “muzzled” and should be, where muzzling is indicated.ASSESSMENT An inventory and evaluation of a preclear, his body and his case toDEFINITION: establish processing level and procedure.1. Determine processing level.2. Determine process to be used.3. Always undercut reality level of the case when assessing processinglevel.4. Establish reality level of case by two-way communication usingunderstanding and affinity as guides. Understanding: What can thepreclear say and talk about that is easily understandable to the auditor?What can the auditor say and talk about that is easily understandable bythe preclear? Affinity: What does the preclear like or dislike? What doeshe detest or ignore? What is he anxious or otherwise mis-emotionalabout?5. Never overlook an obvious physical defect or communication difficultywhen making an assessment of any kind.6. Be alert to preclear’s comm lags and what produces them.7. Observe the preclear’s response to control.8. Find out what the preclear assigns cause to—what he blames what hefeels he can do nothing about.TERMINAL ASSESSMENT—for OVERT-WITHHOLD PROCESSIn the HCA/HPA course this is done by two-way communication. The student shouldlearn it by observance of the instructor. Terminal Assessment is made to locate theterminals in the case which, when run, will produce an increase in the responsibility andreality level of the preclear.A VERY BRIEF COVERAGE OF DYNAMIC AND KNOW TO MYSTERY SCOUTING1. Discover the terminals the preclear states to represent each part of the expandedKnow to Mystery Scale. Any terminal which is obviously aberrated and won’t clearby two-way comm should be run.2. Discover what terminals the preclear has identified with the wrong Dynamic. Anyterminal wrongly placed that won’t blow by two-way comm should be run.NOTE: Two-way comm here does not mean invalidative or evaluative questions orcomments by auditor.SELECTED PERSONS SCOUTThis is the assessment most used. It is applied to the persons in the preclear’s present life.There are several loaded questions which can be used and there are several observationsto be made by the auditor.QUESTIONS: “Who is to blame for the condition you are in?”"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"“Who do you know or have known that you’d really hate to be?”“Who really had it in for you?” “Who do you know or have known that you dislike thinking about?”To be observed by auditor:Comm lag: Willingness or unwillingness to communicate about a specific person.Physical and emotional effect produced by discussion of specific person: agitation, voicechange, blushing, dopiness, etc.NOTE: Auditor must realize that preclear has no power of choice in the selection ofterminals. The terminal is chosen by the auditor.In a case where the preclear does not answer up to questions or shows no useful (to theassessment) effects from questions, simply select the person who is realest to the preclearand proceed with the process. Continue running the persons in preclear’s present life onbasis of who is realest until preclear is able to answer up to assessment questions. Realestperson at start may turn out to be the auditor. If so, run it.OVERT-WITHHOLD SELECTED PERSONS STRAIGHT WIRE- A TYPE 6—STRAIGHT WIRE PROCESSCOMMANDS:“Think of something you have done to .” “Thank you.”“Think of something you have withheld from .” “Thank you.” Or“Recall something you have done to .” “Thank you.”“Recall something you have withheld from .” “Thank you.”The use of the “think of’ command rather than the “recall” allows the preclearto plow through where his track is jammed and incidents are not easilyseparated, to the point where he can recall. In either case commands are runalternately, one for one.POSITION: Auditor and preclear seated facing each other at a comfortable distance.PURPOSE:To put the preclear at knowing cause toward the people in his current life sothat those people can no longer restimulate the preclear in livingness.TRAININGAny terminal run with this process is flat when that terminal can no longerSTRESS:restimulate the preclear’s reactive bank. When the preclear canfind no new incidents to recall and must repeat old incidents to continueprocess, a given terminal can be considered flat. Make sure he is repeatingincidents and not recalling similar incidents before ending the run on thatterminal. Also, the first few repeats may be just the preclear’s way of filling ina comm lag. Student should observe and understand phenomena occurringwith this process. Where assessment has been properly made, the preclearwill manifest various mis-emotions ranging from below 0.0 on the tone scaleup to 2.0 and emotions up to 4.0. The NOT-ISNESS on the case will showup as attempts to not-is the auditor, process or anything preclear’s attentiontouches. The preclear, at first, will not correctly assign the reasons for hismis-emotions and discomforts and will blame them on the auditor, etc. This isan example of COROLLARY No. 3 of AXIOM 58 in action. This process isrun “muzzled” by the student in training. Muzzled auditing is done as follows:At the beginning of session, instructor makes an assessment of the preclear’scase and chooses the terminal to be run. He gets the preclear’s agreement torun the process and does a very brief clearing of the command with thepreclear. Then, the student auditor says, “Start of session,” and gives the first"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"command. When preclear has answered the auditor acknowledges and goeson to the next command. If the preclear originates anything, either as astatement, comment or question the auditor nods his head as anacknowledgement. If the preclear asks to have the command repeated, theauditor nods his head and repeats it. This is continued until end of session oruntil process is flat on that terminal. If student has any question or thinksterminal is flat, he puts his hand behind his chair and wig-wags to getinstructor’s attention. He does not leave his chair. Near end of sessioninstructor gives the team notice that the session will end in two minutes. At theend of that time, when preclear has answered the last command and has beenacknowledged, the student auditor says, “End of session.” This is all there isto muzzled auditing done by students. The student auditor uses only TR 0,TR2, TR3 (duplicative command) and handles originations with a nod of hishead, only. No rudiments or two-way comm beyond “Start of session” and“End of session”. Student should understand that when he runs this process(and some others) on preclears in the field, he should use muzzled auditingwhenever he finds himself with any tendency to over-communicate or withany preclear who ARC breaks easily. Student should also understand thatOvert-Withhold Selected Persons, Third Rail, ARC Break Straight Wire andNot-is Straight Wire can all restimulate so much automatic NOT-ISNESS thatthe preclear will at times apparently lose his bank, his memory, and even theauditing command and its meaning. The only action indicated when thisoccurs is to persist with the process.HISTORY:Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in the 21st ACC, in Washington, D.C., in1959, as a means of ensuring wider and more predictable case gains by moreauditors, even unskilled ones.FACTUAL HAVINGNESS—A TYPE 5—OBJECTIVE PROCESSCOMMANDS: “Look around here and find something you have.” “Thank you.” “ Lookaround here and find something you would continue. “ “Thank you.” “Lookaround here and find something you would permit to vanish.” “Thank you.”Commands are each flattened in turn before going on to next command.Process can be begun on any of the three commands, but the above ordershould be followed. If process is begun on “vanish” the next command to berun is “have”.POSITION: Auditor and preclear seated facing each other at a comfortable distance andwith preclear facing majority of auditing room.PURPOSE:To remedy havingness objectively. To bring about the preclear’s ability tohave, or not have, his present time environment and to permit him to alter hisconsiderations of what he has, what he would continue and what he wouldpermit to vanish.TRAININGTo be run smoothly without invalidative questions. One of the most STRESS:effective processes known when thinkingness can be controlled somewhat.The student should thoroughly understand that when a preclear is set onwasting, the vanish command will at first occupy the majority of auditing timespent on this process. Student should understand that the three commands canbe each flattened in order any number of times and that running one of thecommands is quite apt to unflatten the other two. Process should be continueduntil this no longer occurs.THIRD RAIL is a special form of FACTUAL HAVINGNESS"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"COMMANDS are the same as in Factual Havingness. However the commands are &POSITION: run in a special ratio of: 8 commands of “vanish”2 commands of “continue” and 1 command of “have”.PURPOSE:To remedy extreme conditions of NOT-ISNESS. To remedy obsessive waste.To permit use of the process without bogging preclear in any one of thecommands.TRAININGStudent should realize that there is very seldom any reason for altering thisSTRESS:ratio and should never Q and A with the preclear’s complaints about doing the“continue” or “vanish” commands. Student should understand that Third Railshould be run where auditor is uncertain where to begin with FactualHavingness.HISTORY:Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., in 1958, as the bestform of objective havingness. Originally developed by L. Ron Hubbard inLondon in 1955 as “Terrible Trio”. Third Rail developed by L. Ron Hubbardin London for the 5th London ACC.RUDIMENTS—A TYPE 1 PROCESS—OPENING AND CLOSING SESSIONSCOMMANDS: None as such. Rudiments is the establishment of the agreements basic to anauditing session, and the termination of them, at end of session. Studentsmust understand what the rudiments are and be able to use them with anypreclear who is capable of agreeing to them, by two-way communication.They are:1. Auditor2. Preclear3. Auditing room4. Start of session5. Preclear’s goal for session.Auditor, by two-way comm, gets preclear’s agreement to each of these,allowing preclear to state his own goals. The above order is not necessarilythe order in which they are established. There should be enough two-waycomm to get the preclear’s agreement and no more. The auditor shoulddetermine for himself, but not tell the preclear, what he (the auditor) intends todo with the session. At the end of session auditor makes sure the preclear isreleased from agreements. Auditor does not argue with the preclear about thepreclear’s goals.NOTE:If a preclear cannot communicate about the rudiments or be brought to agreewith them fairly easily, CCH 1, 2, 3, 4 should be run with only “Start ofsession” spoken by the auditor as total rudiments. Rudiments are not usedotherwise with any preclear who needs to be run on CCH 1, 2, 3, 4.Alternatively, for more accessible cases, do “muzzled” auditing as describedabove.MOCK UP A PICTURE FOR WHICH YOU CAN BE TOTALLYRESPONSIBLE"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"—A TYPE 4—SUBJECTIVE PROCESSCOMMAND:“Mock up a picture for which you can be totally responsible.” “Thank you.”POSITION:Auditor and preclear seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE:To put preclear at cause with regard to mental image pictures to the degree thatengrams are under his control.TRAININGThat preclear not be run on this process before he is willing to carrySTRESS:out a subjective process command exactly as given. Earlier processes shouldbe well flattened before this is attempted. Otherwise the preclear will be givenloses. The command means exactly what it says and the preclear’sthinkingness must be well enough under control for him to view the commandthat way. This process should not be run for ever without an occasionalflattening of NOT-IS Straight Wire.HISTORY:Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., in 1958.RE-EXPERIENCE AND EXPERIENCE PROCESS—A TYPE 4—SUBJECTIVE PROCESSCOMMANDS:“What part of your life would you be willing to re-experience?” “Thank you.”“What part of the future would you be willing to experience?” “Thank you.”Commands run alternately, one for one.POSITION:Auditor and preclear seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE:To bring about the preclear’s ability to re-experience his past without enduringconsequence and to confront the future without restimulation.TRAININGThat student understand that the process is run until flat and thatSTRESS:student be aware of what “flat” is. When the preclear can easily get out of anyincident he gets into and when he can re-experience those things withoutenduring consequence. Where engrams are encountered with the process theauditor should attempt to find out the year of its occurrence by two-way command flash answers and should record the dates found. The auditor must not gointo general two-way comm with the preclear about the incidents preclearcontacts. Never end the process while preclear is sticking in an incident.HISTORY:Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., in 1959.PRESENT TIME PROBLEMS—PART OF RUDIMENTS—TYPE I PROCESSESCOMMANDS:Auditor, by two-way comm, discovers the preclear’s present time problemand discusses it with him. If it blows on this basis, fine. If not, we move outof Type 1 Processes. To handle the present time problem other than by two-way comm, discuss it with the preclear and get the names of the terminalsinvolved. Ask the preclear which of these is realest. Run the one he nameswith Selected Persons Overt-Withhold Straight Wire. Discuss the problem.Find which of the remaining terminals is most real to the preclear. Run it withS.P.O.W.S.W. Discuss the problem and so on until the problem is run out,which is when the preclear does not need to do anything about it.POSITION:Auditor and preclear seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart."},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"PURPOSE:To remove the surface difficulty that is the present time problem so that theauditing session can progress.TRAININGStudent should know definition of a problem and should know verySTRESS:well what happens to auditing sessions where present time problem is unflat.A problem is “The conflict arising from two opposing intentions”. A presenttime problem is one that exists in present time, in a real universe. It is any setof circumstances that so engages the attention of the preclear that he feels heshould be doing something about it instead of being audited. Auditor usesquestions based on definition of present time problem to find present timeproblems. Never leave a present time problem half run. Preclears with whomthe rudiments cannot be readily established should not be run on present timeproblems but should be run on CCH 1, 2, 3, 4.HISTORY:Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in London in 1952.ARC BREAK STRAIGHT WIRE—A TYPE 6 PROCESSCOMMAND: “Recall an ARC break.” “When?” “Thank you.”POSITION: Auditor and preclear seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE:To as-is ARC breaks. To bring about the preclear’s ability to confront and as-is ARC breaks. To straighten out the preclear’s time track which has becomecollapsed by ARC breaks in restimulation. To key out and take out ofrestimulation the “Rock” chain.TRAININGTo not acknowledge the preclear’s execution of the command untilSTRESS:the time of the ARC break has been established and to acknowledge with goodTR 2 when the time is established. To accept preclear’s reality as to “when”.If he says, “It occurred the year I graduated from high school,” accept it andgo on to next command. Assist him with two-way comm when he hasdifficulty locating time. Flash answers may also be used for this. Do not leaveprocess until preclear can easily get out of incidents he gets into on theprocess. Process is flat when recalling ARC breaks no longer produces undueamounts of mis-emotion. Student should understand that the process has thelimitation of being somewhat hard to clear command with person unfamiliarwith the term “ARC”.HISTORY:Developed by L. Ron Hubbard in Washington, D.C., in 1958.NOTE:In handling ARC breaks with the auditor, the auditor should use SelectedPersons Overt-Withhold with the auditor as the terminal when the break issevere. Otherwise, use TR 5N.NOT-IS STRAIGHT WIRE—A TYPE 6—STRAIGHT WIRE PROCESSCOMMANDS:“Recall a time you implied something was unimportant.” “Thank you.”“Recall a time somebody else thought something was important.” “Thankyou.” Commands run alternately, one for one.POSITION:Auditor and preclear seated facing each other a comfortable distance apart.PURPOSE:To bring NOT-ISNESS (Axiom 11) under preclear’s knowing control and toreduce the NOT-ISNESS in the preclear’s bank.

(See Axioms 11D, 18 and22.)Pcs divide into three general classes:1. Those who have 3D pictures and good time sense.2. Those who are occluded with black, colored or invisible fields and poor time sense.3. Those who dub-in and have no time sense.The scale of deterioration of a case is as above. First there are 3D copies of the realuniverse, then there is the action of not-ising these pictures (while they’re still there) andfinally, while not-ising, substituting false pictures.This process is aimed at case types 2 and 3 above. (ARC Break Straight Wire alsohandles type 2 but not so well as type 3.)Types 2 and 3 press into invisibility pictures by making them “unimportant”. This is theclue word to unreality, stupidity, occlusion and dub-in. (See the Logics.)The cycle which occurs is that the person gets overwhelmed with other people’s declaredimportance. They counter by not-ising the importance of others. The reverse cycle of othersreducing the pc’s own importances is not run in Not-Is Straight Wire as it reduces havingness.The commands of Not-Is Straight Wire are only these and no other:“Recall a time you implied something was unimportant.” Pc does. “When?” Pc says orauditor assists him by pegging it on an E-Meter.This is run for about an hour.

This is thecommand which asks for out-of-Affinity moments, out-of-Reality moments and out of-Communication incidents.All after charge is based on prior ARC. Therefore for a withhold to exist there must havebeen communication earlier. ARC incidents are basic on all chains. Out of ARC are later on thechain. One has to get a basic to blow a chain. Otherwise one gets recurring answers. (Pc bringsup same incident over and over as you don’t have the basic on the chain.)You can alternate an ARC command with an out-of-ARC command. “What have youdone?” (means one had to reach for and contact) can be alternated with “What haven’t youdone?” (means not reached for and not contacted).But if one runs the out-of-ARC (not reached for and not contacted) process only the pcwill soon bog.On the other hand an ARC process runs on and on with no bad side effects, i.e. “Whathave you done?”“What bad thing have you done?” is a mixture of ARC and out-of-ARC.

In short, do not complete this process onany pc beyond the level of Mest Clear unless the pc has been sent for a course. This will saveconsiderable upset and instability in the long run. It is a technical fact having nothing to do witheconomics of Central Orgs.The only overt we can do is to fail to disseminate correct data. We can refuse to processwithout any overt occurring. But we cannot fail to disseminate without an overt. Study it outand you’ll see it’s true.I will not give you much theory on this at this writing beyond a statement that all apparentdynamics on people are inverted from their sixth dynamic and that the theory of confusion andthe stable datum is paramount here.In the process we remove the confusion and permit the pc to release the various terminalsand ideas.Later assessment and the running of terminals is probably needful.The basic process was looked for first in 1951. There was a lecture on it called “Motionand Emotion” and a talk about the “governor” of a pc’s speed of advance. Since then I have hadto search very hard and it has taken eight years to match up processes to hit at this.I have now done this.The rundown is as follows, every session: Presession Model Session Help Alternate Confront HavingnessThe thing on which Help is run is MOTION. The commands are these:“What motion have you helped?”“What motion have you not helped?”Do not run “What motion could you help” or any invent process. Help, being aresponsibility process, gives us the only practical way to get the pc to face a non-terminal likeMotion."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"This is Mest Clear Route, Theta Clear Route, OT Route.If the pc runs to flat meter, assess for a terminal, run that terminal flat, then run moreMotion as above exactly.

The “Instructor” audits each casethrough the co-auditor.All pcs present can be put on one meter at the instructor’s desk by means of leads and amultiple switch. This is of considerable use and is authorized for all Central Orgs, PEFoundations.ASSESSMENTAn assessment is a necessity on each case. At the course’s start, assess rapidly with ameter and then when the majority are running on terminals go back and do a longer assessmenton the hard one. Keep a record of your assessment. But don’t spend all your time favouringhard cases. It makes other cases tend to toughen to get your attention.If a case isn’t getting meter fluctuation on the meter at the instructor’s desk, check into it.A running case gets a changing needle and a changing tone arm.Keeping a record of tone arm position and needle state for each case helps you keep track.It’s done by making a three column roster, the same one you used for assessment.PROCESSESYou have three processes you may now use.1.O/W on a selected terminal “What have you done to ?” “What have you withheld from ?” A good assessment for this is: “What person do you have problems about?” Run thatperson.2. Comm process on a body part. “From where could you communicate to a ?” on an E-Meter, assess for a body part that falls not what the pc says. The part that falls will bereal to the pc. An obviously ill part may not be real. When the chosen part is flat orreasonably so, assess for a new body part. Body parts are safer to run on co-audit thanindefinite terminals. But “friend” or “car” can still be used. Use the paper trick on all co-audit comm processes.3. Responsibility process “What part of your life have you been responsible for?” Thisrequires no assessment but it is rather rougher than the first two above."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"PROCUREMENTYour best procurement comes from word of mouth and happy cases.If you supervise well and make sure the co-audit pc gets gains, you will have good wordof mouth.Free co-audit weeks given for one reason or another (such as highest scores of PE coursequiz) is good procurement.Well advertised free PE and a good comm course are the best procurements. A good infopackage mailed to everyone on your list and all callers is a necessity.Being on time, handling bodies in an orderly way are good procurement.HAS CERTIFICATESHAS certificate requirements have changed.A passing grade on an examination of materials covered is all it takes at this time.Later we may require that they pass a comm course too. But not now.So examine your past students on essentials they’ve been taught and as they pass sendtheir names and addresses to your central organization and the student will receive a nice HAScertificate.Your student having a certificate will help procurement.SUMMARYPE co-audit is running well where auditors are doing it by the book, running badly wherethe handling of processes, students and paper work is sloppy. Good total 8-C = good course.Courses where regular charges are made and collected get better graphs.Here and there a PE co-audit set up is running poorly because the auditor instructor doesnot have info packages and does not even try to handle bodies walking in.Most everywhere PE co-audit is doing well. I am very proud of the way most auditors aretrying and winning. Thank You.By the way, the Scientology population of earth has exactly doubled in the last tenmonths!  L.

What one does against his willoperates as an overt act against oneself. But where one’s will to do has deteriorated tounwillingness to do anything, lack of will is itself an aberration.Variations in the reactions of pcs to responsibility processes stem from the pc’s belief thathis power of choice is being or has been overthrown. Where an auditor has a pc balking againsta responsibility process, the pc has conceived that the auditor is forcing responsibility on the pcand very little good comes of the session.There is nothing wrong, basically, with doingness. But where one is doing something heis unwilling to do, aberration results. One does, in such a case, while unwilling to do. Theresult is doingness without responsibility.In the decline of any state into slavery as in Greece, or into economic strangulation of theindividual as in our modern western society, doingness is more and more enforced andwillingness to do is less and less in evidence. At length people are doing without beingresponsible. From this results bad workmanship, crime, indigence and its necessities forwelfarism. At length there are so many people who are unwilling to do that the few left have totake full burden of the society upon their backs. Where high unwillingness to do exists,democracy is then impossible, for it but votes for the biggest handout.Where high unwillingness to do exists then we have a constant restimulation of all thethings one is really unwilling to do such as overt acts. Forcing people who do not want to workto yet work restimulates the mechanism of overt acts with, thereby, higher and higher crimeratio, more and more strikes and less and less understanding of what it is all about.The individual who has done something bad that he was not willing to do then identifiesanything he does with any unwillingness to do—when of course he has done this many times.Therefore all doingness becomes bad. Dancing becomes bad. Playing games becomes bad.Even eating and procreation become bad. And all because unwillingness to do something badhas evolved and identified into unwillingness to do.The person who has done something bad restrains himself by withholding doingness inthat direction. When at length he conceives he has done many many bad things, he becomes atotal withhold. As you process him you encounter the recurring phenomenon of his realizationthat he has not been as bad as he thought he was. And that’s the wonderful part of it. Peopleare never as bad as they think they are—and certainly other people are never as bad as onethinks they have been.The basic wonder is that people police themselves. Out of a concept of good theyconceive themselves to be bad, and after that seek every way they can to protect others fromself. A person does this by reducing his own ability. He does it by reducing his own activity.He does this by reducing his own knowingness.Where you see a thetan who sleeps too much and does too little, where you see a person"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"who conceives bad doingness on every hand, you see a person who is safeguarding othersfrom the badness of himself or herself.Now there is another extreme. A person who must do because of economic or otherwhips, and yet because of his own concept of his own badness dares not do, is liable tobecome criminal. Such a person’s only answer to doingness is to do without taking anyresponsibility and this, when you examine the dynamics, falls easily into a pattern ofdramatized overt acts. Here you have a body that is not being controlled, where mostknowledge is obscured and where responsibility for others or even self is lacking. It is an easystep from criminality to insanity, if indeed there is any step at all. Such people cannot bepoliced since being policed admits of some obedience. Lacking control there is no ability toobey, and so they wind up simply hating police and that is that.Only when economic grips are so tight or political pressure is so great as it is in Russia dowe get high criminality and neurotic or psychotic indexes. Whenever doing is accompanied byno will to do, irresponsibility for one’s own acts can result.Basically, then, when one is processing a pc, one is seeking to rehabilitate a willingnessto do. In order to accomplish this one must rehabilitate the ability to withhold on the pc’s owndeterminism (not by punishment) further bad actions. Only then will the pc be willing torecover from anything wrong with the pc—since anything wrong with the pc is self-imposed inorder to prevent wrongdoing at some past time.All types of responsibility processes have this as their goal: to rehabilitate the willingnessto do and the ability to withhold on one’s own determinism.Restraint in doing something one knows he should do is a secondary deterrent but comeswith other offshoots of responsibility into the cognition area.Thus we have a formula of attack on any given area where the pc cannot do, is havingtrouble or cannot take responsibility: (a) Locate the area. (b) Find a terminal to represent it. (c)Find what the pc has done to that terminal that he thinks he should have withheld. (d) Reduceall such incidents.In short all we have to do to rehabilitate any case is find an area where the terminal is stillreal to the preclear and then get rid of what he has done and withheld, and we come up with animproved responsibility.Of all the responsibility processes, the oldest one I developed is still the best one by testand that is:“What have you done to a (terminal)?”“What have you withheld from a (terminal)?”The processing results depend in large part on the accuracy of assessment, on thewillingness of the auditor to process the pc and upon running the process as flat as it will gobefore finding another terminal.Assessment accuracy depends upon skilled use of the E-Meter. Dynamic Straight Wire isbest, and a weather eye upon the tone arm to see what terminal varies it, once one has thedynamic and from that has selected a terminal.The willingness of the auditor to process the pc depends upon the confidence of theauditor to obtain results—and this is established by deletion of things the auditor has done topcs and withheld from pcs in general and this pc in particular. Thus co-audit teams would beright always if they took each other as the terminals to be run first, get these pretty flat (andkeep them flat during processing with “What have you done to me?” “What have you withheldfrom me?”), then as the next thing to do run the sex of the auditor off the pc, then clean up"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Dianetics or Scientology (or use this as step two). And only then go into “case”. That would bea pretty fine co-audit team after they have survived the first explosions and gotten them gone.Then in searching out areas to run as a case, care should be taken not to over-run aterminal or under-run one. A pc running out of answers can get very restless.Responsibility can be rehabilitated on any case and when it has been you have a clear andthat’s all there is to it.L.

The preclear who only gets death pictures orbad pictures is somewhere late on the cycle of action or late on an inversion cycle.This preclear believes that every cause brings about a destruction.Thus he falls out of communication, since any and all received communication willdestroy him, he thinks.All this is covered in the First Melbourne ACC Tapes and will probably not be covered tosuch a degree again. The Melbourne ACC Tapes are consecutive with the Philadelphia lectureseries (fall 1952), and are a little out of the way of our present theory, but have a special placein know-how.Out of this we now have an understanding of what a limited process is. Any processwhich makes the preclear create is a limited process and should be avoided. Such processes as“Tell a Lie” are creative processes.The preclear has creation tangled up with cause and cause tangled up with the overt-motivator sequence. The thing that straightens all this out is any version of responsibility runwith the pc at cause. Earlier the best we had to straighten this out was confront. Responsibilityis confront and is very senior to confront as a process.When a pc over-creates he accumulates the unconfronted debris. All you have to do torestimulate debris (stiffen up the bank) is to run the pc on some version of create process.Havingness is a confront process and straightens out the create factor.Havingness is the lowest version of responsibility; Confront is the next lowest; Overt-Withhold is the next; and at our present top for practical purposes is just plain responsibility.Actually all these are responsibility processes.Create is bad only when one does not take responsibility for the creation.The key process of all processes at this writing is being responsible for having beenirresponsible.There is a great deal of anatomy to responsibility. A great many answers lie waiting on itstrack. When one maligns another, he has not taken responsibility for the acts of that other"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"person and so is separate from that other person.One of the highest points of knowingness which is not at this time known is whether weare all one or if we are actually separate beings. Enough responsibility run achieves a subjectiveanswer to this.While several offshoots of this present technology are under test at this time it can be saidwith certainty now that the best version of responsibility for most cases is:“What have you done to a (terminal)?”“What have you withheld from a (terminal)?”It will be seen at once that what could you do to and what could you withhold from aterminal is a create process, and is therefore slightly limited and leaves debris. Thus it can besaid with finality overt/withhold rather than cause/withhold is the best process.In the presence of ARC breaks, havingness is a must on any responsibility process and isalways a good preventive for flops. Don’t forget havingness. We know now that it is thelowest rung of responsibility. This becomes evident when we examine the withhold aspects ofhavingness.Plain ordinary “What could you be responsible for” is of course a very fine process andoddly enough often goes lower (for a short run) than overt/withhold. Responsibility isn’t just ahigh level process. It works where it works.It is interesting that while running pure raw responsibility in its non-create form (whathave you been responsible for) we see anew the old know-to-mystery scale revealed.Factual Havingness can be run in its trio form with good results: “Look around here and find something you could have” “Look around here and find something you would permit to continue” “Look around here and find something you would let vanish”The old restrictions and know-how of running this still apply.“Look around here and find something you could have” is of course a wonderful process.And whenever you run an hour and a half of any other version of responsibility you had betterrun half an hour of “Look around here and find something you could have” and be on the safeside.SUMMARYThe data in this bulletin is far from merely theoretical. To some auditors it will come as anemergency super frantic hysterical rush item for they should shift over any version ofresponsibility they are running to the above versions.Don’t run any other version of overt/withhold than that given above. You can runresponsibility as itself on any incident or terminal if the pc can take it. Run a half hour ofhavingness for every hour and a half of any responsibility subjective process.NOTEInstead of the CCHs for that low low level case, why not get it going with havingness asabove and then find any terminal that ticks on a meter and run O/W on that terminal. Then run"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"more havingness. Then find another terminal that ticks and run O/W on that. Then run morehavingness.

We now have them.I am truly sorry that this took seven years. Actually, it took more than twenty-five.Under other “systems of research” it could not have been done. It was financed at first bymy writings and expeditions. Some 15,000,000 words of fact and fiction articles ranging frompolitical articles to westerns were consumed in a large part by this research-but it was free to actif not free from sweat.No bullying dictator wanted it for his mass slaveries as happened to poor misguidedPavlov. No big corporation wanted it for a better Madison Avenue approach to advertising—another kind of slavery. No big RESEARCH FOUNDATION like Ford was there to interjecttheir “America First” philosophy. These had not paid for it; therefore they didn’t own it. Thework stayed free. Thus it prospered. It did not wither in support of some aberrated “cause.” Itbloomed.But the violence of protecting this work while continuing it took a toll nevertheless.Special interests believed it must be evil if they did not own it. Between 1950 and 1956,2,000,000 traceable dollars were spent to halt this work. Newspaper articles, radio ads (as inSeattle from the University of Washington), bribed “patrons,” financed “patients” all costmoney. You hear the repercussions of this campaign even today.Money could not stop this work by then. It was too late. If anything had been wrong withour organizations, my character, our intentions or abilities the whole advance would havecrumbled. But we had no Achilles’ heels. We carried on. All that has survived of this attack bythe two APAs, the AMA and several universities is a clutter of rumors concerning your sanity"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"and mine—and rumors no longer financed will some day die.And so the work has emerged free of taint and misguided slants. It is itself. It does whatit says it does. It contains no adroit curves to make one open to better believing some “ism.”That makes it singular today in a world gone mad with nationalism. Buddhism, when it came tothe millions, was no longer free of slant and prejudice. Taoism itself became a nationaljingoism far from any work of Lao-Tze. Even Christianity had its “pitch.” And if these greatworks became curved, with all the personal force of their creators, how is it that our littletriumph here can still be found in a clear state?Well, no diamonds and palaces have been accepted from rajahs, no gratuitous printing ofresults has been the gift of warlords, no testament had to be written 300 years after the fact.For this we can thank Johann Gutenberg, and the invention of magnetic tape.Therefore, although we have no such stature as the Great Philosophies, I charge you withthis—look to source writings, not to interpretations. Look to the original work, not offshoots.If I have fought for a quarter of a century, most of it alone, to keep this work fromserving to uphold the enslavers of Man, to keep it free from some destructive “pitch” or slant,then you certainly can carry that motif a little further.I’ll not always be here on guard.

Pc must to some degree be at cause with regard to session ifonly by wanting it or some result of it, or to escape some elsewhere consequence. This step isCCH 0 but it is run only to establish the thetan to some degree at cause with regard to the wholesession. This must be improved throughout the intensive. Applies even to dead pcs.STEP TWO: Establish obedience of some part of the auditing room to the pc. Here hemust begin at some level of knowingness. He must KNOW that he himself, when ordered todo so, can gain some compliance on the part of the auditing room. This includes his own body.Thus we get “You seat that body in that chair. Thank you.” “You make that body continue to liein that bed. Thank you.” We also get CCH 1. And we get a very important but neglectedprocess run with two objects wherein the pc himself is ordered to keep one then the other fromgoing away (alternately), hold it still, make it more solid, all with two objects. Stress is onYOU do it.STEP THREE: Establish control of pc’s body by pc. Here we have CCH 2, but we alsohave an even more important series of processes, S-C-S in all their ramifications on the body.Here is pc at cause with regard to body. It is expected that lots of S-C-S will be run on pcs.STEP FOUR: Make pc even more conscious of auditor and place him somewhat at causewith ARC. The mechanical steps of this are CCH 3 and CCH 4 but these steps are only valid ifthey heighten ARC and make the pc decide HE did it.STEP FIVE: Establish pc as cause over Mest by establishing pc’s ideas as cause overMest. Here, running these, we again emphasize YOU DO IT. The basic process of this isCONNECTEDNESS with the PC doing the connecting. Control Trio, Trio, Look around here"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"and tell me what part of the environment you would be willing to be responsible for. You look,You connect, You make ....... Alter the old commands to put pc at cause point in doing these.STEP SIX: Establish pc’s control over Mest subjective. Creative Processes, RecallUnwanted and Lost Objects. Then and Now Solids. First step on this in some cases isconquering black ‘‘field’’ and invisible “field.” This is done by a repair of havingness overblack masses and then invisible masses, run even if pc goes unconscious. When field is clearedup, start on a gradient scale of mock-ups and get pc able to mock things up. Then run “Keep itfrom going away” until flat on mock-ups. Then run “Hold it still” on mock-ups. Then run“Make it more solid” on mock-ups. All this until pc really has fine, solid mock-ups. Typicalcommand, “Mock up a and keep it from going away. Thank you.” RULE: A PC’SFACSIMILES ARE NOT STORED, THEY ARE MADE IN THE INSTANT AND UNMADEBY THE PC, therefore remedy of mock-ups AND THEIR PERSISTENCE is actually a directroute to clear and winds up with no obsessive mock-up making (which we call a bank). Avaluable side process here: “Decide to make a mock-up. Decide that will ruin the game. Decidenot to do it.” Also this one, “Decide to make a mock-up everyone can see. Decide that wouldruin the game. Decide not to do it.” A TOTAL REMEDY OF MOCK-UPS WOULD MAKE ABOOK ONE CLEAR.STEP SEVEN: Establish pc’s control over his “bank.” “Mock up a facsimile and (keep itfrom going away, and when that is flat, hold it still, and when that is flat, make it a little moresolid).” Run this alternately with “Mock up that wall (keep it from going away, hold it still,make it a little more solid).” Run the “Keep it from going away” on a facsimile one command,then the wall one command, until flat, then shift to “Hold it still” same way, then shift to “Makeit more solid,” same way.STEP EIGHT: Make some Time.AUDITING TRUTHS:ARC breaks must all be repaired thoroughly. ARC Must Be Maintained.There is no real liability to a pc in this universe except one: becoming total subject ofMest.Life versus Life, no liability. Life via Mest versus Life, some liability. Life versus Mest,total liability.A pc must be kept at Cause as much as possible.An Intensive in Brief for Practical UseBegin by carefully easing the pc into session with CCH 0 but don’t talk too much orpermit him to talk too much as you will as-is his havingness.Establish control of a room object with “You make that chair sit on the floor.”Get wheeling with S-C-S and run it up to Stop-C-S.Run Connectedness inside the auditing room and then outside with “You make thatconnect with you.” or “You look around here and tell me something you could have.” Or, “Youlook around here and tell me something you could be responsible for.”Run an engram or do Then and Now Solids and put pc at cause with regard to facsimiles.If you have any time left, do it all over again."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"DEFINITIONS, GOALSThere are three possible goals in processing a preclear. The first of these is Mest Clear.The second is Theta Clear. The third is Operating Thetan.By Mest Clear is meant a BOOK ONE CLEAR. Here we defined clear in terms offacsimiles. This is a rather simple mechanical definition. It said in effect that so far as humanbeings were concerned our preclear finally arrived at a point where he had full color-visio-sonic, had no psychoses or neuroses and could recall what had happened to him in thislifetime. This is almost a baby-talk sort of clear. It pays no heed at all to identification with abody and it has nothing to do with ability. Today, by running Creative Processes (four yearsold!) we can turn on visible facsimiles and weed out the bottom spots of operations and whatnot. This is actually a rather easy goal. Somehow I’ve never given a real tight procedure forachieving it even though the essence of the processes has been around for a very long time.COMPLETING STEP SIX OF CLEAR PROCEDURE IN FULL GIVES US A MESTCLEAR.By Theta Clear is meant a Clear obtained by Clear Procedure as is being delineated in thisregimen. The main trouble is, amusingly, trying to reach Mest Clear without running into ThetaClear. I personally don’t believe now that it can be done without actually shoving the pc back inhis head every time he pops out. Thus the goal of this procedure is actually THETA CLEAR.This is what we mean then when we say “clear.” We mean a Theta Clear.By Operating Thetan we mean Theta Clear PLUS ability to operate functionally against orwith Mest and other life forms. For the first time we have here the matter of ABILITY. AnOperating Thetan is not an absolute term. Theta Clear is a more absolute term than OperatingThetan. An Operating Thetan is a Theta Clear (not a mystical mystic out on an inversion) whocan also do something.Thus we have two goals which contain no ambition to accomplish anything and one goalwhich contains much ambition. Now here is another puzzle in definitions. Which is highest,the Theta Clear or the Operating Thetan? Well, the answer to that is not what we used to think.As DOINGNESS is not really at the top we find that we will probably make an OperatingThetan before we achieve Theta Clear for a Theta Clear would probably not be much interestedin operating. Therefore, we see the actual goal we are trying to reach, no matter in whichlimited sense, is Operating Thetan.Operating Thetan is then a highly variable goal. A thetan who can move in and out of abody is actually operating somewhat but he is not really a Theta Clear since a Theta Clear, in itshighest sense, means no further dependency upon bodies.The goals of the auditor, therefore, do not rack up one, two, three, Mest Clear, ThetaClear, Operating Thetan. They actually stack up on a very gradient scale between thetaninoperative and a thetan who can operate. The auditor is therefore seeking to reach with the pc astate wherein the pc can function. At no time does the auditor suddenly arrive with a pc in astartling new shiny state all of a sudden that can be called a certain thing. In that pcs oftenexpect this suddenly bursting “into the light” the auditor is subject to disappointment when hehas actually achieved an enormous gain for the pc. In other words, pcs gain on a smoothgradient scale and do not suddenly become something.There is only one point on the road up where something does happen and that isexteriorization. When the pc exteriorizes for the first time he feels there must be a cause forrejoicing and has the idea he has gotten somewhere. Well, in fact you could achieve the sameresult by hitting him over the head with a club. He would exteriorize. The point is notexteriorizing the pc but cutting down his dependency upon a body. A pc who exteriorizes andis not carried right on with the same process that sprang him out of his head until it is flat willgo back into his head in an hour or a week and will be harder to dig out the next time."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"In other words, this point of exteriorization does happen and does mean to the pc that heis himself. But it shouldn’t mean very much to an auditor beyond his noticing that this phasehas been entered in the case. For in truth thetans don’t stay out of their bodies very long if theyare not in good shape. Thus exteriorization means less than ability to act, to live, to be and do.The attention of the auditor should be upon the increasing ability of the pc to handle life, notupon the distance the pc gets from his body. Is that clear? Well, it tells us that arriving at a stateof Clear is easy if that means stable outside and that any state of betterment on the road toOperating Thetan is an honest achievement.Thus an auditor should at all times go toward the state of Operating Thetan and should notbe mixed up in the oddities of exteriorization for a day.HGC Clear Procedure goes straight toward exteriorization and achieves it. But it alsogoes straight toward increasing ability to handle life. The latter is the auditor’s best goal. Theauditing goal should go in the same direction as this new definition for Operating Thetan.An Operating Thetan can be at cause knowingly and at will over Life, Matter, Energy,Space and Time, subjectively and objectively.This Action Definition of Operating Thetan is the true goal of the auditor and if followedwith complete understanding will achieve the best possible results.In this discussion of goals and definitions, I am telling you cleanly that the goals of MestClear and Theta Clear are not worth following from the auditor’s standpoint. You can let pcsthink what they will about them. The only goal worthy of the auditor’s time WHATEVER THESTATE OF CASE OF THE PC is Operating Thetan. To achieve one on any subject it is onlynecessary to place the pc to some degree at willing and knowing cause point with regard to thatsubject. All the steps of HGC Clear Procedure are leveled at Operating Thetan. But you neednot tell your pc that. You can use the words RELEASE, MEST CLEAR, THETA CLEAR orany other if you like. Just remember there is only one payoff goal and that is Operating Thetan.MEST CLEAR: Can see facsimiles with sonic present lifetime, has no psychoses orneuroses. Upper part of APA (in UK OCA) graph. Above 13 5 IQ.THETA CLEAR: Can exist knowingly independent of bodies.RELEASE: Average a third of a graph higher than first test, above 115 IQ.OPERATING THETAN: Can be at Cause knowingly and at will over Life, Matter,Energy, Space and Time, subjectively and objectively.STEP ONEParticipation in Session by the PcWe have long known that ARC was important. Just how important it is was establishedby some tests I made in London in 1956 wherein every time the pc showed any restlessness orother signs of loss of havingness, instead of remedying havingness I carefully searched out anyfancied break of ARC and patched it up. The “loss of havingness” vanished. In other words,loss of ARC is even more important than loss of havingness since a repair of ARC restoreshavingness. Lack of havingness is only one symptom of a lack of communication.There are two ways an auditor, according to long practice, can err. One of these is topermit two-way communication to a point where the pc’s havingness is injured. The other is tochop communication to such a degree that havingness is injured. There is a point past whichcommunication is bad and short of which lack of communication is bad. Here we have auditorjudgment at play. Because the pc will fidget or go downscale in tone when his havingness"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"drops, an auditor can SEE when the pc’s havingness is being lowered. Because a pc will goanaten or start to grind into the process an auditor can tell whether or not the pc feels hiscommunication has been chopped. When either happens the auditor should take action—in thefirst instance by shutting off the pc’s outflow and getting to work and in the second instance bymaking the pc talk out any fancied communication severance.Participation in session by the pc is not something the auditor sees to at the beginning ofthe session and then forgets for the rest of the intensive. This step is continued throughout theintensive and is given as much attention as any process being run at the time. The auditor’sattention is always therefore upon two things—first the continued participation in session andsecond the action of the process.Grouped under this head we would also have ways and means of getting the pc intosession in the first place. An unconscious pc used to be an apparent roadblock. A downtone,antagonistic, you-can’t-help-me pc was also a rough one. These two things are countered byalways carefully starting a session and following through on standard CCH 0.It is as important to open a session with a baby or an unconscious person as it is with anyother preclear. It doesn’t matter whether the pc is answering up or not. It is only necessary toassume that the pc would answer if he could answer and that the mechanics of voice andgesture are simply absent from the answer. Therefore one always carefully starts every session,paying attention to what is happening, where it is happening, who is there, help, goals andproblems. Obviously anaten or inability to control the body are the present time problem of theunconscious person or the child. One can actually audit this with a plain question and simplyassume after a bit it has been answered, then give the acknowledgment and ask anotherquestion just as though the pc were in full vocal action. Auditors still fall for the belief, verycurrent, that “unconscious” people are unable to think or be aware in any way. A thetan isseldom unconscious regardless of what the body is doing or not doing.PRESENT TIME PROBLEM is a highly vital point of PRECLEAR PARTICIPATION.If a preclear is being nagged too thoroughly by a PT problem auditing can actually send himdownhill if done without addressing the problem. A whole intensive, even seventy-five hourscan be wasted if the auditor does not clear the PT PROBLEM.The preclear generally doesn’t know he has one which is nagging him, for the rough PTproblems go into the apathy band and below into forgetfulness rather rapidly. Therefore theauditor should ferret out the PT problem with an E-Meter. Adroit use of an E-Meter does notinclude evaluating for the preclear but it certainly does include ferreting out PT problems. TheE-Meter is also used for valences and sometimes psychophysical difficulties. (Auditor: Use theword “psychophysical” rather than psychosomatic and stay out of a medical field.)THE RUNNING OF A PT PROBLEM today is the most. PT problem, valences,psychophysical ailments, all run beautifully with “Mock up something worse than (terminal)”or “Invent something worse than (terminal).” To run this it is necessary to isolate theTERMINAL most intimately connected with the PT problem (or the valence or psychophysicaldifficulty). One then CLEARS THE COMMAND (and you always better do that with anycommand) and lets go.The whole idea of WORSE THAN is the whole of the dwindling spiral. People who are“trying to get better” and “be more perfect” and “think the right thought” lose all control of“getting worse,” “being imperfect” and “thinking the wrong thought.” All these WORSETHANS are then left on automatic and we arrive at something less than optimum. In fact wearrive with the dwindling spiral. We also arrive with the “point of no return.” We also arrivewith the declining ability to heal or get well. And we also arrive with old age.After running “worse than” on the PT problem, we proceed with other parts of CCH 0.Clearing help will be found quite beneficial. But to get a pc to participate who is downrightugly about it, running help is usually only a partial solution. When these only ones get going"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"they really snarl on the subject of getting audited. Here CCH 1 is of benefit. No questionsasked. But this, of course, defeats the purpose of STEP ONE.PARTICIPATION OF THE PC in the session is necessary in order to place the pcsomewhat at the cause point in the actual fact of auditing. This fits the definition. You canalways change a body or recover it from some illness by auditing without much helping the pchimself. Therefore, the pc, while under auditor control, is still somewhat at cause, what withcomm bridges and clearing commands, etc., but he is made to feel no bad effects from beingAT EFFECT if ample ARC is used. In other words, the pc can’t be entirely at cause in asession or he would be self-auditing, which isn’t good, but he can be salvaged from being atotal effect by good ARC. When the ARC drops out that DOES leave the pc at more or less totaleffect, a thing you have probably noticed.The things to be done in CCH 0 should be done thoroughly at intensive’s beginning andshould be glanced at whenever a new session starts and should get a bow when a newcommand is used. But all CCH 0 is is a collection of mechanical aids to assist the pc’sparticipation in the session and to assist the auditor in ARC. Although CCH 0 must be usedalways, it is not a total substitute for ARC.The sum of CCH 0 is find the auditor, find the auditing room, find the pc, knock out anyexisting PT problem, establish goals, clear help, get agreement on session length and get up tothe first real auditing command. CCH 0 isn’t necessarily run in that order and this isn’tnecessarily all of CCH 0, but if any of these are seriously scamped, the session willsomewhere get into trouble.When the participation of the pc ceases in a session, he must be gotten back into sessionby any means and then participation is re-established. A pc is never permitted to end a sessionon his own choice. He seeks to end them when his participation drops out of sight.The trick question “What did I do wrong?” re-establishes ARC.The problem of handling a pc who is not cooperative, who does not wish to participate, isa highly special problem. In the first place it is the pc’s engrams that do not want to continue, inthe second place it is the engrams which are doing the talking. One ordinarily tackles this casewith a formal opening of session, brief but positive, and then sails in with CCH 0, just asthough the person were unconscious, which, of course, the person is.Participation by an unconscious person, while covered above, requires the additionalrefinement of technique. ONE MUST ALWAYS FIND SOMETHING THE PRECLEAR CANDO AND THEN BETTER THAT ABILITY. An unconscious person is usually lying in bed. Ifnot the command must be varied to fit the environment. But the best command is somethinglike “You make that body lie in that bed.” A slightly upper grade process to a person sitting in achair is “You seat that body in that chair.” In such cases a grip on the pc’s hand and the use of aslight squeeze each time the auditor acknowledges considerably speeds the process.There is another special case—or maybe it isn’t so special. There are many people whocannot tackle a present time problem with a process. If the auditor sought out a PT problem andthen ran “something worse than a related terminal” or a “problem of comparable orincomparable magnitude” he would find the pc digging in hard, unable to handle the process.Thus some judgment must be used in such cases. Don’t run a PT problem on somebody invery bad shape casewise.There is an awful lot to know about starting sessions. The bad-off case and the case invery good condition alike require special handling. For the case just mentioned who cannothandle a PT problem with a process, there is always locational (TR TEN). TR TEN will run aPT problem or anything else if slowly. Thus many a person with a PT problem can onlyparticipate in a session to the extent of TR TEN, “YOU notice that object (wall, floor, chair,etc.).” By introducing in the auditor’s and pc’s bodies as a couple of the items being spotted"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"along with everything else we eventually wind up with “find the auditor, find the auditingroom, find the pc.” And we get there without a PT problem being in full bloom.In running “You notice that object” there are some things that MUST be observed. Mostimportant of these is this one: ANY PROCESS WHICH TURNS ON A SOMATIC MUST BECONTINUED UNTIL IT NO LONGER TURNS ON SOMATICS. This is true particularly ofTR TEN, 8-C and TRIO. The case hangs right there until the process is flat, whether in oneday, one year or six. Another thing which must be stressed is the inclusion of the auditor’s andpc’s bodies. Because some pcs WHEN EXTERIORIZED snap back in when they see the bodyis no reason to avoid it in TR TEN. Another thing is to make the pc use his eyes to view theobjects and if he doesn’t turn his eyes toward them, then it is up to the auditor to use manualdirection of the head and even pry the eyes open. No balks are ever permitted in auditing. If TRTEN is being run at a problem, every now and then the auditor pauses and discusses theproblem again with the pc in order to keep it in restimulation until TR TEN can run it out.The high case is a worse problem than auditors commonly believe. In the first place ahigh case can “blow” a situation out of the bank with considerable ease and if the auditor insistson sledge-hammering it out with a process, then pc participation blows rather than a facsimile.High case participation can also be misunderstood in that there are a lot of cases that thinkthey are high which aren’t. Here’s how you tell a real high case from a bogus (“I can doeverything”) case. A thetan in good shape can be cause. When he looks at something in thebank it becomes the effect. A bogus high case can think anything he wants without anythinghaving an effect on the bank. You want to watch this point because here is the definition of OTthoroughly at work. Pc at Cause. A case that has pictures and everything and is impatient to geton with it BUT DOES NOT MARKEDLY ALTER THE BANK WITH THINKING ALONEis not a high case but an old “wide open case” of Dianetic days.Two-way communication AS A PROCESS is the key to all this. If you put a pc on an E-Meter and locate a present time charge, you can, if the pc can somewhat handle his bank, gethim to two-way comm the incident flat very quickly—in five or ten minutes at the most. This isall the process used. It would take an actual E-Meter run to give you a full reality on this.Here we are looking at the basic differences amongst cases. That difference lies in theability to knowingly CAUSE. Bodies are the same, they all react alike. Banks differ onlyvaguely and only in content and significance. Engrams are engrams and they all behave alike.There is only ONE DIFFERENCE amongst pcs. We called this BASIC PERSONALITY inBOOK ONE. We can be a lot more simple about it now that I have my teeth into the subject afew more feet. The difference is DEGREE OF KNOWING CAUSABILITY. What do wemean by CAUSE? The basic, old Scientology definition is still at work. CAUSE-DISTANCE-EFFECT. Joe knowingly shoots Bill. Joe is at Cause. Bill is at Effect. Mary gives John apresent. Mary is at Cause, John is at Effect. Bill says Boo to Joe. Bill is at Cause, Joe is atEffect. But when we introduce KNOWING CAUSE and CAUSE AT WILL into this CAUSE-DISTANCE-EFFECT idea we see we have something else added. The person at Cause is therebecause he knows he is there and because he is willingly there. The person at Cause is not atCause because he does not dare be at Effect. He must be able to be at Effect. If he is afraid tobe at Effect, then he is Unwilling Cause and is at Cause only because he is very afraid of beingat Effect. Education can show a person he can be at effect without liability. Then he can be atCause without HAVING TO BE BECAUSE HE DOESN’T DARE BE AT EFFECT. Auditingin its whole operation is teaching the pc this. Pc slides from terrified effect to tolerated effect toknowing cause with regard to any incident he contacts IF HE IS AUDITED PROPERLY. Thepc who has to get rid of all his engrams because he has to get rid of them because it’s all toohorrible winds up, with good auditing, into a tolerance of the pictures since he has learned hecan tolerate them and so can swing around to Cause.So we have this great difference in pcs. DEGREE OF KNOWING CAUSABILITY is theextent that he is willing to be at Cause and the extent he is willing to know he is at Cause plusthe ability to cause things."},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"You will see this on an E-Meter in PT problem handling. Bill has a PT problem. It dropsa dial when first contacted. The auditor, using his UNDERSTANDING of Scientology, two-way comms on it. The incident discharges and no longer registers after a few minutes. Maryhas a PT problem. It drops steeply on the E-Meter. The auditor tries to two-way comm on it.The charge remains the same or Mary begins to disperse. She doesn’t hold to the subject. Theauditor at length finds that two-way comm only serves to run down her havingness. The chargeremains on the meter dial. What is the difference between Bill and Mary? Bill can be atknowing cause, Mary is either obsessive cause or heavy effect. Bill can blow facsimiles. Marycannot. On Mary the auditor is very wise to enter upon TR TEN.One version of TR TEN is called Short Spotting. “You notice that (nearby object).” Solong as the pc can see with his eyes the object or feel the auditor’s hand on it, the processworks. It is spotting right up close. If run with mediumly near and far objects (such as theroom wall) it is very effective in getting a case going. It has given some cases their first realityon auditing. BUT the rule still holds here about somatics. When a somatic is turned on with aprocess, turn it off with that process. See Auditor’s Code 13. This is entirely true of ShortSpotting. In that it almost always turns on somatics, when you start it, you have to flatten it andthat’s often lengthy.Remember this about pc participation. A low case can’t handle the bank, therefore youkeep high ARC and kid-glove him through a session. A very high case doesn’t need dynamite,therefore you retain his participation by going as rapidly as you can. A medium, average caseneeds ARC, something of dynamite, something of kid gloves, something of two-way comm.And IN ALL GOOD AUDITING, CASES IMPROVE. Just because you start a pc lowdoesn’t mean he’ll always stay low. Check the case often. See if his CAUSABILITY is rising.If it isn’t, he isn’t improving and you better go easier or heavier. PROBABLY when a casedoesn’t improve you didn’t handle a PT problem. THAT IS THE ONLY THING WHICHCAN KEEP A CASE FROM GAINING. So check every session for one.There are probably thousands of ways to gain the participation of the pc, there areprobably thousands of ways to open a session. There are probably an infinite number of trickythings you can do. However, this breadth of choice should not obscure the following:1. A pc who is not participating in the session is not at Cause.2. An auditor who isn’t able to maintain ARC, who isn’t able to “freeze” a process fora short time, even a Tone 40.0 process, and re-establish ARC, will not get results.3. The end-all of processing is the attainment of a goal, the goal of OT. One alwaysprocesses the problems and difficulties of the pc, he does not process the process. Processesonly assist in processing the pc. They will not do anything by themselves. Processes are a roadmap to the goal of OT, they are nothing in themselves. The target is the condition, thedisabilities of the pc. How one achieves the eradication of these difficulties is secondary to thefact of their eradication. Scientology is a route attained after several thousand years of noattainment by Man and the route is important and valuable and must be traveled correctly, butthe concern is the pc, not the route.4. A new auditor can be adrift with his tools. He is uncertain as to what he isattacking. He should have reality on engrams, locks, key-ins, secondaries, the time track, thekey buttons of Scientology such as Communication, Control and Havingness. Given anunderstanding of all these and the theory of Scientology itself he can almost pilot his waythrough a case with two-way comm. But two-way comm will not work if one doesn’tunderstand all the above. So two-way comm is not conversation. The pc has had a few trillionyears of that and it hasn’t made him well, so two-way comm is a highly specialized thing, donewith full understanding of the thetan, bank and body. Good two-way comm meansparticipation by the pc."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"5. Scientology is a precise commodity, something like engineering. A pc is a precisething, part animal, part pictures and part God. We want the ability to handle things and theGod, and the less unthinking responses in the pc the better off he will be. Therefore a PCWHO ISN’T COGNITING regularly is being processed beyond his ability to do and it isnecessary to drop back downscale to find something he CAN DO.6. The golden rule of processing is to find something the preclear CAN do and then toimprove his ability to do it. At once you will have participation. The highest ability one pc hadwas to get drunk: a resolution of his case was entered upon by having him invent ways to getdrunk.7. The attention span of children and psychos is not necessarily a factor since it is onlythe phenomena of dispersal against mental blocks, keying in of incidents. The auditor can payattention to it or not as he likes. Short, regular sessions on people with limited attention spanget more gain per week than a steady grind since the participation is maintained.8. The auditor remains at Cause in all sessions without forbidding the pc to be atCause. See the rules in Dianetics: The Original Thesis.STEP TWOPlacing the Preclear at CauseEstablish obedience of some part of the auditing room to the pc. Here he must begin atsome level of knowingness. He must know that he himself, when ordered to do so, can gainsome compliance on the part of the auditing room. This includes his own body.The basic rule of auditing is to start with something the preclear can do and then get himto do it better. This is the basic difference between a high level and a low level process. This isalso the difference between a process which is real to the preclear and a process which is unrealto the preclear. A preclear “can do” a process without doing it at all. Actually the body and bankare obeying the auditor. Now here we had in Dianetics one of the more interesting phenomenaof an auditor being able to make a preclear physically well without the preclear once finding outabout it. This was a source of great grief and upset to auditors. They could not see how thiscould possibly be. The man priorly could not walk, apparently, and after auditing he couldwalk, and yet he did not attribute to Dianetics or to the auditor any of this renewed ability.The auditor could monitor the preclear’s bank and body, shift around the engrams, as-isthem and do various things with them without the preclear finding out about it. All of this wasso far above the preclear’s ability to do that it was totally unreal to him.We also get the phenomenon of an individual doing a great many spotting processes andfeeling better but not being able to understand what this has to do with sanity or insanity. In thefirst place, the individual could not himself spot. The auditor more or less did the spotting forhim. The preclear then never connected it in any way with his own capabilities.A test an auditor should make to ascertain the sense of this is as follows: “Look aroundhere and tell me something you could do.” The preclear will get many odd and peculiarsensations as he fishes around and finally decides that he could do some minor thing. This isnot really a good process but it is a good test process for an auditor. This preclear who hasbeen walking and talking and working and going around the world and apparently behaving ina fairly sane and rational fashion actually could do none of these things. He was supportedentirely by his “machinery,” by the social responsibilities which were demonstrated towardhim, by his education, by the basic agreement of what goes on in the world. He was walkingaround in a dream and life felt to him much like a dream. Now the auditor starts to audit him onthe basis that this individual is capable. Well now the individual himself is the thetan andwhereas the bank might have been capable (and would have broken down some day), the"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"thetan himself was not. He was going along for the ride.We often see this phenomenon in the third dynamic. It could be said that a government isthe aggregate irresponsibility of a people. They are not taking responsibility for the course ofjustice or protection of the state from foreign aggression, and they shove all this responsibilityover on to a government and they themselves are quite irresponsible for it. After a while thegovernment doesn’t look to the people at all to furnish any responsibility. The governmenttakes all the initiative, and we eventually wind up with some sort of a dictatorship. The peoplethen no longer count; they are slaves; they are totally irresponsible.In a similar wise, a thetan can be totally irresponsible for everything that goes on inrelationship to his workaday world, and we see people dramatizing this on every hand.Wherever a thetan refuses to take responsibility and is participating in action, he is being“unreal.” This is the unreality of a situation. Let us say you were part of a crowd which wassurging downtown to Third Street and you yourself wanted to go uptown to Tenth Street. Thecrowd swept you along toward Third Street and after a while things would become prettyunreal. That is because you were being carried in a direction opposite to your basic intent. Thusyour own intention is overwhelmed. This intention overwhelmed becomes what we know asunreality.It is very easy for an auditor to overwhelm the preclear’s intention. The preclear isactually going to Tenth Street, the auditor is trying to push him to Third Street. We get the mostremarkable subdivision of this in Survive and Succumb. The auditor is going on the basis thatthe preclear wants to Survive and the preclear is going on the basis that he wants to Succumb.The auditor is then thrusting him in an opposite direction. Hence it is really necessary to clearGoals in an auditing session. There must be some goal which the preclear considers obtainable.The goal of just being able to sit there for the next two or three hours is a goal. You would besurprised to find that in some preclears this is a tremendously high goal. But even a preclear’sgoals can be unreal to him. They are the social goals. Actually, the preclear privately thinkshe’d like to get rid of every man, woman and child on Earth and the goal he gives you is tosave everyone.Now the question actually confronts us—what can the preclear really do? Of course, in acase of tremendous doubt, you could run the above process—”Look around here and findsomething you could do.” But there are certain things that an auditor can take for granted whichundercut any other thing. The body is sitting in the chair. The preclear can be brought up to arealization that he can make the body sit in the chair. And thus we get the first really worthwhileprocess on a preclear who is conscious, and that process is “You seat that body in that chair.Thank you.” And in the case of somebody who is Lying in bed, even unconscious, we get thisbasic process: “You make that body continue to lie in that bed. Thank you.”All we are asking anybody to do when we ask for these two processes is to takeresponsibility for what is actually occurring in the first place. We raise his responsibility levelin other words, and thus raise his doingness level. A preclear who does not come througheventually with a cognition that he can make the body sit in the chair of course isn’t worthbothering with, in that his doingness level is even below this. This preclear ought to be lying ina bed. He must consider himself completely helpless and completely ill. Thus if we ran “Youseat that body in that chair. Thank you,” for several hours without any realization on the part ofthe preclear that he could do this and without turning on any somatics or without getting anyeffect at all, we would consider that we had overshot this. Actually it shouldn’t take severalhours to find this out. We would go back to the basic position of Dianetic auditing. Thispreclear probably thinks of himself as being dead or probably thinks of himself as being very illor thinks of himself as being totally unconscious. Thus we would run him as an unconsciousperson. Putting him down on a couch we would run “You make that body continue to lie in thatbed. Thank you.”Also, on a much higher level we get CCH 1."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"“You give me that hand” is actually the old cat process where we got the cat to reach forthe auditor, plus an obedience process. The preclear after a while should decide that he can dothis. Sometimes we run CCH 1, then CCH 2, CCH 3, and then CCH 4 and going backdiscover that CCH 1 is now unflat and the preclear is unable to perform this action which hepreviously could perform. Now what has happened here is we have broadened the scope of thepreclear’s responsibility. His bank at first was perfectly capable of giving that hand but oncewe have invited further responsibility and gotten him to find the auditor as in CCH 3 and CCH4, we discover that the preclear himself is now trying to do it and in trying to do it is havingdifficulties but he wins through with this difficulty and eventually comes out much better.Unless these particular goals and theories behind these processes are understood theyvery often do not work at all in the CCH bands. Thus CCH 1 to 4, while tremendouslysuccessful when run by a very excellent auditor understanding his job, may not be successfulin the hands of somebody who is simply going through some mechanical motions.Basically we are trying to get the preclear to do something and know that he himself cando it. Thus we are improving his ability. On this fundamental we can go forward and establishmany processes, all of which are fundamental doingness or obedience processes. We can dosuch a process as “You make that chair sit on the floor.” This process at first seems a littleincredible to the preclear, but after a while he gets the idea that he can do it, then this unflattensand he gets the idea that it’s gravity that’s doing it and therefore he can’t do it, and he goesthrough various cognitions of one sort or another simply about having a chair, which is alreadysitting there, sit there. Unless we can cross this particular stage of a case and get the preclear upto an idea that he does have some sort of an ability of some kind, we might as well do nothingelse about the case at all. Therefore this Step Two is quite important and actually is the basicentrance into auditing.STEP THREEEstablish Control of Pc’s Body by PcAlthough we could continue onward with the CCHs simply rotating them from CCH 1through to 4 and back to 1 and to 4, and back to 1 and to 4 again and again and again and win,there is a faster way of going about this which has been known to us for a very long time. Thisway starts really with 8-C.It does not matter particularly which brand of 8-C is run. We have had now three or fourvarieties of 8-C. The first one was rather permissive and indirect and did not demand verymuch compliance and possibly had its own place in the firmament since use of it has resolved avery, very great many cases. The first command of this is “Do you see that wall?” Then “Walkover to it.” Then “Touch it.” And that was all there was to the process. Later 8-Cs, particularlyTone 40 8-Cs, were highly precise, very directive and had a great deal of control stress tothem. It does not matter particularly which 8-C is used so long as the auditor feels that it isbiting. If the particular 8-C he is using isn’t biting, maybe he needs a more permissive one,maybe he needs a more exacting control one.There are a great many factors surrounding the control of the pc’s body by a pc. Most pcsfeel their body if tampered with in any way would fly out of control and flip-flop all over thefloor, would suddenly freeze or would get ill, and they have anxieties about their bodies andthe control of their bodies which must be solved, otherwise we don’t get very far. Control ofbodies can actually be assisted by old-time flip-flopping.Flip-flopping was a process by which the preclear’s excess motion was taken off. Thecreative processes of earlier times did not require of the preclear any great cognition of whatwas going on. Thus flip-flopping could be used at a very early stage of case. We would say,“Mock up a man and make him flip-flop” and then make him insist that the body flip-flop evenfurther and even more wildly until he himself knew that he was making the body flip-flop. We"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"would do this with a woman’s body and would eventually take the motion off the case that wasinhibiting the preclear from controlling the body. This is actually a motionectomy. It is really acase of the auditor controlling the bank and body of the preclear. When we did not do this wefound that in running 8-C and in doing some other processes the preclear all of a sudden wouldconvulse and start to fly apart. These fly-aparts were simply the flip-flop manifestation ofbodies.It is extremely interesting that a preclear exteriorizing from his own body which is out ofcontrol, flip-flopping, writhing, convulsing and going into epileptiform seizures was at adistance from a flip-flopping body. One day while in his own body he causes some other bodyto go out of control, he shoots somebody or hits somebody, and has this person go into a flip-flop. He himself gets restimulated and he feels that his body in the future is liable to go out ofcontrol at any time. If you draw a little picture of this you will see that a thetan exteriorizedfrom his own body and a thetan in his body knocking about some other body is, to the thetan,the same point of view. In other words, if you make somebody’s body flip-flop, your ownbody may flip-flop. It looks the same to a thetan.Some guarantee or security of body control is therefore necessary.There is a very fine set of processes which have been used for more than a year at thiswriting and which produced excellent results. These we call the S-C-S processes.After running 8-C (and if it turned on somatics remember to flatten the process entirely,even though it takes 50 hours, before going on to another process), we go into these controlprocesses grouped under S-C-S. There have been several varieties of process, all entirely in thecontrol bracket but with different severities of control. The commands of S-C-S processes arealmost all the same except that some are made more severe than others.The first of these processes is the Start process. This is very simple. We have a preclearout in the middle of the room standing up while we stand up alongside of him touching him,and we explain to him (and we explain this every command) that when we say “Start” we wanthim to start his body in that direction, and we point out some direction.Then we take our hands off of him and we say “Start.” We do not say Stop, Halt, oranything else, but after he has moved forward we then say, “Did you start your body?” And hesays he guesses he did or he did, and we then—and only then— acknowledge. We do thismany times until the process apparently has no charge on it or is flat. We then go into the nextof this series, which is Change.To run Change the auditor marks four points out on the floor. These points can beimaginary or they can be actually chalk-marked on the floor. One of these points we label “A,”one “B,” one “C,” and one “D.” We explain the meanings of these symbols to the preclear andwe give him this auditing command: “Now when I ask you to change the body, I want you tochange the body’s position from A to B. Do you understand that?” The preclear says he does,and the auditor, stepping back from the preclear, says “Change.” The preclear then changes thebody’s position. Similarly in using the various points and combinations of the points A, B, Cand D, the auditor drills the preclear on Change until that particular process seems to be flat.The auditor then goes to Stop. The auditor takes the preclear by the arm and explains(explains every time) that when he says “Stop,” he wants the preclear to stop the body. Theactual wording of the auditor is “Now I want you to get the body moving in that direction andwhen I say Stop, I want you to stop the body. Do you understand?” When the preclear saysthat he does, the auditor lets go of him, lets him move down the room a distance (never thesame distance twice) and says “Stop.” When the preclear has stopped the auditor says “Did youstop the body?” And the preclear says “yes,” or “maybe” and the auditor then acknowledges.The auditor does this many times until the preclear understands that he himself can stop thebody or he has regained an ability, or the process appears to be flat and has no charge on it."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"These three steps done in that order are then repeated. And it will be discovered that onceStop has been flattened, Start is now unflattened and can be flattened all over again by runningit anew. Similarly, Change will be found to be unflat and again Stop will be found to be unflat.Thus, one runs Start and one runs Change and then one runs Stop, in that order, over and overand over again until all three appear to be flat.A variation of this particular process has been called Stop Supreme. Stop Supreme is aheavy emphasis on Stop and it will be found that after the three processes of Start, Change andStop are flat, one can move rather easily into Stop Supreme and concentrate heavily upon it. Inother words, one runs Start, Change and Stop, Start, Change and Stop, Start, Change andStop until they are relatively flat. He should not then suppose that the whole of S-C-S is flatsince he still has Stop Supreme in all of its variations.The idea behind Stop Supreme is that Stop, or motionlessness, is probably the mostthetan ability a thetan has. Thus the rehabilitation of this particular ability is worth while anddoes produce considerable results. But don’t be surprised if the preclear falls apart in theprocess of doing it.The commands of Stop Supreme are roughly these. Every time one runs one of these S-C-S processes he, of course, explains the thing in full at the beginning of every command. Hedoes not let any explanation hang over from the last time the command was executed. It will befound that the preclear cannot hold in his mind these explanations. Therefore, it has to be allexplained anew every time. Thus we say to the preclear in Stop Supreme, “Now I want you toget your body moving down the room when I so indicate and when I say Stop, I want you tostop your body absolutely still.” Then the auditor gives the preclear a slight shove and thepreclear moves the body down the room, and the auditor says “Stop,” and the preclear tries tostop his body absolutely still in that instant. It will be found that faster and faster responses areachieved by the preclear and he can actually stop the body in more and more peculiar positions.The auditor then says, “Did you stop your body absolutely still?” The preclear answers this andthen the auditor acknowledges. There are even more severe versions of this, but they are left tothe imagination of the auditor.These S-C-S processes produced the greatest control changes that have been producedwith any control process. They were consistently used with great success by a great manyauditors. This is not really true of CCH 1, 2, 3 and 4. CCH 1, 2, 3 and 4 depend in a verylarge measure not only upon the excellence of the auditor but upon how the auditor himself isfeeling while he is running them. And we can get an auditor who is not feeling up to par thatday not doing well with CCH 1, 2, 3 and 4. This difficulty was never encountered with the S-C-S processes and therefore the S-C-S processes are to be recommended.An apparent drop of havingness is occasionally experienced by the preclear as he doesthese processes. This is because of compulsive exteriorization. If a preclear is about to fly outof his head he’ll fly out of his head on S-C-S. If he does fly out of his head on S-C-S, or anyother process, you, of course, continue the process. You do not suddenly change and do someother process. Once upon a time we felt at liberty to change because of the severity of thechange, but we have learned in long experience that one never changes the process just becausesomebody compulsively exteriorizes. S-C-S is probably more susceptible to compulsiveexteriorization than any other single process, and as it is run preclears fly into their heads andout of them at a great rate and eventually get to a state quite ordinarily where they can move intothe head or out of the head at will.The reason the preclear is holding on to the body is (1) fear of loss of control and (2)havingness. If the havingness of the preclear is low, he is apt to close in tight to the bodybecause this gives him more havingness and if the preclear fears that the body is going to goout of control he will also move in closer to the body. Thus we get interiorization as no morecomplicated than fear of loss of control and drops in havingness.When a loss of havingness is experienced, a preclear will agitate or go anaten and tend to"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"be upset in general. Actually, any loss of havingness in an auditing session can be repaired byan excellent auditor by repair of the ARC of the session. One uses the trick “What did I dowrong?” and two-way comm in general to patch up state of affairs. Loss of havingness is firstmanifested on loss of havingness of the session or loss of goals rather than on actual loss ofmass.In running S-C-S, however, the preclear flying in and out of his head will experiencevarious changes of havingness which are quite upsetting. The very best handling of thissituation is to restore the ARC of the session in every way possible. It is actually not allowed tostop S-C-S and go into Trio.Concentration upon the body is one of the frailties of S-C-S and we have long sincediscovered that those preclears who had difficulty in exteriorization would very often re-interiorize the moment they glanced at the body. Well, keeping a body there and looking at itare apparently two different things entirely. Thus if a preclear can’t put his attention upon thebody without bad things happening, we should run a process which prevents the preclear frombeing upset simply because he is concentrating upon his body, and S-C-S certainly does thisand does it well.Don’t be surprised in running S-C-S if the preclear suddenly flies to pieces, goes intoflip-flopping, has to be picked up off the floor and put over on the couch and left aghast, but dobe very surprised at yourself if you fail to get the preclear back up on his feet and into sessionagain at once. This is no time for you to be changing processes simply because a preclearcollapses. Now if this did happen, that the preclear went entirely out of session while runningS-C-S and you could not get him in any way to do any more of the S-C-S and get it flat, thenyou had better start the entire intensive all over again and go right back to the beginning andcarry on from the beginning and bring him right straight on through to S-C-S. You would dothis rapidly, of course, but you would nevertheless have no other choice. It would not be goodenough to change processes simply because the preclear found himself incapable of runningthis body control process of S-C-S.It has been noticed that S-C-S can be run very sloppily by some auditors who do not havevery much experience with it. The only way to err is in the direction of imprecision and badARC. It is perfectly easy to be very precise with high ARC. ARC does not mean non-confronting.One of the elementary processes which can be used after S-C-S and which is a very fineprocess and will have to be done at some time, is the Keep it from going away— Hold it still—Make it more solid series on two objects.To do this particular process one takes two disrelated objects, that is to say he doesn’ttake two ashtrays or two bottles. He could take one object made out of wood, one made out ofglass, both of them with different purposes. But these are usually picked up as non-significantobjects and the auditor asks the preclear to place the two of them to the right and to the left ofthe preclear and asks the preclear to pick up one of them and keep it from going away and put itback in exactly the same place, pick up the other one and keep it from going away, put it backin exactly the same place, and keeps up this drill between these two objects. Actually, preclearswho are having a very hard time require more than two objects, even as many as six or seven.In this event the auditor places the preclear at a table and scatters several objects around andpicks them up at random. The duplicative feature of the process can be toughened up as theprocess is continued, but on some preclears it will be found to be very arduous to start outbasically with two. When the preclear can successfully keep the two objects from going away,knowing very well that he kept them from going away—which the auditor asks him every time,“Did you keep it from going away?”—the hold-it-still phase is run in exactly the same way, andwhen this seems to be flat on the two objects we get into “Make it more solid.” One of theprincipal dividing lines between a psychotic state and a sane state is the ability to make thingssolid. It will be found that people who are having a very bad time indeed have the whole worldin a very thin look-straight through-it state. Only when they themselves can be at Cause in"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"keeping things from going away and making things hold still and making things more solid willit be found that they have a solidity in the environment.There would be another process which we could run at this particular stage and that isold-time Book and Bottle, which is also one of the deadlier exteriorization processes.Old-time Book and Bottle was run in this wise. The auditor placed a book on one table orchair and a bottle on the other table or chair and he directed the individual to first one and thenthe other, always with a very duplicative command. Probably the first version of Book andBottle was the best. It should be understood that Book and Bottle is an absolute necessity andmust be run at some time or another upon a Scientology auditor, but it is not necessarilysomething which must be run on somebody who is simply trying to attain a state of Clear.Thus a mention of it is introduced at this time.STEP FOURFind the AuditorMake pc even more conscious of auditor and place him somewhat at Cause with ARC.There are probably a thousand inventive ways that this could be done but it is time whenone has been butchering the pc this long for the pc to regain some of his self-respect withregard to the auditing session. One could do this with almost any auditing command whichmade the pc look at the auditor. Such a question as “Is there anything I am doing that you coulddo?” carried forward to its logical conclusion would find the pc regaining some of his Causewith regard to the session. Simple locational spotting, however, is probably the best processhere. One directs the pc’s attention with “You notice that (object)” all about the room and at firstonly occasionally includes the pc’s body and the auditor’s body in the spotting. Then theauditor, using the same process, concentrates less and less upon the room and more and moreupon the auditor and the pc. It will be found that the pc will eventually find the auditor with hisattention so directed.It will be seen then that S-C-S directed the pc’s attention very strongly to the auditing ofhis own body and it will be seen that we have not yet started to get the pc’s attention out intothe environment.But here we have two very pat processes which are CCH 3 and CCH 4. These areextremely simple processes but require a considerable amount of care in their use. Anyvalidated auditor knows how to run these two processes. CCH 3 is Hand Space Mimicry andCCH 4 is Book Mimicry. Both of these processes simply invite the pc to find the auditor morethoroughly.The earliest process along the line was “Look at me, Who am I?”, and it has very far frombeen disallowed, so that in lack of anything else simply this process could be picked up andused at this stage. Now here we get the preclear to identify or to say who the auditor is and youwill find that many preclears go through a considerable number of convulsions in trying toestablish who the auditor is.There is no particularly recommended step for this. It depends in a large measure on whatstate the pc is in when he arrives at this point. But it is necessary for the pc to becomesomewhat causative with regard to the session at this stage, whether by spotting, CCH 3 andCCH 4, or by old-time “Look at me, Who am I?” They all more or less accomplish the samething. CCH 3 and 4 accomplish the location of the auditor very mechanically according to theReality Scale. Spotting has the additional advantage of taking a pc’s attention very thoroughlyunder control, and “Look at me, Who am I?” invites the pc to use his identification and thinkingcapacities. If an auditor wanted to be totally sure, he would use all of them."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"STEP FIVEPc Versus MestEstablish pc as cause over Mest by establishing pc’s ideas as cause over Mest.There are several varieties of spotting processes. The most basic of these is the most basicprocess to association and this is Connectedness. This process is run directively with thefollowing command: “You get the idea of making that (object) connect with you. Did you?Thank you.”The reason Connectedness works is because it is the basic process on association. Themost aberrative thing on any case is association with Mest. This does not mean that theindividual is not creating the Mest, it does not mean that he has no relationship with Mest, but itdoes mean that Theta and Mest interconnected too strongly are the components of a trap. Thetais mixed up with Mest, Mest is mixed up with Theta. They are two different things actually,and it is not true that all thought derives from Mest, nor is it true that all Mest derives fromthought. A thetan can create Mest by simply creating Mest, not by telling it to be created, butsimply by putting it there. This is the isness of Mest. Now when he connects his thoughts withthe actual mass he gets into trouble and we get association, we get compulsive thinking, we getidentification and the old A = A = A of Dianetic days.Thus you will see at once that Connectedness in any form is a very excellent process torun. But note carefully that we have him get the idea of making the object connect with him.We never command the preclear to get the other idea of connecting with the object. This is a no-games condition. This is what is wrong with the preclear.Now there are a large variety of processes which stem out of this process of basicassociation. These are Control Trio, Trio and Responsibility. But all of these things arebasically connectedness processes.The only thing that ever went wrong with connectedness processes was the unrealityfactor. The auditor would tell the preclear to get the idea of making that wall connect with him,when as a matter of fact the preclear couldn’t have gotten much of any kind of an idea ofmaking anything connect with him.Thus it is mandatory for an auditor to start out a preclear on some level of reality andsome two-way comm should precede this connectedness process, such as “Do you think thereis anything anywhere that you could get to connect with you?” Once this is cleared up, it will befound that only those things very close in could be real to the preclear on this line ofconnectedness. Thus the auditor is given no great power of choice in this matter in the firstrunnings of the process. He will have to run things which are relatively close in to the preclear,then proceed to things which are middle distance and then things which are further from thepreclear.A great deal of good common sense is needed here, and a great deal of two-way comm isnecessary to get some idea of whether or not the preclear thought it was real.Thus the earliest commands of Connectedness should probably be the preclear’s nose andthe auditor’s hand; the arm of the preclear’s chair and the button on the auditor’s shirt; thebutton on the preclear’s shirt and his own left hand, et cetera. Further, the auditor is onlyasking him to get the idea of making the thing connect with him, not to make the thing connectwith him, otherwise he will have the preclear being yanked all over the room.Control Trio, Trio and Responsibility are actually only complications on top ofConnectedness, but they themselves have their own particular peculiar virtues, and a preclearwho can actually run straight, old-time Trio, “Look around here and find something you couldhave,” can get a very long way on that process all by itself."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"Control Trio is actually a three-stage process on a heavy spotting control. It runs in thisfashion. “Get the idea that you can have that (object).” And when this is relatively flat, “Get theidea of making that (object) remain where it is,” (or continue where it is) and “Get the idea ofmaking that (object) disappear.” This is actually a very fine process and undercuts (runs on alower case than) Trio itself.Old-time Trio is extremely good, however, and is not to be underrated in any way. Youcan run a whole three-week intensive on this if the preclear can do it. The commands are:“Look around here and find something you could have.” And when that is somewhat flat,“Look around here and find something you would permit to remain,” and then “Look aroundhere and find something you would permit to disappear.” These are run in relationship to eachother. In other words, all three of them are run in the same session. Sometimes a preclear willrun the third command two hundred and fifty times before he can get either of the other twocommands with any reality at all.Responsibility is another process just like Trio and actually has its three commands, too.“Look around here and find something you could be responsible for.” “Look around here andfind something you don’t have to be responsible for.” “Look around here and find somethingyou would permit somebody else to be responsible for.”The emphasis here is “You look,” “You connect,” “You make” in any of these processes,and the “You” should be entered into the old commands to make the thing as causative aspossible.Although we cover this rather briefly, this is probably the most effective section of ClearProcedure. The whole trick is to get the preclear to actually do it. It does no good for a preclearto run these processes with no reality. It does no good for a preclear to run these processeswith no ARC between himself and the auditor. But it does a lot of good to get these processesrun.Basically TR TEN, “You notice that (object),” is a fundamental process onconnectedness. It will be discovered that unless the preclear is actually able to look at a fewthings he will not be able to get an idea about them, too. Furthermore, it will be discovered thatthere is a process called Short Spotting, wherein the auditor has the preclear spot things that arevery close to him. The only thing wrong with Short Spotting is that the auditor must give thepreclear things to spot which the preclear can actually see with his eyes. If the preclear cannotsee these things with his eyes there is not much use in having him spot them as it will run downhis havingness and add to an uncertainty.Havingness of an objective variety, namely Trio, is one of the greatest processes everinvented. Do not lose sight of this fact. The process can do things that no other process can do.There may be some factors kicking around in Havingness which are not entirely understoodand which are not entirely connected with Connectedness. However, it has been found thatConnectedness will put a preclear in a condition where he can eventually run Havingness.Therefore, Connectedness undercuts and possibly even overpasses Havingness in general.This process of Connectedness can also be run outside. It can be run on people. It can berun on a certain type of object. It can be used to familiarize a pilot with his airplane and a driverwith his car. It can be used to increase ARC between the preclear and the world around him byletting him run it in a heavily populated area or upon a busy street and using bodies. Here wehave one of the more interesting processes to run in terms of cognition, because it undoes somuch basic association. If your preclear is not cogniting while running Connectedness you canbe very sure of the fact that somewhere along the line you have not given him a reality and youshould flatten it off gracefully and start the intensive all over again.STEP SIX"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Creative ProcessingRead and understand Scientology 8-8008 and “Electropsychometric Auditing,” and usean E-Meter throughout the auditing.The first step on this in some cases is conquering black “field” and invisible “field.” Thisis done by a repair of havingness over black masses and then invisible masses, run even if thepc goes unconscious. This means that you continue to audit him even if he goes unconsciousand you use the same command and pay no attention to his unconsciousness. You continue justas though he were wide awake. When field is cleared up, start on a gradient scale of mock-upsand get pc able to mock things up. Then run “Keep it from going away” until flat on mock-ups.Then run “Hold it still” on mock-ups. Then run “Make it more solid” on mock-ups. All thisuntil pc really has fine, solid mock-ups. Typical command, “Mock up a and keep it fromgoing away. Thank you.” RULE: A PC’S FACSIMILES ARE NOT STORED, THEY AREMADE IN THE INSTANT AND UNMADE BY THE PC, therefore remedy of mock-upsAND THEIR PERSISTENCE, is actually a direct route to clear and winds up with noobsessive mock-up making (which we call a bank). A valuable side process here: “Decide tomake a mock-up. Decide that will ruin the game. Decide not to do it.” Also this one: “Decide tomake a mock-up everyone can see. Decide that would ruin the game.

IF IT DOESN’T EXIST doCCH 0 briefly and quickly and get on with the session.It will be noted that giving pc’s attention to auditing room or environment can turn on asomatic after three or four commands. After one command of “Have you got an auditingroom?” this becomes a process called LOCATIONAL. If Locational turns on a somatic it mustbe run until somatic is flat. Therefore, the auditor has no business attempting Locational orgetting the pc involved unless he intends to do something about it."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Present Time ProblemThe preclear is put on an E-Meter before PT problem is discussed. When the E-Meter hasbeen adjusted (one-third of a dial surge when pc squeezes cans), the auditor asks if the pc has apresent time problem. After a little discussion of this, the needle may surge. If it does, theauditor locates the PT problem’s most intimate terminal and runs (with the pc still holding thecans) “Invent something worse than (indicated terminal)” until the problem flattens out on thedial. The auditor can ask for and run another PT problem or even three or four, but alwaysflattening down the surge of the needle. IF THE PC IS 50% below the center line of the APA,it is not safe to run “Invent.” Instead, without scouting around “Invent,” but knowing the graphin the first place, simply two-way comm the problem and run Locational until the problemflattens out on the needle. The auditor does not begin with “Invent” and then change his mindand run Locational. It is an “either-or.” The auditor starts with “Invent” or he starts withLocational and whichever he does he does not change. IF LOCATIONAL TURNS ON ASOMATIC IT MUST BE RUN UNTIL LOCATIONAL NO LONGER TURNS ONSOMATICS.Once the PT problem is flat the auditor puts away the E-Meter.S-C-S StepsS-C-S begins with 8-C of any kind. If 8-C turns on a somatic, the auditor runs it until itno longer turns on somatics. 8-C is run formal or Tone 40.Start is then run as per 1956.Change is then run as per 1956.Stop is then run as per 1956.If each of these is flattened in turn, it does not mean that S-C-S is flat. It means only thatStart is probably unflattened. Thus one again runs Start after Stop, runs Change after Start,Stop after Change until none of the three unflatten the others.More 8-C can be run. There is no error in liberally running 8-C, which is, after all, amore complicated Locational of a Short Spotting sort.Spotting StepsSpotting itself is a broad process. Locational is only one of many spotting processes.Spotting spots in the past, in space, in the present, Short Spotting (Locational done up close)are all effective.SPOTTING DEPENDS FOR ITS WORKABILITY ON THE DISLIKE OF A THETANOF BEING LOCATED. IT RUNS BEST, of course, WITH THE THETAN AT CAUSEDOING THE SPOTTING.Connectedness is the basic process on ASSOCIATION of Theta with Mest. All formsand kinds of association, including being caught in traps, are prone to become identifications asin Dianetics. Connectedness puts the thetan at cause in making the Mest (or people when runoutside) connect with him. The command is “Get the idea of making (indicated object) connectwith you.” The auditor points. The worse off a person is, the less reality he has on far objects.Havingness is a complicated Connectedness. Also a permissive one. Thus Trio is aboveConnectedness and may be used when Connectedness is flat."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"B O A R D T E C H N I C A L B U L L E T I N9 OCTOBER 1971R ISSUE IVREVISED 12 MARCH 1974CANCELS & REVISESRemimeoHCO BULLETIN OF 9 OCTOBER 1971Level IIISSUE IVChecksheetsAuditor Drills Series 4RDRILLS FOR AUDITORSLEVEL 2 PROCESS DRILLSPURPOSE: To improve the quality of auditing by familiarizing auditors with the exactprocedure of each auditing action through the use of drills.HOW TO USE: These drills are in order by levels. The first number indicates the level taughton. Those that begin with TR200- are level two drills. Unbullbaited drills and with oddnumbers, and bullbaited end in even numbers. Where an odd number seems to be skipped, thisindicates only the bullbaited drill is done.Most of the drills are done within the basic format of the bullbaited and unbullbaiteddrills, as in the front of this peck; those that do not have their own training stress, position, etc.These are totally drilled out, as you reach them in the pack.Simply start with the first actions and work through the pack applying the drillsunbullbaited and bullbaited, until you are thoroughly familiar with each separate auditingaction, end can apply it flawlessly, even with distractions.If a student has trouble on a drill locate whether the student has a misunderstood or hasa skipped gradient and handle either or both with standard study tech. This can lead back tooutnesses on basics such as TRs, Codes Or Scales; wnatever it is find out why and handle.ALWAYS COACH ON A GRADIENT. And build them up to get them tough!When the student is very familiar with a drill the speed should be increased.NOTE: If coach upset because of restimulation, fruit words should be inserted in the place ofthe process key words for bullbelted drills onlv.FORMAT FOR UNBULLBAITED DRILLS:NAME: Auditing On a Doll Unbullbaited.COMMANDS: As for each separate process.PURPOSE: To train the student to be able to coordinate and apply the commands andprocedures of each separate suditing action with the actual doingness of auditing.POSITION: Student seated at a table with E-Meter, worksheets and auditing forms as needed.In the chair opposite the student is a doll occupying the position of the pc. (During checkoutsthe coach is seated or standing beside the auditor. He does not take the position of the doll.)TRAINING STRESS: This drill is coached. The student sets up an E-Meter and worksheetsexactly as in a session - as follows:1. Set up E-Meter as for E-Meter drills.2. Set up shield (to prevent To and admin being seen by pc (doll)."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"3. Have extra pens under the E-Meter.4. Have C/S face down between the bottom of the E-Meter and the table.5. Have W/S and Lists readily available in sequence required for the session.Auditor starts the session and runs a standard session with the particular auditing actionbeing taken up on the doll, keeping full session admin and using all standard procedures of theauditing action. Coach watches Drill & points out any outnesses noted giving a that’s it &restart. Outnesses should be handled one at a time until none exist.The drill is done on a steeper and steeper gradient, until the student can very quickly dothe action correctly.The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlessly with good TRs 0-4,correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion; i.e. flawlessly! Attestationby student is per Superliterate Fast Flow policies.FORMAT TO BE USED FOR BULLBAITED DRILLS:NAME: Auditing Bullbaited.COMMANDS: As for each separate auditing action.PURPOSE: To train the student to be able to coordinate nnd apply the commands andprocedures of each separate auditing action in a drill similar to a real auditing session andthereby become flawless in applying it.POSITION: Student seated at a table with E-Meter and auditor forms, as needed. In the chairopposite the auditor is the Coach/gullbaiter who gives answers as pc, not about his own case.TRAINING STRESS: The drill is the same as for auditing on e doll except that the pc coachbullbaits the student auditor, using “fruit” answers during the session in an attempt to throw thestudent off session. On any list the cosch squeezes the cans to simulate reads. He still uses“fruit” answers (six apples, blue pears) when asked to speak, but as the student auditor readsoff the list items (e.g. L3RD) he squeezes the cans for reeds.When bullbaiting an auditing action the coach should THROW IN VARIOUS SIGNSOF PC OUT OF SESSIONESS. (Per HCOB on Good and Bad Indicators.) The studentauditor must:1. Obnose the out of sessionness.2. Align this to the process run.3. Handle.An example is, on a Listing end Nulling procedure sn out of sessionness is observed,the auditor queries and follows through with an L4B at once. (An L4B is a repair list.)The pc bullbaiter can throw in situations, originate troubles, or gains, be tricky, etc. Buthe must never lose sight of HCOB 24 May 1968, “Coaching”, especially the second paragraph,“coach with reality”.Once the coach throws out a situation, etc. he must allow the student suditor to carry itout, and handle the situation before the coach calls a new situation.Stress is on training the student auditor to have his TRs 0-4 IN on the bullbaiter.The coach (bullbaiter) does the “start”, flunking or “That’s it”. Flunks are given for anyimproper commands, procedure, comm lags, break in TRs or improper session admin.Each drill is to be done thoroughly t building up the speed of auditor commands and"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"actions, (‘it’s the number of auditing commands per unit of auditing time which makes gains ina session.” ARE.)When the student auditor has done these steps to his satisfaction he attests as per FastFlow policies for Superliterates. The drill is passed when the student can do the drill flawlesslywith excellent TRs 0-4, correct procedure and commands, without comm lags or confusion.These are the drills that train the student auditor to handle all the elements in a session,so be exact and be real.TR 200-1 R2-22 VIEWPOINT STRAIGHTWIRE - UNBULLBAITEDTR 200-2 R2-25 VIEWPOINT STRAIGHWIRE - BULLBAITEDRef.
