Pcs who have routinely had meter reads missed on them become so unconfident of the meter that they are perpetually ARC broke. Only ARC breaks stop a meter from reacting. Therefore this unconfidence in the meter can cancel meter reads! It is utterly fatal to pass up an instant reaction on a pc. It invalidates the meter and may cancel further reads. Meters work. They work every time. Only auditors fail by failure to use the meter re-actions to guide a session. Only the auditing question or the auditor’s inability to read can be wrong."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PREPCHECKING HOW METERS 2 HCOB 23.5.62 GET INVALIDATED INSTANT READS BRIEFING 2 06.02.10 Because of bad metering many pcs get the secret opinion that meters do not in fact work. This is caused by sloppy auditors who miss instant reads and fail to clean up hot ques-tions. If the pc knows it is hot and the auditor fails to see the meter react, the pc thinks he can “beat the meter” and is thereafter harder to audit because of this specific phenomenon. This is exactly how meters get invalidated – auditors who fail to read them and meters that aren’t Mark IVs. There have been plenty of both in the past, so clean up the above ques-tion. It’s all that keeps some pcs from winning. And, oh yes, don’t miss meter reads! And, oh very yes, be sure you are well trained on meters! L.

The reaction of the needle may be any reaction except „nul”. An instant read may be any change of characteristic providing it occurs instantly. The absence of a read at the end of the major thought shows it to be nul. All prior reads and latent reads are ignored. These are the result of minor thoughts which may or may not be restimulated by the question. Only the instant read is used by the auditor. Only the instant read is cleared on rudi-ments, What questions, etc. The instant read may consist of any needle reaction, rise, fall, speeded rise, speeded fall, double tick (dirty needle), theta bop or any other action so long as it occurs at the exact end of the major thought being expressed by the auditor. If no reaction occurs at exactly that place (the end of the major thought) the question is nul. By „major thought” is meant the complete thought being expressed in words by the auditor. Reads which occur prior to the completion of the major thought are „prior reads”. Reads which occur later than its completion are „latent reads”. By „minor thought” is meant subsidiary thoughts expressed by words within the major thought. They are caused by the reactivity of individual words within the full words. They are ignored. Example: „Have you ever injured dirty pigs?” To the pc the words „you”, „injured” and „dirty” are all reactive. Therefore, the minor thoughts expressed by these words also read on the meter. The major thought here is the whole sentence. Within this thought are the minor thoughts „you”, „injured” and „dirty”. Therefore the E-Meter needle may respond this way: „Have you (fall) ever injured (speeded fall) dirty (fall) pigs (fall)?” Only the major thought gives the instant read and only the last fall (bold-italic type in the sentence above) indicates anything. If that last reaction was absent, the whole sentence is nul despite the prior falls."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"INSTANT READS 2 HCOB 25.05.62 INSTANT READS BRIEFING 36 06.02.10 You can release the reactions (but ordinarily would not) on each of these minor thoughts. Exploring these prior reads is called „compartmenting the question”. Paying attention to minor thought reads gives us laughable situations as in the case, written in 1960, of „getting P.D.H.ed by the cat”. By accepting these prior reads one can prove anything. Why? Because Pain and Drug and Hypnosis are minor thoughts within the major thought: „Have you ever been P.D.H.ed by a cat?” The inexpert auditor would believe such a silly thing had happened. But notice that if each minor thought is cleaned out of the major thought it no longer reacts as a whole fact. If the person on the meter had been P.D.H.ed by a cat, then only the discovery of the origin of the whole thought would clean up the whole thought. Pcs also think about other things while being asked questions and these random per-sonal restimulations also read before and after an instant read and are ignored. Very rarely, a pc’s thinks react exactly at the end of a major thought and so confuse the issue, but this is rare. We want the read that occurs instantly after the last syllable of the major thought without lag. That is the only read we regard in finding a rudiment in or out, to find if a goal reacts, etc. That is what is called an „instant read”. There is a package rudiment question in the half truth, etc. We are doing four rudi-ments in one and therefore have four major thoughts in one sentence. This packaging is the only apparent exception but is actually no exception. It’s just a fast way of doing four rudi-ments in one sentence. A clumsy question which puts „in this session” at the end of the major thought can serve the auditor badly. Such modifiers should come before the sentence, „In this session have you......?” You are giving the major thought directly to the reactive mind. Therefore any analyti-cal thought will not react instantly. The reactive mind is composed of: 1. Timelessness. 2. Unknownness. 3. Survival. The meter reacts on the reactive mind, never on the analytical mind. The meter reacts instantly on any thought restimulated in the reactive mind. If the meter reacts on anything, that datum is partly or wholly unknown to the preclear. An auditor’s questions restimulate the reactive mind. This reacts on the meter. Only reactive thoughts react instantly. You can „groove in” a major thought by saying it twice. On the second time (or third time if it is longer) you will see only the instant read at the exact end. If you do this the prior reads drop out leaving only the whole thought. If you go stumbling around in rudiments or goals trying to clean up the minor thoughts you will get lost. In sec checking you can uncover material by „compartmenting the question”"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"INSTANT READS 3 HCOB 25.05.62 INSTANT READS BRIEFING 37 06.02.10 but this is rarely done today. In rudiments, What questions, et al, you want the instant read only. It occurs exactly at the end of the whole thought. This is your whole interest in cleaning a rudiment or a What question. You ignore all prior and latent reactions of the needle. The exceptions to this rule are: 1. „Compartmenting the question”, in which you use the prior reads occurring at the ex-act end of the minor thoughts (as above in the pigs sentence) to dig up different data not related to the whole thought. 2. „Steering the pc” is the only use of latent or random reads. You see a read the same as the instant read occurring again when you are not speaking but after you have found a whole thought reacting. You say „there” or „that” and the pc, seeing what he or she is looking at as you say it, recovers the knowledge from the reactive bank and gives the data and the whole thought clears or has to be further worked and cleared.

All TRs must contain the correct data of auditing. This is vital. There have been two broad instances where TRs gave an impetus to im-proper auditing which all but crippled the forward advance of Scientology. These were: Upper Indoc TRs which caused students to conceive that the CCHs were run without 2-way comm and with a militant, even vicious attitude. (See HCO Bulletins of April 5 and 12, 1962.) E-Meter Needle drills which caused the student to believe that every action of the nee-dle was a read and prevented three-quarters of all Scientologists from ever getting rudiments in or questions cleared (see HCO Bulletin of May 25,1962 and 2 Saint Hill Lectures of May 24, 1962). In the matter of the CCHs, we were deprived of their full use for 5 years and extended the time in processing 25 times more than should have been consumed for any result. This came from TRs 6-9 which are hereby scrapped. In the matter of the E-Meter it is probable that all auditing failures and widely ex-tended false ideas that Scientology did not work stem from the improper conception of what action of the needle one cleaned up. This came from needle reading TRs where instructors had students calling off every activity of the needle as a read, whereas only the needle action at the exact end of the question was used by the auditor. Auditors have thought all needle ac-tions were reads and tried to clean off all needle actions except, in some cases, the end ac-tions. This defeated the meter completely and upset every case on which it was practised. This accounts for all auditing failures in the past two years.

From his earliest training on meters the student must be trained to consider a read only what he would take up in session and clear or use, and must be taught that mere actions of the needle are neglected except in steering the pc, fishing or compartmenting questions. Only teach proper use. Only use TRs which exactly parallel use of Scientology in session and do not give an impression that something else is used. I have seen clearly that Scientology’s effectiveness could be destroyed by teaching via TRs which can be interpreted by a student as the way to audit when in fact one does not audit that way or use the data in auditing. There are many valuable TRs. There will be many more valuable TRs. But an invalid TR is one which gives a wrong impression of auditing. These must be kept out of all training. L.

For a long time I’ve been urging you to get rudiments in. For the past ten days I have been working hard to analyze and resolve why you sometimes cannot. Just as an E-Meter can go dead for the auditor in the presence of a monstrous ARC break, I have found it can go gradiently dull in the presence of out rudiments. If you fail to get one in then the outness of the next one reads faintly. And if your TR1 is at all poor, you’ll miss the rudiment’s outness and there goes your session. To get over these difficulties, I have developed a Model Session that can be used, in the rudiments, as a series of repetitive processes. Then, with this, I’ve developed Repetitive Rudiments. The auditor at first does not consult the meter, but asks the rudiments question of the pc until the pc says there is no further answer. At this point the auditor says, “I will check that on the meter.” And asks the question again. If it reads, the auditor uses the meter to steer the pc to the answer, and when the pc finds the answer, the auditor again lays the meter aside and asks the question of the pc as above until the pc has no answer. The auditor again says, “I will check that on the meter” and does so. The cycle is repeated over and over until the meter is clean of any instant read (see HCO Bulletin of May 25, 1962 for Instant Read). The cycle: 1. Run the rudiment as a repetitive process until pc has no answer. 2. Consult meter for a hidden answer. 3. If meter reads use it to steer (“that” “that” each time the meter flicks) the pc to the an-swer. 4. Lay aside the Meter and do 1 and 2 and 3. The process is flat when there is no instant read to the question. One does not “bridge out” or use “two more commands”. When the meter test of the question gets no instant read, the auditor says, “Do you agree that that is clean?” covertly looking at the needle as he or she says “clean”. If the question really isn’t clean, there will be"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"REPETITIVE RUDIMENTS 2 HCOB 2.7.62 HOW TO GET THE RUDIMENTS IN INSTANT READS BRIEFING 42 06.02.10 an instant read on “Do you agree the question is clean?” If there is such a read, do 1, 2 and 3 again. The trick here is the definition of “In Session”. If the pc is in session the meter will read. If the pc is partially out the meter will read poorly, and the rudiment will not register and the rudiment will get missed. But with the pc in session the meter will read well for the auditor. Thus you get the pc to talk to the auditor about his own case, the definition of “in session”, before consulting the meter by using the repetitive process. What a relief to the pc to have his rudiments in! And goodbye ARC breaks and no au-diting results! ______________________ Use this system always on the beginning rudiments for every type of session. Use this system on the Middle Rudiments in a havingness and sometimes on the Prep-check type of session. But seldom on a Routine 3 (goals) type of session. Use this system always on the End Rudiments of a havingness session. Do not use it on the End Rudiments of a Prepcheck or Routine 3 type of session unless the session has been full of screaming pc (which with this system it won’t be). • Havingness Type Session: Repetitive Rudiments System on Beginning, Middle and End Rudiments. • Prepcheck Type Session: Repetitive Rudiments on Beginning and sometimes Middle Rudiments. Ask End Ru-diments against meter as in step 2 and 3 of cycle (Fast Checking, see below). • Routine 3 Type Session: Use Repetitive Rudiments on Beginning Rudiments. Use 2 and 3 only (Fast Checking) for Middle and End Rudiments unless Session very rough. ______________________ So that’s where Repetitive auditing processes wind up. Addressed to rudiments! A tip – you can ARC break a session by overuse of Middle Rudiments on Routine 3 processes. Never use the Middle Rudiments just because the pc is talking about his or her own case. That’s the definition of In Session. Use Middle Rudiments in Routine 3 when you have not had any meter needle response on three goals read three times (not one goal read dis-turbed the needle). Then get your Middle Rudiments in and cover the first consecutive nul goal above (the three that gave no response). Don’t use Middle Ruds just because 3 goals went nul. Only if no reading of a goal disturbed the needle for three goals in a row. Also use Middle Ruds when the pc “can’t think of any more” in listing of goals or items. Don’t use every time you shift lists now. Only if the pc “can’t list more”."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"REPETITIVE RUDIMENTS 3 HCOB 2.7.62 HOW TO GET THE RUDIMENTS IN INSTANT READS BRIEFING 43 06.02.10 ______________________ In Prepchecking use Middle Ruds Repetitively after 3 Zero questions have each been nul on a list of Zeros and recheck those Zeros if Middle Ruds were out. Use Middle Ruds after each What question was nulled and check the What question again and rework it if alive. Also check the Zero questions if a What went nul. If a Zero advanced to a What, both What and Zero must be checked for nullness and found nul before leaving them. One Middle Rudiments use may suffice for both unless one was found still alive after the Middle Ruds were gotten in. Repair it and recheck if so. ______________________ FAST CHECKING A Fast Check on the Rudiments consists only of steps 2 and 3 of the cycle done over and over. Watching the meter the auditor asks the question, takes up only what reads and, care-ful not to Q and A, clears it. One does this as many times as is necessary to get a clean needle. But one still says, “Do you agree that that is clean?” and catches up the disagreement by get-ting the additional answers. When both the question and the agreement are seen to be clean, the question is left. In using Fast Checking never say, “that still reads.” That’s a flunk. Say, “There’s another read here.” ______________________ You cannot easily handle a transistor type meter more sensitive than a Mark IV. The needle would be so rapid in its swings you would find it nearly impossible to keep it centred. Therefore a more sensitive meter was no answer. The TR 1 of many auditors lacks any great impingement. And this is remediable only when “altitude” can also be remedied. There had to be a better answer to getting out rudiments to read better on a Meter for all auditors and all pcs. Repetitive Rudiments is the best answer to this. (Note: I am indebted to Mary Sue, when I was working on this problem, for calling my attention back to this system which I originally developed for Sec Checking and where it worked well.) L.

To be otherwise can be catas-trophic. By perfect is meant: 1. Auditor never tries to clean a clean read; 2. Auditor never misses a read that is reacting. One mistake on M.S. or TRs may not ruin a session. One mistake on a meter read can ruin a session. That gives you the order of importance of accurate never-miss meter reading. All bad auditing results have now been traced to inaccuracy in meter reading. Other aspects of a session should be perfect. But if the session, even vaguely following a pattern session, comes to grief, it is only meter reading accuracy that is at fault. I have carefully ferreted this fact out. There is only one constant error in sessions that produce no results or poor results; inaccurate meter reading. This is also true for student and veteran auditors alike. When an auditor starts using unusual solutions, he or she was driven to them by the usual solution not working. The usual solution always works unless the meter needle reading is inaccurate. If an auditor is using unusual solutions, then that auditor’s meter reading is inaccu-rate. Given this, consequent ARC breaks and failures drive the auditor to unusual solutions. A D of P who has to dish out unusual solutions has auditors who are missing meter reads. Meter reading must be perfect every session. What is perfect? 1. Never try to clean a read that is already clean. 2. Never miss an instant reaction of the needle. If you try to clean a clean rudiment, the pc has the missed withhold of nothingness. The auditor won’t accept the origination or reply of nothingness. This can cause a huge ARC break, worse than missing a somethingness. A nothingness is closer to a thetan than some-thingness."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"AUDITING ALLOWED 2 HCOB 14.7.62 INSTANT READS BRIEFING 46 06.02.10 If you miss an instant reaction you hang the pc with a missed withhold and the results can be catastrophic. If you fumble and have to ask two or three times, the read damps out, the meter can become inoperative on that pc for the session. If you miss on one rudiment, the next even if really hot can seem to be nul by reason of ARC break. A meter goes nul on a gradient scale of misses by the auditor. The more misses, the less the meter reads. Meter perfection means only accurate reading of the needle on instant reads. It is eas-ily attained. An auditor should never miss on a needle reaction. To do so is the basis of all unsuc-cessful sessions. Whatever else was wrong with the session, it began with bad meter reading. Other auditing actions are important and must be done well. But they can all be over-thrown by one mistake in metering. 1. Never clean a clean needle. 2. Never miss a read. Unless metering perfection is attained by an auditor, he or she will continue to have trouble with preclears. The source of all upset is the missed withhold. The most fruitful source of missed withholds is poor metering. The worst TR 4 is failure to see that there is nothing there or failing to find the some-thing that is there on an E-Meter. This is important: Field Auditors, Academies and HGCs are all being deprived of the full benefit of processing results by the one read missed out of the 200 that were not missed. It is that critical! A good pro, by actual inspection, is at this moment missing about eight or nine reads per session, calling one that is clean a read and failing to note a read that read. This is the 5 to 1 ratio noted between HGC auditing and my auditing. They miss a few. I don’t. If I don’t miss meter reads, and don’t have ARC breaky pcs, why should you? With modern session pattern and processes well learned, all you have to acquire is the ability to never miss on reading a needle. If I can do it you can. L.

Purpose: To train the student auditor to locate a date on the track with the E-Meter, to in-crease the student auditor’s reality on the factualness of an E-Meter and the factualness of the time track, and to give the student auditor a great familiarity with the E-Meter and its use. Position: The student auditor and coach sit facing each other across a table. The student audi-tor handles the meter, while the coach holds the electrodes. Commands: No set commands. “Over and under” method of questioning is used to isolate the correct date. Training Stress: The coach is to select a date, preferably his birthday or any known anniver-sary. Later as the student auditor gets better, the coach is to select any date (month, day, and year) at random from the early years of his present lifetime. He does not tell the student what the date is. The student auditor, by the use of the meter, is to find the date the coach has se-lected, without the coach replying or saying anything at all except for coaching instructions. A date is found by the process of elimination. The student auditors questions are of this sort: “Is the date before 1940 A.D. . . . After 1940 A.D.?” If the needle reacts, the answer is yes. If the needle doesn’t react, the answer is no. If the needle reacts on the first question, then the second question is not asked. If the needle does not react on either question, then the student auditor does not have a year even close to the right one or he has been asking the questions with poor TR- l. After the year is found, then the student auditor locates the month of the year, “Is it before June, 1945 A.D. . . . After June 1945 A.D.?” Then the day is found, “Is it before March 15, 1945 A.D. . . . After March 15, 1945 AD.?” As the student auditor improves, the coach should increase the difficulty of the date to be found by selecting month, day, year and also minutes and seconds. The student auditor may use “before” and “after”, but not “more than. . . . less than. . . .” for this lifetime. The coach should flunk the student auditor for TR’s 0 to 2, if poor; for ambiguous, in-direct Q and A type of questions; for improper interpretation of the E-Meter reads; or for tak-ing an excessive amount of time. The student auditor passes this drill when he can easily, correctly, and accurately date on the E-Meter. History: Developed as ”E-Meter Hidden Body Part” by L.

It is a very valuable unlimited process that under-cuts Repetitive Processes and produces tone arm action on cases that have none on repetitive processes. R2H, however, is a training must before an auditor is permitted to run engrams. It does not have to be run on a pc before engrams are run. Only when an auditor can produce results with R2H should he or she run engrams on any pc. For R2H combines the most difficult steps of engram running, dating, assessing, locating and indicating by-passed charge. If an auditor can date skillfully and quickly handle ARC Breaks (and handle the Time Track) he or she is a safe auditor on R3R. If not, that auditor will not produce results with R3R or make any OTs. In Academies and the SHSBC, R2H is placed after skill is attained in Model Session and repetitive processes. In auditing programming R2H comes immediately after Reach and Withdraw and the CCHs. For sweetening a pc’s temper and life, R2H has had no equal for cases above but not including level 8. ARC stands for the Affinity–Reality–Communication triangle from which comes the Tone Scale and is best covered by the booklet “Notes on Lectures”. By-passed charge is covered very fully in recent HCOBs on ARC Breaks. R2H BY STEPS The auditing actions of Routine 2H are complex and must be done with great preci-sion. The actions are done in Routine 3 Model Session. Mid Ruds and Missed Withholds may be used. Step One: Tell the pc, “Recall an ARC Break.”"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"ROUTINE 2H ARC BREAKS BY ASSESSMENT 2 HCOB 25.6.63 INSTANT READS BRIEFING 50 06.02.10 When pc has done so acknowledge that the pc has done so. Do not ask the pc what it is. If pc says what it is, simply acknowledge. It is no business of R2H to know what the ARC Break consists of! Step Two: Date the ARC Break on the meter. If the pc volunteers the date do not verify it on the meter further. Accept it at once and write it down. The date is more important than the content of the ARC Break. Step Three: Assess the ARC Break for by-passed charge, using the attached list. Find the greatest read. The assessment is seldom gone over more than once as a whole and those that read are then read again until one remains. This is a rapid action on the meter. Look only for tiny ticks or falls or a small left to right slash of the needle. Do not expect large reactions. The Mark V meter is indispensable. Step Four: Indicate to the pc what charge was missed in that ARC Break he or she has recalled. The pc must be satisfied that that was the charge missed. The pc may try to recall what it was that was indicated. This is not a vital part of the drill but the pc must be satisfied that the located by-passed charge was the source of the ARC break. There is a danger here of a great deal of auditor ad-libbing and tanglefoot. If the pc is not satisfied and happier about it, the wrong by-passed charge has been found and Step Three must be re-done. It is no part of this process to run an engram or secondary thus located. THE ASSESSMENT FORM This is a sample form. It may be necessary to add to it. Some lines of it may eventu-ally be omitted. However, this form does work. The auditor may add a few lines to it. In asking the questions preface the whole assessment with, “In the ARC Break you re-called _____.” Do not preface each question so unless pc goes adrift. A dirty needle means pc has started to speculate.

They settle for ticks, tiny falls, etc, of the sort that can be found usually in getting Mid Ruds in. In all auditing up to Class V the usual meter needle read is around an eighth to a quarter of an inch long at sensitivity 16. The Mark V is designed to give good serviceable reads for the lower classes of audit-ing and is quite wonderful at it. But the moment you enter the wide vistas of Class V, the whole character of meter needle behaviour changes, you go from tiny read to big read. In Classes V and VI tiny reads are used only for Mid Ruds as they were in lower lev-els. But in all work in goals, Case Analysis, plotting, finding items, checking things out, etc, reads are enormous. A new horizon of metering dawns and an auditor coming up through the lower levels, entering Class V and VI work just doesn’t believe it. Most of his early mistakes in checking out goals or finding the wrongnesses are entirely based on this. He thinks a tiny read is enough and he uses it. Whereas he really must never use a small read for this work. If a goal is a real GPM it will read with great, intermittent, inconsistent slashes. If an analysis of a situation is brought to the right answer, the meter needle falls hugely. The trouble is that the auditor just doesn’t press on looking for the right answer and settles for ticks – because he can’t think up the right combination. The right combination “No GPM” or “Lock on an Implant” will send the needle racing. All mistakes on goals or situations in Classes V and VI can be traced to a failure to appreciate that metering is different at these levels. The sensitivity at Class VI has to be kept around 4. You only use sensitivity 8 or 16 to get in Since Mid Ruds. On all R6 work you shut the meter down. You can’t keep the needle at Set if you use a sensitivity higher than 4. Here’s a Class V or VI student fiasco, based on using Class III expected meter behav-iour on high level work: Auditor finds goal on list that ticks (1/8”). Asks if it’s the correctly worded goal. Gets a tick (1/16”). Runs it on the pc. Pc collapses."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"METER READS, SIZE OF 2 HCOB 1.3.64 INSTANT READS BRIEFING 54 06.02.10 Here’s the real way it should have been: Auditor finds goal on list that only ticks. Gets in Suppress and Invalidate on the list. Re-nulls. Finds another goal. Gets in Suppress on it. Gets a third of a dial instant slash (all goals and items must Instant read). Checks it out until he gets a 3” prior slash on Actual GPM. Gets a 2” slightly latent or prior slash on “correctly worded”. Gives it to the pc and pc thrives. It’s not asking the right question (what it really is) that gives you ticks. In fact a tick with a sharp edge at Class V or VI really means “wrong question asked”! Big reads are the only reads you buy at Class V and VI. Learn the right questions to ask about the character or nature of what you’re examining and you get the big falls, RRs, etc. So it’s a lack of knowledge of Track Analysis that makes the auditor fall back on small reads. And he’ll fail. The second stage of desperation enters at Class V and VI when the student, hammered by the instructors, still can’t get big reads (through lack of knowledge of the track and what things can be). The student then abandons all he knew about body motion causing needle reaction. The quickly exhaled breath, the shuffled feet, the can fling about, the stretch, the can bang, all cause big surges. So the auditor encourages the pc to shout goals and items or fling himself about so the meter will react big. This, of course, will spin the pc, getting no charge off, running wrong goals and RIs. By the time the student auditor is trained not to take body motion, shout or breath reads, his Track Analysis has also improved and he starts to ask the right questions and gets his big reads with the pc quiet as a lamb. I never touch a TA during the pc’s body movement. This loses TA, of course, since a pc is most likely to move when an RI starts to discharge. I never buy a goal unless I’ve seen it Instant read, bang on the last letter. I never ask the character of anything to Instant read, i.e. “Is this an Implant GPM”, because it may go on anticipate or arrive latent. And do I get TA on the pc! In goals finding and plotting you don’t expect much TA. Yet in six consecutive sessions I built TA a few divisions more per session, from 70 TA down divisions to 103 TA down divisions in 2½ hour session, and all by never buying a tick, only big RRs or falls. Gradual build of TA shows all is well. So Classes V and VI are not only big read classes, but they are big TA classes as well. As you are handling the basic sources of charge on a case in Classes V and VI, you expect big meter behaviour and you get it. Only ignorance of the track keeps the auditor in the small read, small TA departments. If you keep on trying to get what it really is until you have it, you will always see a big read on what it is. You wouldn’t expect to handle high voltage wires with tiny sparks. You would expect huge arcs to crackle.

Never prepcheck an item that doesn’t read. These rules hold good for all lists, all items, even Dianetics. A „tick” or a „stop” is not a read. Reads are small falls or falls or long falls or long fall blowdown (of TA). A preclear’s case can be gotten into serious trouble by listing a list that doesn’t read or prepchecking or running an item that doesn’t read. On a list, this is the sort of thing that happens: The List is „Who or what would fly kites?” The C/S has said to „List this to a BD F/N Item”. So the auditor does list it without checking the read at all. The list can go on 99 pages with the pc protesting, getting upset. This is called a „Dead horse list” because it gave no item. The reason it didn’t was that the list question itself didn’t read. One does an L4 on the pc to correct the situation and gets „Unnecessary action”. On a list that is getting no item you don’t extend. You correctly use L4 or any subse-quent issue of it. If you extend a „dead horse list” you just make things worse. Use an L4 and it will set it right. This weird thing can also happen. C/S says to list „Who or what would kill buffa-loes?” The auditor does, gets a BD F/N Item „A Hunter”. The C/S also says to list as a second action „Who or what would feel tough?” The auditor fails to test the Question for read and lists it. Had he tested it, the list would not have read. But the list comes up with an item, „A mean hunter”. It has stirred up charge from the first question and the item „A mean hunter” is a wrong item as it is a misworded variation of the first list’s item! Now we have an unneces-sary action and a wrong item. We do an L4 and the pc is still upset as maybe only one or the other of the two errors read. ____________"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"UNREADING QUESTIONS AND ITEMS 2 HCOB 27.5.70 INSTANT READS BRIEFING 62 06.02.10 In a Dianetic „list” one is not doing a listing action. One is only trying to find a so-matic or sensation, etc. that will run. The item must read well. Or it won’t produce a chain to run. In actual fact the Dn list Q does usually read but one doesn’t bother to test it. But an item that doesn’t read will produce no chain, no basic and the pc will jump around the track trying but just jamming up his bank. The moral of this story is: Always test a Listing Question before letting the pc list. Always mark the read it gave (SF, F, LF, LFBD) on the worksheet. Always test an item for read before prepchecking or running recall or engrams. Always mark the read an item gave (SF, F, LF, LFBD) on the worksheet. CHARGE The whole subject of „charge” is based on this. „Charge” is the electrical impulse on the case that activates the meter. „Charge” shows not only that an area has something in it. It also shows that the pc has possible reality on it. A pc can have a broken leg, yet it might not read on a meter. It would be charged but below the pc’s reality. So it won’t read. THINGS THAT DON’T READ WON’T RUN. The Case Supervisor always counts on the Auditor to test Questions and Items for read before running them. The auditor, when a Question or Item doesn’t read, can and should always put in „Suppress” and „Invalidate”. „On this (Question) (Item), has anything been Suppressed?” „On this (Question) (Item), has anything been Invalidated?” If either one read, the question or item will also read. The Case Supervisor also counts on the Auditor to use Suppress and In-validate on a Question or Item. If after this there is still no read on the Question or Item, that’s it. Don’t use it, don’t list it. Go to the next action on the C/S or end off. L.

SCIENTOLOGY III AUDITING BY LISTS REVISED (Note: We now F/N everything. We do not tell the pc what the meter is doing. This changes „Auditing By Lists” in both respects. We do not say to the pc, „That’s clean” or „That reads”.) AUDITING BY LISTS (Reference: HCO B 14 Mar 71, „F/N Everything”) Use any authorized, published list. (Green Form for general review, L1C for ARC Brks, L4B for listed items list errors.) METHOD 3 Use meter at a sensitivity so meter needle is loose but it is easy to keep needle at „Set”. If sensitivity is too high the needle will be in constant motion as one tries to set the TA. If too low, the instant read will not be visible. 5 is usual for upper grade cases. 16 is usual for lower grade or Dianetic cases. Have your meter in a position (line of sight) so you can see the list and the needle or you can see the needle and the pc. The meter position is important. Hold the mimeoed list close beside the meter. Have your worksheet more to the right. Keep record on your worksheet. Mark the pc’s name and date on it. Mark what list it is on the W/S with Time. It remains in the folder stapled to the W/S. Read the question on the list, note if it reads. Do not read it while looking at the pc, do not read it to yourself and then say it while looking at the pc. These are the L10 actions and"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"AUDITING BY LISTS 2 HCOB 3.7.71 INSTANT READS BRIEFING 64 06.02.10 are called Method 6, not Method 3. It is more important to see the pc’s cans than his face as can fiddle can fake or upset reads. TR 1 must be good so the pc clearly hears it. You are looking for an Instant Read that occurs at the end of the exact last syllable of the question. If it does not read, mark the list X. If the list is being done through an F/N and the F/N just continues, mark the Question F/N. If the question reads, do not say „That reads”. Mark the read at once (tick, SF, F, LF, LFBD, R/S), transfer the number of the Q to the W/S and look expectantly at the pc. You can repeat the Q by just saying it again if pc doesn’t begin to talk. He has probably already begun to answer as the Q was live in his bank as noted by the meter. Take down the pc’s remarks in shortened form on the W/S. Note any TA changes on the W/S. If the pc’s answer results in an F/N (Cog VGIs sometimes follow, GIs always accom-pany a real F/N), mark it rapidly on the W/S and say, „Thank you. I would like to indicate your needle is floating.” Do not wait endlessly for the pc to say more. If you do he will go into doubt and find more, also do not chop what he is saying. Both are TR errors that are very bad. If there is no F/N, at the first pause that looks like the pc thinks he has said it, ask for an Earlier Similar _____ whatever the question concerned. Do not change the Q. Do not fail to repeat what the Question is. „Was there an Earlier Similar Restimulation of ‘rejected affin-ity’?” This is the „E/S” part of it. You do not leave such a Question merely „clean”. It does not matter now if you look at the pc when you say it or not. But you can look at the pc when you say it. The pc will answer. If he comes to a „looks like he thinks he said it” and no F/N, you ask the same Q as above. You ask this Q „Was there an earlier similar ______” until you finally get an F/N and GIs. You indicate the F/N. That is the last of that particular question. You mark „F/N” on the list and call the next question on the list. You call this and other questions without looking at the pc. Those that do not read, you X as out. The next question that reads, you mark it on the list, transfer the question number to the W/S. Take the pc’s answer."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"AUDITING BY LISTS 3 HCOB 3.7.71 INSTANT READS BRIEFING 65 06.02.10 Follow the above E/S procedure as needed until you get an F/N and GIs for the ques-tion. Ack. Indicate and return to the mimeoed list. You keep this up until you have done the whole list in this fashion. If you got no read on the list Question but the pc volunteers some answer to an unread-ing question, do not take it up. Just ack and carry on with your mimeoed list. Believe your meter. Do not take up things that don’t read. Don’t get „hunches”. Don’t let the pc run his own case by answering non-reading items and then the auditor taking them up. Also don’t let a pc „fiddle the cans” to get a false read or to obscure a real one. (Very rare but these two actions have happened.) BIG WIN If half way down a prepared list (the last part not yet done) the pc on some question gets a wide F/N, big Cog, VGIs, the auditor is justified in calling the list complete and going to the next C/S action or ending the session. There are two reasons for this – one, the F/N will usually just persist and can’t be read through and further action will tend to invalidate the win. The auditor can also carry on to the end of the prepared list if he thinks there may be something else on it. GF AND METHOD 3 When a GF is taken up Method 3 (item by item, one at a time and F/Ned) it can occur that the TA will go suddenly high. The pc feels he is being repaired, that the clearing up of the first item on the GF handled it and protests. It is the protest that sends the TA up. This is not true of any other list. Thus a GF is best done by Method 5 (once through for reads, then the reads handled). L1C and L4B, L7 and other such lists are best done by Method 3. The above steps and actions are exactly how you do Auditing by List today. Any ear-lier data contrary to this is cancelled. Only 2 points change – we F/N everything that reads by E/S or a process to handle (L3B requires processes, not E/S to get an F/N) and we never tell the pc that it read or didn’t read, thus putting his attention on the meter. We still indicate F/Ns to the pc as a form of completion. L1C and Method 3 are not used on high or very low TAs to get them down or up. The purpose of these lists is to clean up by-passed charge."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"AUDITING BY LISTS 4 HCOB 3.7.71 INSTANT READS BRIEFING 66 06.02.10 _____________________ An auditor also indicates when he has finished with the list.

All definitions which state it is fractions of seconds after the question is asked, are cancelled. Thus an instant read which occurs when the auditor assesses an item or calls a ques-tion is valid and would be taken up and latent reads, which occur fractions of seconds after the major thought, are ignored. Additionally, when looking for reads while clearing commands or when the preclear is originating items, the auditor must note only those reads which occur at the exact moment the pc ends his statement of the item or command.
