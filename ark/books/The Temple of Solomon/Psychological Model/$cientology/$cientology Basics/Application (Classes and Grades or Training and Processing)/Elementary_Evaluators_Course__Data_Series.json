March 1975 Remimeo Data Series 1R THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT There are many types of thought. Unless one knows these types he can make serious errors on administrative lines. In the unpublished work \"Excalibur\" (most of which has been released in HCOBs, PLs and books) there was an important fundamental truth. This was Sanity is the ability to recognize differences, similarities and identities. This is also intelligence. Two or more facts or things that are totally unlike are different. They are not the same fact or same object. Two or more facts or things that have something in common with one another are similar. Two or more facts or things that have all their characteristics in common with one an-other are identical. SEMANTICS In a subject developed by Korzybski a great deal of stress is given to the niceties of words. In brief a word is NOT the thing. And an object exactly like another object is different because it occupies a different space and thus \"can't be the same object.\" As Alfred Korzybski studied under psychiatry and amongst the insane (his mentor was William Alanson White at Saint Elizabeth's insane asylum in Wash., D.C.) one can regard him mainly as the father of confusion. This work, \"general semantics,\" a corruption of semantics, (meaning really \"signifi-cance\" or the \"meaning of words\") has just enough truth in it to invite interest and just enough curves to injure one's ability to think or communicate. Korzybski did not know the formula of human communication and university professors teaching semantics mainly ended up assur-ing students (and proving it) that no one can communicate with anyone because nobody really knows what anybody else means."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 2 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 2 DATA SERIES As this \"modern\" (it was known to the Greeks, was a specialty of Sophists and was also used by Socrates) penetration into culture affects all education in the West today, it is no wonder that current communication is badly strained. Schools no longer teach basic logic. Due to earlier miseducation in language and no real education in logic much broken-down \"think\" can occur in high places. A system of thinking derived from a study of psychotics is not a good yardstick to employ in solving problems. Yet the \"thinking\" of heads of states is based on illogical and irrational rules. Populations, fortunately less \"well-educated,\" are assaulted by the irrational (kooky) \"thinking\" of governments. This \"thinking\" is faulty mainly because it is based on the faulty logic shoved off on school children. \"You must study geometry because that is the way you think\" is an idiocy that has been current for the past two or three decades in schools. I have nothing against Korzybski. But the general impact of \"General Semantics\" has been to give us stupified schoolboys who, growing up without any training in logic except general semantics are giving us problems. Increasingly we are dealing with people who have never been taught to think and whose native ability to do so has been hampered by a false \"education.\" ADMINISTRATIVE TROUBLE At once this gives an administrator trouble. Outside and inside his sphere of influence he is dealing with people who not only can't think but have been taught carefully to reach irra-tional conclusions. One can make a great deal of headway and experience a lot of relief by realizing the way things are and not getting exasperated and outraged by the absurdities that he sees being used as \"solutions.\" He is dealing with people who in school were not only not taught to think but were often taught the impossibility of thinking or communicating. This has a very vast influence on an administrator. Things that are perfectly obvious to him get so muddled when passed for decision to others that an administrator tends to go into apathy or despair. For instance it is completely logical to him that some activity must either cut its ex-penses or make more money before it goes broke. So he passes this on as an order demanding that the activity balance up its income-outgo ratio. He gets back a \"solution\" that they \"get a huge sum each week from their reserves\" so they will be \"solvent.\" The administrator feels rattled and even betrayed. What reserves? Do they have reserves? So he demands to know, has this activity been salting away reserves he knew nothing about? And he receives a solemn reply – no they don't have any reserves but they consider the administrator should just send them money! The idiocy involved here is that the \"logic\" of the persons in that activity is not up to realizing that you cannot take more out of something than is in it."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 3 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 3 DATA SERIES And the activity mentioned is not alone. Today the \"assets\" of a company are said by \"competent economists\" to be its property – good will – cash added to its debts! In short, if you have ten pennies and owe £1000 then your assets are £1000-0-10! Yes, you say, but that's crazy! And you're right. For an example of modern \"think\" the Ford Foundation is believed to have financially supported the arming of revolutionary groups so they will be dependent upon the capitalistic system and won't overthrow it even though the revolutionary group could not exist without Ford Foundation support! A war is fought and continued for years to defend the property rights of landlords against peasants although the landlords are mostly dead. Electronic computers are exported under government license and paid for by the ex-porter and shipped to an enemy who could not bomb the exporter without them in order to prevent the enemy from bombing the exporter. Yes, one says. That's treason. Not necessarily. It is the inability to think! It is the result of suppressing the native ability by false systems of \"logic.\" PROPER DEFINITIONS People who annoy one with such weird \"solutions\" do not know certain differences. Thoughts are infinitely divisible into classes of thought. In other words, in thought there are certain wide differences which are very different indeed. A Fact is something that can be proven to exist by visible evidence. An Opinion is something which may or may not be based on any facts. Yet a sloppy mind sees no difference between a Fact and somebody's opinion. In courts a psychiatrist (who is an authority) says \"Joe Doakes is crazy.\" Joe Doakes is promptly put away for ten years, tortured or killed. Yet this statement is just an Opinion uttered by somebody whose sanity is more than suspect and what's more is taken from a field \"psychiatry\" which has no basis in fact since it cannot cure or even detect insanity. A vast number of people see no difference at all in Facts and Opinions and gaily ac-cept both or either as having equal validity. An administrator continually gets opinions on his lines which are masquerading as facts. If opinion instead of facts is used in solving problems then one comes up with insane solutions. Here is an example: By opinion it is assumed there are 3000 pounds of potatoes avail-able in a crop. An order is therefore written and payment ($300 at 100 a pound) is made for"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 4 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 4 DATA SERIES the crop. One sack of potatoes is delivered containing 100 pounds. That sack was the fact. Loss is 2900 pounds of potatoes. An administrator runs into this continually. He sends somebody to find an electric po-tato peeler \"just like the one we had.\" He gets back a paring knife because it is the same. The administrator orders a similar type of shirt and gets overcoats. The administrator feels he is dealing with malice, sharp practice, laziness, etc., etc. He can lose all faith in honesty and truthfulness. The actual reason he is getting such breakdowns is Sanity is the ability to recognize differences, similarities and identities. The people with whom he is dealing can't think to such a degree that they give him in-sane situations. Such people are not crazy. Their thinking is suppressed and distorted by mod-ern \"education.\" \"You can't really communicate to anybody because the same word means different things to everyone who uses it.\" In other words, all identities are different. A basic law is usually confused by students with an incidental fact. This is conceiv-ing a similarity when one, the law, is so far senior to the fact that one could throw the fact away and be no poorer. When a student or an employee cannot use a subject he studies or cannot seem to un-derstand a situation his disability is that basics are conceived by him to be merely similar to incidental remarks. The law, \"Objects fall when dropped,\" is just the same to him as the casual example \"a cat jumped off a chair and landed on the floor.\" Out of this he fixedly keeps in mind two \"things he read\" – objects fall when dropped, a cat jumped off a chair and landed on the floor. He may see these as having identical value whereas they are similar in subject but widely dif-ferent in value. You give this person a brief write-up of company policy. \"Customers must be satisfied with our service,\" begins the write-up. Of course that's a law because it has been found to be catastrophic to violate it. On down the page is written, \"A card is sent to advise the customer about the order.\" The employee says he understands all this and goes off apparently happy to carry out his duties. A few weeks later Smith and Co. write and say they will do no more business with you. You hastily try to find out why. If you're lucky enough to track it down, you find the shipping clerk sent them a card saying, \"Your order was received and we don't intend to fill it.\" You have the clerk in. You lay down the facts. He looks at you glumly and says he's sorry. He goes back and pulls another blooper. You threaten to fire him. He's now cost the company $54,000. He is contrite. All he understands is that life is confusing and that for some mysterious reason you are mad at him, probably because you are naturally grouchy."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 5 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 5 DATA SERIES What he doesn't know is what the administrator seldom taps. It isn't that he doesn't know \"company policy.\" It's that he doesn't know the difference between a law and a com-ment! A law of course is something with which one thinks. It is a thing to which one aligns other junior facts and actions. A law lets one predict that if all objects fall when not sup-ported, then of course cats, books and plates can be predicted in behavior if one lets go of them. As the employee hasn't a clue that there is any difference amongst laws, facts, opinions, orders or suggestions he of course cannot think as he doesn't have anything to which he can align other data or with which to predict consequences. He doesn't even know that company policy is, \"Too many goofs equals fired.\" So when he does get sacked he thinks \"somebody got mad at him.\" If you think this applies only to the \"stupid employee,\" know that a whole government service can go this way. Two such services only promoted officers to high rank if they sank their own ships or got their men killed! Social acceptability was the only datum used for pro-motion and it followed that men too socially involved (or too drunk) of course lost battles. An organization, therefore, can itself be daffy if it has a concept that laws and facts and opinions are all the same thing and so has no operating policies or laws. Whole bodies of knowledge can go this route. The laws are submerged into incidental facts. The incidental facts are held onto and the laws never pointed up as having the special value of aligning other data or actions. An administrator can call a conference on a new building, accidentally collect people who can't differentiate amongst laws, facts, opinions or suggestions – treating them of equal value – and find himself not with a new building but a staggering financial loss. As the world drifts along with its generations less and less taught and more and more suppressed in thinking, it will of course experience more and more catastrophes in economics, politics and culture and so go boom. As all this influences anyone in any organization it is an important point. PERSONNEL In despair an administrator enters the field of choosing personnel by experience with them. He embraces a very cruel modern system that fires at once anybody who flubs. Actually he is trying to defend himself against some hidden menace he has never de-fined but which haunts him day by day. The majority of people with whom he deals-and especially governments-cannot con-ceive of 1. Differences, 2. Similarities, 3. Identities."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 6 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 6 DATA SERIES As a result they usually can't tell a Fact from an Opinion (because all differences are probably identities and all identities are different and all similarities are imaginary). A=A=A We have a broad dissertation on this in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health as it affects insane behavior. Everything is everything else. Mr. X looks at a horse knows it's a house knows it's a school teacher. So when he sees a horse he is respectful. When anyone in an org is sanely trying to get things done he sometimes feels like he is spinning from the replies and responses he gets to orders or requests. That's because observa-tion was faulty or think was faulty at the other end of the comm line. As he tries to get things done he begins to realize (usually falsely) that he is regarded as odd for getting impatient. THE WAYS OUT There are several ways out of this mess. a. One is to issue orders that demand close observation and execution. Issuance of clear orders provides no faintest opportunity of error, assumption or default. b. Another is to demand that an order is fully understood before it is executed. c. A third is to be sure one totally understands any order one receives before one goes off to do it or order it done. d. One is to deal only in orders and leave nothing to interpretation. e. Another is to pretest personnel on one's lines for ability to observe and conceive dif-ferences, similarities and identities. f. The effective way is to get the personnel processed. g. A useful way is to educate people with drills until they can think. h. Another way is to defend one's areas by excluding insofar as possible adjacent areas where crippled think is rampant. i. A harsh way is to plow under zones whose irrationality is destructive (such as psychia-try). THOUGHT CONFUSIONS Wherever you have thought confusions (where Fact = Opinion, where Suggestion = Orders, where an observation is taken as a direction, etc., etc., etc.) an administrator is at seri-ous risk. Misunderstoods pile up on these short circuits. Out of misunderstoods come hostili-ties. Out of these come overwork or destruction."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 7 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 7 DATA SERIES The need for all discipline can be traced back to the inability to think. Even when ap-pearing clever, criminals are idiots; they have not ever thought the thought through. One can conclude that anyone on management lines, high or low, is drastically affected by irrational think. Individuals to whom differences are identities and identities are differences can mud-dle up an operation to a point where disaster is inevitable. These are the third dynamic facts with which an organization lives daily. The fault can be very subtle so as to nearly escape close search or it can be so very broad so that it is obvious and ridiculous. But on all admin lines, the point that fails has not achieved the basic law Sanity is the ability to recognize differences, similarities and identities. L.

LOGIC means the subject of reasoning. Some in ages past have sought to label it a science. But that can be discarded as pretense and pompousness. If there were such a \"science\" men would be able to think. And they can't. The term itself is utterly forbidding. If you were to read a text on logic you would go quite mad trying to figure it out, much less learn how to think. Yet logic or the ability to reason is vital to an organizer or administrator. If he cannot think clearly he will not be able to reach the conclusions vital to make correct decisions. Many agencies, governments, societies, groups, capitalize upon this lack of logic and have for a very long time. For the bulk of the last 2,000 years the main western educator – the Church – worked on the theory that Man should be kept ignorant. A population that is unable to think or reason can be manipulated easily by falsehoods and wretched causes. Thus logic has not been a supported subject, rather the opposite. Even western schools today seek to convince students they should study geometry as \"that is the way they think.\" And of course it isn't. The administrator, the manager, the artisan and the clerk each have a considerable use for logic. If they cannot reason they make costly and time-consuming errors and can send the entire organization into chaos and oblivion. Their stuff in trade are data and situations. Unless they can observe and think their way through, they can reach wrong conclusions and take incorrect actions. Modern Man thinks mathematics can serve him for logic and most of his situations go utterly adrift because of this touching and misplaced confidence. The complexity of human problems and the vast number of factors involved make mathematics utterly inadequate. Computers are at best only servomechanisms (crutches) to the mind. Yet the chro-mium-plated civilization today has a childish faith in them. It depends on who asks the ques-tions and who reads the computer's answers whether they are of any use or not. And even then their answers are often madhouse silly."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"LOGIC 2 HCO PL 11.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 10 DATA SERIES Computers can't think because the rules of live logic aren't fully known to Man and computer builders. One false datum fed into a computer gives one a completely wrong an-swer. If people on management and work lines do not know logic the organization can go adrift and require a fabulous amount of genius to hold it together and keep it running. Whole civilizations vanish because of lack of logic in its rulers, leaders and people. So this is a very important subject. UNLOCKING LOGIC I have found a way now to unlock this subject. This is a breakthrough which is no small win. If by it a formidable and almost impossible subject can be reduced to simplicity then correct answers to situations can be far more frequent and an organization or a civiliza-tion far more effective. The breakthrough is a simple one. By establishing the ways in which things become illogical one can then establish what is logic. In other words, if one has a grasp of what makes things illogical or irrational (or crazy, if you please) it is then possible to conceive of what makes things logical. ILLOGIC There are 5 primary ways for a relay of information or a situation to become illogical. 1. Omit a fact. 2. Change sequence of events. 3. Drop out time. 4. Add a falsehood. 5. Alter importance. These are the basic things which cause one to have an incorrect idea of a situation. Example: \"He went to see a communist and left at 3:00 A.M.\" The omitted facts are that he went with 30 other people and that it was a party. By omitting the fact one alters the importance. This omission makes it look like \"he\" is closely connected to communism! When he isn't. Example: \"The ship left the dock and was loaded.\" Plainly made crazy by altering se-quence of events. Example: \"The whole country is torn by riots\" which would discourage visiting it in 1970 if one didn't know the report date of 1919."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"LOGIC 3 HCO PL 11.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 11 DATA SERIES Example: \"He kept skunks for pets\" which as an added falsehood makes a man look odd if not crazy. Example: \"It was an order\" when in fact it was only a suggestion, which of course shifts the importance. There are hundreds of ways these 5 mishandlings of data can then give one a com-pletely false picture. When basing actions or orders on data which contains one of the above, one then makes a mistake. Reason depends on data. When data is faulty (as above) the answer will be wrong and looked upon as un-reasonable. There are a vast number of combinations of these 5 data. More than one (or all 5) may be present in the same report. Observation and its communication may contain one of these 5. If so, then any effort to handle the situation will be ineffective in correcting or han-dling it. USE If any body of data is given the above 5 tests, it is often exposed as an invitation to acting illogically. To achieve a logical answer one must have logical data. Any body of data which contains one or more of the above faults can lead one into il-logical conclusions. The basis of an unreasonable or unworkable order is a conclusion which is made il-logical by possessing one or more of the above faults. LOGIC Therefore logic must have several conditions: 1. All relevant facts must be known. 2. Events must be in actual sequence. 3 Time must be properly noted. 4. The data must be factual, which is to say true or valid. 5. Relative importances amongst the data must be recognized by comparing the facts with what one is seeking to accomplish or solve."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"LOGIC 4 HCO PL 11.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 12 DATA SERIES NOT KNOW One can always know something about anything. It is a wise man who, confronted with conflicting data, realizes that he knows at least one thing-that he doesn't know. Grasping that, he can then take action to find out. If he evaluates the data he does find out against the five things above, he can clarify the situation. Then he can reach a logical conclusion. DRILLS It is necessary to work out your own examples of the 5 violations of logic. By doing so, you will have gained skill in sorting out the data of a situation. When you can sort out data and become skilled in it, you will become very difficult to fool and you will have taken the first vital step in grasping a correct estimate of any situation. L.

The first is finding a datum of comparable magnitude to the subject. A single datum or subject has to have a datum or subject with which to compare it be-fore it can be fully understood. By studying and isolating the principles that make a situation illogical one can then see what is necessary to be logical. This gives us a subject that could be called \"Illogicality Testing\" or \"Irrationality Location\" but which would be better described as data analysis. For it subjects data and therefore situations to tests which establish any falsity or truth. The other breakthrough consists of the discovery that no rules of logic can be valid unless one also includes the data being used. The nearest the ancients came to this was testing the premise or basis of an argument. Trying to study logic without also having the answers to data is like describing every-thing about an engine without mentioning what fuel it runs on; or making a sentence like \"He argued about\" or \"She disliked\" without completing it. Logic concerns obtaining answers. And answers depend on data. Unless you can test and establish the truth and value of the data being used, one cannot attain right answers no matter what Aristotle may have said or what IBM may have built. The road to logic begins with ways and means of determining the value of the data to be employed in it. Without that step no one can arrive at logic. Two things that are equal to each other and to which a third is equal are all equal to one another. If A equals B and B equals C, then C equals A. Great. This is often disputed as a theorem of logic and has been ever since Aristotle said so. There is even a modern cult of non-Aristotelian logic. The facts are that the ancient theorem is totally dependent on the data used in it. Only if the data is correct does the theorem work. Lacking emphasis on the data being used, this theorem can be proven true or false at will. The philosophers point out the fallacy without ever giving emphasis to data evaluation."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGHS 2 HCO PL 12.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 16 DATA SERIES DATA ANALYSIS Unless you can prove or disprove the data you use in any logic system, the system it-self will be faulty. This is true of the IBM computer. It is true of CIA intelligence conclusions. It is true of Plato, Kant, Hume and your own personal computer as well. Data Analysis is necessary to any logic system and always will be. Ships run on oil, electric motors on electricity and logic runs on data. If the data being stuffed into a computer is incorrect, no matter how well a computer is planned or built or proofed up against faults you can get a Bay of Pigs. In mathematics no formula will give an answer better than the data being used in it. Valid answers may only be attained in using valid data. Thus, if the subject of data analysis is neglected or imperfect or unknown or unsus-pected as a step, then wild answers to situations and howling catastrophes can occur. If data analysis becomes itself a codified subject, regardless of what formula is going to be used, then right answers can only then be attained. THE MIND AS A COMPUTER The mind is a remarkable computer. It is demonstrable that a mind which has the wrong answers removed from it becomes brighter, IQ soars. Therefore for our purposes we will consider the mind capable of being logical. As processing improves the mind's ability to reach right answers, then we can assume for our purposes that if a person can straighten out his data he can be logical and will be logi-cal and can attain right answers to situations. The fallacy of the mind is that it can operate on wrong data. Thus if we specialize in the subject of Data Analysis we can assume that a person can attain right answers. As an administrator (and anyone else) has to reach conclusions in order to act and has to act correctly to ensure his own or his group's continued survival, it is vital that he be able to observe and conclude with minimal error. Thus we will not be stressing how to think but how to analyze that with which one thinks-which is data. This gives us the importance and use of data analysis. L.

Analyze the data, 2. Using the data thus analyzed, to analyze the situation. The way to analyze data is to compare it to the 5 primary points and see if any of those appear in the data. The way to analyze the situation is to put in its smaller areas each of the data analyzed as above. Doing this gives you the locations of greatest error or disorganization and also gives you areas of greatest effectiveness. Example: There is trouble in the Refreshment Unit. There are 3 people in the unit. Do-ing a data analysis on the whole area gives us a number of outpoints. Then we assign these to A, B and C who work in the unit and find B had the most outpoints. This indicates that the trouble in the Refreshment Unit is with B. B can be handled in various ways such as his hat, his attendance, etc. Note we analyzed the data of the main area and assigned it to the bits in the area, then we had an analyzed situation and we could handle. Example: We analyze all the data we have about the Bingo Car Plant. We assign the data thus analyzed as out (outpoints) to each function of the Bingo Car Plant. We thus pin-point what function is the worst off. We then handle that function in various ways, principally by organizing it and grooving in its executives and personnel. There are several variations. We obtain an analysis of the situation by analyzing all the data we have and as-signing the outpoint data to the areas or parts. The area having the most outpoints is the target for correction. In confronting a broad situation to be handled we have of course the problem of find-ing out what's wrong before we can correct it. This is done by data analysis followed by situa-tion analysis. We do this by grading all the data for outpoints (5 primary illogics). We now have a long list of outpoints. This is data analysis."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"DATA AND SITUATION ANALYZING 2 HCO PL 15. 5. 70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 18 DATA SERIES We sort the outpoints we now have into the principal areas of the scene. The majority will appear in one area. This is situation analysis. We now know what area to handle. ____________________ Example: Seventy data exist on the general scene. We find 21 of these data are irra-tional (outpoints). We slot the 21 outpoints into the areas they came from or apply to. Sixteen came from area G. We handle area G. EXPERIENCE The remarkable part of such an exercise is that the data analysis of the data of a period of I day compares to 3 months operating experience. Thus data and situation analysis is an instant result where experience takes a lot of time. The quality of the data analysis depends on one knowing the ideal organization and purpose on which the activity is based. This means one has to know what its activities are supposed to be from a rational or logical viewpoint. A clock is supposed to keep running and indicate time and be of practical and pleasant design. A clock factory is supposed to make clocks. It is supposed to produce enough clocks cheaply enough that are good enough to be in demand and to sell for enough to keep the place solvent. It consumes raw materials, repairs and replaces its tools and equipment. It hires workmen and executives. It has service firms and distributors. That is the sort of thing one means by ideal or theoretical structure of the clock company and its organization. Those are the rational points. From the body of actual current today data on the clock company one spots the out-points for a Data Analysis. One assigns the outpoints to the whole as a Situation Analysis. One uses his admin know-how and expertise to repair the most aberrated subsection. One gets a functioning clock factory that runs closer to the ideal. Military, political and PR situations, etc., are handled all in the same way. We call these two actions: Data Analysis Situation Analysis.

One can only guess at how they do it and looking at results wonder if it is actually done at all. Obtaining information is necessary for any analysis of data. If one obtains and analyzes some information he can get a hint of what information he should obtain in what area. By obtaining more data on that area he can have enough to ac-tively handle. Thus how one obtains information becomes a very important subject. Nations have whole mobs of reporters sent out by newspapers, radio, TV and maga-zines to collect information. Politicians go jaunting around collecting information. Whole spy networks are maintained at huge expense to obtain information. The Japanese in the first third of the 20th century had two maxims: \"Anyone can spy.\" \"Everyone must spy.\" The Germans picked this up. They had their whole populations at it. The Russian KGB numbers hundreds of thousands. CIA spends billions. MI-6 _________ well you get the idea. It is not amiss however to point out that those 2 nations that devoted the most effort to espionage (Japan and Germany) were both defeated horribly. Thus the quantity of data poured in is not any guarantee of understanding. Newspapers today are usually devoted to propaganda, not news. Politicians are striv-ing to figure out another nation's evil intentions, not to comprehend it. The basic treatise on data collection and handling used to found the US intelligence data system (\"strategic intelligence\") would make one laugh – or cry. All these elaborate (and expensive) systems of collecting information are not only use-less, they are deluding. They get people in plenty of trouble. A copy of Time magazine (US) analyzed for outpoints runs so many outpoints per page when analyzed that one wonders how any publication so irrational could continue sol-vent. And what do you know! It is going broke! Those countries that spend the most on espionage are in the most trouble. They weren't in trouble and then began to spend money. They began to spy and then got into trouble! News media and intelligence actions are not themselves bad. But irrational news me-dia and illogical intelligence activity are psychotic."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"INFORMATION COLLECTION 2 HCO PL 15.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 22 DATA SERIES So information collection can become a vice. It can be overdone. If one had every org in a network fill out a thousand reports a week he would not ob-tain much information but he sure would knock them out of comm. There is a moderate flow of information through any network so long as it is within the capability of the comm lines and the personnel. Thus we get a rule about collecting data in administrative structures. Normal admin flows contain enough data to do a data and situation analysis. And The less data you have the more precise your analysis must be. And Indicators must be watched for in order to undertake a situation analysis. And A situation analysis only indicates the area that has to be closely inspected and handled. Thus, what is an \"indicator\"? An indicator is a visible manifestation which tells one a situation analysis should be done. An indicator is the little flag sticking out that shows there is a possible situation un-derneath that needs attention. Some indicators about orgs or its sections would be – dirty or not reporting or going insolvent or complaint letters or any nonoptimum datum that departs from the ideal. This is enough to engage in a data and situation analysis of the scene where the indica-tor appeared. The correct sequence, then, is 1. Have a normal information flow available. 2. Observe. 3. When a bad indicator is seen become very alert. 4. Do a data analysis. 5. Do a situation analysis. 6. Obtain more data by direct inspection of the area indicated by the situation analysis. 7. Handle. An incorrect sequence, bound to get one in deep trouble is A. See an indicator, B. Act to handle. This even applies to emergencies if one is fast enough to do the whole correct cycle in a split second."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"INFORMATION COLLECTION 3 HCO PL 15.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 23 DATA SERIES Oddly enough anyone working in a familiar area can do it all in a split second. People that can do it like lightning are known to have \"fast reaction time.\" People who can't do it fast are often injured or dead. Example of an emergency cycle: Engineer on duty, normal but experienced percep-tion. Is observing his area. Hears a hiss that shouldn't be. Scans the area and sees nothing out of order but a small white cloud. Combines sight and hearing. Moves forward to get a better look. Sees valve has broken. Shuts off steam line. Example of an incorrect action. Hears hiss. Pours water on the boiler fires. ADMIN CYCLE When you slow this down to an Admin Cycle it becomes very easy. It follows the same steps. It is not so dramatic. It could string out over months unless one realized that the steps 1 to 7 should be taken when the first signs show up. It need not. However it sometimes does. Sometimes it has to be done over and over, full cycle, to get a full scene purring. Sometimes the \"handle\" requires steps which the area is too broken down to get into effect and so becomes \"Handle as possible and remember to do the whole cycle again soon.\" Sometimes \"handle\" is a program of months or years duration; its only liability is that it will be forgotten or thrown out before done by some \"new broom.\" DATA COLLECTION But it all begins with having a normal flow of information available and observing. Seeing a bad indicator one becomes alert and fully or quickly finishes off the cycle. BAD INDICATOR What is a \"bad indicator\" really? It is merely an outpoint taken from the 5 primary outpoints. It is not \"bad news\" or \"entheta\" or a rumor. The \"bad news\" could easily be a false-hood and is an outpoint because it is false bad news! \"Good\" news when it is a falsehood is an outpoint!"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"INFORMATION COLLECTION 4 HCO PL 15.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 24 DATA SERIES RELIABLE SOURCE Intelligence services are always talking \"reliable sources.\" Or about \"confirmed obser-vation.\" These are not very reliable ways of telling what is true. The master double spy Philby as a head MI-6 adviser was a Russian spy. Yet for 30 years he determined \"reliable sources\" for the US and England! If three people tell you the same thing it is not necessarily a fact as they might all have heard the same lie. Three liars don't make one fact – they make three outpoints. So it would seem to be very difficult to establish facts if leading papers and intelli-gence services can't do it! Yes it is tough to know the truth. But the moment you begin to work with them, it is rather easy to locate outpoints. You are looking for outpoints. When they are analyzed and the situation is analyzed by them you then find yourself looking at the truth if you follow the cycle 1 to 7. It's really rather magical. If you know thoroughly what the 5 primary outpoints are they leap into view from any body of data. Oscar says he leads a happy married life. His wife is usually seen crying. It's an out-point – a falsehood. The Omaha office is reported by Los Angeles to be doing great. It fails to report. The LA datum does not include that it is 6 months old. Three outpoints, one for time, one for falsehood, one for omitted datum. Once you are fully familiar with the 5 primary outpoints they are very obvious. \"We are having pie for supper\" and \"We have no flour\" at least shows out of se-quence! It is odd but all the \"facts\" you protest in life and ridicule or growl about are all one or another of the outpoints. When you spot them for what they are then you can actually estimate things. And the pluspoints come into view. L.

Remimeo Data Series 6R DATA SYSTEMS Two bad systems are in current use on data. The first is \"reliable source.\" In this system a report is considered true or factual only if the source is well thought of. This is a sort of authority system. Most professionals working with data collection use this. Who said it? If he is considered reliable or an authority the data is considered true or factual. Sources are graded from A to D. A is highest, D lowest. The frailty of this system is at once apparent. Philby, as a high British intelligence official, was a Russian spy for 30 years. Any data he gave the UK or US was \"true\" because he was a \"reli-able source.\" He had every Western agent who was being sent into communist areas \"fin-gered\" and shot. The West became convinced you could not enter or overthrow communist held areas and stopped trying! Philby was the top authority! He fooled CIA and MI-6 for years! Psychiatrists are \"authorities\" on the mind. Yet insanity and criminality soar. They are the \"reliable sources\" on the mind. Need I say more? The other system in use is multiple report. If a report is heard from several areas or people it is \"true.\" The Russian KGB has a Department D that forges documents and plants them in several parts of the world. They are then \"true.\" Propaganda spokesmen located all over the world say the same thing to the press on every major occasion. This becomes \"public opinion\" in government circles and so is \"true\" because it is published and comes from so many areas. Five informants could all have heard the same lie. Thus we see these two systems of evaluation are both birdbrain. TWO PROBLEMS The two problems that information collection agencies have are"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"DATA SYSTEMS 2 HCO PL 1.5.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 26 DATA SERIES 1. Data evaluation and 2. How to locate the areas they should closely investigate. For (1), data evaluation, they use primarily reliable source and multiple report. Every item received that is not \"Reliable\" or \"Multiple\" is waste-basketed. They throw out all outpoints and do not report them! Their agents are thoroughly trained to do this. As for (2), areas to investigate, they cannot pinpoint where they should investigate or even what to investigate because they do not use their outpoints. Using outpoints and data and situation analysis they would know exactly where to look at, at what. ERRORS The above data errors are practiced by the largest data collection agencies on the planet-the \"professionals.\" These advise their governments! And are the only advisers of their governments. Thus you can see how dangerous they are to their own countries. Naturally they have agents who have what is called \"flair.\" These, despite all systems, apply logic. They are so few that Eisenhower's intelligence adviser, General Strong, said in his book that they are too scarce so one is better off with a vast organization. These agencies are jammed with false reports and false estimations. An event contemporary with this writing where the US invaded Cambodia shows sev-eral data and situation errors. Yet the Viet Cong HQ were using computers. Yet their HQ was wiped out. The US President used CIA data which does not include, by law, data on the US. So the info on which the US President was acting was 50% missing! He was only told about the enemy evidently. When he ordered the invasion the US blew up! A rather big outpoint (omitted facts) don't you think? FAULTS The reason I am using intelligence examples is because these are the biggest human data collection \"professionals\" in the world. The collection and use of data to estimate situations to guide national actions and the data collection by a housewife going shopping are based on the same principles. Mrs. Glutz, told by a \"reliable source,\" Nellie Jones, that things are cheaper at Finkle-berries and told by enough TV admen she should buy Kleano tends to do just that. Yet Blas-tonsteins is really cheaper and by shaving up laundry soap and boiling it she can have ten dol-lars worth of Kleano for about fifty cents. Errors in national data collection give us war and high taxes and for Mrs. Glutz gives her a busted budget and stew all week."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"DATA SYSTEMS 3 HCO PL 1.5.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 27 DATA SERIES So at top and bottom, any operation requires a grasp of data evaluation and situation estimation.

This is what also could be called an ideal scene or situation. If one doesn't know the ideal scene or situation then one is not likely to observe non-ideal points in it. Let us send a farmer to sea. In a mild blow, with yards and booms creaking and water hitting the hull, he is sure the ship is about to sink. He has no familiarity with how it should sound or look so he misses any real outpoints and may consider all pluspoints as outpoints. Yet on a calm and pretty day he sees a freighter come within 500 feet of the side and go full astern and thinks everything is great. An experienced officer may attempt madly to avoid collision and all the farmer would think was that the officer was being impolite! The farmer, lacking any familiarity with the sea and having no ideal as to what smooth running would be, would rarely see real outpoints unless he drowned. Yet an experienced sailor, familiar with the scene in all its changing faces sees an outpoint in all small illogicals. On the other hand, the sailor on the farm would completely miss rust in the wheat and an open gate and see no outpoints in a farm that the farmer knew was about to go bust. The rule is A person must have an ideal scene with which to compare the existing scene. If a staff hasn't got an idea of how a real org should run, then it misses obvious out-points. One sees examples of this when an experienced org man visiting the org tries to point out to a green staff (which has no ideal or familiarity) what is out. The green staff grudgingly fixes up what he says to do but lets go of it the moment he departs. Lacking familiarity and an ideal of a perfect org, the green staff just doesn't see anything wrong or anything right either! The consequences of this are themselves illogical. One sees an untrained executive shooting all the producers and letting the bad hats alone. His erroneous ideal would be a quiet org, let us say. So he shoots anyone who is noisy or demanding. He ignores statistics. He ig-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"FAMILIARITY   2   HCOPL   18.5.70   ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 30 DATA SERIES nores the things he should watch merely because he has a faulty ideal and no familiarity of a proper scene. OBSERVATION ERRORS When the scene is not familiar one has to look hard to become aware of things. You've noticed tourists doing this. Yet the old resident \"sees\" far more than they do while walking straight ahead down the road. It is easy to confuse the novel with the \"important fact.\" \"It was a warm day for winter\" is a useful fact only when it turns out that actually everything froze up on that day or it indicated some other outpoint. Most errors in observation are made because one has no ideal for the scene or no familiar-ity with it. However there are other error sources. \"Being reasonable\" is the chief offender. People dub-in a missing piece of a sequence, for instance, instead of seeing that it is missing. A false datum is imagined to exist because a se-quence is wrong or has a missing step. It is horrifying to behold how easily people buy dub-in. This is because an illogical se-quence is uncomfortable. To relieve the discomfort they distort their own observation by not-ising the outpoint and concluding something else. I recall once seeing a Tammany Hall group (a New York political bunch whose symbol is a tiger) stop before the tiger's cage in a zoo. The cage was empty and they were much disap-pointed. I was there and said to them, \"The tiger is out to lunch.\" They told those on the outer edge of the group, \"The tiger is out to lunch.\" They all cheered up, accepted the empty cage and went very happily on their way. Not one said \"Lunch?\" Or \"Who are you?\" Or laughed at the joke. Even though it was sunset! I pitied the government of New York! ACCURATE OBSERVATION There are certain conditions necessary for accurate observation. First is a means of perception whether by remote communication by various comm lines or by direct looking, feeling, experiencing. Second is an ideal of how the scene or area should be. Third is familiarity with how such scenes are when things are going well or poorly. Fourth is understanding pluspoints or rightnesses when present. Fifth is knowing outpoints (all 5 types) when they appear. Sixth is rapid ability to analyze data."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"FAMILIARITY   3   HCOPL   18.5.70   ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 31 DATA SERIES Seventh is the ability to analyze the situation. Eighth is the willingness to inspect more closely the area of outness. Then one has to have the knowledge and imagination necessary to handle. One could call the above the cycle of observation. If one calls handle number 9 it would be the Cycle of Control. If one is trained to conceive all variations of outpoints (illogics) and studies up to conceive an ideal and gains familiarity with the scene or type of area, his ability to observe and handle things would be considered almost supernatural.

This has been so far out in the society that the word \"sane\" itself has come to mean \"conservative\" or \"cautious.\" Or something you can agree with. The 19th century psycholo-gist decided he could not define \"normal\" and there weren't any normal people. The 14th cen-tury psychiatrist is the 20th century \"authority\" on sanity. Yet an examination of such shows them to be unable to demonstrate it personally or bring it about, much less define it. Dictionaries say it is \"health, soundness of body or mind; level-headedness, reason-ableness.\" Yet sanity is vital to accurate observation. FIXED IDEAS The \"idée fixe\" is the bug in sanity. Whenever an observer himself has fixed ideas he tends to look at them not at the in-formation. Prejudiced people are suffering mainly from an \" idée fixe.\" The strange part of it is that the \"idée fixe\" they think they have isn't the one they do have. An example of this is the social \"scientist\" with a favorite theory. I have seen tons of these birds pushing a theory as though it was the last theory in the world and valuable as a ten-pound diamond. Such throw away any fact that does not agree with theory. That's how 19th century psychology went off the rails. All fixed ideas and no facts. The physical sciences in Hegel's time did the same thing. There was no 8th planet in the solar system, even when found in a telescope, because \"seven is a perfect number so there can only be seven planets.\" History is full of idiocies-and idiots-with fixed ideas. They cannot observe beyond the idea."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"SANITY 2 HCO PL 19.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 34 DATA SERIES A fixed idea is something accepted without personal inspection or agreement. It is the perfect \"authority knows best.\" It is the \"reliable source.\" A typical one was the intelligence report accepted by the whole US Navy right up to 7 Dec. 1941, the date of destruction of the US fleet by Jap planes. The pre-Pearl Harbor report, from unimpeachably reliable sources was \"the Japanese cannot fly-they have no sense of balance.\" The report overlooked that the Japs were the world's greatest acrobats! It became a fixed idea that caused the neglect of all other reports. A fixed idea is uninspected. It blocks the existence of any contrary observation. Most reactionaries (people resisting all progress or action) are suffering from fixed ideas which they received from \"authorities,\" which no actual experience alters. That British red-coated infantry never took cover was another one. It took a score or two of wars and fantastic loss of life to finally break it down. If any single fixed idea de-stroyed the British Empire, this one is a candidate. NORMAL SCENE The reason a fixed idea can get so rooted and so overlooked is that it appears normal or reasonable. And somebody or a lot of somebodies want to believe it. Thus a fixed idea can become an ideal. It is probably a wrong ideal. Incapable Jap pi-lots would be a wish for a navy. It would be wonderful! Red-coated infantry were supposed to be brave and unflinching. In both cases the ideal is irrational. A rational ideal has this law: The purpose of the activity must be part of the ideal one has for that activity. A navy that has an ideal that the enemy can't fly is stupidly avoiding its own purpose which is to fight. British infantry had the purpose of winning wars, not just looking brave. Thus one can analyze for a sane ideal by simply asking, \"What's the purpose of the ac-tivity?\" If the ideal is one that forwards the purpose, it will pass for sane. There are many factors which add up to an ideal scene. If the majority of these for-ward the purpose of the activity, it can be said to be a sane ideal. If an ideal which does not forward the activity in any way is the ideal being stressed then a fixed idea is present and had better be inspected. This could be said to be a very harsh utilitarian view of things. But it is not. The artis-tic plays its role in any ideal. Morale has its part in any ideal."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"SANITY 3 HCO PL 19.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 35 DATA SERIES An ideal studio for an artist could be very beautiful or very ugly so long as it served him to produce his art. If it was very beautiful yet hindered his artistic activities it would be a very crazy ideal scene. A handsome factory that produced would be a high ideal. But its nearness to raw ma-terials, transport and worker housing are the more important factors in an ideal of a factory. And its location in a country where the government made an atmosphere in which production could occur could be an overriding part of an \"ideal scene.\" You have to look at what the area is for before you can say whether it is ideal or not. And if its area is too limited to produce or too expensive for it to be solvent, then it is-n't a sane scene. URGES TO IMPROVE Sometimes the urge to improve an activity is such that it injures or destroys the activ-ity. If one is familiar with the type of activity he must also realize that there is a law in-volved. The fact that something is actually operating and solvent can outweigh the un-tested advantages of changing it. In other words, an ideal scene might be vastly different but the actual scene IS operat-ing. So the factor of obsessive change enters. Change can destroy with ferocity. Whole areas of London, jammed with small but customer-filled shops, have been swept away to make room for chromium high-rent modern stores which stand empty of buy-ers. Birmingham, where you could get anything made, had all its tiny craft shops swept away and replaced with high-rent huge new buildings all on some progress-crazy psychotic break. Possibly the new stores and the huge new shops fitted somebody's \"ideal\" but they did not match an actual operating environment. It is this difference between an ideal scene and a practical scene which brings down many old businesses and civilizations. Therefore, to have an ideal, familiarity with what works is desirable. It is quite possible without any familiarity, to imagine a successful ideal. But it must not have any fixed ideas in it. It is the fixed idea that knocks a practical operating living environment in the head."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"SANITY 4 HCO PL 19.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 36 DATA SERIES Do-gooders are always at this. They see in a row of old shacks, not economic inde-pendence and a lazy life but P-O-V-E-R-T-Y. So they get a new housing project built, shoot taxes into the sky, put total control on a lot of people and cave in a society. The do-gooder is pushing the 19th century fixed idea of the Comte de Saint-Simon-to gear the whole economy down to the poorest man in it. In other words to reward only the downstat. Everyone becomes a slave of course but it sure sounds good. Newspapermen are probably the world's worst observers. They observe through the fixed ideas of the publisher or the prevailing control group. Their stories are given them be-fore they leave the office. Yet their observations advise the public and the government! The outpoints to be found in any contemporary newspaper brand most stories as false before one proceeds more than a paragraph. Yet this is what the world public is expected to run on. Naturally it distorts the scene toward raving insanity. This conflicts with the native logic of people so the public thinks the world a lot madder than it really is. In two cities all newspapers were suspended from publication for quite a period. In both, crime dropped to zero! And resumed again when newspapers were again published. The ideal scene of the citizen in his workaday world is vastly different than the scene depicted in a newspaper. The difference between the two can make one feel quite weird. Thus there should not be too wide a difference between the ideal and the represented scene. And not too wide a difference between the ideal and the actual scene. R (reality) consists of the is-ness of things. One can improve upon this is-ness to bring about an ideal and lead the R up to it. This is normal improvement and is accepted as sane. One can also degrade the R by dropping the representation (description) of the scene well below the actual. In the black propaganda work traditionally carried on by many gov-ernments this latter trick of corrupting the R is the means used to foment internal revolt and war. Both actions of upgrade and downgrade are outpoints when reported as facts. \"We made £1000 in reserves this week\" is as crazily outpoint as \"the government went broke this week\" when either one is not the truth. When the report says, \"we should plan a higher income,\" it is leading to a higher idea! and is not an outpoint mainly because it is not representing any fact but a hopeful and ambi-tious management. 5 POINTS When none of the outpoints are present, yet you do have reports and the scene is func-tioning and fulfilling its purpose one would have what he could call a sane scene."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"SANITY 5 HCO PL 19.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 37 DATA SERIES If all 5 points were absent yet the scene was not functioning well enough to live, it would be such a departure from the ideal that that itself would be outpoint in that importance was altered. What is out here is the whole situation! The situation analysis would be instantly visible. But in practice this last happens only in theory, not in practice. A collapsing situation is forecast by outpoints in its data. Organisms and organizations tend to survive. A decline of survival is attended also by outpoints. SANITY IS SURVIVAL Anything not only survives better when sane but it is true that the insane doesn't sur-vive. Thus survival potential can be measured to a considerable degree by the absence of outpoints. This does not mean that sane men can't be shot or sane organizations can't be de-stroyed. It means only that there is far less chance of them being shot and destroyed. So long as men and organizations are connected to insane men and organizations, wild things can and do happen unexpectedly. But usually such things can be predicted by outpoints in others. When sane men and organizations exist in a broad scene that is convulsed with irra-tionality, it takes very keen observation and a good grip on logic and fast action to stay alive. This is known as \"environmental challenge.\" It can be overdone! Too much challenge can overwhelm. The difference between such happening to a sane man or organization and to the in-sane would be that the failure did not itself become a fixed idea. INSANITY The 5 primary illogics or outpoints as we call them are of course the anatomy of insan-ity. In their many variations the insanity of any scene can be sounded and the nucleus of it located. By locating and then closely inspecting, such a point of insanity can then be handled. When you know what insanity really is you can then confront it and handle it. One is not driven into a huge generality of \"everything is insane.\" By detecting and eliminating small insane areas, taking care not to destroy the sane things around it, one can gradually lift any situation up to sanity and survival."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"SANITY 6 HCO PL 19.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 38 DATA SERIES By seeing what is insane in a scene and seeing why it is insane, one has by comparison also found what is sane.

An error may show something else. It is nothing in itself. An error obscures or alters a datum. Example: Asking someone to spot the outpoints in a Russian passenger vacation cruise liner in a foreign port, the answers were, \"The hammer and sickle are upside down.\" \"The courtesy flag is not flying right side up.\" These aren't outpoints. The hammer and sickle weren't backwards so saying it was an outpoint. The actual outpoint was passenger vacation cruise liner. There is no Russian idle class. It was too big to be giving cruises to winning trac-tor drivers. Russian and vacation cruise liner just don't go together. Either the reports of Rus-sian refusal to let Russians travel is false or it wasn't a vacation cruise liner but it was. Hence it's an outpoint. An omitted datum. Two contrary data means one is false. Investigation dis-closed it was Russian all right and a vacation cruise liner all right. But it was chartered to an Italian company that sold cruises to Italians! But this leads to a new outpoint. How come the workers paradise is building huge ships for capitalist pleasures? If anyone like a Martian was tracing down what's out on this planet, this one outpoint would lead to others. A situation analysis would indicate an investigation of Russia where outpoints abound and the Martian would know a lot of what's wrong on the planet, In doing so he would find a lot of capitalistic outpoints which would lead him to in-vestigate the so-called West and he would have the basic \"cold war\" of communism versus capitalism. This would lead him into new data the two have in common (economics) and a data analysis of economics would discover the screwiest bunch on the planet, the international banker playing off both sides. He would have analyzed the planet. Given that he knew or could translate languages, it might take him a week, starting with a Russian luxury cruise liner, to run down the planetary bad spot."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"ERRORS 2 HCO PL 23.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 40 DATA SERIES Now if he reversed his investigation and used pluspoints he would arrive with a situa-tion analysis of what group would be strong enough to handle the down spot and by investiga-tion possibly pinpoint what could tip over the bad spot. If he just used \"errors\" he would get no place. The ideal he would have to be working from would be a planet at peace where indi-viduals could go about their affairs and be happy without threats of immediate arrest or de-struction. It would be a very simple ideal or it would be based only on how planetary popula-tions and cultures survive and that is already laid down in an earlier rule in this series. Ask somebody to look at a table used for meals at the end of a meal and indicate any outpoints. Usually he'll point out a dirty plate or crumbs or an ashtray not emptied. They are not outpoints. When people finish eating one expects dirty plates, crumbs and full ashtrays. If none of these things were present there might be several outpoints to note. The end of a meal with table and plates all clean would be a reversed sequence. That would be an outpoint. Evi-dentially the dinner has been omitted and that would be quite an outpoint! Obviously no meal has been served so there's a falsehood. So here are three outpoints. It is best to get what outpoints are down pat. One does this first by thinking up exam-ples and then by observing some body of data and then by looking at various scenes. It will be found that outpoints are really few unless the activity is very irrational. Simple errors on the other hand can be found in legions in any scene. Child's games often include, \"What's wrong with this picture?\" Usually they are just errors like a road sign upside down. But if you had a brown rabbit in winter holding down a man with its front paws and a caption, \"Japanese parasols attack ____________ ,\" you'd have some real outpoints. A lot of people would try to figure it out and supply new outpoints (being reasonable). A learned professor could point out the symbolism. Some would laugh it off. Some would be annoyed by it. And the reason anybody would do anything about it is that it is sort of painful to confront the irrational so instead of seeing its is-ness of illogics an effort is made to make it logical or to throw it away. The reason misunderstood words or typographical errors were not regarded as a bar-rier to study was that people converted them or not-ised them. In actual fact a word one does not understand made a missing datum. Reasonableness or nonconfront enter in and one drops the book. Errors do not count in pluspoints either. That a factory has a few errors is no real indicator. A factory has pluspoints to the de-gree it attains its ideal and fulfills its purpose. That some of its machinery needs repair might not even be an outpoint. If the general machinery of the place is good for enough years to easily work off its replacement value there is a pluspoint.

A person who does not know how the scene should be can thereafter miss most of the outpoints in it. An example is the continual rewrite of the International Code (signaling by flags be-tween ships) by some \"convention\" composed of clerks who have never gone to sea. Not knowing the scene, the International Code of Signals now contains \"How are your kidneys?\" but nothing about lifeboats. College education became rather discredited in Europe until students were required to work in areas of actual practice as part of their studies. Educated far from reality students had \"no scene.\" Thus no data they had was related by them to an actual activity. There was even an era when the \"practical man\" or \"practical engineer\" was held in contempt. That was when the present culture started to go down. On the other hand one of the most long-lived activities around is the wine industry of Portugal. It has almost no theory trained. It is total scene. Every job in it is by apprenticeship for years. It is very constant and very successful. A good blend would be theory and practical in balance. That gives one data and activ-ity. But it could be improved by stressing also the ideal scene. BODIES OF DATA Data classifies in similar connections or similar locations. A body of data is associated by the subject to which it is applicable or by the geo-graphical area to which it belongs. A body of data can also be grouped as to time, like an historical period. Illogic occurs when one or more data is misplaced into the wrong body of data for it. An example would be \"Los Angeles smog was growing worse so we fined New York.\" That is pretty obviously a misplace."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE MISSING SCENE 2 HCO PL 23.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 44 DATA SERIES \"Cars were no longer in use. Bacterial warfare had taken its toll.\" \"I am sorry madam but you cannot travel first class on a third class passport.\" Humanoid response to such displacements is to be reasonable. A new false datum is dreamed up and put into the body of data to explain why that datum is included. (Reasonable-ness is often inserted as explanation of other outpoints also.) In the smog one, it could be dreamed up that New York's exports or imports were causing LA smog. In the car one, it could be imagined that bacteriological warfare had wiped out all the people. In the train one, it could be inserted that in that country, passports were used instead of tickets. The brain strains to correctly classify data into its own zones and is very rejective or imaginative when it is not. Intelligence tests accidentally use this one very often. It remains that an outpoint can occur when a datum belonging to one zone of data, lo-cation or time, is inserted into another zone where it doesn't. Algebra is sometimes hard to learn for some because numbers are invaded by letters. 2x = 10. X is of course 5. But part of a new student's mind says letters are letters and make words. Primitive rejective responses to foreigners is a mental reaction to a body of people, in this case, being invaded by a person not of that tribe. If the scene is wholly unknown, one doesn't know what data belongs to it. Thus a sense of confusion results. Recruits can be sent for ruddy rods for rifles and apprentice paint-ers can be ordered to get cans of sky blue lampblack. A sense of humor is in part an ability to spot outpoints that should be rejected from a body of data. In fact a sense of humor is based on both rejection and absurd outpoints of all types. Reasonable people accept displacements with an amazing tranquility by imagining connecting links or assuming they do not know the ideal scene. A reasonable person would accept a pig in a parlor by imagining that there was a good reason for it. And leave the pig in the parlor and revise their own ideal scene! Yet pigs belong to a body of data including barns, pens, farms, animals. And parlors belong to a body of data including teacups, knickknacks, conversation and humans. Possibly Professor Wundt who \"discovered\" in 1879 that humans were animals had seen too many pigs in parlors! And based the whole of \"psychology\" on a confusion of bodies of data!"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"THE MISSING SCENE 3 HCO PL 23.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 45 DATA SERIES Murder in a hospital, as done by psychiatry, would be a confusion of bodies of ac-tions. Actions belong to their own bodies of data. One drives a car, rides a horse. One doesn't ride a car but one can drive a horse. But the action, the motions involved with, driving a horse are very different than those used in driving a car. This is a language breakdown called a \"homonym.\" One word means two dif-ferent things. Japanese is an easy language except for its use of the same word for several different things. Two Japanese talking commonly have to draw Chinese characters (Japanese is written with Chinese characters) to each other to unravel what they mean. They are in a perpetual struggle to pry apart bodies of data. \"1234 Red 789 P 987 Green 432 Apple\" as a statement would probably tie up CIA codebreakers for weeks as they would know it was a code. The same statement would tie up a football coach as he would know it was a team play. A mathematician would know it fitted into some other activity than his. Hardly anyone would classify it as a totally meaningless series of symbols. So there is a reverse compulsion-to try to fit any datum found into some body of data. The mind operates toward logic, particularly in classes of things. The sensible handling of data of course includes spotting a datum, terminal, item, ac-tion, grouped in with a body of data wrong for it. And in spotting that a datum does not have to belong anywhere at all. Included in mental abilities is putting similar data into one type of action, items, or data. Car parts, traffic rules, communications, are each a body of data in which one can fit similar data. When a person has some idea of the scene involved, he should be able to separate the data in it into similar groups. An org board is an example of this. Sections are broad classes of action or items into which one can fit the related data. Departments are a broader body of related data, actions, items. Divisions are even broader but still cover related classes of data. The whole org is a very broad class of data, determined in part by the type of product being made. If a person has trouble relating data to its proper body of data (if he were unaware or \"reasonable\") he would have an awful lot of trouble finding his way around an org or routing despatches or getting things or wearing his own hat. Orders are a broad class of data. Orders from proper sources is a narrower body of data. If a person cannot tell the difference he will follow anyone's orders. And that will snarl him up most thoroughly. I once knew a carpenter so obliging and so unable to classify orders that he built knickknacks, cabinets, shelves, for any staff member who asked and wasted all the time and materials and orders from his boss that were to have built a house! The house materials and money and the carpenter's time and pay were all expended without anything of value to show"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"THE MISSING SCENE 4 HCO PL 23.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 46 DATA SERIES for it! Not only was he unable to relate orders to their own classes but also couldn't relate ma-terials and plans to a house! In most miscarriages of projects it will be found that someone on the line cannot relate data or actions to their own classes. Along with this goes other illogics. So the ability to spot illogics in a known scene can directly relate to efficiency and even to success and survival. A switch intended for a house put into an airplane electrical system cuts out at 30,000 feet due to the wrong metal to withstand cold and there goes the airplane. A part from one class of parts is included wrongly in another class of parts. So there is an incorrectly included datum which is a companion to the omitted da-tum as an outpoint. This most commonly occurs when, in the mind, the scene itself is missing and the first thing needed to classify data (scene) is not there. An example is camera storage by someone who has no idea of types of cameras. In-stead of classifying all the needful bits of a certain view camera in one box, one inevitably gets the lens hoods of all cameras jumbled into one box marked \"lens hoods.\" To assemble or use the view camera one spends hours trying to find its parts in boxes neatly labeled \"camera backs,\" \"lenses,\" \"tripods,\" etc. Here, when the scene of what a set up view camera looks like and operates like, is missing, one gets a closer identification of data than exists. Lens hoods are lens hoods. Tri-pods are tripods. Thus a wrong system of classification occurs out of scene ignorance. A traveler unable to distinguish one uniform from another \"solves\" it by classifying all uniforms as \"porters.\" Hands his bag to an arrogant police captain and that's how he spent his vacation, in jail. Lack of the scene brings about too tight an identification of one thing with another. This can also exclude a vital bit making a disassociation. A newly called-up army lieutenant passes right on by an enemy spy dressed as one of his own soldiers. An experienced sergeant right behind him claps the spy in jail accurately because \"he wasn't wearing 'is 'at the way we do in the Fusileers!\" Times change data classification. In 1920 anyone with a camera near a seaport was a spy. In 1960 anyone not carrying a camera couldn't be a tourist so was watched! So the scene for one cultural period is not the scene for another. ____________________ Thus a class of data for a given time belongs broadly or narrowly to itself. Including a datum in it or from another time or excluding a datum from it, or forcing a datum to have a class can in any combination produce an illogical situation."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"THE MISSING SCENE 5 HCO PL 23.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 47 DATA SERIES Some knowledge of the scene itself is vital to an accurate and logical assembly or re-view of data.

To some, a despatch is a situation. A small error to others is a situation. Yet, if one wishes to know and use data and logic one must know exactly what is meant in this logic series by situation. English has several meanings for the one word. In the dictionary it's a \"place,\" a 64state or condition of affairs,\" \"a momentous combination of circumstances,\" \"a clash of passions or personalities,\" or \"a job.\" One gets the feeling that people are fumbling around for a meaning they know must be there. For our purposes we had better give an exact definition of what is meant by situation. If we are going to do a situation analysis by doing an analysis of data, then WHAT is a situa-tion? We can therefore specifically define for our purposes in logic the word situation. A situation is a major departure from the ideal scene. This means a wide and significant or dangerous or potentially damaging circumstance or state of affairs which means that the ideal scene has been departed from and doesn't fully exist in that area. THE IDEAL SCENE One has to work out or know what the ideal scene would be for an organization or de-partment or social strata or an activity to know that a wide big flaw existed in it. To be somewhat overly illustrative about it, let us take a town that has no one living in it. One would have to figure out what was the ideal scene of a town. Any town. It would be a place where people lived, worked, ate, slept, survived. It could be pretty or historical or well designed or quaint. Each of these would possibly add purpose or color to the town."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"SITUATION 2 HCO PL 30.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 50 DATA SERIES But this town in question has no people living in it. That is a departure from the ideal scene of towns. Therefore the situation would be no people live in this \"town.\" Data analysis would lead us to this by noting outpoints.  6 P.M. - No smoke from house chimneys. (omitted item)  9 P.M. - No lights. (omitted item)  Dawn - No dogs. (omitted terminals)  1910 election poster. (wrong time) That would be enough. We would then realize that a situation existed because data analysis is also done against the ideal scene. We would know enough about it to look more closely. No people! That's the situation. HANDLING Thus if one were responsible for the area one would now know what to handle. How he handled it depends upon (a) the need, (b) availability of resources, and (c) ca-pability. Obviously if it's supposed to have people in it and if one needs a town there one would have to get a bright idea or a dozen and eventually get people to live there. How fast it could be done depends on the availability of resources-those there or what one has (even as little resource as a voice, paper, pen, comm lines). One's own capability to get ideas or work or the capabilities of people are a major fac-tor in handling. But so far as the situation is concerned, it exists whether it is handled or not. HOW TO FIND A SITUATION When you are called upon to find out if there is a situation (as an inspector or official or soldier or cat or king, whatever) you can follow these steps and arrive with what the situa-tion is every time. 1. Observe. 2. Notice an oddity of any kind or none. 3. Establish what the ideal scene would be for what is observed. 4. Count the outpoints now visible."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"SITUATION 3 HCO PL 30.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 51 DATA SERIES 5. Following up the outpoints observe more closely. 6. Establish even more simply what the ideal scene would be. 7. The situation will be the most major departure from the Ideal Scene. HANDLING Just as you proceed to the most major situation – go big, when it comes to handling it usually occurs that reverse is true – go small! It is seldom you can handle it all at one bang. (Of course that happens too.) But just because the situation is big is no real reason the solution must be. Solutions work on gradient scales. Little by more by more. When you really see a situation it is often so big and so appalling one can feel inca-pable. The need to handle comes first. The resources available come next. The capability comes third. Estimate these and by getting a very bright workable (often very simple) idea, one can make a start. An activity can get so wide of the ideal scene the people in it are just in a confusion. They do all sorts of odd irrelevant things, often hurt the activity further. Follow the steps given 1-7 above and you will have grasped the situation. You will then be able to do (a), (b), (c). That begins to make things come right. In that way most situations can be both defined and handled. INTERFERENCE Lots of people, often with lots of authority, get mired into situations. They do not know they are in anything that could be defined, isolated or stated. They bat madly at unim-portant dust motes or each other and just mire in more deeply. Whole civilizations uniformly go the route just that way. So do orgs, important activities and individuals. One can handle exactly as above, if one practices up so he can really do the drill on li-fe. The only danger is that the situation can be so far from any ideal that others with fixed ideas and madness can defy the most accurate and sensible solutions."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"SITUATION 4 HCO PL 30.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 52 DATA SERIES But that's part of the situation, isn't it? ____________________ Data analysis is done to make a more direct observation of exactly the right area pos-sible.

These are defining the ideal scene itself, detect without error or guess any departure on it, find out why a departure occurred and work out a means of reverting back to the ideal scene. In order to resolve a situation fully one has to get the real reason why a departure from the ideal scene occurred. \"What was changed?\" or \"What changed?\" is the same question. That \"change\" is the root of departures comes from a series of plant experiments I conducted. (The type of experimentation was undertaken to study cellular life behavior and reaction to see if it was a different type of life-it isn't. The experiments themselves were later repeated in various universities and were the subject of much press for them over the world.) In setting up conditions of growth I observed that plants on various occasions greatly declined suddenly. In each case I was able to trace the last major change that had occurred and correct it. Changes made in temperature, water volume, humidity, ventilation, greatly affected the plants in terms of wilt, decreased growth rate, increase in parasites, etc. When the change was isolated and the condition reverted to that occurring during the previous healthy period, a recovery would occur. At first glance this may seem obvious. Yet in actual practice it was not easy to do. Gardeners' records would omit vital data or alter importance or drop out time, etc. A gardener might seek to cover up for himself or a fellow worker. He tended to make himself right and would enter falsehoods or reassurance that was a falsehood into the analysis. A new gardener would seem to affect the plants greatly and one could build a person-ality influence theory on this-until one found that, being untrained in the procedure used, he would enter even more outpoints than usual. At such a juncture one would of course train the gardener. But that didn't locate what had been changed. And one had to locate that to get the plants to recover. The conditions in use were extreme forcing conditions anyway and lapse of duty was very apparent. Six-"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 2 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 54 DATA SERIES teen-foot hothouse American corn from seeds usually furnishing 5-foot stocks, 43 tomatoes to the truss where 5 is more usual were the demands being met. So any change showed up at once. The fact of change itself was a vital point as well. One discovery was that life does best in a near optimum constancy-meaning that change just as change is usually harmful to plant life. The fact of isolating change in the environment as the sole harmful cause was one dis-covery. That one had to isolate the change in order to obtain full recovery was another discov-ery. Change itself was not bad but in this experimental series conditions were set as opti-mum and the beneficial changes had already been made with remarkable results. Thus one was observing change from the optimum. This would be the same thing as \"departures from the ideal scene.\" The action was always 1. Observe the decline. 2. Locate the exact change which had been made. 3. Revert the change. 4. A return to the near ideal scene would occur if one were maintaining the ideal scene meanwhile. THE IDEAL SCENE There are two scenes: A. The ideal scene B. The existing scene, These of course can be wide apart. How does one know the ideal scene? At first thought it would be very difficult for a person not an expert to know the ideal scene. For years certain \"authoritarian\" people in the field of mental healing fought with lies and great guile to obscure the fact that the ideal scene in mental healing can be known to any-one. Such imprisoned and tortured and murdered human beings with the excuse that they themselves were the only experts. \"It takes 12 years to make a psychiatrist.\" \"Expert skill is required to kill a patient.\" The existing scene these \"experts\" made was a slaughterhouse for asylums and the in-sanity and crime statistics soaring."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 3 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 55 DATA SERIES They fought like maniacs to obscure the ideal scene and hired and coerced an army of agents, \"reporters,\" \"officials,\" and such to smash anyone who sought to present the ideal scene or ways to attain it. Indeed it was a world gone mad with even the police and govern-ments hoodwinked by these \"experts.\" Yet any citizen knew the ideal scene had he not been so propaganda frightened by the existing scene. By constantly pounding in the \"naturalness\" of an existing scene consisting of mad-ness, crime, torture, seizure and murder, these mad \"experts\" put the ideal scene so far from reach that it appeared incredible. It was so bad a situation that anyone proposing the ideal scene was actively resisted! Yet the ideal scene is so easy to state that any citizen could have stated it at any time. And often believed it was occurring! The ideal scene of an asylum would be people recovering in a calm atmosphere, re-stored to any previous ability, emerging competent and confident. The ideal scene in the society would be, probably, a safe environment wherein one could happily make his way through life. Of course, the technology of the mind was the missing data. But the experts in charge of that sector of life paid out hard cash to hoods to prevent any such technology developing-a matter fully documented. The gap between the ideal scene and the existing scene can be very wide and in any endeavor elements exist that tend to prevent a total closure between the two. However, approached on a gradient with skill and determination, it can be done. DEPARTURE The mental awareness that something is wrong with a scene is the point at which one can begin reverting to the ideal scene. Without this awareness on the part of a group then an individual can be much im-peded in handling a situation. The mental processes of the person seeking to improve things toward an ideal scene or change them back to an ideal scene must include those who are also parts of the scene. Seeing something wrong without seeking to correct it degenerates into mere faultfind-ing and natter. This is about as far as many people go. That something, real or imagined, is wrong with the scene is a not uncommon state of mind. Not knowing what's intended or being done, or the limitations of resource or the magnitude and complexity of opposition, the arm-chair critic can be dreadfully unreal. He therefore tends to be suppressed, particularly by reac-tionaries (who try to keep it all as it is regardless). Unfortunately, the continual battle of life then is between the critic and the reaction-ary. As this often blows up in pointless destruction, it can be seen there could be something wrong with both of them."},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 4 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 56 DATA SERIES Particularly the inactive carping critic is at fault on three counts. A. He isn't doing anything about it. B. He is not conceiving or broadcasting a real ideal scene. C. He is not providing any gradient approach to actually attain an ideal scene. The reactionary of course simply resists any change regardless of who is suffering providing the reactionary can retain what position and possession he may have. A revolutionary of course usually 1. Is doing something about it even if violent. 2. Is conceiving and broadcasting his version of the ideal scene, and 3. Is planning and acting upon some means of bringing about his own ideal scene. History and \"progress\" seem to be the revolutionary making his version of progress over the dead bodies of reactionaries. And although it may be history and \"progress\" the cycle is usually intensely destruc-tive and ends up without attaining an ideal scene and also destroying any scene existing. The ancient world is filled with ruins over which one can wander in contemplative and philosophic reverie. These attempts to make and maintain an ideal scene certainly left enough bruised masonry around. So it is really not enough to natter and it's rather too much to thrust violent change down on the heads of one and all including the objectors. Violent revolution comes about when the actual ideal scene has not been properly stated and when it excludes significant parts of the group. It's no good having a revolution if the end product will be a further departure from the ideal scene. The pastoral nonsense of Jean Jacques Rousseau was about as wide from an ideal scene as you could get, and it and other efforts, also wide, brought on the French Revolution. The Russian 1917 revolution had already been preceded by the democratic Kerensky revolt. But it failed because Russia being Russia was about a century and a half late. Also the French Revolution was late. And in both cases those who should have led didn't. Lesser ranks overthrew command. These and countless other human upheavals mark the fluttering pages of history and history will be written in similar vein again and again to eternity unless some sense and logic gets into the scene. Revolt is only an expression of too long unmended departures from the ideal scene of society. Usually the stitches taken to mend the growing social order are too weak and too hast-ily improvised to prevent the cultural fabric from being torn to rags."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 5 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 57 DATA SERIES Street battles and angry infantry are the direct opposite of the ideal political scene. What was needed in such a case was an awareness of departure from the ideal scene, the discovery of Why a departure occurred and a gradient, real and determined program to return the scene closer to the ideal. The elements of improved mechanical arts and progress in the humanities may be util-ized to effect the recovery. In any event (which is missed by the reactionary and his \"good old days\") cultures do change and those changes are a part of any new ideal scene. So one does not achieve a reversion to the ideal by turning back the clock. One must be bright enough to include improvements in a new ideal scene. IDEAL SCENE AND PURPOSE Let us look this over, this concept of the ideal scene, and see that it is not a very com-plex thing. One doesn't have to be much of an expert to see what an ideal scene would be. The complex parts of the whole may not make up the whole, but they are not really vi-tal to conceiving an ideal scene for any activity, as small as a family or as big as a planet. The entire concept of an ideal scene for any activity is really a clean statement of its purpose. All one has to ask is \"What's the purpose of this?\" and one will be able to work out what the ideal scene of \"this\" is. To give a pedestrian example let us take a shoe shop. Its purpose is obviously to sell or provide people with shoes. The ideal scene is almost as simple as \"This activity sells or pro-vides people with shoes.\" Now no matter how complex may be the business or economics of shoe sales, the fact remains that that is almost the ideal scene. Only one factor is now missing: Time. The complete ideal scene of the shoe shop is then, \"This activity is intended to provide people with shoes for (time).\" It can be always or for its owner's lifetime or for the duration of the owner's stay in the town or the duration of the state fair. Now we can see departures from the ideal scene of this shoe store. One has to work out fairly correctly what the purpose of an activity is and how long it is to endure before one can make a statement of the ideal scene. From this one can work out the complexities which compose the activity in order to establish it in the first place including the speed of the gradient (how much shoe store how fast) and also how to spot the fact of departure from the ideal scene. This process would also work on any portion of the shoe store if the main ideal is not also violated. The children's department, the cashier, the stock clerk also have their sub-ideal scenes. And departures from their ideal scenes can be noted."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 6 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 58 DATA SERIES It doesn't matter what the activity is, large or small, romantic or humdrum, its ideal scene and its sub-ideal scenes are arrived at in the same way. METHODS OF AWARENESS Statistics are the only sound measure of any production or any job or any activity. The moment that one goes into any dependence on opinion, he goes into quicksand and will see too late the fatal flaw in restoring anything. If the fact that anything can be given production statistics seems too far out, it is visi-ble that even a guard, who would at first glance seem to be producing nothing but giving only security, is actually producing minutes, hours, weeks, years, of continued production Time. Probably the most thoughtful exercise is not conceiving the ideal scene but working out what the production statistic of it is. For here, the activity or subactivity must be very cor-rectly staticized to exactly measure the ideal scene of any activity or the statistic will itself bring about a departure! Just as the purpose from which the ideal scene is taken must be correct, so must the statistic be all the more thoughtfully correct. As an example, if the ideal scene of the shoe store is given the total statistic of its in-come then three things can happen: 1. It may cease to provide people with shoes that persuade them to come back for more. 2. It may sell shoes without enough profit to cover overhead and cease to exist. 3. It may conduct itself with more interest in the cashier than the customer and lose its trade. Probably its statistic is \"percentage of citizens in the area profitably shod by this store.\" Working out how long it takes to wear out an average pair of shoes, any ex-customer would be retired from the percentage after that time span had elapsed from buying his last pair. Given a fairly accurate and realistically updated census figure, that statistic would probably tell the tale of the ideal scene, which has its element of continuance. The sole fixation on making money can depart from the scene. Abandonment of mak-ing any money would certainly cause a departure of the shoe store. A commando battalion would have just as serious an examination for its ideal scene and statistic as a shoe store! And it would give a very, very effective activity if fully worked out. You'd really have to work out, probably better than the generals who think they have, the real purpose of a commando battalion (which is probably \"to disperse enemy preparations by unexpected actions and overinvolve enemy manpower in expensive guarding\"). The statistic could be something like \"our individual soldiers freed from opponents\" and/or \"casualties not occurring by reason of interrupted enemy preparations.\""},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 7 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 59 DATA SERIES In effect the commando battalion would be \"producing.\" The results would be an ef-fective increase in men under arms for their own side. WHY Knowing, then, the ideal scene and its statistic, one, by keeping the statistic, can notice without \"reasonableness\" or somebody's report or some fifth column propaganda, an immedi-ate departure from the ideal scene. Remember, violent change only becomes seemingly vital when the departure from the ideal scene is noticed too late . Opinion, reports, subject to outpoints as they almost always are, seldom tell one more than somebody else's prejudices or his efforts to cover or failures to observe. Now that a departure is seen (because the statistic drops) one can quickly go about no-ticing when and so get at Why. When he has the Why of the departure he can proceed to handle it. The statistic, guarded against false reports, and verified, is a clean statement not as subject to outpoints as other types of statements. Whole activities have been smashed by not having a statistic of success but taking an opinion of trouble, and reversely, by having a statistic indicating disaster but a broadcast opinion of \"great success.\" Probably the latter is the more frequent. It is not possible to locate Why the departure soon enough to remedy unless one takes the most reliable datum available-which is the datum most easily kept clean of out-points-which is a statistic. You don't really even know there is a Why unless there has been a departure. And the departure may be very hard to spot without a statistic. I have seen a group producing like mad, doing totally great, but which had no statistic, become the subject of wild outpoints and even contempt within itself. If an activity lacks an ideal scene and a correct statistic for it, it has no stable datum with which to rebuff opinion and outpoints. To that extent the group goes a bit mad. Group sanity depends. then. upon an ideal scene. correct sub-ideal scenes and statistics to match. One of the calmest safest groups around had a bad reputation with fellow groups be-cause it did not have or make known its ideal scene and did not have or release its statistics. And it had a hard time of it for quite a while, meantime working exhaustedly but dedi-catedly. Planet, nation, social groups, businesses, all their parts and the individual have their ideal scene and their statistic, their departures and successes and failures. And none fall out-side these data."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 8 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 60 DATA SERIES L.

Therefore outpoints indicate departures. It must follow then that rationality is connected to an ideal scene. These three assumptions should be studied, observed and fully grasped. They are very adventurous assumptions at first glance for if they are true then one has not only the definition of sanity in an organization or individual but also of neurosis and psy-chosis. One also sees that organizations or social groups or companies or any third dynamic (the urge to survival as a group) activity can be neurotic or psychotic. It therefore would follow that the technology of the ideal scene, existing scene, depar-tures, outpoints and statistics would contain or indicate the means of establishing sane groups or individuals or measuring their relative sanity or re-establishing relative sanity in them. THE PLAGUE OF MAN Man has been harassed by irrationality in individual and group conduct since there has been Man. The existing scene of Man's activities is so immersed in departures and outpoints that at first survey there would seem to be no possible handling of the situation. Most people have accepted the existing conditions as \"inevitable\" and toss them off with a \"that's life.\" This is of course an overwhelmed attitude. And it is true that the departure from any ideal is so distant as to obscure any feeling of reality about possibly achieving an ideal scene even in a limited area. Philosophies exist to \"prove\" that chaos is needful to furnish challenge. That is like saying \"Be glad you're crazy\" (as 19th century psychologists did say). Or \"Suffering refines one,\" as the playwrights of the early 20th century so fondly used in their plots. One whole religious order preached the necessity to accept Man as he is."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 2 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 62 DATA SERIES Thus Man is plagued with defeatism, has lacked technology, and civilization after civilization has succumbed, either in a flash of flame and war or in the slow erosion of grind-ing distress. Most men, it has been said, live lives of quiet desperation. One doesn't have to live through several wars to learn that Man and his leaders are something less than sane. Every sword-waving conqueror has exploited Man's seeming inability to avoid broth-erly slaughter and no conqueror or army seems to have noticed that wars only rarely shift boundaries no matter how many are killed. Europe for centuries has excelled in the develop-ment of marble orchards and failed remarkably to establish any lasting political scene at all. In other lands government leaders, who should have at least a partial duty of preserv-ing their citizenry have sat raptly listening to the advice of madmen for some centuries now. US leaders lately have taken to acting on the mental health guidance of many civilian com-mittees, each one of which contains at least one member of an organization directly connected to Russia! The country most interested in fomenting US civil commotion! A former head of CIA once cracked for a joke, \"What if there were a Russian KGB agent inside CIA?\" The shudder of horror that went through US politicians was interesting to see. Yet every new em-ployee of CIA was \"vetted\" before employment by members of two organizations connected to Russia! The \"American\" Psychological Association and the \"American\" Psychiatric Asso-ciation are directed by the World Federation of Mental Health founded by Brock Chisholm, the companion of Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers, the famous US communist traitors. And the US government pays the WFMH to hold congresses which are attended by Russian KGB delegates. And all intelligence given the President on Vietnam, where the US was \"fighting communism\" was passed through the hands of a man whose parents are both Rus-sian born communists. And the US Defense Department intelligence on the same war was led and \"coordinated\" by another communist-connected employee. With that many outpoints showing up in their social welfare and intelligence scene, the US government seems something less than bright in wondering, \"What riots?\" \"Why drugs?\" \"Why defeats?\" The statistics of the US welfare and social scene under the domination of the World Federation of Mental Health are soaring insanity, crime and riot graphs. It is so bad that Rus-sia will never have to fight an atomic war. The US economic, political and social scene will deteriorate and is deteriorating so rapidly that the US will have lost any will to fight or any economic or social power to resist Russia. (In case you wonder as to the factualness of data given above, it is all documented.) I have given this existing scene so that you can see the outpoints. The deteriorated state of public safety in the US is well known. The fantastic sums it spends are well known. I have given visible outpoints. One glance at psychiatric and psychological statistics (which are all negative) would tell any sane person that they must be doing something else as they were given all the money,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 3 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 63 DATA SERIES political power and authority ever needed to handle the scene. But it got worse! So, checking the scene for outpoints, one finds them directly connected to the No. 1 US enemy. Their data is marvellous for outpoints. Paid to serve the US, their literature discusses mainly abolishing boundaries and the Constitution. The US official, so drowned in the chatter and confusion of double-talk and false intel-ligence and situation reports, apparently cannot see any solution. And heaps money on his traitors and finances their avid destruction of the country. Yet, outpoints are so many and so visible that even the citizen sees them while the of-ficial remains apparently numb and inactive. Very well, Man can and does get drowned in his own irrationality. And his civiliza-tions rise and fall. Man's primary plague is irrationality. He is not in the grip of a \"death wish,\" nor is he having a love affair with destruction. He has just lacked any road out or the technology to put him on it. RESOLVING THE SCENE All the US would have to do is count up the outpoints, look at the statistics, drop their passionate affair with Russian psychiatry, conceive an ideal scene of a productive America, re-channel welfare monies into decent public works to give people jobs and improve produc-tivity per capita, knock off foreign funds and wars, give the money to increasing the value of American resources and even now the US would become all right. National production would catch up with destructive inflation, money would return to value and an ideal national scene would be approached. Even the military-industrial clique would be happy making bulldozers instead of tanks and youth would have a future in sight instead of a foreign-made grave. The odd part of it is, even the Senate and House would vote for such a program as their own statis-tic today is how much federal money can they bring home to their own states. The only ones that would resist are the people who are the ones causing the above outpoints and who knowingly or unknowingly serve other masters than the US. And that's a simple security problem after all. I have put the example on a large canvas just to show that the steps of handling depar-tures are the same for all situations large or great. When done this way, by the steps mentioned in the Data Series, big situations can be analyzed as well as little ones. Available resources and all that play a part in getting the solution into effect. But the cost in time and action of the original effort to introduce the cycle of revertment to an ideal scene is not anywhere near as costly as letting the departure continue. The easier thing to do in all cases is to work out the ideal scene, survey the existing scene for outpoints, work out statistics that should exist, find out WHY the departure, pro-gram a gradient solution back to the ideal, settle the practical aspects of it and go about it."},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 4 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 64 DATA SERIES LOSING ONE'S WAY One's direction is lost to the degree one fails to work out the ideal scene. It is so easy to toss off an \"ideal scene\" that is not the ideal scene that one can begin with a false premise. As he tries to work with an incorrect \"ideal scene\" for an activity he may fail and grow discouraged without recognizing that he is already working with an omitted datum-the real ideal scene for that activity. This is a major reason one can lose one's way in handling a situation. Also in trying to find a why of departure one may refuse to admit that something he himself did was the reason for the departure-or why the ideal scene never took place. It re-quires quite a bit of character to recognize one's own errors; it is much easier to find them in a neighbor. Thus one may choose the wrong why, for this and other reasons. Failures to examine the scene, reasonableness which causes blindness to the obvious, errors of penetration and defensive reasons not to admit it all impede a proper analysis. The existing scene may be missing in one's view because one doesn't really look at it or because one has no correct ideal scene for it. Many would rather blame or justify than be honest. Others would rather criticize than work. But this all adds up to outpoints in the examination itself. If one keeps at it one will however arrive at the right answers with regard to any scene. BUILDING THE IDEAL SCENE To suppose one can instantly hit upon an ideal scene for any activity without further test is to be very fond of one's own prejudices. There is however a test of whether you have the ideal scene or not. Can you staticize it? Strangely, but inevitably, since we live in the physical universe where there is both time and association of beings with beings and the physical universe and the physical uni-verse with itself, there is a production-consumption factor in all living. There seems to be a ratio between producing and consuming, and establishing it would probably resolve that strange subject, economics, as well as social welfare and other things. It seems to be fatal to consume without producing. Many social observations teach us this. Evidently one cannot, at the physical universe level, produce without consuming. And it seems that it is destructive to produce only and consume too little. One can produce far more than one consumes. apparently, but cannot consume far more than one produces. This seems to be true of groups."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 5 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 65 DATA SERIES Some dreamers puffing on a hash pipe of unreality believe one can really be happy producing nothing and consuming everything. The idyllic ideal of a paradise where no one produces has been tried. In interviewing secretaries in New York I found the larger percentage had the personal ideal scene of \"marrying a millionaire.\" Aside from there not being that many millionaires, the dream of idle luxury forever was so far from any possible ideal scene that it was busy ru-ining their lives and giving their current male escorts a life of critical hell. One, having mar-ried a boy who was fast on the road to becoming a millionaire, was so dissatisfied with him not being one right now that she ruined his life and hers. In short, it sounds nice, but having met a few who did marry millionaires, I can attest that they were either not producing and failing as beings or were working themselves half to death. These no-production dreams, like the harp in heaven, lead at best to suicidal boredom. Yet Madison Avenue's ads would have one believe that one and all should own all manner of cloth, wood and metal just to be alive. A whole civilization can break down, flop, on propaganda of no-production, total con-sumption. The sweat that flies off a \"workers' paradise\" would rival the Mississippi! There is some sort of balanced ratio and it favors apparently, for pride and life and happiness, higher production of something than consumption. When it gets too unbalanced in values, something seems to happen. The unhappiness and tumult in current society is oddly current with the Keynesian economic theory of creating want. It's a silly theory and has lately become to be abandoned. But it was in vogue forty years or more, as I recall. It produced the \"welfare era\" of the psy-chiatrist and the total slavery of the taxpayer! So, whatever the economics of it, an ideal scene apparently has to have a statistic or the whole thing caves in, either from lack of continuity in time, from disinterest, or from plain lack of supply. Death is possibly, could be in part, a cessation of interested production. Hard pressed, a living being dreams of some free time. Give him too much and he be-gins to crave action and will go into production and if blocked from doing so will tend to cave in. Loss of a job depresses people way out of proportion and subsequent declines often trace back to it. Destructive activities carry their own self-death. The state of veterans after wars is not always traced to wounds or privation. Destructive acts put a brand on a man. Some of this is answered by the absence of production. IDEAL SCENE AND STAT Whatever the facts and economic rules may be about production and the ideal scene, it would seem to be the case, sufficient at least for our purposes, that this rule holds good:"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 6 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 66 DATA SERIES The correctly stated ideal scene will have a production statistic. The way one defines \"production\" in this is not necessarily so many things made on an assembly line. That's an easy one. It isn't just pairs of shoes. Production can be defined as the regulation or safeguarding of it, the planning or the designing of it, a lot, lot, lot of things. A stat is a positive numerical thing that can be accurately counted and graphed on a two-dimensional thing. To test the correctness of an ideal scene, one should be able to assign it a correct sta-tistic. If one can't figure out a statistic for it, then it probably is an incorrectly stated ideal scene and will suffer from departures. Wrong stats assigned the ideal scene will wreck it. A wrongly conceived ideal scene will derail the activity quickly. To understand something it is necessary to have a datum of comparable magnitude. To understand logic one needs to be able to establish what is illogic. One then has two things for comparison. The ideal scene can be compared to an existing scene. This is one way to establish the ideal scene. But both need a factor to keep them in reality. To test the ideal scene for correctness one needs to be able to formulate its statistic. The exercise of testing the statement of the ideal scene, to keep it real and not airy-fairy and unattainable, is to work out a realistic stat for it. One can go back and forth between the statistic and the stated ideal scene, adjusting one, then the other until one gets an attainable statistic that really does measure the validity of the stated ideal scene. A statistic is a tight reality, a stable point. which is to measure any departure from the ideal scene. In setting a statistic one has to outguess all efforts to falsify it (predict possible out-points in collecting it) and has to see if following the statistic would mislead anyone from the ideal scene. So let's walk back to the shoe store. Test statement of ideal scene: to make money. Test statistic: pairs of shoes sold. Now if you tried to marry up those two you'd get a prompt catastrophe. The potential departure would be immediate. We sell shoes at no profit to raise the stat, we make no money. We try only to make money, we sell cheap shoes at high cost and our customers don't come back and we don't make money."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 7 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 67 DATA SERIES So those two are both no good. Departure would occur, indeed it already exists right in the badly worked out ideal scene and the stat. Test ideal scene: Cobblers are entitled to the shoes they make. Test statistic: how many shoes cobbler makes. So that's loopy! Test ideal scene: all citizens furnished with shoes. Test statistic: number of shoes given away. Well, that's bonkers for a shoe store in any economic set-up. The citizens for sure would have no shoes once the shoe store was empty, for if everything is given away, who'd raise cows for hides or drive nails in soles unless he had a gun held on him so what workers' paradise is this? Slave state for sure. So that's no ideal scene for a shoe store no matter how \"ideal\" it looks to a do-gooder. Too airy-fairy. Since no shoes would exist to be given away. Test ideal scene: shoes for any worker who has coupons. Test statistic: number of coupons collected. Well, maybe. In some society. But can the shoe store get shoes for the coupons? Maybe if there's enough economic police. But then this would have to be a monopoly shoe store and the quality would not be a fac-tor, So this must be an army quartermaster depot or a state monopoly. If no incentive were needed it would work. Sure would be hard on the corns but it would barely work. Rather insecure though. But this is a shoe store where people buy. Test ideal scene: to provide workers with good shoes that can be replaced from suppliers. Test statistic: ??? Number of shoes from suppliers given to workers ... Happy workers ...??? Amount of control that can be exerted on suppliers ...??? Ah. Number of shoes supplied well-shod workers. Okay, that's a QM depot. Now what's a shoe store? And we probably get what was given in an earlier example: Ideal scene: to provide people with shoes and continue in business for owner's lifetime. Statistic: percentage of citizens in area profitably shod by this store. But even this would need to be played back and forth. And if this shoe store was in a so-cialist country both might require amendment. And if it was in a beach resort thronged with tour-ists who were also mostly foreigners the ideal scene and statistic would suffer an immediate de-parture and the store would fail, crash if the ideal scene were not correctly stated and the statistic real. The class of tourist would have a bearing on it. Maybe the state has currency control demands on shopkeepers and requires them to get in foreign currency or no new stock!"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 8 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 68 DATA SERIES Thus you could get: Ideal scene: engendering acquisitiveness for novelty footwear made in this country. Statistic: pairs of gift shoes bought by foreigners. That sure would shift the whole atmosphere of the store! Thus one plays the ideal scene against the statistic. Maybe one can't find any ideal scene for the activity and no statistic of any signifi-cance to anyone. Could be that the activity is totally worthless even to oneself as a hobby. Although this opens the door to cynicism or a lazy way of not doing anything about anything, it just could be. Even a \"reporter\" who writes nothing could have an ideal scene and statistic. But it would have to be really real even then. Like, Ideal scene: unsuspected as a spy while accepted as a \"reporter.\" Statistic: cash collected for reports undetectedly delivered to my government. If that seems unreal as a scene the staff of TIME magazine recently held a mass meet-ing protesting the use of TIME credentials for government spying. \"Nobody will talk to us anymore,\" the staff of that dying WFMH mouthpiece wept. So anything could have an ideal scene, even a police state. Idealism has nothing to do with it. VIABLE The word \"viable\" means capable of living, able to live in a particular climate or at-mosphere. Life over a period of time requires viability, or the ability to survive. Any organism or any group or any part of a group must have a potential of survival. It must be viable-life-able. This is true of any ideal scene. The statistic measures directly the relative survival po-tential of the organism or its part. This tells you the plain fact that life contains the essential purpose of living, no matter how many misguided philosophers or generals may decree otherwise. The planetary population is now not fully viable since weapons exist capable of mak-ing it a billiard ball at the whim of some madman. The potential survival of the whole is of course an influence and limitation on its parts. Men who live \"only for self\" don't live. An organism or group can live a dangerous life in that it risks its survival. But is more of a threat than its enemies if it does not know or adjust its ideal scene. A military company, told on posters the ideal scene is all brag in the bar with girls on each arm, who find in fact that their actual scene is military police outside every bar with"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 9 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 69 DATA SERIES clubs and a real short life under the orders of sadistically disinterested and inexpert govern-ment, is presented with an instantly visible departure. The government believed such posters were needful to get recruits and did not realize that a truthfully stated scene and an effort to promote survival to commanders would also have recruited and conscription needn't be resorted to as the end product of lies. Men will become part of the most onerous and dangerous groups imaginable provid-ing the purpose is there and stated and they have a chance of survival. The ideal scene of a nation worshipping death is that of a nation that will not survive anyway. At least not as that nation. A group or an organism must be viable. The state is relative to the time the group needs to live to accomplish its purpose. Each part of a group, in any ideal scene, should contribute viability to the whole group. Production of something is mandatory on any part of a group if the group is to be fully viable. Painting, writing, music, all have positive roles in a society. So productivity, as is vi-ability, can be seen as a very broad inclusive term. The sub purposes of any group make up the sub-ideal scene of its various parts. In other words each part of a broad group has its own ideal scene and its own statistic. These combined bring about the broad group's ideal scene. The statistics each lead to viability of the part and then the whole group. In reverse, with so many parts of a planet desirous of extinguishing so many other parts, the viability of the planet becomes questionable. In an organization each part has its own ideal scene and its own statistic on up to the main ideal scene and the main statistic. In practice one works back from the ideal scene of the group into its smallest part, so that all lesser ideal scenes and lesser statistics mount up to and bring about the main ideal scene and statistic. Examining the lesser ideal scenes and statistics, one can find outpoints first in how the whole thing is organized and then the main ideal scene and the statistics and how the lesser ones bring it about. Dominant is the viability of the whole. Where any part does not support total viability it is an outpoint. Contributive is the viability of each part and cohesive is the scheme in which the lesser ideal scenes and the lesser statistics bring about the big ideal scene and the big sta-tistic. If this does not occur the non-supportive lesser ideal scene or statistic is an outpoint. Groups that falter have to have all this restudied. As departures did occur, the organi-zation itself, as part of any action, must be reexamined against experience and new greater and lesser ideal scenes and statistics must be worked out for it and put into use."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 10 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 70 DATA SERIES Agreement of the group is a necessary ingredient as many reformers have learned, of-ten too late, and as many groups have seen, also generally too late. The trick is to correct the ideal scene and statistic and all lesser ones of the group while it is still alive. After that one can have better dependence upon them and keep the statistics up and the purpose going forward. L.

Interpersonal relations with many strata of many societies in many lands with many activities demonstrates plainly that Man's largest and most unjust fault consists wholly of act-ing on opinion. Opinions can be as varied as the weather in Washington, all on the same subject. When one says \"opinion\" one is dealing with that morass of false reports and prejudices which make up the chaos of current social orders. Some seek an answer in status. \"If one has status one is safe\" is about as frail as a house of cards. Ask some recently deposed dictator or yesterday's idol what his status was worth. Yet many work exclusively for status. In Spain it is enough to have an executive de-gree. One doesn't have to do any executiving. Work at it? Caramba no! In capitalisms it is enough to be an heir and in communisms it is only necessary to be the son of a commissar. Work? Nyet. Revolts are protests against idle status. Where are the kings of yesteryear? Riding along on the last generation's statistics is as fatal as a diet of thin air. Undeserved status is a false statistic. Nothing is more bitterly resented, unless it is a statistic earned without status by those who live by status alone! William Stieber, the most skilled intelligence chief of the 19th century, who won the Franco-Prussian war for Bismarck, was hated by German officers because he was not a proper officer but a civilian! When German officers took over German intelligence they lost two wars in a row and the caste is very unlamentedly dead. So long as \"character\" can be reviled, so long as \"opinion\" is used, so long as govern-ments run on rumors and false reports, the social scene will continue to be a mess. You will not believe it but governments think newspaper stories are \"public opinion.\" One US President was astounded to be given a wildly enthusiastic public reception at an air-port. The press had been hammering him for a year and the poor fellow thought it was \"public opinion.\" Texts on public relations remark this strange governmental fixation on believing the press."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"WORKING AND MANAGING 2 HCO PL 7.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 72 DATA SERIES That means all a nation's enemies have to do is bribe or hire some underpaid reporters or semibankrupt publishers, and voila! it can steer the government any way it wishes! Do a survey on any personality or subject and the conflicts in opinion are revealed as fantastic. Seven witnesses to one street accident will even give seven conflicting accounts. Thus this whole field of \"opinion\" and \"reports\" is a quicksand endangering both per-sonal repute and management skill. It is so bad that wars and revolutions stem directly from the use of opinion and the ne-glect of statistics. In a chaos it is necessary to set up one point or terminal which is stable before one can really decide anything much less get anything done. A statistic is such a stable point. One can proceed from it and use it to the degree that it is a correct statistic. One can detect then, when things start to go wrong well before they crash. Using opinion or random rumors or reports one can go very wrong indeed. In fact, us-ing these without knowing the statistics one can smash a life or crash a group. The US Navy operates on the social attainments and civilized behavior of their people. A naval officer is promoted on the basis of his amiability and the social skill of his wife! A clerk is promoted because he marries the boss's daughter. A governor is elected because he could play a guitar! This is a whirlwind of chaos because of the falseness of the statistics used. So the stat used is itself an outpoint in each case. PREDICTION Outpoints are more than useful in prediction. The whole reason one does a data analysis and a situation analysis is to predict. The biggest outpoint would be a missing ideal scene, the next biggest would be a cor-rect statistic for it. If these are missing then prediction can become a matter of telling fortunes with bam-boo sticks. One predicts in order to continue the viability of an organism, an individual, a group, an organization, a state or nation or planet, or to estimate the future of anything. The more outpoints the less future. A disaster could be said to be a totality of outpoints in final and sudden culmination."},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"WORKING AND MANAGING 3 HCO PL 7.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 73 DATA SERIES This gives one a return to chaos. The closer one approaches a disaster the more outpoints will turn up. Thus the more outpoints that turn up the closer one is approaching a disaster. When the outpoints are overwhelming a condition of death is approached. By being able to predict, the organism or individual or group can correct the out-points before disaster occurs. Each sphere of activity has its own prediction. A group of different activities with a common goal can be predicted by the outpoints turning up in parts of the general activity. In theory if all parts of a main group or organization had an ideal scene for each, a sta-tistic and an intense interest in maintaining the ideal scene and statistic of each part, the sur-vival would be infinite. Any group or organism or individual is somewhat interdependent upon its neighbors, on other groups and individuals. It cannot however put them right unless it itself has reached some acceptable level of approach to its ideal scenes. The conflict amongst organisms, individuals and groups does not necessarily add up to \"the survival of the fittest,\" whatever that meant. It does however mean that in such conflict the best chance of survival goes to the individual, organism or group that best approaches and maintains its ideal scene, lesser ideal scenes, statistic and lesser statistics.

Her brother Oscar has been playing ball in the yard. A window breaks. Josie Ann's mother rushes into the room, sees Josie Ann and the ball on the floor, spanks Josie Ann.

The manager promptly insists on buying fire insurance. Example: The people of Yangville are starving due to food scarcity in the land. The premier borrows 65 million pounds to build a new capital and palace. Example: The government is under attack and riot and civil disorder spreads. The government officials campaign to put down all \"rightists\" for trying to establish law and or-der. Example: A man is beaten and robbed on the main street of a town.

A government campaigns against cigarettes. Example: A boy wants to be an accountant. His family forces him to join the army as a career.

In auditing when one reviews or \"corrects\" a case that is running well, one has trouble. It is made trouble. Similarly on the third dynamic, correcting situations which do not exist and neglecting situations which do exist can destroy a group. All this boils down to correct investigation. It is not a slight skill. It is the basic skill behind any intelligent action. SUPPRESSIVE JUSTICE When justice goes astray (as it usually does) the things that have occurred are 1. Use of justice for some other purpose than public safety (such as maintaining a privileged group or indulging a fixed idea) or 2. Investigatory procedure. All suppressive use of the forces of justice can be traced back to one or the other of these. Aberrations and hate very often find outlet by calling them \"justice\" or \"law and or-der.\" This is why it can be said that Man cannot be trusted with justice. This or just plain stupidity brings about a neglect of intelligent investigatory proce-dures. Yet all third dynamic sanity depends upon correct and unaberrated investigatory pro-cedures. Only in that way can one establish causes of things. And only by establishing causes can one cease to be the effect of unwanted situations. It is one thing to be able to observe. It is quite another to utilize observations so that one can get to the basis of things."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"INVESTIGATORY PROCEDURE 2 HCO PL 19.9.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 78 DATA SERIES SEQUENCES Investigations become necessary in the face of outpoints or pluspoints. Investigations can occur out of idle curiosity or particular interest. They can also occur to locate the cause of pluspoints. Whatever the motive for investigation the action itself is conducted by sequences. If one is incapable mentallv of tracing a series of events or actions, one cannot investi-gate. Altered sequence is a primary block to investigation. At first glance, omitted data would seem to be the block. On the contrary, it is the end product of an investigation and is what pulls an investigation along-one is looking for omitted data. An altered sequence of actions defeats any investigation. Examples: We will hang him and then conduct a trial. We will assume who did it and then find evidence to prove it. A crime should be provoked to find who commits them. Any time an investigation gets back to front, it will not succeed. Thus if an investigator himself has any trouble with seeing or visualizing sequences of actions he will inevitably come up with the wrong answer. Reversely, when one sees that someone has come up with a wrong or incomplete an-swer one can assume that the investigator has trouble with sequences of events or, of course, did not really investigate. One can't really credit that Sherlock Holmes would say \"I have here the fingerprint of Mr. Murgatroyd on the murder weapon. Have the police arrest him. Now, Watson, hand me a magnifying glass and ask Sgt. Doherty to let us look over his fingerprint files.\" If one cannot visualize a series of actions, like a ball bouncing down a flight of stairs or if one cannot relate in proper order several different actions with one object into a proper sequence, he will not be able to investigate. If one can, that's fine. But any drilling with attention-shifting drills will improve one's ability to visualize se-quences. Why? Stuck attention or attention that cannot confront alike will have trouble in visualizing sequences.

Indeed, had these been in and followed we would have had a great deal less trouble than we did. But investigation is not monopolized by law and order. All betterment of life depends on finding out pluspoints and why and reenforcing them, locating outpoints and why and eradicating them. This is the successful survival pattern of living. A primitive who is going to survive does just that and a scientist who is worth anything does just that. The fisherman sees seagulls clustering over a point on the sea. That's the beginning of a short sequence, point No. 1. He predicts a school of fish, point No. 2. He sails over as se-quence point No. 3. He looks down as sequence point No. 4. He sees fish as point No. 5. He gets out a net as point No. 6. He circles the school with the net, No. 7. He draws in the net, No. 8. He brings the fish on board, No. 9. He goes to port, No. 10. He sells the fish, No. 11. That's following a pluspoint-cluster of seagulls. A sequence from an outpoint might be: Housewife serves dinner. Nobody eats the cake, No. 1, she tastes it, No. 2, she recognizes soap in it, No. 3. She goes to kitchen, No. 4. She looks into cupboard, No. 5. She finds the soap box upset, No. 6. She sees the flour below it, No. 7. She sees cookie jar empty, No. 8. She grabs young son, No. 9. She shows him the set-up, No. 10. She gets a confession, No. 11. And No. 12 is too painful to describe. Unsuccessful investigators think good fish catches are sent by God and that when cake tastes like soap it is fate. They live in unsuccessful worlds of deep mystery. They also hang the wrong people. DISCOVERY All discoveries are the end product of a sequence of investigatory actions that begin with either a pluspoint or an outpoint. Thus all knowledge proceeds from pluspoints or outpoints observed. And all knowledge depends on an ability to investigate. And all investigation is done in correct sequence. And all successes depend upon the ability to do these things. L.

The lazy and popular way is to generalize \"They're all confused.\" \"The organization is rickety.\" \"They're doing great.\" That's all very well but it doesn't get you much of anywhere. The way to observe so as to find out what to observe is by discarding areas. This in fact was the system I used to make the discoveries which became Dianetics and Scientology. It was obvious to me that it would take a few million years to examine all of life to find out what made it what it was. The first step was the tough one. I looked for a common denominator that was true for all life forms. I found they were attempting to survive. With this datum I outlined all areas of wisdom or knowledge and discarded those which had not much assisted Man to survive. This threw away all but scientific methodology, so I used that for investigatory proce-dure. Then, working with that, found mental image pictures. And working with them, found the human spirit as different from them. By following up the workable one arrived at the processing actions which, if applied, work, resulting in the increase of ability and freedom. By following up the causes of destruction one arrived at the points which had to be eradicated. This is of course short-handing the whole cycle enormously. But that is the general outline. Survival has been isolated as a common denominator to successful actions and suc-cumb has been found as the common denominator of unsuccessful actions. So one does not have to reestablish these. From there, to discover anything bad or good, all one has to do is discard sterile areas to get a target necessary for investigation."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"NARROWING THE TARGET 2 HCO PL 19. 9.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 82 DATA SERIES One looks broadly at the whole scene. Then discards sections of it that would seem unrewarding. He will then find himself left with the area that contains the key to it. This is almost easier done than described. Example: One has the statistics of a nine division org. Eight are normal. One isn't. So he investigates the area of that one. In investigating the one he discards all normal bits. He is left with the abnormal one that is the key. This is true of something bad or something good. A wise boy who wanted to get on in life would discard all the men who weren't getting on and study the one who was. He would come up with something he could use as a key. A farmer who wanted to handle a crop menace would disregard all the plants doing all right and study the one that wasn't. Then, looking carefully he would disregard all the should be's in that plant and wind up with the shouldn't be. He'd have the key. Sometimes in the final look one finds the key not right there but way over somewhere else. The boy, studying the successful man, finds he owed his success to having worked in a certain bank seven states away from there. The farmer may well find his hired man let the pigs out into the crop. But both got the reason why by the same process of discarding wider zones. Pluspoints or outpoints alike take one along a sequence of discoveries. Once in a purple moon they mix or cross. Example: Gross income is up. One discards all normal stats. Aside from gross income being up only one other stat is down-new names. Investigation shows that the public execu-tives were off post all week on a tour and that was what raked in the money. Conclusion-send out tours as well as man the public divisions. Example: Upset is coming from the camp kitchen. Obvious outpoints. Investigation discloses a 15-year-old cook holding the job solo for 39 field hands! Boy is he pluspoint. Get him some help! DRAWN ATTENTION Having attention dragged into an area is about the way most people \"investigate.\" This puts them at effect throughout. When a man is not predicting he is often subjected to outpoints that leap up at him. Conversely when outpoints leap up at one unexpectedly he knows he better do more than gape at them. He is already behindhand in investigating. Other signs earlier existed which were disregarded."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"NARROWING THE TARGET 3 HCO PL 19. 9.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 83 DATA SERIES ERRORS The usual error in viewing situations is not to view them widely enough to begin with.

One has been given a single observation. It is merely an outpoint: Central Files omitted. There is no why. You follow up \"no CF\" and you may find the Registrar is in the Public Division and Letter Registrars never go near a file and the category of everyone in CF is just \"been tested.\" You really investigate and you find there's no HCO Exec Sec or Dissem Sec and there hasn't been one for a year.

This can be an omitted person, terminal, object, energy, space, time, form, sequence, or even an omitted scene. Anything that can be omitted that should be there is an outpoint. This is easily the most overlooked outpoint as it isn't there to directly attract attention. On several occasions I have found situation analyses done which arrived at no why that would have made handling possible but which gave a false Why that would have upset things if used. In each case the outpoint that held the real clue was this one of an omitted something. In a dozen cases it was omitted personnel each time. One area to which orders were being issued had no one in it at all. Others were undermanned, meaning people were missing. In yet another case there were no study materials at all. In two other cases the whole of a subject was missing in the area. Yet no one in any of these cases had spotted the fact that it was an omitted something that had caused a whole activity to decay. People were working frantically to remedy the general situation. None of them noticed the omissions that were the true cause of the decay. In crime it is as bad to omit as it is to commit. Yet no one seems to notice the omis-sions as actual crimes. Man, trained up in the last century to be a stimulus-response animal, responds to the therenesses and doesn't respond as uniformly to not-therenesses. This opens the door to a habit of deletion or shortening which can become quite com-pulsive. In any analysis which fails to discover a why one can safely conclude the Why is an omission and look for things that should be there and aren't."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"SUMMARY OF OUTPOINTS OMITTED DATA 2 HCO PL 19.9.70 III ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 86 DATA SERIES ALTERED SEQUENCE Any things, events, objects, sizes, in a wrong sequence is an outpoint. The number series 3, 7, 1, 2, 4, 6, 5 is an altered sequence, or an incorrect sequence. Doing step two of a sequence of actions before doing step one can be counted on to tangle any sequence of actions. The basic outness is no sequence at all. This leads into Fixed Ideas. It also shows up in what is called disassociation, an insanity. Things connected to or similar to each other are not seen as consecutive. Such people also jump about subjectwise without relation to an obvi-ous sequence. Disassociation is the extreme case where things that are related are not seen to be and things that have no relation are conceived to have. Sequence means linear (in a line) travel either through space or time or both. A sequence that should be one and isn't is an outpoint. A \"sequence\" that isn't but is thought to be one is an outpoint. A cart-before-the-horse out of sequence is an outpoint. One's hardest task sometimes is indicating an inevitable sequence into the future that is invisible to another. This is a consequence. \"If you saw off the limb you are sitting on you will of course fall.\" Police try to bring this home often to people who have no concept of se-quence; so the threat of punishment works well on well-behaved citizens and not at all on criminals since they often are criminals because they can't think in sequence – they are simply fixated. \"If you kill a man you will be hanged,\" is an indicated sequence. A murderer fixated on revenge cannot think in sequence. One has to think in sequences to have correct sequences. Therefore it is far more common than one would at first imagine to see altered se-quences since persons who do not think in sequence do not see altered sequences in their own actions or areas. Visualizing sequences and drills in shifting attention can clean this up and restore it as a faculty. Motion pictures and TV were spotted by a recent writer as fixating attention and not permitting it to travel. Where one had TV raised children, it would follow, one possibly would have people with a tendency to altered sequences or no sequences at all. DROPPED TIME Time that should be noted and isn't would be an outpoint of \"dropped time.\" It is a special case of an omitted datum. Dropped time has a peculiarly ferocious effect that adds up to utter lunacy. A news bulletin from 1814 and one from 1922 read consecutively without time as-signed produces otherwise undetectable madness."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"SUMMARY OF OUTPOINTS OMITTED DATA 3 HCO PL 19.9.70 III ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 87 DATA SERIES A summary report of a situation containing events strung over half a year without say-ing so can provoke a reaction not in keeping with the current scene. In madmen the present is the dropped time, leaving them in the haunted past. Just tell-ing a group of madmen to \"come up to present time\" will produce a few miraculous \"cures.\" And getting the date of an ache or pain will often cause it to vanish. Time aberrations are so strong that dropped time well qualifies as an outpoint. FALSEHOOD When you hear two facts that are contrary, one is a falsehood or both are. Propaganda and other activities specialize in falsehoods and provoke great distur-bance. Willful or unintentional a falsehood is an outpoint. It may be a mistake or a calculated or defensive falsehood and it is still an outpoint. A false anything qualifies for this outpoint. A false being, terminal, act, intention, any-thing that seeks to be what it isn't is a falsehood and an outpoint. Fiction that does not pretend to be anything else is of course not a falsehood. So the falsehood means \"other than it appears\" or \"other than represented.\" One does not have to concern oneself to define philosophic truth or reality to see that something stated or modeled to be one thing is in actual fact something else and therefore an outpoint. ALTERED IMPORTANCE An importance shifted from its actual relative importance, up or down, is an outpoint. Something can be assigned an importance greater than it has. Something can be assigned an importance less than it has. A number of things of different importances can be assigned a monotone of impor-tance. These are all outpoints, three versions of the same thing. All importances are relative to their actuality.

Killing the king to be free from taxation leaves the tax collector alive for the next regime. Injustice is usually a wrong target outpoint. Arrest the drug consumer, award the drug company would be an example. Military tactics and strategy are almost always an effort to coax the selection of a wrong target by the enemy. And most dislikes and spontaneous hates in human relations are based on mistaken as-sociations of Bill for Pete. A large sum of aberration is based on wrong targets, wrong sources, wrong causes. Incorrectly tell a patient he has ulcers when he hasn't and he's hung with an outpoint which impedes recovery. The industry spent on wrong objectives would light the world for a millennium.

Why = that basic outness found which will lead to a recovery of stats. Wrong Why = the incorrectly identified outness which when applied does not lead to recovery. A Mere Explanation = a \"Why\" given as the Why that does not open the door to any recovery. Example: A mere explanation: \"The stats went down because of rainy weather that week.\" So? So do we now turn off rain? Another mere explanation: \"The staff became over-whelmed that week.\" An order saying \"Don't overwhelm staff\" would be the possible \"solu-tion\" of some manager. But the stats wouldn't recover. The real Why when found and corrected leads straight back to improved stats. A wrong Why, corrected, will further depress stats. A mere explanation does nothing at all and decay continues. Here is a situation as it is followed up: The stats of an area were down. Investigation disclosed there had been sickness 2 weeks before. The report came in: \"The stats were down because people were sick.\" This was a mere explanation. Very reasonable. But it solved nothing. What do we do now? Maybe we accept this as the correct Why. And give an order, \"All people in the area must get a medical exam and unhealthy workers will not be accepted and unhealthy ones will be fired.\" As it's a correction to a wrong Why, the stats really crash. So that's not it. Looking further we find the real WHY. In the area there is no trained-in org bd and a boss there gives orders to the wrong people which, when executed, then hurt their individual stats. We org board the place and groove in the boss and we get a stat recovery and even an improvement. The correct Why led to a stat recovery. Here is another one. Stats are down in a school. An investigation comes up with a mere explanation: \"The students were all busy with sports.\" So management says \"No sports!\" Stats go down again. A new investigation comes up with a wrong Why: \"The students are being taught wrongly.\" Management sacks the dean. Stats really crash now. A further more competent investigation occurs.

Management and organizational catastrophes and successes are all explained by these three types of Why. An arbitrary is probably just a wrong Why held in by law. And if so held in, it will crash the place. One really has to understand logic to get to the correct Why and must really be on his toes not to use and correct a wrong Why. In world banking, where inflation occurs, finance regulations or laws are probably just one long parade of wrong Whys. The value of the money and its usefulness to the citizen de-teriorate to such an extent that a whole ideology can be built up (as in Sparta by Lycurgus who invented iron money nobody could lift in order to rid Sparta of money evils) that knocks money out entirely and puts nothing but nonsense in its place Organizational troubles are greatly worsened by using mere explanations (which lead to no remedies) or wrong Whys (which further depress stats). Organizational recoveries come from finding the real Why and correcting it. The test of the real Why is \"When it is corrected, do stats recover?\" If they do that was it. And any other remedial order given but based on a wrong Why would have to be cancelled quickly. L.

WRONG SOURCE \"Wrong Source\" is the other side of the coin of wrong target. Information taken from wrong source, orders taken from the wrong source, gifts or materiel taken from wrong source all add up to eventual confusion and possible trouble. Unwittingly receiving from a wrong source can be very embarrassing or confusing, so much so that it is a favorite intelligence trick. Dept D in East Germany, the Dept of Disinfor-mation, has very intricate methods of planting false information and disguising its source. Technology can come from wrong source. For instance Leipzig University's school of psychology and psychiatry opened the door to death camps in Hitler's Germany. Using drugs these men apparently gave Hitler to the world as their puppet. They tortured, maimed and slaughtered over 12,000,000 Germans in death camps. At the end of World War II these ex-tremists formed the \"World Federation of Mental Health,\" which enlisted the American Psy-chiatric Association and the American Medical Association and established \"National Asso-ciations for Mental Health\" over the world, cowed news media, smashed any new technology and became the sole advisors to the US government on \"mental health, education and wel-fare\" and the appointers of all health ministers through the civilized world and through their graduate Pavlov dominated Russian communist \"mental health.\" This source is so wrong that it is destroying Man, having already destroyed scores of millions. (All statements given here are documented.) Not only taking data from wrong source but officialdom from it can therefore be suffi-ciently aberrated as to result in planetary insanity. In a lesser level, taking a report from a known bad hat and acting upon it is the usual reason for errors made in management."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"MORE OUTPOINTS 2 HCO PL 26.11.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 92 DATA SERIES CONTRARY FACTS When two statements are made on one subject which are contrary to each other, we have \"contrary facts.\" Previously we classified this illogic as a falsehood, since one of them must be false. But in doing data analysis one cannot offhand distinguish which is the false fact. Thus it becomes a special outpoint. \"They made a high of $12,000 that week\" and \"They couldn't pay staff\" occurring in the same time period gives us one or both as false. We may not know which is true but we do know they are contrary and can so label it. In interrogation this point is so important that anyone giving two contrary facts be-comes a prime suspect for further investigation. \"I am a Swiss citizen\" as a statement from someone who has had a German passport found in his baggage would be an example. When two \"facts\" are contrary or contradictory we may not know which is true but we do know they can't both be true. Issued by the same org, even from two different people in that org, two contradictory \"facts\" qualifies as an outpoint. ___________________ These two will be found useful in analysis. L.

The inability to observe and find an actual useable Why is the downfall of beings and activities. This is factually the Why of people not finding Whys and using them. The prevalence of historical Man's use of \"fate,\" \"kismet\" (fatalism), superstition, for-tune telling, astrology and mysticism confirms this. Having forgotten to keep seed grain for the spring, the farmer starves the following year and when asked Why he is starving says it is the Gods, that he has sinned or that he failed to make sacrifice. In short, unable to think, he says \"The Why is God.\" This condition does not just affect primitives or backward people. All through the most modern organizations you can find \"The Why is God\" in other forms. By believing that it is the fault of other divisions or departments, a staff member does not look into his own scene. \"The reason 1 cannot load the lumber is because the Personnel Section will not find and hire people.\" It does not seem to occur to this fellow that he is using a WHY which he can't control so it is not a Why for his area. It does not move the existing to the ideal scene. Thus it is not a Why for him. Yet he will use it and go on nattering about, it. And the lumber never gets loaded. The real Why for him more likely would be, \"I have no right to hire day laborers. 1 must obtain this right before my area breaks down totally,\" or \"My department posts are too specialized. I need to operate on all-hands actions on peak loads.\" A Course Supervisor who says, \"I haven't got any students because Ethics keeps them for weeks and Cramming for months\" is using a \"The Why is God.\" As he cannot control Ethics or Cramming from his post his Why is illogical. The real Why is probably \"I am not mustering all my students daily and keeping them on course. If they are ordered to Ethics or Cramming they must be right here studying except for the actual minutes spent in Ethics and Cramming.\" But this does not just apply on small activities. It applies to whole nations. \"The rea-son we Germans cannot advance is because England is against us.\" This wrong Why has killed many tens of millions in two world wars."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"THE WHY IS GOD 2 HCO PL 31.1.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 96 DATA SERIES Intelligence organizations are often almost dedicated to \"the Why is over there.\" It seldom is. Most staffs of orgs, when pay is poor, are completely addicted to over-thereness. In one org, the Finance Banking Officer was continuously hammered to \"give more money\" by the people who were responsible for making the money and yet who were not raising a finger to do so. An actual survey of four org staffs showed that only 2% were aware that their pay depended upon the org gross income! Thus survival is very closely tied to logic. If one finds he is sinking into apathy over his inability to get his job done, it is certain that he is operating on self-conceived wrong Whys in areas that he cannot ever hope to control. And in living any life, most major points of decline can be traced to the person's oper-ating on Whys that do not allow him to improve his own scene. The Greek cut open the guts of birds to find the Why. He called this \"divination\" or \"augury.\" Don't look now. but that civilization has long been dead! Just as anyone will be whose illogic leads him to over-thereness to find his Why. Strength and power in the individual consists of being logical enough to find Whys he can use to advance his existing scene toward the ideal scene. The Why is not God.

This is known as consistency. One does not have a situation about books, data about bicycles, stats of another person, a Why about another area, a different subject for ideal scene and handling for another activity. The situation, whether good or bad, must be about a certain subject, person or area, the data must be about the same, the stats are of that same thing, the Why relates to that same thing, the ideal scene is about the scene of that same thing and the handling handles that thing and especially is regulated by that Why.

There is a report or observation that is out of the ordinary. This \"coming to notice\" occurs on any line. Usually it is fairly major, affecting a large portion of the area, but it can be minor. So observation in general must be continuous for situations to be noted. To just note a situation and act on it is out of sequence as it omits evaluation. You can be elated or shocked uselessly by noting a situation and then not doing any evaluation, It is the hallmark of a rank amateur or idiot to act on reports without any evaluation. So, the first step is noting, from general alertness, a situation exists. A situation is defined as a not expected state of affairs. It is either very good or it is very bad. If it is very good it must be evaluated and a Why found so one can even upgrade an ideal scene. If it is very bad, it must be evaluated and a Why found so that it can be handled to more closely approach the ideal scene. DATA Data is the information one has received that alerts one to the situation. Intelligence systems use various (mainly faulty) methods of \"evaluating\" data so as to \"confirm it.\" They do this uniformly from reports. No matter how many reports one may see there is always a question as to their truth. Intelligence chiefs have started most wars (US vs. Germany 1917) or failed to start them in time (US vs. Japan 1936) by depending on \"authori-tative sources,\" \"skilled observers,\" \"valid documents\" and other confetti they class as \"re-ports\" or \"documents.\" As noted above, the \"raw document\" or \"raw materials\" as they are called have led, when accepted, to the most terrifying catastrophes. British Admiral Hall, without permission of the British government, leaked the famous \"Zimmerman telegram\" to US President Wilson and stampeded the US into World War 1. The alleged German \"instructions\" to their US Am-bassador \"intercepted\" by Hall were passed on with confidence tricks and President Wilson, elected to keep the US out of the war, being no great evaluator, dived overboard on one flimsy questionable report and carried America into the disaster of two world wars and a communist supremacy. The US was lulled by false Japanese assurances and false data on the smallness of Japanese armaments and considered the country no danger. The true situation would have led to a US declaration of war in 1936!

Essentially, \"data\" regarded from the angle of outpoints is a lack of consistency. \"Our Div 2 is doing very well\" doesn't go with gross income $2. This gives you a guideline, the \"string to pull\" (see investigation checksheet on fol-lowing down things you just don't understand, the first emergence of the Data Series). So the data you give is not a lot of reports. It is a brief summary of the \"strings pulled\" on the outpoint or pluspoint route to finally get the Why. Example: (from a situation where an org was going broke) \"The sign-ups reported for service and new names to Central Files were both high yet gross income was down. An inves-tigation of the service area showed no backlogs and no new customers with the staff idle. Tech Services was fully staffed. Examining complement showed no one in the Department of Income. People were signed up but there was no one to receive the money.\" The why of course was a wrong complement particularly no cashier and an Executive Director neglecting his duties. Example: (on a situation of a stat soaring) \"The Promo Dept had very down stats with no promo going out. Bulk mail was low. Div 6 was idle, yet the GI was soaring. Nothing in the org could be found to account for it. Investigation of what promo incoming public had, showed that the promo was coming from a lower level org promoting itself as a route to upper level services.\" The Why of course was an effective promo campaign being run outside the org. And one could bolster that up and get the org active too. Data, then, is the Sherlock Holming of the trail that gave the Why. It at once reflects the command the evaluator has of the Data Series. And his own cleverness. Sometimes they come in a sudden blue flash a yard long, a piece of insight into what must be going on if these outpoints add up this way. Rapid investigation of further data on this trail proves or disproves the flash of insight. One does not run on insight alone (or crystal balls). To one not trained and practiced in evaluation the finding of a Real Why may look as mysterious as an airplane to an aborigine."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 4 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 100 DATA SERIES It is a fact that people who do not understand evaluation can get the idea that man-agement acts on personalities or whims or that management has spies everywhere to know that the Distribution Secretary never came to work. To the expert it is easy. To the ignorant it looks very supernatural. It is the trail followed that counts. This is what is required under \"data.\" STATS Situations and data trails are supported by statistics. Where statistics are not in numeral form this may be harder. Where they are outright lies, this is an outpoint itself. A person or nation without any statistic may be a puzzle at first but statistical ap-proximations can exist and be valid. Statistics of CIA would be very hard to dig up. They don't even let the US Congress in on it. But the deteriorating overseas influence of the US would show that CIA was not batting any high average and that its data fed to policy-makers (its avowed purpose) might well be false or misleading causing policy errors that cause a deteriorating scene. So statistics can be estimated by the scene itself even when absent in numerical form. England has lost its whole empire in a quarter of a century, without a single defeat in war. This gives an adequate statistic for the government's good sense or lack of it. It is at this writing losing even parts of the homeland and is itself joining what might be called the Fourth Reich and so will soon cease to exist as a political sovereignty. This statistic can even be drawn as a dive-bombing down curve. A deckhand's statistic may not exist on a chart but the areas he tends do exist for view. One either has a numerical statistic or a direct observation. One can use both. I once answered the question, \"Why are paid completions high and gross income low?\" by finding that the \"paid\" completions stats were false. So one statistic can be compared to another. Three or more stats can be compared to each other and often lead directly to a Why. The main point is don't act without statistical data. After a fine data analysis, one may well find the stats are quite normal and there is no situation. One may have a great PR PR PR data analysis and collide with statistics you'd need a submarine to read. And one may have data that says the whole staff of Keokuk should be shot without waiting for dawn and then discover that, by stats, they're doing great."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 5 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 101 DATA SERIES And one can also do a data analysis that shows somebody should be commended and prove it by stats and then discover belatedly the stats are false and the guy should have been shot. However, if one looks at all available stats after doing a data analysis one may find they look good at a glance but are sour as green apples. One could see a high lot of stats, GI, etc., and then see a cost stat that shows someone is making $2 million at a cost of $4 million and that the place is going straight into the garbage can. Do not give a Why or recommend handling without inspecting the actual stats. And do not be thrown off a situation you are sure exists without looking at all the stats. (Example: High hour interns' stats throw one off interfering until one sees NO interns graduating and NO programs completed by them.) THE WHY This is the jewel in the crown, the main dish at dinner, the gold mine in the towering mountains of mystery. A real Why must lead to a bettering of the existing scene or (in the case of a wonder-ful new scene) maintaining it as a new ideal scene. Therefore the Why must be something you can do something about. (See THE WHY IS GOD policy letter.) Thus the Why is limited by what you can control. It is never that other division or top management or the bumps on the moon. Even if all this were true, the Why must be something which you can do something about yourself from your level of authority or initiative that will lead to the improvement of a poor existing scene toward the Ideal Scene. The Why is a special thing then. It is a key that opens the door to effective improve-ment. It is not a prejudice or a good idea. It is where all the analysis led. And a Real Why when used and handled and acted upon is like a magic carpet. The scene at once becomes potentially better or gets maintained. \"Acting on a wrong Why\" is the stuff of which coffins are made. No matter how brilliant the program that follows, there it is, the same old mud. Wrong Whys work people half to death handling a program which will lay ostrich eggs and rotten ones at that. It will cost money and time that can't be afforded easily. It will distract from the real tiger in the woods and let him roar and eat up the goats while everyone is off chasing the ghosts which \"really were the cause of it all.\""},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 6 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 102 DATA SERIES Wrong Whys are the tombstones of all great civilizations and unless someone gears up the think will be the mausoleum of this one. Do not think you won't get them. It takes 28,000 casualties in battle, they say, to make a major general. Well it may take a few wrong Whys to make an evaluator. The evaluator who has done the evaluation is of course responsible for it being cor-rectly done and leading to the right conclusion and verified by stats to give the correct real Why. And the real ones are often too incredible to have been arrived at in any other way. Or they are so obvious no one noticed. In one instance Whys were found by experts for six months on a certain course with-out improving the flagrantly bad situation but actually messing it up more until a huge real Why jumped out (the students had never been trained on earlier levels) and the situation be-gan to improve. Using one Why for all situations can also occur and fads of Whys are common. True, a Why often applies elsewhere. That's what gives us technology including policy. But in any area of operation where a situation is very abnormal the Why is likely to be very peculiar and too off the ordinary to be grasped at once. There can be an infinity of wrongnesses around just one rightness. Thus there can be an infinity of wrong Whys possible with just one real Why that will open the door. For the real Why does open the door. With it on a good situation one can maintain it and with a bad situation one can improve it. Thus the Real Why is the vital arrival point to which evaluation leads. THE IDEAL SCENE If a bad situation is a departure from the ideal scene and if a good situation is attaining it or exceeding it, then the crux of any evaluation is the Ideal Scene for the area one is evalu-ating. Viewpoint has a lot to do with the ideal scene. To Russia a collapsed America is the ideal scene. To America a collapsed Russia is an ideal scene. To some have-not nations both Russia and the US competing at vast expense for the favor of a coy petty ruler is the ideal scene to that ruler. To most other parts of the world both these major countries interested only in their own affairs would be an ideal scene. So, with viewpoint the ideal scene can be \"bad\" or \"good.\" The ideal scene is not necessarily big and broad. An intelligence evaluator that gave the ideal scene as \"a defeated enemy\" on every evaluation would be very inexpert."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 7 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 103 DATA SERIES By consistency the ideal scene must be one for that portion of an activity for which one is trying to find the Why. Example: (Situation: renewed activity on a front held by one platoon. Evaluation: No other points along the lines are active and a tank road leads toward the front where the activ-ity is. Why: area being prepared for a tank breakout.) Ideal Scene: an uninhabitable area in front of the platoon. (Which could be done with napalm as there is a wood there and a heavy crossfire maintained and a renewed supply of bazookas for the platoon if the napalm didn't work.) Example: (Situation: a lot of silence from Plant 22. Evaluation: no trucks arriving with materials, no raw materials being sent by outside suppliers, suppliers irate. Why: The ac-counting office forgot to pay the raw materials bill and the suppliers held up all further sup-plies.) The Ideal Scene: high credit rating and good accounts PR established with all credi-tors. (And handling would include a recommendation for an evaluation of the accounting of-fice as to why it forgot and why there is no high credit PR with a new ideal scene for that ac-counting office, which might be a wholly different thing: Ideal Scene: an accounting office that enforces income greater than outgo.) By giving the Ideal Scene for every situation, the evaluator is not led into a fatal con-tempt for the competence of all work actually being done. The ideal scene clarifies for one and all whither we are going. But even more important, the evaluation that includes an ideal scene postulates a win from the viewpoint of those for whom it is being done or for one's activities. Sometimes when one gets to the ideal scene and writes it down he finds his Why won't really lead to it, in which case he must get another Why or familiarize himself with the scene in general to find out what he is trying to send where. In the case of an abnormally good situation one finds he has exceeded what was for-merly thought to be the ideal scene and must state a new one entirely with the Why concerned with how to maintain it. Anyone reading a full evaluation in proper form can better estimate whether the Why and handling are workable if the Ideal Scene is there. And sometimes it will be found that the evaluator is trying to do something else entirely than what everyone else thinks is a correct attainment. Thus it is a very healthy thing to include the ideal scene. It serves as a discipline and incentive for the evaluator and those executing the program. HANDLING Handling must be consistent with the situation, the evaluation, the Why and the ideal scene. Handling must be within the capabilities of those who will do the actions. Handling must be within the resources available."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 8 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 104 DATA SERIES Handling quite often but not always requires a bright idea. It is peculiarly true that the less the resources available the brighter the idea required to attain effective handling. Handling must be supervised by one person who acts as a coordinator of the program and a checker-offer and debug expert. And last but most important handling must be effective and final. The steps of handling are in program form. They are numbered 1-2-3, etc. Or A-B-C, etc. They can be in the sequence they will be done but this is mostly important when one person or one team is going to do the whole thing step by step. These steps are called targets. Each part of the program (each target) is assigned to someone to do or to get done. Care must be taken not to overload persons already loaded and where this occurs one appoints a special personnel or mission for that specific target. The supervision must see that each target gets fully done and no targets not-done and no targets half-done. It is up to supervision to keep track of all completions on a master sheet. Supervision debugs those targets that bog or lag by finding in them a Why, which may mean a rapid evaluation of that target to rephrase it or get it clarified without altering its in-tended accomplishment. Supervision can reassign a target. PROJECTS It is expected that any complex or extensive target will have a project written for it by the person to whom it is assigned if not by the originator. By completing this project the target is done. Often these projects have to be passed upon by a senior before being begun. COMPLIANCE When the master sheet shows all targets done (not not-done and not half-done and not falsely reported) full situation handling can be expected. REVIEW When the supervisor reports all targets done, it is in the hands of fate whether the situation will now be progressed toward or attain the ideal scene. The accuracy of the data, the skill of the evaluator, the correctness of the why, the competence of the supervisor and the skill of those executing the targets and the willingness"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 9 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 105 DATA SERIES of those receiving the effects of all this activity (their human emotion and reaction) determine whether this evaluation approaches or attains the ideal scene. All such evaluations should be reviewed as soon as the actions have had time to take effect. An idiot optimism can suppose all is well and that it is needless to review. But if this why was wrong then the situation will deteriorate and a worsening situation will be apparent. Thus a sharp watch has to be set. No thirst for \"always being right\" or arrogance about never being wrong must prevent an honest review. Was the ideal scene approached or attained? Or was it a wrong Why and now is all Hades breaking loose? Now we don't have just renewed insistence that the Why was right and that the pro-gram must go in in spite of all. We have a wrong Why. MAGIC It will be found that where you have a real why people will cooperate all over the scene. The only exception is where there are traitors around. But this is an easy explanation, too often bought to excuse wrong Whys. The Germans, when they found in World War II, how ineffective the Italian intelli-gence service was, couldn't believe it, tried to improve it, became convinced they were trai-tors, probably shot them in scores and took the service over themselves. And lost Italy even more rapidly. Whatever the right Why was, the Germans had the wrong one. And so does any executive who has to shoot everybody-he just can't find the right Whys. It is no disgrace to find a wrong Why. It is only a disgrace not to keep trying on and on until one does find it. Then the clouds open, the sun shines, the birds pour out their souls in purest melody and the ideal scene is approached or reached. So review is damnably important. Situations have to be handled very fast. And reviews have to be as quick as possible after effect can occur. WHOLE VIEW So here you have the whole view. The keynotes are observe, evaluate, program, supervise and review. The heart of Observe is accuracy."},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 10 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 106 DATA SERIES The heart of Evaluate is a cool, cold knowledge of the Data Series.

SUMMARY If you cannot roll all this off rapidly then misunderstood words in this series are in the way. Or one is battling with some outpoint in his own life. The Data Series is for use. It works because it has unlocked logic. In management one is very fortunate since he can program and handle. In intelligence one is less fortunate as his handling can only be suggested and many an intelligence officer has watched a useless Battle of the Bulge after he told them all about it and \"they\" had other ideas. But the Data Series works in intelligence as well. Data analysis was not developed in a professorial out of a lost-to-the-world tower. It was evolved by attempting to explain logic, then was developed on one of the hottest cross-fire but successful evaluation posts on the planet against a background of blood, sweat and tears war intelligence experience. So it is itself real. The key to it is handling Data. So here it is. I do sincerely hope it serves you in helping to attain your ideal scene. L.

To handle any confusions on the words and substance of \"policy,\" \"plans,\" \"pro-grams,\" \"projects\" and \"orders\" the following descriptive definitions (see Scn Logic No. 5) are laid down for our use. Policy: By this is meant long-range truths or facts which are not subject to change ex-pressed as operational rules or guides. Plans: Short-range broad intentions as to the contemplated actions envisaged for the handling of a broad area to remedy it or expand it or to obstruct or impede an opposition to expansion. A plan is usually based on observation of potentials (or resources) and expresses a bright idea of how to use them. It always proceeds from a Real Why if it is to be successful. Program: A series of steps in sequence to carry out a plan. One usually sees a pro-gram following the discovery of a Why. But in actual fact a plan had to exist in the person's mind, whether written or not, before a program could be written. A program, thus, carries out the plan conceived to handle a found Why. A plan and its program require authorization (or okay) from the central or coordinating authority of the general activities of a group before they can be invested in, activated or executed. Projects: The sequence of steps written to carry out one step of a program. Project or-ders often have to be written to execute a program step. These should be written but usually do not require any approval and often are not generally issued but go to the person or persons who will accomplish that step of a program. Under the category of project would come or-ders, work projects, etc. These are a series of guiding steps which if followed will result in a full and successful accomplishment of the program target. Orders: The verbal or written direction from a lower or designated authority to carry out a program step or apply the general policy."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"HANDLING POLICY, PLANS, PROGRAMS 2 HCO PL 29.2.72R PROJECTS AND ORDERS DEFINED ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 108 DATA SERIES In short: Policy = the rules of the game, the facts of life, the discovered truths and the invariable procedures. Plans = the general bright idea one has to remedy the WHY found and get things up to the ideal scene or improve even that. (Approval.) Program = the sequence of major actions needed to do the plan. (Approval.) Project = the sequence of steps necessary to carry out one step in a program. (No ap-proval.) Orders = some program steps are so simple that they are themselves an order or an or-der can simply be a roughly written project. Thus, by these definitions a data analysis would look like this: Policy: (What brings the evaluation into existence in the first place.) Situation: (Departure from or improvement of the ideal scene expressed in policy.) Data: (Observations leading to investigation.) Statistics: (The independent continuing survey of production or lack of it.) Why: (The real reason found by the investigation.) Ideal Scene: (The state of affairs envisioned by policy or the improvement of even that.) HANDLING: A Plan whether written in full or not based on the why to use the resources available to move the existing scene toward the ideal scene. A Program: A sequence of broad steps to get the plan executed. Projects: Any sequence of steps ordered or written to get a program step completed. Orders: The program step itself or the verbal or written project to get the program step fully done. Thus a handling could look like this: HANDLING: Plan: To use Bob Bartlett to replace the incompetent exec found in the why. 1. Find a replacement for Bartlett. Personnel. ____________ 2.

Personnel. ____________ ___________________ This of course is a very simple plan and simple program. The orders are seen as \"Personnel,\" \"Dir of Personnel Enhancement,\" \"Action Mis-sion Writer,\" etc., at the paragraph ends. The program step itself is an order to the person or unit named at program step end. But it also authorizes that person or unit to do the step or issue orders to do the step or even write a project and get it done. That final end word on the program step is an authority as well as being an order to the person or unit named. ROUND-UP A copy of a full program marked Master is placed in a folder. The folder is marked on the edge with the program name and number. The program itself is stapled along its left edge to the inside left cover of the folder. A \"Flag Rep\" is responsible for \"LRH programs.\" A Deputy Executive Director or Deputy Commanding Officer is responsible for an ED's or C/O's programs. The responsibility lies in seeing that each step is fully effectively done. All related papers, copies of projects' orders, etc., are collected in that folder and as each done is reported and investigated as done it is marked off on the Master program sheet. When all those projects or orders bred by the program steps are done then the pro-gram is considered done. One does not \"report progress\" but only dones and when something is not done yet it is chased up by the 'Flag Rep\" or Deputy ED or C/0 and \"debugged.\" DEBUGGING The word \"bugged\" is slang for snarled up or halted. Debug is to get the snarls or stops out of it. This itself requires an evaluation. The evaluation may be done at a glance or it may take a full formal evaluation by form. The ideal scene here is the program step done or even improved. So the Why here would be the real reason it was not being done or couldn't be done and that may require hours to locate and sometimes days to remedy."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"HANDLING POLICY, PLANS, PROGRAMS 4 HCO PL 29.2.72R PROJECTS AND ORDERS DEFINED ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 110 DATA SERIES When \"debugging\" one usually finds the persons assigned the target already have a \"Why\" and it is usually a false Why for if it was the right one the program step would get done. Thus debugging usually begins with finding \"their Whys\"-which is to say reasons, ex-cuses, apologies, etc. Getting these into view is a main part of the program step evaluation. A project, often written, comes out of this debug evaluation. In extreme cases it will be found that the whole program is based on a wrong Why and rapidly needs redoing by the original authority. Example: The Why found was that the Jinx office was not making money. In doing one step of the program: \"3. Survey past invoices to find where money is coming from and why they don't get it now. mission,\" the mission sent finds Jinx Office was making money by the ton but it was being wasted by their having bought a huge building whose rent is three times normal rental \"in the hopes new subtenants would pay the rent but nobody wants the place.\" Rapid debug is needed because the target can't really be done. They are making money and they do get it now. In such a case doing the program unearthed a new Real Why and scrubbed that pro-gram. A super-frantic hysterical communication would be sent to the authority of the pro-gram, \"New Why found by Pgm 891 target 3 observation. Jinx Office paying $80,000 a quar-ter for skyscraper. Obvious real Why ED has delusions of grandeur, is a bad business head. Suggest Pgm 891 redone on new Why and suggest plan of mission here for instant offload of this skyscraper and office into proper quarters and replacement of ED.\" At which the 'Flag Rep\" or Deputy ED or Deputy C/O will approach the authority for the pgm to get immediate cancellation of 891 and all program targets and a new Program 891R based on the Real Real Why. Debug, however, is not always so dramatic. \"We don't have anyone to put on it\" is the usual excuse as they sit lazily chatting amongst their piled up dev-t. So one evaluates the area against the program target and finds a Why that, executed as a project will get that target done. The Perfect Debug Evaluation (a) gets the target done (b) improves the area (c) leaves no dregs of human emotion and reaction behind it. Just plain screaming often works. But if one has to, there is a real Why there some-place that should be found, a project handed out and done. HANDLING SUMMARY You can find out all the situations and Whys in the world but if there isn't a plan and program and if these are not done fully, then nothing beneficial will happen. Indeed the not-dones, half-dones and backlogs will mount up (per HCO P/L 26 Jan 72, Admin Know-How 29, Executive Series 5) and set the whole thing a step backwards."},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"HANDLING POLICY, PLANS, PROGRAMS 5 HCO PL 29.2.72R PROJECTS AND ORDERS DEFINED ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 111 DATA SERIES Bad programs and clumsy projects develop useless traffic (dev-t) and tie people up all over the place, pull them off normal needful actions and send the existing scene even further from the ideal scene.

Staffs subjected to programs that are not based on sound observation evaluation, a real why and the points in Data Series 23, become apathetic as they see no result.

Misunderstood words. One has not gotten the definitions of the words used. This does not mean \"new words.\" It is usually old common words. It is not just long words, it is more usually little ones. To handle this one takes each policy letter (or chapter) in turn and looks it over carefully to see what words he cannot rapidly define. To help in this one uses an E-Meter and \"Method 4\" Word Clearing which is the method of using a meter to see if-\"Are there any words in this policy misunderstood?\" Any upset or an-tagonism or boredom felt comes only from a misunderstood word or misunderstood words. 2. The person has himself an outpoint in his routine thinking. This is found and handled by what is called an \"HC (Hubbard Consultant) List.\" This list assessed on a meter de-tects and handles this. 3. Lack of knowledge of an existing or an ideal scene. This is handled by observing the existing scene directly or indirectly by reports and for the ideal, study of the basic pol-icy of the scene which gives one its ideal, its expected products and form of organiza-tion. 4. Not having studied the Data Series. Handled by studying it properly. 5. Not having studied data analysis from the viewpoint of needing to apply it. 6. Thinking one already knows all about analyzing and data. Handled by looking over some past failures and realizing they could have been prevented by a proper collection of data and analyzing it. 7. Tossing off \"reasons\" personally on one's own personal area which are usually just ex-cuses or justifications and not Whys. \"I was too tired,\" \"I should have been tougher,\" \"They were just bums anyway,\" which loads up one's own life with wrong Whys.

Handled by practice."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"LEARNING TO USE DATA ANALYSIS 2 HCO PL 19.3.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 114 DATA SERIES 9. Confusing outpoints with Whys.

Missing \"omitted data\" or particles or people as a frequent outpoint. Handled by knowing the ideal scene better. What should be there and isn't. THE BEGINNER When one begins to apply data analysis he is often still trying to grasp the data about data analysis rather than the outpoints in the data. Just become more familiar with the Data Series. Further one may not realize the ease with which one can acquire the knowledge of an ideal scene. An outpoint is simply an illogical departure from the ideal scene. By comparing the existing scene with the ideal scene one easily sees the outpoints. To know the ideal scene one has only to work out the correct products for it. If these aren't getting out, then there is a departure. One can then find the outpoints of the various types and then locate a Why and in that way open the door to handling. And by handling one is simply trying to get the scene to get out its products. Unless one proceeds in this fashion (from product back to establishment), one can't analyze much of anything. One merely comes up with errors. The definition and nature of products is covered in several P/Ls and especially in HCO P/L 13 Mar 72 Establishment Officer Series No. 5. An existing scene is as good as it gets out its products, not as good as it is painted or carpeted or given public relations boosts. So for any scene, manufacturing or fighting a war or being a hostess at a party, there are products. People who lead pointless lives are very unhappy people. Even the idler or dilettante is happy only when he has a product! There is always a product for any scene. The analyst when he begins may get the wrong product. He may get a doingness in-stead of something one can have. And he may look upon a half completion or half-done thing as a completed product. All this makes his data analysis faulty. As he can't figure out an ideal scene, he then has nothing to compare the existing scene to. It is simply a matter of the cost and time in-volved in not or half getting a product compared to the ideal scene of a really valuable prod-uct with exchange value and what it takes to get it. These two things can be worlds apart. The trail that leads to a Why that will close the gap is plainly marked with one kind or another of outpoints. Where the most and biggest are, there is the Why. Found, the real Why and actual handling will move the existing toward ideal."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"LEARNING TO USE DATA ANALYSIS 3 HCO PL 19.3.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 115 DATA SERIES Hideously enough, what I say about products is true. Even a government could have a product. Like \"a prosperous happy country.\" An intelligence agency often muffs its product such as, \"a properly briefed head of state.\" But to do it the head of state would have to have a product concerning other nations like, \"friendly, cooperative allies which are a help and no threat,\" or some other product. Otherwise the agency would wind up going straight out of the intelligence business and being required to conduct its business by assassination of foreign notables or other actions to do handlings based on wrong Whys. As there would be no product, there could not really be an ideal scene. If there is no ideal scene then there is no way to compare the existing scene. Thus, outpoints would expose situations but no WHY would really be possible as there's no ideal scene to approach. One has often heard some agency or activity say, \"Where the hell are we going anyway?\" Translated this would be, \"We haven't had any ideal scene set up for us.\" And translated further, \"The policy-makers have no product in view.\" So they aren't going any place really and lack of an objective would cause them to go down and lack of a product would cause them to be miser-able. That's the way life has been running. Parents and others often ask children, \"What will you do when you grow up?\" Or \"What are you going to be?\" This is not baffling for a 5-year-old, perhaps, but it is a confuser for a child of 12. There are Be, Do and Have as three major conditions of existence. One must BE in order to Do and Do in order to Have. A product is the Have. It is not the Do. Most peo-ple give \"Do\" as \"product.\" A product is a completed thing that has exchange value within or outside the activity. If one asked a 12-year-old, \"What product are you going to make when you grow up?\" he'd likely give you the exchange reward as the answer, like \"money.\" He has omitted a step. He has to have a product to exchange for money. To \"make money\" directly he'd have to be the Secretary of the Treasury, superinten-dent of the mint or a counterfeiter! Only if you cleared up product and exchange with him could he begin to answer the question about what's what with growing up. Let's say this is done and he says he is set on making photographs of buildings. The do now falls into line-he'd have to photograph things well. The be is obviousarchitectural photo-grapher. The exchange of architectural photographs for salary or fee is feasible if he is good. So now we find he is a poor boy and no chance of schooling or even a box camera. That's the existing scene. The ideal scene is a successful architectural photographer making pictures of build-ings. You see the gap between the existing scene and the ideal scene. Now you can follow back the outpoints and get a Why."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"LEARNING TO USE DATA ANALYSIS 4 HCO PL 19.3.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 116 DATA SERIES It isn't just that he's poor. That's no Why as it opens no doors to get from existing scene to ideal scene. We investigate and find his \"father\" is very religious but an alcoholic and that the boy is illegitimate and his \"father\" hates his guts. So we find a Why that his \"father,\" much less helping him, is not about to let him amount to anything whatever ever. This opens a door. Handling often requires a bright idea. And we find the local parson has often shown interest in the boy so an obvious handling is to get the parson to persuade the \"father\" to let the boy apprentice in the local photo store and tell the boy what he has to do to make good there. Situations cannot be handled well unless a real Why is found. And a real Why cannot be found unless the product is named and an ideal scene then stated. This compared to the existing scene gives us, really the first outpoint. In going the other direction, to find a Why of sudden improvement, one has to locate poor existing scenes that suddenly leap up toward ideal scenes. This is done by locating a high product period (by stats or other signs of production) and comparing it as an ideal scene to the existing scenes before it (and just after if there was a slump) and looking into that for a Why. But one is looking for Pluspoints. And these lead to a real Why for the prosperity or improvement. A \"Who\" will often be found. Like \"James Johnny was shop foreman then.\" Well, he's dead. So it's not a Why as it leads nowhere. What did James Johnny do that was different? \"He got out products\" leads nowhere. We keep looking and we find he had a scheduling board and really kept it up-to-date and used it as a single difference. Aha \"The Why is a kept up scheduling board!\" The handling is to put a clerk on doing just that and hatting the current foreman to use it or catch it. Result, up go the stats and morale. People can look at it and see what they're producing today and where they're at! So not all Whys are found by outpoints. The good situations are traced by pluspoints. If the high peak is current, one has to find a Why, in the same way, to maintain it. STANDARD ACTION A beginner can juggle around and go badly adrift if he doesn't follow the pattern: 1. Work out exactly what the (person, unit, activity) should be producing. 2. Work out the ideal scene. 3. Investigate the existing scene. 4. Follow outpoints back from ideal to existing, 5. Locate the real Why that will move the existing toward ideal."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"LEARNING TO USE DATA ANALYSIS 5 HCO PL 19.3.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 117 DATA SERIES 6. Look over existing resources. 7. Get a bright idea of how to handle. 8. Handle or recommend handling so that it stays handled. This is a very sure-fire approach. If one just notes errors in a scene, with no product or ideal with which to compare the existing scene, he will not be doing data analysis and situations will deteriorate badly because he is finding wrong Whys. THINKING One has to be able to think with outpoints. A crude way of saying this is \"learn to think like an idiot.\" One could also add \"without abandoning any ability to think like a gen-ius.\" If one can't tolerate outpoints at all or confront them one can't see them. A madman can't tolerate pluspoints and he doesn't see them either. But there can be a lot of pluspoints around and no production. Thus one can be told how great it all is while the place edges over to the point of collapse. An evaluator who listens to people on the scene and takes their Whys runs a grave risk. If these were the Whys then things would be better. A far safer way is to talk only insofar as finding what the product is concerned and in-vestigating. One should observe the existing scene through data or through observers or through direct observation. An evaluator often has to guess what the Why might be. It is doing that which brings up the phrase \"Learn to think like an idiot.\" The Why will be found at the end of a trail of outpoints. Each one is an aberration when compared to the ideal scene. The biggest idiocy which then explains all the rest and which opens the door to improvement toward the ideal scene is the Why. One also has to learn to think like a genius with pluspoints. Get the big peak period of production (now or in the past). Compare it to the existing scene just before. Now find the pluspoints that were entered in. Trace these and you arrive at the Why as the biggest pluspoint that opened the door to improvement. But once more one considers resources available and has to get a bright idea. So it is the same series of steps as above but with pluspoints."},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"LEARNING TO USE DATA ANALYSIS 6 HCO PL 19.3.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 118 DATA SERIES VETERAN A veteran evaluator can toss off evaluations in an hour or two, mainly based on how long it takes him to dig up data. A big tough situation may require days and days. Sometimes luck plays a role in it. The data that was the key to it was being sat on by someone not skilled in the subject and who had no idea of relative importances. Sometimes the datum pops up like toast from an electric toaster. Sometimes one has it all wrapped up and then suddenly a new outpoint or pluspoint appears that changes the whole view of the evalua-tor. Example: A firm's blacklist has just been published in a newspaper or as a scandal. Evaluator: \"They do what?\" in a voice of incredulity. \"They ship their security files to Mem-phis in open crates? Because they are saving on postage?\" Wrath could dangerously shoot a wrong somebody. The idiocy is not believable. But a new datum leads to personnel who hired a reporter in disguise because it no longer requires or looks up references. Example: Situation where stats soared. \"They used schoolchildren to pass out litera-ture?\" That's just a point but a strange one. Turns out they also hired a cashier and had Never had one on post before! Why? Nobody to take money. Man gets dedicated to his own pet theories very easily. A true scientist doesn't fixate on one idea. He keeps looking until he finds it, not until his pet theory is proven. That's the test of an evaluator. STATISTICS One always runs by statistics where these are valid. Statistics must reflect actual desired Product. If they do not they are not valid. If they do they give an idea of ideal scene. From a statistic reflecting the desired products one can work out the departure from the ideal scene. A backlog of product production must reflect in a stat. As a backlog is negative pro-duction. From such tools an evaluator can work. __________________ The use of data analysis is relatively easy compared to learning a musical instrument. You have the hang of how it is done.

First amongst these is of course poor evaluation. Second would be a considerable dis-agreement in the evaluated scene with the WHY, especially if it is interpreted as condemna-tory. Third would be a failure to obtain actual compliance with the targets in the evaluation. Fourth would be interference points or areas which, although affecting the scene being evalu-ated, are not looked at in relationship to it. In any scene being evaluated, there are two areas which are not likely to get much at-tention from the evaluator as they may not be remarked on in any of the reports or data being used in his evaluation. These two types of area are (1) local environment and (2) relay points and lines between policy and order source and the scene itself. These two areas may be looked at as (1) the plane upon which the scene exists and (2) the upper stages of authority under which the scene reacts. THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT The surrounding area to the scene being evaluated in the matter or a person would be the general third dynamic or other dynamic in which he or she lives his day-to-day life and which influences the person and therefore influences his hat or post. The search for the WHY which exactly causes Joe or Joanna to fail to hold post or wear a hat and which when handled will greatly better Joe or Joanna may well be their reactions to environments at their level and which may be or may not be there with them. Family or distant friends, not visible to an evaluator, or the work environment or on-the-job friends of Joe or Joanna may greatly influ-ence Joe or Joanna. This might prove too inviting for the evaluator to blame environment for the state of the existing scene and a caution'would have to be introduced: that any WHY must lead to a bettered scene and must not just explain it."},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUATIONS 2 HCO PL 25.5.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 126 DATA SERIES EVAL BY RELAY PTS. Thus, in such a problem it should be understood that one has two existing scenes, one, the person and two, his environment; that they interrelate does not make them just one scene. Thus two evaluations about Joe or Joanna are possible, each with its program. To go about it otherwise is likely to prove as unsuccessful as the original evaluation of the person. Life and orders are reaching Joe or Joanna through relay points which are not ordinarily taken into consideration. Thus those areas should be separately evaluated. Usually, in the case of a per-son, something would have to be done to those areas, on the same plane as the person, by the person himself. So the program might include what the person himself could do about them. The local environment of a material object, such as a machine or an office or a vehi-cle, may also be evaluated as well as the machine or the office or vehicle itself. In short, there are relay points of difficulties that produce situations, on the same plane as the person or thing being evaluated. And these make additional evaluations possible and often profitable to the evaluator in terms of bettered ideal scenes. Yet at first glance, or using only the usual reports, it may seem that there is only one situation such as the person himself. Completely in the interests of justice, it is unfair to put down a target in some greater area situation like \"Remove Joe.\" It may well be that stats did go down when Joe was ap-pointed to a post. Well, that may be perfectly true. But by only then evaluating Joe and not the greater zone of Joe's personal scenes, one may very well come up with a very wrong and abrupt and unjust target. Who in other words, when found, may not solve the scene at all even when one only targets it as \"specially train\" or \"audit\" without removal. There may be another scene that is having an effect on Joe which, if not evaluated properly with a proper program of its own, will make nonsense out of any program about Joe himself related only to his post or position. Another scene may be relaying fatality to Joe which if unhandled will unsuit him to any other post of any other kind. Thus Joe and Joanna would have, each of them, two or more full evaluations possible. What the person is failing at or not doing on the job may have a plain enough Why that can be corrected by programming and moved to an ideal scene or at least toward it. What is hit-ting the person at an environmental or familial or social level might be an entirely different situation, requiring its own evaluation, with a proper Why and program for Joe or Joanna to carry out themselves or even with some help from others. In a broader case, we have, let us say, an organization or division that is in a situation. One, of course, can evaluate it as itself, finding a proper Why and a nice bright idea and a program'. And one can also do a second evaluation of the local environment. This might be the society or an adjacent division or even another organization. And this will require the lo-cation of a situation and finding its Why and working out a program to handle that can be done by the org or the division itself or with help from outside. The local environment outside the scene being evaluated is then a proper subject for another evaluation. It is a serious error to only evaluate the local environment as all too often the person or org or division will insist that that is the only situation and also that it is totally beyond any"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUATIONS 3 HCO PL 25.5.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 127 DATA SERIES remedy by their own actions. Thus, if the evaluator is going to evaluate the local environment of a subject that is in a situation, he does it after he has evaluated the subject on its own ground totally. EVALUATION OF ECHELONS On any command or communication channel there are always a certain number of points extending from source through relay points down to the final receipt or action point. These may be very numerous. Some may be beyond the authority of any evaluator. But each is capable of having its own situation that will cause an evaluation of the receipt or action point to fail. These can be called \"echelons\" or step-like formations. The receipt or action point that is to comply finally with the program may be the subject of hidden sources of effect in the relay points of any program or order. Thus, as in the case of a dangerous decline of some activity somewhere, an evaluator has several evaluations possible and probably necessary. It would be, by experience, a severe error to try to evaluate all these different scenes (such as many echelons each in a different area) in one evaluation and find a Why for the lot as one is attempting to find a single Why for several different scenes in different places which violates the strict purity of evaluation procedure. One may find the exact and correct Why for the point of action and do a splendid pro-gram only to find that somehow it didn't come off or didn't last. Yet it was the right Why for that scene. Hidden from view is the influence on that scene from one or more upper echelons which have, themselves, an individual situation and need their own Why and their own pro-gram. Only then can the influence on the action point be beneficial in its entirety. There is a system by which this is done. 1. One recognizes that there is a situation in an area which has not responded well to previous evaluation or has not maintained any benefit received very long. 2. One realizes that there are several, echelons above the point being evaluated. 3. One draws these points without omission. This makes a sort of graph or com-mand chart. It includes every command or comm relay point above the level of the point being evaluated. 4. The points, if any, below the point under consideration as in I above are then added to the chart below it. 5. One now undertakes a brief study of each of these points above and below to see if any have a situation of its own that could influence the success or failure of the original point evaluated as in I above. 6. One does a full separate evaluation of each of these echelon points where any situation seems to exist. Each of the evaluations done must have its own local situation, Why and program. Care is taken not to evaluate \"n o- situations.\""},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUATIONS 4 HCO PL 25.5.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 128 DATA SERIES Care is also taken to keep this Series of evaluations consistent with the main idea of remedying I above. 7. The evaluations are released as a series and executed as feasible. In doing such a series, brand new data may leap out as to the interrelationship of all these relay points and this may bring about a recommendation for a change of organization requiring new policy. But this would be another evaluation entirely as it is in effect an evalua-tion of basic organizational policy and may even require that tech be issued or withdrawn. Take a case where the area which has not bettered or sustained a betterment has in ac-tual fact two echelons below it and six above. The area, let us say, is a continental manage-ment office of an international hotel chain. Below it are its state offices and below that the hotels on that continent. Above it is the international comm relay center, the international headquarters executive at international headquarters for that continent, above that the interna-tional management organization, above that the chief executive of the international manage-ment organization, above that the advisors to the board and above that the board itself. By drawing these out as a series of echelons one sees that there is potentially a series of eight evaluations in addition to the main evaluation of that continental office which is where the situation originally was. By scanning over all these eight other influencing areas, one may find one or more of them which have situations of real influence on the original evaluation subject. One then evaluates separately and handles separately while still going on handling the original subject. One can then also do the local environment evaluation of the original subject if there seems to be a situation there. No evaluation is done where there is no situation. But one should assert in a covering note to the series that there are no known situations in the remaining points. Doing a series of evaluations and local environment evaluations can be extremely fruitful only so long as one realizes that they comprise separate situations which only by their influence are preventing an ideal scene from being achieved in the original area where bet-terment cannot be attained or maintained. Supplementary evaluations, when necessary and when done, can rescue a long series of apparently fruitless evaluations of a subject and move the evaluator himself toward a more ideal and happier scene of success.

Almost every paragraph is a situation requiring evaluation. \"A situation is something that affects stats or survival of the org. \"An outpoint is something that contributes to a situation and should not be in the situa-tion area. \"A Why is the real basic reason for the situation which, being found, opens the door to handling. \"Evaluators who are trying to embrace the whole org of world in one evaluation are missing all the real situations or landing only in Division Seven.\" (The following is a despatch written by LRH in May 1976 regarding an earlier evalua-tion done on an org which LRH was evaluating at the time.) \"That evaluation, that was to pull in the CO, had one of these 'philosophical Whys,' 'The CO and HCO have prevented execs from being made by omitting actions that would ac-complish this (i.e. choosing suitable ones, hatting, training and apprenticing them) which has led to blows and 19th century solution of transfers and removals and eventually no execs at all.'

Almost all of them were sim-ply the basic outpoints in a different guise and needed no special category. However, two new outpoints did emerge that are in addition to the basic number. The new outpoints are ADDED TIME In this outpoint we have the reverse of dropped time. In added time we have, as the most common example, something taking longer than it possibly could. To this degree it is a version of conflicting data = something takes three weeks to do but it is reported as taking six months. But added time must be called to attention as an outpoint in its own right for there is a tendency to be reasonable about it and not see that it IS an outpoint in itself. In its most severe sense, added time becomes a very serious outpoint when, for exam-ple, two or more events occur at the same moment involving, let us say, the same person who could not have experienced both. Time had to be added to the physical universe for the data to be true. Like this: \"I left for Saigon at midnight on April 21st, 1962, by ship from San Francisco.\" \"I took over my duties at San Francisco on April 30th, 1962.\" Here we have to add time to the physical universe for both events to occur as a ship would take two or three weeks to get from San Francisco to \"Saigon.\" Another instance, a true occurrence and better example of added time happened when I once sent a checklist of actions it would take a month to complete to a junior executive and received compliance in full in the next return mail. The checklist was in her hands only one day! She would have had to add 29 days to the physical universe for the compliance report to be true. This is also dropped time on her part. ADDED INAPPLICABLE DATA Just plain added data does not necessarily constitute an outpoint. It may be someone being thorough. But when the data is in no way applicable to the scene or situation and is added it is a definite outpoint."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"OUTPOINTS, MORE 2 HCO PL 30.9.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 140 DATA SERIES Example: Long, long reams of data on an eval write-up, none of which is giving any clue to the outpoints on the scene. By actual survey it was found that the person doing it did not know any Why (not having used outpoints to find it) and was just stalling. Often added data is put there to cover up neglect of duty or mask a real situation. It certainly means the person is obscuring something. Usually added data also contains other types of outpoints like wrong target or added time. In using this outpoint be very sure you also understand the word inapplicable and see that it is only an outpoint if the. data itself does not apply to the subject at hand. There is more about another already named outpoint: WRONG SOURCE This is the opposite direction from wrong target. An example would be a president of the United States in 1973 using the opinions and congratulations of Soviet leaders to make his point with American voters. A more common version of this, not unknown in intelligence report grading for prob-ability, would be a farmer in Iowa reporting a Mexican battleship on Mud Creek. The farmer would be a wrong source for accurate naval reports. A private taking an order from a sergeant that countermands an order he had from a lieutenant would be an example of wrong source. What is sometimes called a \"Hey You\" \"organization\" is one that takes orders from anyone = a repeating outpoint of wrong source. There are many examples of this outpoint. It must be included as a very important out-point on its own. It produces a chaos of illogical ideas and actions when present. PLUSPOINTS Correct Time or the expected time period is a pluspoint. Adequate Data is a pluspoint. Applicable Data is a pluspoint. Correct Source is a pluspoint. L.

If several outpoints come to view in any scene (or even one), if you look further you will find a situation. There is not any real art to finding situations if you can see outpoints. The sequence is simple. (1) You see some outpoints in a scene, (2) you investigate and \"pull a few strings\" (meaning follow down a chain of outpoints) and (3) you will find a situa-tion, and (4) then you can evaluate. Statistics are leaders in pointing the way. They should be X, they are not X. That is conflicting data. Behind that you will find a situation. If anyone has any trouble finding situations then one of three things is true (a) he can-not recognize outpoints when he sees them, (b) he does not have any concept of the ideal scene or want it, or (c) he does not know how to pull strings, which is to say ask for or look for data. On the positive side, to find situations one has to (A) be able to recognize outpoints, (B) has to have some idea of an ideal scene and want it, and (C) has to be able to \"pull strings.\" Evaluation is very much simpler when you realize that the art lies in finding situations. To then find a Why is of course only a matter of counting outpoints and recognizing what (that can be handled) is retarding the achievement of a more ideal scene. REASONABLENESS One often wonders why people are so \"reasonable\" about intolerable and illogical situations. The answer is very simple: they cannot recognize outpoints when they see them and so try to make everything seem logical."},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"SITUATION FINDING 2 HCO PL 30.9.73 II ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 142 DATA SERIES The ability to actually see an outpoint for what it is, in itself is an ability to attain some peace of mind. For one can realize it is what it is, an outpoint. It is not a matter for human emotion and reaction. It is a pointer toward a situation. The moment you can see this you will be able to handle life a lot better. The human reaction is to react! to an outpoint. And then get \"reasonable\" and adopt some explanation for it, usually untrue. You can safely say that \"being reasonable\" is a symptom of being unable to recognize outpoints for what they are and use them to discover actual situations. NATIVE THINK It may come as a surprise or no surprise at all that the ability to evaluate as given in this Data Series is not necessarily native to a being. In a native state a being detests illogic and rejects it. He seldom uses it for any other purposes than humor or showing up a rival in debate as a fool or using it in justice or a court of law to prove the other side wrong or guilty. A being is dedicated to being logical and he does, usually, a wonderful job of it. But when he encounters illogic he often feels angry or frustrated or helpless. He has not, so far as I know, ever used illogic as a systematic tool for thinking. Certain obsolete efforts to describe Man's thinking processes stressed \"associative thought\" and various other mechanisms to prove Man a fully logical \"animal.\" The moment they tried to deal with illogic they assigned it to aberration and sought drugs, tortures or exe-cutions that would \"cure it.\" None of them ever thought of using illogic as a tool of rational thinking! Thus they did not advance anyone's intelligence and conceived intelligence as un-changeable and fixed. The only Greek school of philosophy that dealt with illogic was the Sophist school. But even they had no real idea of the illogic. They were employed by politicians to make their political acts seem reasonable! Even humorists have no real idea of illogic. Reading their ideas of the theory of humor shows them to be off the mark. They don't really know what is \"funny.\" Laughter is rejection, actually. And humor you will find usually deals with one or another outpoint put in such a way that the reader or audience can reject it. The groan of most humorists is that too often their hearers go reasonable on them. Pat. \"Who was that hobo I saw you with last night?\" Mike: \"That wasn't no oboe, that was my fife.\" Listener (puzzled): \"But maybe it was a very slender hobo.\" The tendency of a being is to try to keep it reasonable, logical, rational. And that is of course a very praiseworthy impulse or all life's endeavors might unhinge."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"SITUATION FINDING 3 HCO PL 30.9.73 II ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 143 DATA SERIES The fear of being illogical is a secret fear of being crazy or insane. (Not an idle fear when psychiatry was roaming around loose.) Or at the least being thought a fool or dullard or at the very very least, unworldly and uneducated. To evaluate and be a fine evaluator is to be able to prevent a slump toward a painful collapse. And to be able to steer the way from the non-ideal present to the ideal future. A person who feels queasy about his sanity really doesn't dare look at outpoints or confront and use illogic. Yet it is the way to full sanity itself. The ability to evaluate puts one at cause over both the mad and ideal. It places a being at a height it is unlikely he has ever before enjoyed in the realm of commanding the situations of life. Evaluation is a new way to think. It is very worthwhile to acquire such an ability as it is doubtful if it ever before has been achieved. L.

The evaluator, with all the study for an ideal scene, the exhaustive search for data and the collection and count of outpoints and pluspoints, with the discovery thereafter of the right Why and the brightest of ideas to handle may yet be totally defeated by the simple fact that no one ever chases up the target execution and gets the program really and honestly done. He can even have someone who is responsible for getting his program executed only to find they are themselves issuing additional or even contrary orders. Or even issuing whole new programs which have no relation to evaluation at all. Circumstances have been found where a person with the duty of getting targets done was so deficient in the ability to confront that he accepted any excuse at all and was even pushed over into other subjects. The remedy for this of course is HCOB 21 Nov 73, \"The Cure of Q & A, Man's Deadliest Disease.\" It can be so bad that persons entrusted with target execution did not even speak to or approach any person who had a target to do while not reporting at all or reporting marvelous progress with the program! So, sad to have to relate, it is not enough to be a fantastic and able evaluator. If the program is never truly done, the evaluation is merely a mental exercise. The ability to supervise and obtain cooperation and execution is mandatory for the skill of any evaluator. HCO P/L I Sept 73, \"Admin Know-How No. 30\" and HCO P/L 15 Oct 73, Admin Know-How Series 31, \"Administrative Skill,\" give the evaluator some of the additional data he needs to obtain execution of his programs. One can say right here that the thought, \"Oh well, I'm just a sort of technician here and it's really not up to me to run things. I just evaluate and it's up to 'them' to see that they carry it out,\" is very likely to occur.

The on-paper evaluation was perfect. It would have \"handled the hell\" out of it. But lamentably the program just was never done. Altered or falsely reported or untouched, the targets just weren't done. So the test of an evaluation is: Did it move the Existing Scene toward or attain the Ideal Scene? And that cannot occur without the program being fully and totally and correctly done. See also HCO P/L 26 Jan 72, \"Not-dones, Half-dones and Backlogs\" for more data on this.

Where such a target is written or misused to supplant policy a great deal of trouble can follow. Example: Org policy in authorized issues states that accounts for the week must be fi-nalized at 2:00 P.M. Thursday. Someone writes an evaluation and puts a target in it to end the week on Sunday. People doing the target actions change to Sunday. This is out of phase with all other actions and chaos results. People tend to take orders from anyone and anything in a poorly organized area. When they use evaluation or project targets instead of policy the whole structure may begin to cave in. No eval TGT is senior to official issues and where these conflict the target has the junior position. The only way a target can change policy is to propose that such and such a policy be officially reviewed on proper channels or that a new policy be written and passed upon prop-erly by those in actual authority. Someone attempting to do a target who finds that it conflicts with policy or official technical releases and yet goes on and does the target is of course actionable. TARGETS OUT OF CONTEXT Context: \"The interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.\" Out of Context: Something written or done without relation to the principal meaning of a work. Targets must be written within the meaning of the whole evaluation. Example: The evaluation is about pie. There is a target that says to polish shoes just because the evaluator happened to think of it and squeezed it into the program. A program written to increase pies winds up with the ideal scene of polished shoes. No pies get increased so the evaluation fails."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"TARGET TROUBLES 2 HCO PL 14.12.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 152 DATA SERIES Targets must be done within the context of the evaluation. Example: An evaluation is done to increase central office collections. It calls for an-other evaluation to be done on a statistic. The person doing that target reduces the number of items collected upon and crashes central office collections. The person did not read or understand the whole evaluation before he did the tar-get and so did it in a way that accidentally defeats the ideal scene. Example: An evaluation is done to fill up a big hotel of 450 guest capacity. One of its targets calls for project orders sending a team to the hotel. The person who writes the project orders does not look at the evaluation or the hotel plans and specifies 30 guests must be got-ten! The evaluation is defeated. FALSELY EVALUATING A person who evaluates a situation without chasing up all the data or even looking at the data in his files can bring about a false evaluation. Example: A person has come back into an organization at a high level. The place crashes. The evaluator does not examine personnel changes at the time of the crash and comes up with \"too many football games\" as his Why and the evaluation fails. FALSE DONES False reports that a target has been done when it has not been touched or has been half done at best is actionable in that he is defeating not only the evaluation but the organization. Example: The evaluator has an ideal scene of repaired machines that will increase production. The mechanic reports all machines repaired now when he has not even touched them. The evaluator sees production remains low, looks around for a new Why. But his Why is falsely reported dones on his accurate eval! PERSONAL CONTACT Targets seldom get done without personal contact. Evaluations should carry the name or post of the person who is overall responsible for the completion of the program. Sitting at a desk while one is trying to get people to do targets has yet to accomplish very much. One can have messengers or communicators or Flag Representatives getting the targets done but these in turn must depend upon personal contact. A person assigned responsibility for getting a whole program done is not likely to ac-complish much without personal contact being made. This can be done on a via. Mr. A in location A remote from Mr. C in location C can get a target done reliably only if he has a Mr. B in that area whose sole duty it is to personally"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"TARGET TROUBLES 3 HCO PL 14.12.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 153 DATA SERIES contact Mr. C and have Mr. C get on with it despite all reasons why not. That is how targets get done. That is also how they can be reviewed. Target troubles are many unless the program is under direct contact supervision. Even then targets get \"bugged\" (stalled). But the evaluator can find out why if personal contact is made and the target can be pushed through. SUCCESS Therefore the success of an evaluation in attaining an ideal scene depends in no small measure on 1. Both evaluator and target executor realizing policy and technical materials are senior to targets in programs and that targets do not set senior policy aside. One of the best ways to prevent this is to know and refer to policy and techni-cal issues in targets. 2. Targets must be written in context with the evaluation and done in context with the ideal scene. The best way to achieve this in writing an eval's targets is to make them consistent with the Why and ideal scene. The best way to be sure that targets will be DONE in context is to require that anyone doing a target must first read the whole evaluation (and be word cleared on it) before he does his target so that he does his target in a way to improve the existing scene in the eval not some other scene. 3. To prevent false evaluation one may require that the evaluator attests that all pertinent data and statistics have been examined and to discipline such failures whenever an evaluation fails. 4. To prevent false dones one must review the evidence of dones and statistics af-ter the program is complete and discipline all falsely reporting persons and re-assign the targets or in any way possible get them actually done. 5. The way to get a whole program done, target by target, is through personal contact. Supervise it by personal contact with those assigned the targets. Or use a communicator or messenger. Where the people doing the targets are remote from the evaluator one must have someone there to do the personal contact. And be sure THAT person isn't just sitting at a desk but is actually doing per-sonal contact on targets. Thus all evaluations, on the issue itself or by organiza-tional pattern, should have someone who can personally contact people getting the targets done fully and completely. If these points about evaluations and their programs are understood, one can and only then can move things toward the ideal scene. L.

None of these evaluations would have reached any ideal scene or even improved the existing scene. The real reason for this is that the majority of them had a highly generalized situation such as \"Bidawee Biscuit Company failing\" or \"Stats down from last year.\" They then pro-ceeded on a data trail and got a \"Why.\" In these cases the Why they found was actually the situation! Each of them had failed to use the data trail to find the situation. They were using the data trail to find a Why! The evals then had no Why. The handling was just a bunch of orders that were in fact unevaluated orders since no real Why had been found, Like in playing a game these evaluators had started 50 feet back of the starting line and when they got to the starting line (the situation) they assumed it was the finish. If you look at an \"evaluation\" that has a generalized \"situation\" like \"continental prod-ucts getting fewer\" you will find in a lot of cases (not always accurately) that what was put down as the \"Why\" was in fact the situation. This left the \"eval\" without a Why. Thus the ideal scene would be wrong and the handling ineffective. Example: (not in form) \"Situation: Gus Restaurant failing.\" \"Data: Customers refusing food, etc., etc.\" \"Why: The food isn't good.\" \"Ideal scene: A successful Gus Restaurant.\" \"Handling: Force Gus to serve better food, etc., etc.\" That isn't an eval. That is an observation that if Gus Restaurant is to survive it better get evaluated. It is being evaled because it isn't surviving. Now look at this: The data trail led to \"the food isn't good.\" That's a situation. Why isn't it good enough? Well it turns out the cook got 15% commission from the store for buying bad food at high prices. And Gus didn't know this. So bang, we handle. Gus Restaurant achieves ideal scene of \"Gus Restaurant serving magnificent chow.\" In this example if you used the situation for a Why the Who would probably be Gus!"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"SITUATION CORRECTION 2 HCO PL 18.7.74 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 160 DATA SERIES The data trail of outpoints from a highly general \"situation\" (that is only an observa-tion like failing stats) will lead one to the situation and then a closer look (also by outpoints) will lead one to the real Why and permit fast handling. DATA TRAIL People can get too fixated on the history of something. They can call this a \"data trail.\" Well, all right, if it's a trail of outpoints. But significances of history have little to do with evaluation. Let us say you see the machine division is failing. Now if you simply take masses of data about it and just start turning over 10 or 12 sheets at a time looking for outpoints only and keep a tally of what they are and to whom they belong, you will wind up with your situation area and probably your situation without reading any significances at all. Now that you have your area and situation in it You can start really reading all about it and get that existing scene's data and its outpoints. And your Why leaps at you. SUBSTITUTION You can't substitute stats for a situation or a situation for a Why. But substitution of one part of an eval for another is a common fault. Substituting a general hope for the ideal scene you really would and could achieve makes a sort of failed feeling in an eval. \"Gus Restaurant being best in town\" is nice but \"Lots of customers very well fed so Gus Restaurant survives\" is what you are trying to achieve. That can occur and will be reached if you find the real Why. L.

Only when no major correction is necessary does one then verify all data or go to an extensive review of the whole eval. This makes the line very fast. It also saves a great deal of work by one and all. If the stats are incorrectly given, that's it. Reject. If the Why is really the situation, that's it. On the reject one gives the letter of Data Series 33 that is not correct and any reference to the Data Series that would seem helpful. An evaluation corrector will see how well this rejection system works when you find that the eval, let us say, has no situation on it, but only some stats. Why verify anything as a whole new body of data may have to be found. In correcting evals, if a situation is given, I usually call for the main stats of the unit being evaluated to see if these show any reason to handle it at all. I recently found an activity had had its chief removed when his stats were in Power. The activity then crashed. And that was the situation. It was made by an evaluator and an eval corrector not looking at the stats! If no error exists in situation or stats I read the eval down to bright idea and look espe-cially at the Why, ideal scene and handling to see if one would make the others. If that's okay, I look at the targets of handling and the resources. If those are okay, I look at data and outpoints. If these are all okay, I then verify the data. But if at any of these steps I find an error, I then reject at once for immediate correction. Often, by using only basic things to reject, the whole eval has to be redone as the basics are so far wrong. If you try to correct the whole thing before rejecting or if you correct tiny little things instead of the big ones, the whole line slows. Eval correction should be a fast, helpful line, strictly on-policy, no opinion. That way the job of correction becomes easier and easier. L.

A situation is the most major departure from the Ideal Scene. Thus: One must be able to envision an Ideal Scene to find a situation. A lot of \"ideal scenes\" you see are just glib. An afterthought. Some people know the proper scene so well they at once recognize that a departure from it has occurred, which is fine. But such people do not realize, when they are teaching evaluation or correcting evals, that others may not know the proper scene well enough to get an idea of what the ideal scene should be. Thus, a wrong target occurs. The teacher or correc-tor keeps putting attention on the incorrectness of the situation given in the eval instead of noticing that the ideal scene is adrift. An ideal scene is future. When one is stuck on the time track it may seem pretty difficult to envision a future. In politics this is called \"reactionary\" or \"conservative.\" These mean any resistance to change even when it is an improvement. The bad old days seem to be the good old days to such people. Yet the old days will not come again. One has to make the new days good. \"Liberals,\" \"socialists\" and such make great propaganda out of this. They inveigh against (criticize) conservatives and say the future must be reckoned with. And they hold up some often incredible future scene and say the way to it is by \"revolution\" or destroying eve-rything that was. Both viewpoints could be severely criticized. The conservative tries to stick on the time track with no reality on the fact that today will be yesterday in 24 hours. The su-per-liberal skips tommorrow entirely and goes up the track 5 or 10 years to a perfect state which can never exist or is falsely represented as possible. In between these two viewpoints we have the attainable."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"ENVISIONING THE IDEAL SCENE 2 HCO PL 11.8.74 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 164 DATA SERIES And we come to an ideal scene that is possible and will occur if the Why is right and handling is correct and done. Envisioning an attainable future requires some connection with reality. There is no harm at all in dreaming wonderful dreams for the future. It's almost the bread of life. But how about giving oneself a crashing failure by disconnecting from any reality? Some laborers do this to themselves. Taking no steps to attain it, they daydream them-selves as kings or some other grand identity. Well, all right. But that isn't an \"ideal scene.\" That's a delusion engaged upon for self-gratification in a dream world. One can not only dream a possible ideal scene but he can attain it. So an ideal scene is something that can be attained. It should be quite real. Some people setting unreal quotas are really setting some impossible ideal scene. \"Complete this work in I hour!\" to someone working hard on a job that will take 4 days is delusory. It is setting, without saying so, the ideal scene of having a worker who is really a magician! Well, maybe if he were audited and hatted he would be. But that's sure some ideal scene! The here and now is a guy sweating it out and trying. And that's an ideal scene that is missed! And so are many ideal scenes missed. The offices neat and orderly might not even be imagined by someone who has seen them in a mess for two years. He may think that's the way they're supposed to be! And be quite incapable of envisioning the offices in any other condi-tion! Thus, if one cannot see the offices should be clean, he does not see that they are dirty and messy as a situation. Thus when he is told the public won't come into the place, and even if he finds the place is full of old dirty junk, he can't evaluate it as a clean orderly place would not be envisioned by him. So he doesn't get \"dirty place\" as a valuable datum, doesn't get \"a clean orderly place that is inviting to the public\" as an ideal scene, doesn't get \"office so dirty the public won't go near it\" as a situation and so cannot find a Why to lack of public! And so as he didn't find Why it was so dirty and disorderly, it wouldn't handle. So there would be a failed eval. Yet the teacher or evaluation corrector would not realize the person could not envision an ideal scene and so keep telling the person to find the situation whereas the ideal scene was what was out. You can get some very beautiful ideal scenes and attain them-if you can evaluate! L.

If you write down a Why, ask this question of it: \"Does this open the door to han-dling?\" If it does not, then it is a wrong Why. Backtracking to find how it is wrong, one examines the ideal scene and the situation one already has. The outpoints should be checked. The completeness of data should be checked. One may find he is in a wrong area of the scene. Correct that, correct the ideal scene, correct the situation and look for more data. With the outpoints of more data one can achieve the real Why that will open the door to handling. Quite often an \"evaluator\" \"knows\" the Why before he begins. This is fatal. Why evaluate? Some of the most workable Whys I've ever found surprised me! So usually I also ask, did I know this? Am I surprised? The chances are, if I \"knew\" it already (and the situation still exists) it is a wrong Why. And needs proper evaluation. When you have a right Why, handling becomes simple. The more one has to beat his brains for a bright idea to handle, the more likely it is that he has a wrong Why. So if you're not a bit surprised and if the handling doesn't leap out at you the Why has not opened the door and is probably wrong. I have seen evaluators take weeks to do an evaluation. In such cases they went on and on reading as they did not know how to find a real Why. Actually they did not know what one was. By going through the total current files of an activity looking for outpoints just by randomly glancing at data sheets from all sources, you can find the area. Outpoints lead you straight to it. An ideal scene for that smaller area is fairly easy to envision."},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"WHYS OPEN THE DOOR 2 HCO PL 12.8.74 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 166 DATA SERIES The type of outpoint will generally give you how the departure is. One can then get the situation. By looking over (in detail now) the data of that smaller area and counting the out-points, one can find the Why. The Why will be how come the situation is such a departure from the ideal scene and will open the door to handling. If it doesn't, then review the whole thing, do the steps again. Don't just sit and sag! Let's say we find outpoints of added inapplicable data in all reports. And they lead to Reception. The ideal scene of Reception is easy: attractive pleasant atmosphere, welcoming in the public. We find more detailed reports that the place is full of junk and filthy and we get our situation, \"public repelled by filthy messy Reception.\" Now why? So back to the real data and we find the janitor never cleans it. Or anything else. The easy out is just sack the janitor (and leave the post empty). But that won't handle so we have no Why. So we dig and dig and suddenly we find that the staff refer to the janitor in lowly and disrespectful terms: \"Janitor has no status.\" Well, the outpoints all say so. And it opens the door to a handling. So we handle by transferring the janitor org board position from treasury where it went as he \"looks after assets\" to the Office of the President with the president's secretary as his direct senior. We write up a program for clean offices. Magic! The offices get clean! The public again comes in. The ideal scene is attained. (You may think this example is pretty unreal. But actually it once happened and worked!) So a right Why opens the door to handling. If it doesn't, look harder. There is always a reason for things. And if your ideal scene and situation are correct, you can find the real Why that opens the door. L.

Needless to say, pluspoints are very important in evaluation as they show where logic exists and where things are going right or likely to. Related facts known. (All relevant facts known.) Events in correct sequence. (Events in actual sequence.) Time noted. (Time is properly noted.) Data proven factual. (Data must be factual, which is to say, true and valid.) Correct relative importance. (The important and unimportant are correctly sorted out.) Expected time period. (Events occurring or done in the time one would reasonably expect them to be.) Adequate data. (No sectors of omitted data that would influence the situation.) Applicable data. (The data presented or available applies to the matter in hand and not something else.) Correct source. (Not wrong source.) Correct target. (Not going in some direction that would be wrong for the situation.) Data in same classification. (Data from two or more different classes of material not introduced as the same class.) Identities are identical. (Not similar or different.) Similarities are similar. (Not identical or different.) Differences are different. (Not made to be identical or similar.) The use of the word \"pluspoint\" in an evaluation without saying what type of plus-point it is, is a deficiency in recognizing the different pluspoints as above. It would be like saying each outpoint is simply an outpoint without saying what outpoint it was.

Very rarely you also find one that winds up in a Where. Sometimes you find an \"evaluator\" who only finds Whos or Wheres. If this puzzles you when you see such \"evals\" or if you land in that situation yourself while evaluating, remember this: An \"eval\" that only has a who or a where as its why is incomplete. What has happened is this: The \"evaluator\" does an outpoint count only for Who or Where. He does not then really investigate or dig up the real data on that Who or Where but lets it go at that. He says-Why: Dept I not functioning. Who: Director of Personnel. Ideal Scene: A functioning Dept 1. Handling: Shoot the Dir Personnel. Such evals do not raise statistics. They do not work. Because they are not complete! In any eval you have to do an outpoint count to find where or who to investigate. This prior outpoint count does not appear, always, on the eval form. It's just where to look. Having gotten the Who or Where you now do a full read out, lift the rocks, pry into the cracks and find the Why. It can even get worse. Having seen something wrong, one puts down a situation. He does a preliminary outpoint count for a Where or Who and then discovers a more basic or even worse situation. In other words his situation can change! Example: No personnel being hired leads one to Dept 1, Personnel. So one writes the situation: \"No one being hired.\" Then one can easily dash off, \"Why: Dept I inactive. Ideal scene: An active Dept I hiring personnel.\" And write up a handling: \"Hire people.\" Great, easy as pie. But somehow six months later there are still no personnel! The rea-son is simple: The \"evaluator\" never went beyond the Who-Where. He put down a Who-Where as his Why. Real evaluation would go this way: First observed situation, \"no personnel being hired.\" The Who-Where comes up as Dept 1. Now and only now do we have something to evaluate. So our situation has changed. It becomes, \"Dept I inactive.\" And we investigate and lo and behold there is no one in that whole division! Again we could go off too early. It is tempting to say, \"Why: No one in it!\" And say, \"Handling: Put somebody in it!\" But actually \"no one in it\" is just data! Certainly the execs who should be screaming for personnel know there is no one in Dept 1. After all, they get cobwebs on their faces every"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"WHO-WHERE FINDING 2 HCO PL 28.10.74 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 170 DATA SERIES time they pass the door! So it is just an outpoint, not a Why as it does not securely lead to solution. So we look further. We find seven previous orders to put on a Director of Personnel! The writers of these orders are not the Whos but who they were given to are elected. That's seven noncompliances by the executive in charge of organizing! And this turns out to be Joe Schmoe. Now we have a Who. So what's with this Joe Schmoe? So we go to anything con-nected with Schmoe and we locate Board of Directors minutes of meetings and herein he has been stating for 2 years repeatedly that \"The organization only makes so much money anyway so if we hire anybody to deliver service we might go broke.\" As the organization has been going broke for those two years and the last Dir Personnel was fired two years ago we now also have our date coincidence. But this is still just an outpoint-contrary facts, as one has to deliver to stay solvent. So we look up Joe Schmoe even further and we find he is also the chief stockholder in a rival company! So here is our Why: \"Organization being suppressed by the chief stockholder in the company's rival.\" \"Who: Joe Schmoe. Ideal scene: Organization hiring personnel needed to deliver.\" Now for the handling. Well, Joe Schmoe could mess things up further if we just fired him. So we better know what we're doing. We have found our organization controls the tin Joe Schmoe's company needs for its cans. So we shut off the tin supply and when Schmoe's stock falls we buy it up, merge the companies and fire Joe. Or so a businessman would do. That handles it! Shallow evals that stop with a Who-Where on the first inspection don't succeed. Out-points are usually aberrated and the people there around them usually handle things unless they have depth of mystery. You have to have a Who-Where to begin your investigation. Once you find your Who or your area, now the outpoints begin to count. Very few situations in actual fact are caused by active Whos. Usually it is inactive Whos, confronted with situations they have not grasped and don't see any way through. A classic case was a situation that did not resolve for over a year until very close in-vestigation discovered a statistic was wrongly worked out and which targeted an area in the wrong direction. One could have shot \"Whos\" by the dozen without ever solving it! So when you see a Who-Where as a Why, you know one thing: The eval is incom-plete. You can cure someone doing this chronically by making him first list the outpoints that show Who-Where to look. And then make him go on with the evaluation outpoints that lead to a Why, giving two counts of outpoints. The light will dawn. L.

However the data following, compiled from an LRH taped conference in 1972, is of sufficient importance to include as part of the Data Series.) There are bad situations, good situations and no situations. A situation is something that applies to survival and if you evaluate the word \"situation\" against survival, you've got it. A good situation is a high level of survival; a bad situation is a threatened survival and a no situation is something that won't affect survival. We've gone ahead of the whole show of intelligence with the Data Series. Note: We are using intelligence as an example solely and only because it is the most inclusive system Man has developed for collection and evaluation of data. We have greatly refined this system. Espionage and other intelligence activities and skills have no part in our application. We are using intelligence as an example of data usage systems, that is all. You are out in an area of greater simplification and far more use. This doesn't neces-sarily make anyone an intelligence officer, but a general or a head of something or a general manager or an executive who does not know how to evaluate a situation will make nothing but mistakes. The mistakes of history are made by people who can not evaluate, by which we mean determine the situation-which even more simplified would be find out the situation. From this given body of data, from that indicator we can find a good situation, or a bad situa-tion or a no situation. And this is what one is trying to determine. The more skilled one be-comes in doing it, the less work it is. It is a matter of skill. To give you an idea: If you tried to play every note of a concerto separately by having to look up each note in the chord and then strike it on the piano, you wouldn't have much of a tune, right? But the longer you did that, the more likely you were to begin to approximate some sort of something that sounds like music. But it would take a lot of practice. Now you can get so all-fired-good at evaluation that you can take an isolated indicator and know immediately where it fits into because you know it fits into the plan of things and because you know it is or isn't part of an ideal scene. It's better than the existing scene or it is too far from an ideal scene. You can pick up an indicator in this way-and it sometimes proba-bly looks magical to you how I will suddenly pick up an isolated instance and look down the line and we find a roaring hot situation at the other end of it."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 2 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 174 DATA SERIES Now that is done out of an economy of data. It is done because one has not the time to investigate or read all of the data which might exist on this particular subject being investi-gated. So one learns to do something that looks absolutely intuitive and when you're terrifi-cally hot at this it is called \"flair.\" Prediction from data is an essential part of evaluation. \"This datum is an outpoint-it shouldn't be, peculiar.\" Now it will predict more data. You have to be so hot that you will notice something is an outpoint-it's a wild outpoint of some kind or another-accept its magnitude, size of datum, how important is this datum. The evaluation of importance is one of the more difficult things people have to do. They have a tendency to consider things a monotone importance. You have to train yourself out of that. What do we get here then as a qualification for an evaluator? You have to know all the outpoints in sight. You have to know what outpoints are. But that's rather thinking backwards because you should know that something shouldn't be. And as soon as you get a \"shouldn't be\" you can do a prediction. And that leads you into an investigation-by viewing other data. In other words you find this terrific outpoint or these outpoints and you find out where they exist, it leads you into, very directly, the point that you should be investigating. DEFINITION OF EVALUATION This is as close as the dictionary comes to the definition of evaluation: \"to examine and judge concerning the worth, quality, significance, amount, degree or condition of.\" (The Third Webster's International Dictionary.) Now to edit that down, it's \"to examine and judge the significance and condition of.\" An evaluation: \"the act or result of evaluating, judgement, appraisal, rating, interpreta-tion.\" And an evaluator is \"one that evaluates. An intelligence officer is supposed to be a pro-fessional evaluator.\" (The Third Webster's International Dictionary.) This word is a technical word which isn't given in these dictionaries. It is an action which is basically an intelligence action. The actual meaning which is supposed to be embraced in the word is \"to examine the evidence in order to determine the situation\" and that is the intelligence meaning and then it could have, further: \"so as to formulate policy or planning related thereto. In other words 'What is the enemy going to do?' So the general can say 'Therefore we should. . . .' \" WHAT IS EVALUATION Here is an example of what evaluation is, the type of thing expected of an evaluator. I was looking at an org's graphs, all of a sudden I see a drift down of reserves and a level of bills. The bills are level, level, level-drift down of reserves, until all of a sudden it's about to cross and this was an org where we just changed the CO, so I say \"Hey whoa! Wait a minute, wait a minute! This organization is spending more than its income obviously by the looks of this graph. So let's look into this just a bit further.\" I looked further and got more data"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 3 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 175 DATA SERIES and I found out that the org was running insolvent. The Data Bureau already had a report on this; I picked it up on another line. I just picked it up off graphs. Further investigation found out that the new CO had taken over from the old CO and had inherited an extremely backlogged org-included backlogged bills. And the new CO had been sent in there on a set of Garrison Mission Orders-and they just contained standard CO-ing actions when they should have been MOs designed to handle the insolvency scene-forcing the org to promote and make income; then making an announcement that no POs will be signed except promotion, wages and utilities; then get in the date-line paying and forcing Ac-counts to dig it up out of all their mouseholes and all those bills that have been in there for a year or two and the stuff they didn't file and get a date-line paying system in. Then you start surveying like mad to find out what the organization can sell and then you start delivering, beef up your delivery lines and so on. It wasn't any surprise to me to learn that that graph was a false report, of course. But this is no explanation. It doesn't mean the situation doesn't exist but the graph is a false report. That is an outpoint all in itself. It's actually backed up by other data but you could have taken it this way: You could have seen the graph declining-that is reserves going down, bills staying the same and you find out it's a false report. At that moment, by Data Series, you charge in and investigate the heck out of it. Here's an indicator, then another indicator that's a false re-port. Where did I count outpoints? I was counting them all the time. One is enough-a de-clining reserves graph and a holding debts graph-well that was enough. So the counting was \"one,\" and as I looked a little further I got \"two\" and then as I looked a little further I got a \"three\" and a \"four\" and a \"five\" and a \"six.\" We did a handling and more outpoints showed up. Right as you are handling the thing more and more outpoints show up so there is a point where you neglect any more outpoints, you can go on as a lifetime profession finding out-points in one of these areas. It's enough. ' We have actually done something with the Data Series which has never before been done. Other data evaluation systems have to do with the reliability of the observer, which de-termines if the reported fact is a \"proper datum.\" But all of their work is done on computers and those computers are built against logic systems developed by the Greeks. But it is data, data validity of, which monitors logic. A black propaganda operation is almost totally concerned with feeding wrong data into the population and therefore the population cannot come to correct conclusions and their actions will be peculiar. There are experts in black propaganda and they're fully trained in it and they do it all the time. Back of wrong data you will normally find an impure intent. So that somebody is giv-ing you false reports is an evaluation in itself. An evaluation first requires data. The absence of data you should have would give you an evaluation. We knew something was wrong with an area because all of a sudden somebody found out they weren't sending in their reports. The absence of data is an adequate evaluation that there is something wrong. And in one such case it actually took weeks to find out what was wrong."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 4 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 176 DATA SERIES If you find the outpoint, you're into evaluating a situation. You're just looking at data-you find an outpoint, you investigate that. You find more outpoints, you go along and say, \"It's the thing that we're looking at now, what the heck. . . \" because you're obviously traveling away from the ideal scene or you've found something that went much closer to the ideal scene or something that didn't change it. You then look it over and say, \"It's this point,\" and at that moment you can figure out why this is occurring. \"Now why is this occurring?\" And that requires quite a bit of data. \"Why is this occurring?\" Therefore when you can say \"Why,\" now you can handle. What you want is the outpoint and an outpoint is a departure from the ideal scene. That tells you that there is an area to investigate and you can investigate it simply by going and finding more data and more outpoints and then as your data accumulates you can get why it's a departure. The accuracy of your Why then gives you the point which you will have to handle which is all very neat and there comes in your recommendation. This is the trick on evaluation: You have to learn what is an outpoint, what is this out-rageous thing and then that cones you down. Now you could find all kinds of little points. REVIEW Having handled the thing or having done something about it, don't be too surprised to now and then find a lot more data suddenly emerge. In fact it is almost usual now that you've started to handle something for more data to emerge. But you have to look it over. You have to say, \"Well, have I handled it? Does this data confirm our Why or doesn't it confirm our Why?\" And that's all you do with that data-it's confirmatory. Sometimes you get data after the fact, after you've taken action. That is a review of your evaluation. When the data comes in after the fact, there's another step involved here. You review the situation and all of a sudden you find out you were looking at a heck of a wrong Why. One of the first things that will tell you you operated on a wrong Why is that the stats went down-because it departed further from the ideal scene. You get injustices and that sort of thing coming out of wrong evaluations, so this is one of the reasons why you watch an evaluation in your line of country-you watch an evalua-tion after the fact. Was it true? So there's a confirmatory step which isn't mentioned in the Data Series-\"Was that the right Why?\" The Data Series does mention it's whether or not the stat goes up. But it's worse than that: \"Did you have the right Why?\" or \"Did you shoot down the wrong man?\" FAMILIARITY We have a considerable amount of technology which is administrative technology, which gives us an ideal scene, and with which we must be familiar in order to evaluate and handle. We would have to be as practiced in this as in the building of armament factories or running navies or building toy balloons or trying to get housing furnished to the great un-"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 5 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 177 DATA SERIES housed if that's what we were doing-you have to have some familiarity with the type of scene which you're handling. If you're good at this you don't go on wasting your time and energy. You find the right Why, you set it up, you make sure that it does get set up-but there's nothing more you have to do with it and then that's that. Sometimes that takes quite a while but note that if you're im-mediately pressing down this Why all the rest of the way and you go on past the point where you corrected it-the thing is corrected-now you're handling a no-situation. If you didn't have evaluation you would find yourself handling no-situations and ne-glecting tough situations and not taking advantage of good situations. CLOUDING UP A SITUATION Occasionally you'll find a scene wherein a person's or area's PR is greater to him than his production-PR, personal PR, means more than production. And that is a characteristic of a suppressive. He'll fog the situation up with big PR about how good it is so it can't be handled. THE WHY You have to know when you don't have a Why. It is very, very important to know you don't have a Why. The end product of your evaluation could be said to be \"What do we do about this?\" In other words, your recommendation could be said to be the end product. Actually that's a short circuit. As far as your investigation and your data analysis is concerned your first target, the Why, if skipped will defeat the end product of your evaluation. If that Why is found then you can handle. A Why is just this: It is the reason there has been a departure or closer approach to or an exceeding of the ideal scene. What will defeat you continuously is trying to find Whys in no-situations. You won't find a Why. If you can't find a Why readily then you can possibly suspect that you have a no-situation. A Why, by essence, is something you can do something about. You have to have a recommended action on top of the Why. The Why is something which departed from, the reason it departed from or the reason why it bettered the ideal scene or got closer to it. It is a Why you can use and which will bring you a better scene. Therefore the definition of a Why is: It must be something which will permit you to bring about a better scene-not necessarily bring about the ideal scene. You might actually have a better scene than the ideal scene. We've described the ideal scene as so and so and all of a sudden a Why suddenly emerges which actually makes the ideal scene look pale.

That'd mean one had a turned agent or an agent that wasn't working. In other words, it isn't meaningless, it's not something you discard into the wastebasket. Now a good data collection and evaluation officer doesn't always discard this. He says, \"Well, it's false data so therefore it's probably been taken over by the enemy\" and he does make some sort of hit at it. But there are other outpoints that they would never have noticed. \"A datum is OK. . . \" this is the general think-not just of the generals but this is general intelligence think. \"Of the data we receive, a great deal of it is not useful because it doesn't come from reliable observ-ers.\" Well that's a hell of an outpoint in itself. If an enemy battleship was seen on the coast it wouldn't matter who saw it-intelligence organizations would not pick it up unless it had been observed by a trained officer. \"The town could not have been shelled because no reliable ob-server put a report in-there was no artilleryman to tell us whether or not. . . .\" So our system doesn't begin with \"The Slobovians are building 85,000 Panzer tanks, and that's by a reliable observer because Agent 462 has given us factual reports in the past and it's confirmed by aerial observation and satellite pictures. . . .\" So what! The intelligence would be \" Why are the Slobovians building this many Panzer tanks? Now, is this a lot more Panzer tanks than Slobovians normally build?\" because maybe Slobovians go in for a lot of building Panzer tanks so they can call them T-something-or-other and say they were invented in Slobograv. Why? And we right away have a new brand of intelligence-Why? Why are they building these Panzer tanks? One is the fact that they're building these Panzer tanks, is that an outpoint? Well, is it a lot more Panzer tanks than they have built before? Is it a lot less? Did they build a million a year and are only building 200,000 a year now? Now the officer evaluating this hasn't any Why, he hasn't anything so he makes the supposition that the Slobovians are now easing off. \"Yeah, well general, the Slobovians are now easing off.\" \"Yes, Mr. President, the Slobovians are now easing off and everything is going to be fine.\" The fool! What's the Why? Where's the Why? He assumed something-he didn't investigate further. He didn't look all over the place and find a whole lot of political or such ramifications and add it all up and so forth. Now, had he known about it he would have looked from that data to more outpoints and he would have found something or other-building the tanks for Bongoland so that they could knock out their neighboring country. Why? Why? Because they have a contract with Bongoland to furnish them with tanks. He could've found something like that. You get these unwarranted conclusions because they don't have the mechanism of ask-ing \"Why?\" and they don't investigate it until they have an adequate Why that explains it. When you've got a Why you can handle."},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 7 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 179 DATA SERIES THE CHANGE One more tip on this whole scene. If you can't find the Why, you revert. 1 learned this about life out of plant research. 1 found out that you went back to the point of major change in a greenhouse or a garden and corrected it the second you saw the plants dying. You re-quired, then, a logging of everything that was done. If you had a log of everything that was done you could get the date and the change. You knew the date they started to wilt so what change was around the vicinity of that date. And you inevitably and invariably found a huge change had taken place. Not a small one, and the tip is that if all else fails, why just go back to your major change and you can do that by stats, go to major change, and so on. You won't always be right but you're operating on a general Why-there was a change. Every once in a while you'll be scattering around trying to find this. This works in almost all situations to some degree, what change was there. It has a li-ability. It tends to wipe out improvements. If you go back to the point of high stuff all the time, all the time, all the time, you're pegging yourself into a pattern where, as a matter of fact, there might have been better patterns. There might have been a better Why in there than just a change of pattern. NEW WHY Once in a while you'll have found a Why and handled that, but find it keeps slipping out again. For example, an org having to be told to keep in its FP No. 1. FP No. I resulted from an evaluation of financial difficulties. That was a Why at one time and has since become a standard action-but where you keep having to say to an area \"Get your FP No. I in\"-now why do you have to keep getting in FP No. P The Why is not that FP No. I is out-we have gotten that in as a practiced action. Why does it keep sliding out in this area? There could be several things actually. If you have to keep saying \"Get in C/S Series 25 so that you do have a D of P so that people do come in and are invoiced and so forth,\" you are obviously running into a Why of why something keeps sliding out. WHAT IS A RECOMMENDATION What is a recommendation? Actually-usually-it would be recommended if somebody else were going to execute it. You have a recommended program and then from a recom-mended program you have an executed program, so at that moment you shifted your hat. You're no longer an evaluator, you're an executor or an executive. If your evaluations, that wind up in Whys that wind up in recommendations, are going to autonomously function-that is to say, singly and by itself function-without regard to any other entity or activity, the next thing you know you're going to have fourteen or fifteen pro-grams which are in direct collision which will produce sufficient confusion to reduce the stats. Then you, yourself, will wonder if you've found the right Why because it didn't work. Whereas the reason could be entirely different. The reason is your recommendation was in"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 8 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 180 DATA SERIES collision with other Whys and recommendations and so operated to block other actions which were vital to the continuous operation of an activity. You can kill your own recommendation. If you were in a position where you were going to independently of other evaluators execute all your actions, you might wind up with a mess-you've got your neck out as an evaluator. The essence of a recommendation is \"agreed-upon\" and after there is a recom-mendation, there is an \"agreed-upon\" before there is execution. An agreed-upon action means that you'd have to agree with other bodies of data which people had-not their personality-other bodies of data. If you have data which is contrary to an action which is being proposed, you could be put in a position of canceling or trying to cancel or recommending a cancellation of a senior's order. Therefore one has to have \"agreed-upon\" before execution. When you are collecting data you have a torrent of data coming in. You are collecting data, collecting data, collecting data, collecting data. If that data is not evaluated, it is useless. It is just a useless expense. The only way that data is of any value at all is if evaluations are done on it. Any independent order given without the benefit of the other evaluations would be a risk. It isn't agreed upon person to person, it's agreed upon data to data. The only agreement would be on whether there is a situation or a no-situation, a good situation or a bad situation or a no-situation. There'd have to be agreement on that point and there would have to be an agreement on the Why. Only then could you get a coordinated recommendation. EVALUATE You've got to do evaluations. If you don't do evaluations you'll be insufficiently in-formed to be a competent agreer or disagreer. You'll be insufficently informed to be suffi-ciently efficient to get the show on the road. Take advantage of the tremendous volumes of data which come in and, by doing evaluation, provide a sufficient running record of any and all existing situations in your line of country so that there is a general view of what is going on so that the data can be looked at, looked up and one is sufficiently informed so that he can make efficient judgments-and that will decrease the amount of work done on this and that, that doesn't really handle anything. And it amounts to fewer orders which can then be enforced. It amounts to prosperity because one of the Whys we find on occasion is that there are too many orders drifting around which haven't been executed. One winds up operating on somewhat of a jammed communica-tion line just jammed by volume. The guy that's reading all this stuff is out there and he's got noise and he's got this and they've got bill collectors and he's got something else and so on. He never has time to read it. He doesn't know what the situation is and so forth. One could also, without proper evaluation, easily issue an order into an area with a hidden Why-which could destroy it."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 9 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 181 DATA SERIES And the speed of action determines the degree of loss-and that is a rule.

You can take a stat book of an org and look over its GDSes and know their interrelationship and find the outpoint, and then from that outpoint you will know what part of the org's folder to read. If you are doing evaluations by reading the whole folder, you're being silly. You're not interested in that. You're interested in this out-point, because that's your first outpoint. Your first outpoint usually occurs in stats. One outpoint, from stats, was tremendous quantities of bulk mail being mailed at vast cost after the stats had been brought up by regging, and then the stats collapse. That was the first oddity that was noticed from some Dissem stats. So it was a stat oddity. They were busy regging and they made a lot of money, and then they spent it on bulk mail and went broke. Because there was a stat oddity here. It meant the GI did not match the bulk mail. So it's an outpoint. It's inconsistent. Contradictory. Something's false. So right there, you're looking at a great big cracking outpoint. One or the other of those facts is a lie, or something's wrong. And we find out the real outpoint underlying it is wrong target. It's just number of pieces being sent out. They were mailing out fliers several times a week – sending scraps and calling it bulk mail. Now just the fact that an org's stats are down is an outpoint. Having found a downstat you look to see if the org ever did make money? If it was ever affluent. Just taking it from the standpoint of GI, was this org ever affluent? If the org was ever affluent, it must have been doing something right so you've got something that ap-proximates its ideal scene. You haven't approached data files yet. That's why stats are separate from the data files. LOCATING A COMPARATIVE So here's two conditions: (1) the stats are down, and (2) you can't evaluate one thing, as you learn in the Data Series, unless you have a comparative thing. You have to compare it with something. So you can find a period when their stats were up. You find out that in July of 1969 Kokomo was really booming. It had nice climbing stats and they went up and up and up and up and up. And that rise started on the 6th of June. What did they do? In May and June of 69? Those are the two folders you want. Anything you"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"DATE CONFIDENCE 2 HCO PL 17.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 184 DATA SERIES can find out about that org of May/June 69. That gives you something dimly resembling an ideal scene. It isn't the ideal scene, but it is certainly an upstat scene. That gives you a com-parative. If you were hot you would use your telex lines to fill in the missing holes. For in-stance, if you don't understand something, or if it looked like they moved in 1970 and you can't find out locally, and you don't seem to know whether or not they didlocation seems to be something important here – you could send a telex to somebody who might know and say, \"Where were you located in June of 69? Where was this org located? Can you find out from anybody?\" It might be important you see. This is just a collection of a little bit more data. You know that the org was doing something, at that time, that it isn't doing now. I did just this when I wrote the PL \"Selling and Delivering Auditing.\" I looked back when HGCs were really making the money and wrote that PL. This PL is in use in one org and they're really going to town. They're using the same system. A guy comes in to sign up, they say, \"No you can't sign up for one intensive, thank you, you'll have to buy seven,\" or something. So he does, he pays the money on the barrelhead. That PL comes out of a com-parative – a comparative of HGCs not selling much auditing and having a hard time doing so, and what they were doing in an earlier period. So, when doing an evaluation (1) look at your stats, (2) find your outpoint in the stats, (3) find some comparative – find some period of affluence for the org, if you can, to give you some ideal scene for that org. That requires something of a pluspoint evaluation. Now you can do your outpoint evaluation. Because you've already got the outpoint, you don't have to read 8,752 folders. ETHICS SITUATION A while back, I asked the Data Bureau for the folders of a particular downstat org. The first folder came up, that wasn't even a complete month's folder. I looked through the folder, read scraps of what I was reading, picked out the reports I wanted. Scanned them. Pulled the outpoints out of them. Counted up the outpoints as to where they were going. And the thing just fell apart. The CO was unaware of the fact that Personnel was letting him down. That was their admin Why. And obviously the CO had to take that person in there off. And obviously there was something wrong with this CO. Now every eval done on that org since is grooving on straight down that same Why. We've tried to make orders, and we've tried to do this and we've tried to do that. But now an ethics situation has developed out of the thing. We got the admin Why all right. But an ethics situation developed as we tried to get this in. And notice that the ethics situation develops when you try to get in the Admin or Tech why. In another area the ethics situation developed to such a degree that it then emerged – after an observation mission, after a handling was done and orders were issued – that they did not execute a single one of them. They were told to revert. They did not. Therefore an ethics Why was looked for. Now I've just found out why people can't put in ethics. They don't know investigatory tech, and possibly in some cases their own ethics are out. If you put their own ethics in, they"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"DATE CONFIDENCE 3 HCO PL 17.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 185 DATA SERIES will get in ethics further. The reason they assign broad conditions and the reason there are so many Comm Evs is they don't know how to investigate. WHO WHEN Someone was given an evaluation to do and had been on that for five days. I kept ask-ing all this time – where's this evaluation? People must think I'm rushing them. Evaluators are slow because the evaluation is not being done in this sequence: (1) stats, (2) who was on where. I gave an order to an evaluator to find out exactly when did a CO of an org come to Flag, and when did this person go back, because that would give you a stat comparison. That was how I found this person was the man-of-all-work and the scooting genius of that org. Now you're talking about ethics. It's the police action called date coincidence. It's how you locate geniuses and murderers. Body found in swamp. Her cousin arrived in town on Tues-day. Body found on Wednesday. Guy departed on Thursday. That's all the police need. That's called date coincidence. That's old time investigatory tech. It's still with us. So, when were they gone out of the org, and when did they arrive back in the org, and'what happened during that period of time? Important! In the case of this particular CO, I found out that two other execs could leave the org and return and nothing happened – but when the CO left, the roof fell in, the front steps col-lapsed under everybody, and the staff went on vacation. I traced this down and I found out that this CO would run around the org wearing hats in rotation. She dived into Tech and wore the Tech Sec hat for a while, and then she dived into another area, and she wore that hat for a while, and the stats would go up. In other words, she supported that area by punching one area at a time. That was the way she was operating. So if she was all over the org like that, her obvious post was D/CO. We put her on that post, and the org has done well ever since. Now that's a sort of ethics action in reverse. That's looking for who really pushes it. You don't just keep on looking for tigers. Tigers are probably more numerous than geniuses. But you could find that certain people have a vast effect on stats. This is how you evaluate a personnel scene. In another org, a guy took over and the place has been crashed ever since and it was right square on the stats. There is your most obvious ethics investigation by stats. When you don't know, you've got to send an investigatory mission and it's got to be run well. Otherwise they just wind up shooting all the people that the staff complain about. If you don't operate on a comparison every time – comparison admin Why, compari-son on the stats, ethics comparisons – if you're trying to operate on a single datum, that single datum won't buy you any pie. Because it has nothing to compare with. SUMMARY What the Data Bureau gives us is experience. And that is huge files full of experience, but you've got to recognize what you're reading. You don't read everything! If you do you're"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"DATE CONFIDENCE 4 HCO PL 17.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 186 DATA SERIES omitting an analysis of the GDSes and an analysis of who went on where. At a good time and a bad time. What are you looking for? You're looking for the stat – look at your GDSes (this is for your admin Whys), tells you the big outpoint, tells you what information you're looking for in the files – and you're only interested in that information. You start counting up that type of information and see where it lands, and the Why will practically jump out at you out of the folder. It is so easy! It just leaps right out. But you have to know what you're looking at. In writing up one eval, an evaluator verbally gave me more valuable data than she had put into the eval. She was quoting reports. All you want to do is quote the steps of your inves-tigation. The Why has got to be specific. If a Why is insufficiently specific, it just can't be op-erated. There's an admin Why, which is the normal one that you're trying to handle. There'll be an admin or tech Why and below that there'll be an ethics Why and above that there'll be a bright idea. You have a criterion when you've got your evaluation all done, your handling has got to be bright – it's got to be a bright idea, that will actually drive those stats up – and some-thing which can be operated. And if you do an evaluation that cannot be operated at this stage of the game, you're just wasting your time. Look at your resources. What can you do with what you've got? While you improve what you've got. It will all have to be done by a gradi-ent. So the worse off things are the brighter you have to be. When you do evaluations, you've got to be able to operate the resulting actions. If you write something that can't be operated nothing will happen. That at once tells you whether you have a good evaluation or a bad evaluation. Do your evaluations in such a way that they are dead on – bang! bang! bang! – and then, that being the case, they have got to be something that can be operated. And the next thing you know your stats will go up. Compiled from LRH taped confer-ence to Staff Aides \"Current and Future Operations Actions\" 7205TC 18SO L.

We can cause stats at will. External actions don't affect them. A newspaper can write reams of entheta and it doesn't affect our stats at all. We get good publicity-it doesn't affect our stats. It's totally internal. The public demand is apparently exactly as great as we put the wherewithal in their hands with which to demand-apparently exactly proportional. You get as great a response as you require. Therefore, the more efficient your org is, the greater response you will get. It's that elementary. The test of an evaluator or executive is: \"Can you get your org to do a constructive thing at once without any flashback or any nonsense, and will it occur in such a way as to increase stats promptly? If so, you're a good administrator. If you can't do that, we have all kinds of paint to scrape.\" It's just that: The guy can produce an effect or he can't. And if you run a managing body that way, all of a sudden the staff will get happy and cheerful producing effects; everything will be fine-because they'll become at cause. That is the essence of hatting. The person can then come up to cause and he'll get sane, productive and cheerful. Actually, it takes a very able guy to do an administrative line. A ditchdigger has to have a solid line of his arm and a shovel, and that's as far as he can produce an effect. That's why he's a ditchdigger. Now for a guy to produce an effect at 7,000 miles without any solid beam-he has to be right on the ball. He has to know his business."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"EVALUATION AND PROGRAMS 2 HCO PL 18.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 188 DATA SERIES SPEED OF EVALUATION There was once a situation in an org which was very interesting. Apparently the ED was stopping the reports of the LRH Comm and Flag Rep, so no one was about to find out what was going on in that org. But if the manager had been on the ball, all he would have had to do was to look at that data file and find those reports missing and know that there was something wrong-and it would have been detected a long time before. What you're up against is that most of your evaluation is on omission, and the toughest outpoint for anybody who is not familiar with the scene to recognize is an omission. The speed of recognizing outpoints determines the speed with which one can evaluate. You wonder why it takes people so long to evaluate. It is simply that they are too slow in recognizing an outpoint. The inability to recognize an outpoint is reasonableness. It's that thing, reasonableness. We've been talking about it for years. That's just the in-ability to recognize an outpoint. There was a fellow out in the field saying \"I think we have done all right in the past\"-meaning \"without the Data Series\"-\"in our thinking and planning.\" He didn't think he had to take a Data Series course or something. Whereas I was literally getting rivers of out-points from him and his area. He didn't recognize them as such. Well, what he didn't appreciate is that this is a brand new way of thinking. Man prides himself on being logical so that he has never based any system on illogic-except humor. You have to learn to think backwards-you learn to think backwards, and boy can you think for-wards. It's like a dichotomy, positive-negative. If everybody omits the negative all the time, they never get to the positive. A lot of people are on a stuck flow of being sensible and sane-and that winds up in stupidity. So they get reasonable. Their confront of evil isn't up to it-basically, their confront of outpoints. The ability to recognize outpoints will exactly monitor the speed of evaluation and the ability to handle the scene. An evaluator cannot say, when he hasn't received any reports for 21/2 months, that he doesn't know what to do because he hasn't received any reports . . . he'd better be able to rec-ognize an omitted report when he sees one and that there is a situation and he had better take action to remedy that situation NOW.

A Why is findable to such a situation. That's probably an ethics scene. But you still will find a Why. You always find a Why for the situation. In other words, he's in a personal situation of some kind or another. He might be able to function, himself, as a junior or he might not-but for a guy to sit there with completely idle staff members and not notice it, with their areas wrapped around a telegraph pole-quite reprehensible. In investigating one inactive Esto, I found out she was operating under an order that she was not to Bait and Badger until she was trained on it-and there were probably many other things she \"was not permitted to do.\" She accepted an illegal order not to do certain Esto actions. Found out one, probably if we had investigated further, why we would find more. In the first place, if anybody has read the Esto Series, he'd find out that you are an Esto (it says it right in the beginning) and that's it. It doesn't matter if the guy has studied it or not studied it, he's an Esto and he's supposed to do the job. So it was a violent policy violation as well as keeping someone from doing her job. EXPANSION PROGRAM An expansion program is for getting an org built. It's based on an evaluation for that org. There is a way you could go about this. Suppose you wrote Kokomo and said, \"What should be done about Kokomo?\" You get a bunch of answers from the whole staff-compulsory answer, not a couple of guys. Evaluate from that what their level and tone and that sort of thing is. And you could then form up, based squarely on policy and forming the org, an expansion program. The expansion program is actually a very basic org rudiment function, but which would be adapted to that org, and within the reality of that org. Highly specialized-and it's terminable. The person executing it, when he gets through with the thing-that's the end of that one. Now let's get another entirely new program. You could actually do it on a blanket basis where each org was treated as an individual org. Then you'd know what policies to get in in this org. You just ask them, \"What should be done about Kokomo?\" \"What should be done about Keokuk?\" they'll tell you. Then you could go down to your Data Files and do an evaluation for the expansion program. You can thus use knowledge of the org's troubles and the staff interviews as the basis for an evaluation. There has to be an immediate organization for production, according to the Prod-Org system. However, long-range, long-term organization actions have got to be done by some-body because the Prod-Org system tears an org to ribbons. There's got to be somebody putting an org there who's not directly involved in that immediate scene. He's got to put it there adroitly enough so that what he puts there expands its production so as to pay for the addi-tional organization."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"EVALUATION AND PROGRAMS 4 HCO PL 18.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 190 DATA SERIES It's quite neat, that type of program. As they get executed along the line, they wind up with an increased production. Every three or four targets that are done, why all of a sudden you've got more production. There could be some good long-range targets like \"Get 30 audi-tors\" -probably could take a year or more to exhaust such a target. But note-such an expansion program wouldn't go on your production program execu-tion lines at all. Your long-term organizational actions go on another line than your immediate production actions. PRODUCTION PROGRAM Such a program is something concerned with handling an immediate situation which had to do with immediate production. Right now. Such as: Why: Division 6 doing all the sign-ups for Division 2. Handling: 1. Get a Registrar on post in Division 2, right now. 2. Then get an Advanced Scheduling Registrar on post immediately. 3. Then get three letter writing Registrars on post at once. 4. Get them functioning, production, immediately. It's a \"right now\" scene. A short-term production program ought to expire within 30 days-it becomes staledated within 30 days. Some of them become staledated within 10 or 15 days. So you need a very hot, very fast line of very quick compliance. It already takes quite a while for the reports to get to the files through the mail so that you know what the situation is. You're already 10 days behind the gun-10 days, 2 weeks late. And then it's going to take maybe another week to get it assembled-to know that there is a situation and evaluate it and get it through and ready. So you're operating on about a 3-week average comm lag. You have to make up for it at the other end of the line-get this thing done now-now-now. And you've got to have someone there to get it done. The eval probably will not save the bacon of an org for the next two years. It will be lucky if it keeps the stats bolstered for six weeks-then something else will go out. By that time, why Div 6 will have become completely confused because it is not now being permitted to do all the registration of the org, so therefore it would have gone out of existence, and the Registrar would have left, so now we would have to evaluate and handle Division 6. It goes tick-tock. From one situation to another. There are different types of evaluation. There'd be a divisional evaluation. There could even be a departmental evaluation. There could be an org evaluation. An executive stratum evaluation.

Normally speaking and in the-ory, that would be possible. But in fact a competent evaluation would find the imbalance be-tween divisions. The operative word is current evaluation. You could push a current evaluation. How wide is present time? Well, that's a matter of judgment, but a year-old evaluation would be pretty much not current. FIRST TARGET Your first program target must always be a production target-but you can't, in actual fact, write a pure production target. It would be impossible to write a pure production target because somebody would have to do it, and the moment that you have somebody there to do it you have organization. So there is a certain amount of organization that comes into it. If I were evaluating an org right now, say its Dept 7, 1 would have to include in it as its second target, beefing up Dept 7. First target would be for Dept 7 to do anything it could to handle its collections. And the second target would be to beef up that department forthwith, bang bang! Otherwise the production would not continue. It would break. So, as mentioned earlier, there has to be immediate organization for production. TERMINABLE TARGETS Now how do you like a target like this: \"Maintain friendly relations with the environ-ment.\" How do you like that target? It is utterly completely not a doingness target. It isn't a target at all! Now if it said: \"Call on so and so, and so and so and make them aware of your pres-ence . . .\" and so forth, it could have a done on it. Targets should be term inable-doable, finishable, completable. REPEATING TARGETS There is such a thing as a repeating target. You can accomplish it many times-it's like when you do org rudiments. Every time they do one of those targets a compliance is added to the compliance stat. This is especially true of some targets in expansion programs.

Pgm was almost fully done. Finance got bugged. Org crashed 22 August 74. 3. 22 July eval. By 15 Aug stats had gone up. 4. 21 July 74 eval but not started on until 26 Sept 74 as Study Manuals were delayed on which eval depended. Org stats after eval began to be done went up and by the end of Oct hit highest ever almost across the boards. 5. 20 July 74 eval. Started on 10 Aug 74. Half-done. By 24 Oct stats went up. 6. 23 July 74 issue. Bugged. Not completed. Stats went up first couple weeks. Org crashed 24 Oct 74. (Eval was also cross-ordered by removal of CO.) 7. 23 July 74. Three-quarters done. Stats went up. Thus 5 out of 7 of the above evals were successful. The two that failed were obviously insufficiently broad as other matters got in the way of them. The evaluator could not have had the real situation. Means not enough preliminary work to find the area that should have been evaluated.

The two poor evals in the 7 just weren't watched fast enough by the evaluators. You cancel a failing eval fast and do a better one.

In each of these cases, personnel whose personnel folders had not been looked into and whose ethics files had not been examined were concerned. In the last one, a person was being proposed for promotion to a high executive position in an org while the stats for the past week demonstrated that his area was seriously downstat, the matter even being men-tioned on the current battle plans. It is not how much you read, it is where you look. In the Data Files, if one is examin-ing the statistics of a division, one does not read all manner of reports from other divisons and other personnel. One has to be selective and right target to get his data. Statistics (as fully outlined in statistical management PLs) are the dominant factors in an evaluation, and most evaluations begin on the basis of statistics which are either suffi-ciently high to merit examination so as to be reinforced, or are too low to be viable. These read in conjunction with other statistics usually give you an org situation. When one discovers a series of outpoints, there is generally a situation underlying them. From the statistical trail, or the gross outpoint trail, one can locate a situation, The situation is then evaluated by looking for and finding the exact data which applies to that situation. From this one can find his Why, and once this is found he can get a bright idea. A program can then ensue which terminatedly handles that situation. Evaluations cannot be done in any other way. The moment that you apply humanoid think to the subject of evaluation, you lose. In the last evaluation I looked over, the evaluator obviously had not gone to personnel files, data files or any other files but had simply read some PR despatches written by the guy himself and had taken single-source data and decided to promote the person to the control of an area. Statistics demonstrated at once that the person's stats were down, that practice evalua-tions done on that very org existed, and that the ethics and personnel files of that person would never have suggested any promotion and on the contrary would have suggested demo-"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"SUPER EVALUATION 2 HCO PL 20.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 196 DATA SERIES tion. This would have made a very dangerous situation in the area, would have victimized a great many good people, and would have played hell with Flag statistics. Persons \"evaluating\" without having looked at the vital data concerned with their evaluation, are subject to a Court of Ethics on the charge of false evaluation. While this might be looked on some as a deterrent to evaluating at a// when evalua-tions are vital, remember that it is better to handle one person, the evaluator, than to tie up and maul a thousand people with a program based on a false Why Evaluations not only can be done but are quite magical in handling things when the evaluator knows what he is doing and when he looks for the information he needs to evaluate in the places where that information exists. It is out of correct and brilliant evaluation that high stats are made. We have superlative tools, we must use them right. Compiled from LRH OODs item 15 October 1973 \"Super Evaluation\" L.

It is vital that you examine resources when evaluating before you plunge into any han-dling, and resources belongs just above handling on the evaluation form. Resources sometimes turn out not what they seemed, so when I say \"examine re-sources\" I mean look into them searchingly. Were you ever sure that you had $50.00 in the bank and $20.00 in a teapot only to find on closer examination that you were overdrawn at the bank and the teapot contained an IOU whose signature you couldn't read? Sometimes you think you have resources you don't have even when there is total agreement on every hand that you have resources. Take for instance clerk X. It is \"common knowledge\" that he has been around \"Department 5\" for years and is a \"good clerk.\" So you make him head of the department without going down and inspecting his area. What will hap-pen to your evaluation and \"Department 511 if that undone inspection would have revealed unfiled backlogs 10 feet high, lost supplies and equipment and an office mainly used for plot-ting mutinies. This may be an extreme case but some shadow of it lies behind most failed evaluations. The evaluator just didn't examine his resources and thought he had what he didn't have. There is one type of program you can always predict will fail, it begins \"Hire a __________ or \"Recruit a __________ \" When sending a mission out on such orders you know you won't hear from them for 6 months because the program has said, in effect, \"ac-quire nonexisting resources.\" If you do an evaluation on almost any subject and omit an examination of resources and the resources section, your evaluation may lay an ostrich egg. \"Appoint Joe Blow, who is a trained Personnel Officer,\" may trip over the fact that he left the company 5 months ago and has not been heard from since. The eval will bug at this point. That is because the evaluator didn't examine resources. You sometimes have to gear down your bright idea and handling from \"Buy Wall Street\" to \"Set up a peanut vender stand on Bleaker Street.\" But the point is your evaluation will succeed where otherwise it will fail."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"EXAMINING RESOURCES 2 HCO PL 27.09.78 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 198 DATA SERIES Almost all evaluations actually have the overall goal of preserving or acquiring re-sources.

Unless one knows these types he can make serious errors on administrative lines. In the unpublished work \"Excalibur\" (most of which has been released in HCOBs, PLs and books) there was an important fundamental truth. This was Sanity is the ability to recognize differences, similarities and identities. This is also intelligence. Two or more facts or things that are totally unlike are different. They are not the same fact or same object. Two or more facts or things that have something in common with one another are similar. Two or more facts or things that have all their characteristics in common with one an-other are identical. SEMANTICS In a subject developed by Korzybski a great deal of stress is given to the niceties of words. In brief a word is NOT the thing. And an object exactly like another object is different because it occupies a different space and thus \"can't be the same object.\" As Alfred Korzybski studied under psychiatry and amongst the insane (his mentor was William Alanson White at Saint Elizabeth's insane asylum in Wash., D.C.) one can regard him mainly as the father of confusion. This work, \"general semantics,\" a corruption of semantics, (meaning really \"signifi-cance\" or the \"meaning of words\") has just enough truth in it to invite interest and just enough curves to injure one's ability to think or communicate. Korzybski did not know the formula of human communication and university professors teaching semantics mainly ended up assur-ing students (and proving it) that no one can communicate with anyone because nobody really knows what anybody else means."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 2 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 200 DATA SERIES As this \"modern\" (it was known to the Greeks, was a specialty of Sophists and was also used by Socrates) penetration into culture affects all education in the West today, it is no wonder that current communication is badly strained. Schools no longer teach basic logic. Due to earlier miseducation in language and no real education in logic much broken-down \"think\" can occur in high places. A system of thinking derived from a study of psychotics is not a good yardstick to employ in solving problems. Yet the \"thinking\" of heads of states is based on illogical and irrational rules. Populations, fortunately less \"well-educated,\" are assaulted by the irrational (kooky) \"thinking\" of governments. This \"thinking\" is faulty mainly because it is based on the faulty logic shoved off on school children. \"You must study geometry because that is the way you think\" is an idiocy that has been current for the past two or three decades in schools. I have nothing against Korzybski. But the general impact of \"General Semantics\" has been to give us stupified schoolboys who, growing up without any training in logic except general semantics are giving us problems. Increasingly we are dealing with people who have never been taught to think and whose native ability to do so has been hampered by a false \"education.\" ADMINISTRATIVE TROUBLE At once this gives an administrator trouble. Outside and inside his sphere of influence he is dealing with people who not only can't think but have been taught carefully to reach irra-tional conclusions. One can make a great deal of headway and experience a lot of relief by realizing the way things are and not getting exasperated and outraged by the absurdities that he sees being used as \"solutions.\" He is dealing with people who in school were not only not taught to think but were often taught the impossibility of thinking or communicating. This has a very vast influence on an administrator. Things that are perfectly obvious to him get so muddled when passed for decision to others that an administrator tends to go into apathy or despair. For instance it is completely logical to him that some activity must either cut its ex-penses or make more money before it goes broke. So he passes this on as an order demanding that the activity balance up its income-outgo ratio. He gets back a \"solution\" that they \"get a huge sum each week from their reserves\" so they will be \"solvent.\" The administrator feels rattled and even betrayed. What reserves? Do they have reserves? So he demands to know, has this activity been salting away reserves he knew nothing about? And he receives a solemn reply – no they don't have any reserves but they consider the administrator should just send them money! The idiocy involved here is that the \"logic\" of the persons in that activity is not up to realizing that you cannot take more out of something than is in it."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 3 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 201 DATA SERIES And the activity mentioned is not alone. Today the \"assets\" of a company are said by \"competent economists\" to be its property – good will – cash added to its debts! In short, if you have ten pennies and owe £1000 then your assets are £1000-0-10! Yes, you say, but that's crazy! And you're right. For an example of modern \"think\" the Ford Foundation is believed to have financially supported the arming of revolutionary groups so they will be dependent upon the capitalistic system and won't overthrow it even though the revolutionary group could not exist without Ford Foundation support! A war is fought and continued for years to defend the property rights of landlords against peasants although the landlords are mostly dead. Electronic computers are exported under government license and paid for by the ex-porter and shipped to an enemy who could not bomb the exporter without them in order to prevent the enemy from bombing the exporter. Yes, one says. That's treason. Not necessarily. It is the inability to think! It is the result of suppressing the native ability by false systems of \"logic.\" PROPER DEFINITIONS People who annoy one with such weird \"solutions\" do not know certain differences. Thoughts are infinitely divisible into classes of thought. In other words, in thought there are certain wide differences which are very different indeed. A Fact is something that can be proven to exist by visible evidence. An Opinion is something which may or may not be based on any facts. Yet a sloppy mind sees no difference between a Fact and somebody's opinion. In courts a psychiatrist (who is an authority) says \"Joe Doakes is crazy.\" Joe Doakes is promptly put away for ten years, tortured or killed. Yet this statement is just an Opinion uttered by somebody whose sanity is more than suspect and what's more is taken from a field \"psychiatry\" which has no basis in fact since it cannot cure or even detect insanity. A vast number of people see no difference at all in Facts and Opinions and gaily ac-cept both or either as having equal validity. An administrator continually gets opinions on his lines which are masquerading as facts. If opinion instead of facts is used in solving problems then one comes up with insane solutions. Here is an example: By opinion it is assumed there are 3000 pounds of potatoes avail-able in a crop. An order is therefore written and payment ($300 at 100 a pound) is made for"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 4 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 202 DATA SERIES the crop. One sack of potatoes is delivered containing 100 pounds. That sack was the fact. Loss is 2900 pounds of potatoes. An administrator runs into this continually. He sends somebody to find an electric po-tato peeler \"just like the one we had.\" He gets back a paring knife because it is the same. The administrator orders a similar type of shirt and gets overcoats. The administrator feels he is dealing with malice, sharp practice, laziness, etc., etc. He can lose all faith in honesty and truthfulness. The actual reason he is getting such breakdowns is Sanity is the ability to recognize differences, similarities and identities. The people with whom he is dealing can't think to such a degree that they give him in-sane situations. Such people are not crazy. Their thinking is suppressed and distorted by mod-ern \"education.\" \"You can't really communicate to anybody because the same word means different things to everyone who uses it.\" In other words, all identities are different. A basic law is usually confused by students with an incidental fact. This is conceiv-ing a similarity when one, the law, is so far senior to the fact that one could throw the fact away and be no poorer. When a student or an employee cannot use a subject he studies or cannot seem to un-derstand a situation his disability is that basics are conceived by him to be merely similar to incidental remarks. The law, \"Objects fall when dropped,\" is just the same to him as the casual example \"a cat jumped off a chair and landed on the floor.\" Out of this he fixedly keeps in mind two \"things he read\" – objects fall when dropped, a cat jumped off a chair and landed on the floor. He may see these as having identical value whereas they are similar in subject but widely dif-ferent in value. You give this person a brief write-up of company policy. \"Customers must be satisfied with our service,\" begins the write-up. Of course that's a law because it has been found to be catastrophic to violate it. On down the page is written, \"A card is sent to advise the customer about the order.\" The employee says he understands all this and goes off apparently happy to carry out his duties. A few weeks later Smith and Co. write and say they will do no more business with you. You hastily try to find out why. If you're lucky enough to track it down, you find the shipping clerk sent them a card saying, \"Your order was received and we don't intend to fill it.\" You have the clerk in. You lay down the facts. He looks at you glumly and says he's sorry. He goes back and pulls another blooper. You threaten to fire him. He's now cost the company $54,000. He is contrite. All he understands is that life is confusing and that for some mysterious reason you are mad at him, probably because you are naturally grouchy."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 5 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 203 DATA SERIES What he doesn't know is what the administrator seldom taps. It isn't that he doesn't know \"company policy.\" It's that he doesn't know the difference between a law and a com-ment! A law of course is something with which one thinks. It is a thing to which one aligns other junior facts and actions. A law lets one predict that if all objects fall when not sup-ported, then of course cats, books and plates can be predicted in behavior if one lets go of them. As the employee hasn't a clue that there is any difference amongst laws, facts, opinions, orders or suggestions he of course cannot think as he doesn't have anything to which he can align other data or with which to predict consequences. He doesn't even know that company policy is, \"Too many goofs equals fired.\" So when he does get sacked he thinks \"somebody got mad at him.\" If you think this applies only to the \"stupid employee,\" know that a whole government service can go this way. Two such services only promoted officers to high rank if they sank their own ships or got their men killed! Social acceptability was the only datum used for pro-motion and it followed that men too socially involved (or too drunk) of course lost battles. An organization, therefore, can itself be daffy if it has a concept that laws and facts and opinions are all the same thing and so has no operating policies or laws. Whole bodies of knowledge can go this route. The laws are submerged into incidental facts. The incidental facts are held onto and the laws never pointed up as having the special value of aligning other data or actions. An administrator can call a conference on a new building, accidentally collect people who can't differentiate amongst laws, facts, opinions or suggestions – treating them of equal value – and find himself not with a new building but a staggering financial loss. As the world drifts along with its generations less and less taught and more and more suppressed in thinking, it will of course experience more and more catastrophes in economics, politics and culture and so go boom. As all this influences anyone in any organization it is an important point. PERSONNEL In despair an administrator enters the field of choosing personnel by experience with them. He embraces a very cruel modern system that fires at once anybody who flubs. Actually he is trying to defend himself against some hidden menace he has never de-fined but which haunts him day by day. The majority of people with whom he deals-and especially governments-cannot con-ceive of 1. Differences, 2. Similarities, 3. Identities."},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"THE ANATOMY OF THOUGHT 6 HCO PL 26.4.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 204 DATA SERIES As a result they usually can't tell a Fact from an Opinion (because all differences are probably identities and all identities are different and all similarities are imaginary). A=A=A We have a broad dissertation on this in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health as it affects insane behavior. Everything is everything else. Mr. X looks at a horse knows it's a house knows it's a school teacher. So when he sees a horse he is respectful. When anyone in an org is sanely trying to get things done he sometimes feels like he is spinning from the replies and responses he gets to orders or requests. That's because observa-tion was faulty or think was faulty at the other end of the comm line. As he tries to get things done he begins to realize (usually falsely) that he is regarded as odd for getting impatient. THE WAYS OUT There are several ways out of this mess. a. One is to issue orders that demand close observation and execution. Issuance of clear orders provides no faintest opportunity of error, assumption or default. b. Another is to demand that an order is fully understood before it is executed. c. A third is to be sure one totally understands any order one receives before one goes off to do it or order it done. d. One is to deal only in orders and leave nothing to interpretation. e. Another is to pretest personnel on one's lines for ability to observe and conceive dif-ferences, similarities and identities. f. The effective way is to get the personnel processed. g. A useful way is to educate people with drills until they can think. h. Another way is to defend one's areas by excluding insofar as possible adjacent areas where crippled think is rampant. i. A harsh way is to plow under zones whose irrationality is destructive (such as psychia-try). THOUGHT CONFUSIONS Wherever you have thought confusions (where Fact = Opinion, where Suggestion = Orders, where an observation is taken as a direction, etc., etc., etc.) an administrator is at seri-ous risk.

The U.S. just returned to price freezes. The need for this action is debatable. Mr. Nixon in his program of price freezes Included a blanket 60-day freeze on retail prices, but not on wages, rents, or dividends. Raw agriculture products es-caped controls, but food and other farm items were frozen after that stage. The present state of the public mind could do with a morale boost and some im-provement should come about if only because some action has been taken by the President. Because prices have been frozen, there will be few, if any demands for wage in-creases. Further, there will be a less feverish pace of inflation in the economy. Though the freeze is designed for a limited duration only, it will produce all around improvements and at worst it could produce only limited damage. c.

LOGIC means the subject of reasoning. Some in ages past have sought to label it a science. But that can be discarded as pretense and pompousness. If there were such a \"science\" men would be able to think. And they can't. The term itself is utterly forbidding. If you were to read a text on logic you would go quite mad trying to figure it out, much less learn how to think. Yet logic or the ability to reason is vital to an organizer or administrator. If he cannot think clearly he will not be able to reach the conclusions vital to make correct decisions. Many agencies, governments, societies, groups, capitalize upon this lack of logic and have for a very long time. For the bulk of the last 2,000 years the main western educator – the Church – worked on the theory that Man should be kept ignorant. A population that is unable to think or reason can be manipulated easily by falsehoods and wretched causes. Thus logic has not been a supported subject, rather the opposite. Even western schools today seek to convince students they should study geometry as \"that is the way they think.\" And of course it isn't. The administrator, the manager, the artisan and the clerk each have a considerable use for logic. If they cannot reason they make costly and time-consuming errors and can send the entire organization into chaos and oblivion. Their stuff in trade are data and situations. Unless they can observe and think their way through, they can reach wrong conclusions and take incorrect actions. Modern Man thinks mathematics can serve him for logic and most of his situations go utterly adrift because of this touching and misplaced confidence. The complexity of human problems and the vast number of factors involved make mathematics utterly inadequate. Computers are at best only servomechanisms (crutches) to the mind. Yet the chro-mium-plated civilization today has a childish faith in them. It depends on who asks the ques-tions and who reads the computer's answers whether they are of any use or not. And even then their answers are often madhouse silly."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"LOGIC 2 HCO PL 11.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 214 DATA SERIES Computers can't think because the rules of live logic aren't fully known to Man and computer builders. One false datum fed into a computer gives one a completely wrong an-swer. If people on management and work lines do not know logic the organization can go adrift and require a fabulous amount of genius to hold it together and keep it running. Whole civilizations vanish because of lack of logic in its rulers, leaders and people. So this is a very important subject. UNLOCKING LOGIC I have found a way now to unlock this subject. This is a breakthrough which is no small win. If by it a formidable and almost impossible subject can be reduced to simplicity then correct answers to situations can be far more frequent and an organization or a civiliza-tion far more effective. The breakthrough is a simple one. By establishing the ways in which things become illogical one can then establish what is logic. In other words, if one has a grasp of what makes things illogical or irrational (or crazy, if you please) it is then possible to conceive of what makes things logical. ILLOGIC There are 5 primary ways for a relay of information or a situation to become illogical. 1. Omit a fact. 2. Change sequence of events. 3. Drop out time. 4. Add a falsehood. 5. Alter importance. These are the basic things which cause one to have an incorrect idea of a situation. Example: \"He went to see a communist and left at 3:00 A.M.\" The omitted facts are that he went with 30 other people and that it was a party. By omitting the fact one alters the importance. This omission makes it look like \"he\" is closely connected to communism! When he isn't. Example: \"The ship left the dock and was loaded.\" Plainly made crazy by altering se-quence of events. Example: \"The whole country is torn by riots\" which would discourage visiting it in 1970 if one didn't know the report date of 1919."},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"LOGIC 3 HCO PL 11.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 215 DATA SERIES Example: \"He kept skunks for pets\" which as an added falsehood makes a man look odd if not crazy. Example: \"It was an order\" when in fact it was only a suggestion, which of course shifts the importance. There are hundreds of ways these 5 mishandlings of data can then give one a com-pletely false picture. When basing actions or orders on data which contains one of the above, one then makes a mistake. Reason depends on data. When data is faulty (as above) the answer will be wrong and looked upon as un-reasonable. There are a vast number of combinations of these 5 data. More than one (or all 5) may be present in the same report. Observation and its communication may contain one of these 5. If so, then any effort to handle the situation will be ineffective in correcting or han-dling it. USE If any body of data is given the above 5 tests, it is often exposed as an invitation to acting illogically. To achieve a logical answer one must have logical data. Any body of data which contains one or more of the above faults can lead one into il-logical conclusions. The basis of an unreasonable or unworkable order is a conclusion which is made il-logical by possessing one or more of the above faults. LOGIC Therefore logic must have several conditions: 1. All relevant facts must be known. 2. Events must be in actual sequence. 3 Time must be properly noted. 4. The data must be factual, which is to say true or valid. 5. Relative importances amongst the data must be recognized by comparing the facts with what one is seeking to accomplish or solve."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"LOGIC 4 HCO PL 11.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 216 DATA SERIES NOT KNOW One can always know something about anything. It is a wise man who, confronted with conflicting data, realizes that he knows at least one thing-that he doesn't know. Grasping that, he can then take action to find out. If he evaluates the data he does find out against the five things above, he can clarify the situation. Then he can reach a logical conclusion. DRILLS It is necessary to work out your own examples of the 5 violations of logic. By doing so, you will have gained skill in sorting out the data of a situation. When you can sort out data and become skilled in it, you will become very difficult to fool and you will have taken the first vital step in grasping a correct estimate of any situation. L.

The first is finding a datum of comparable magnitude to the subject. A single datum or subject has to have a datum or subject with which to compare it be-fore it can be fully understood. By studying and isolating the principles that make a situation illogical one can then see what is necessary to be logical. This gives us a subject that could be called \"Illogicality Testing\" or \"Irrationality Location\" but which would be better described as data analysis. For it subjects data and therefore situations to tests which establish any falsity or truth. The other breakthrough consists of the discovery that no rules of logic can be valid unless one also includes the data being used. The nearest the ancients came to this was testing the premise or basis of an argument. Trying to study logic without also having the answers to data is like describing every-thing about an engine without mentioning what fuel it runs on; or making a sentence like \"He argued about\" or \"She disliked\" without completing it. Logic concerns obtaining answers. And answers depend on data. Unless you can test and establish the truth and value of the data being used, one cannot attain right answers no matter what Aristotle may have said or what IBM may have built. The road to logic begins with ways and means of determining the value of the data to be employed in it. Without that step no one can arrive at logic. Two things that are equal to each other and to which a third is equal are all equal to one another. If A equals B and B equals C, then C equals A. Great. This is often disputed as a theorem of logic and has been ever since Aristotle said so. There is even a modern cult of non-Aristotelian logic. The facts are that the ancient theorem is totally dependent on the data used in it. Only if the data is correct does the theorem work. Lacking emphasis on the data being used, this theorem can be proven true or false at will. The philosophers point out the fallacy without ever giving emphasis to data evaluation."},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"BREAKTHROUGHS 2 HCO PL 12.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 226 DATA SERIES DATA ANALYSIS Unless you can prove or disprove the data you use in any logic system, the system it-self will be faulty. This is true of the IBM computer. It is true of CIA intelligence conclusions. It is true of Plato, Kant, Hume and your own personal computer as well. Data Analysis is necessary to any logic system and always will be. Ships run on oil, electric motors on electricity and logic runs on data. If the data being stuffed into a computer is incorrect, no matter how well a computer is planned or built or proofed up against faults you can get a Bay of Pigs. In mathematics no formula will give an answer better than the data being used in it. Valid answers may only be attained in using valid data. Thus, if the subject of data analysis is neglected or imperfect or unknown or unsus-pected as a step, then wild answers to situations and howling catastrophes can occur. If data analysis becomes itself a codified subject, regardless of what formula is going to be used, then right answers can only then be attained. THE MIND AS A COMPUTER The mind is a remarkable computer. It is demonstrable that a mind which has the wrong answers removed from it becomes brighter, IQ soars. Therefore for our purposes we will consider the mind capable of being logical. As processing improves the mind's ability to reach right answers, then we can assume for our purposes that if a person can straighten out his data he can be logical and will be logi-cal and can attain right answers to situations. The fallacy of the mind is that it can operate on wrong data. Thus if we specialize in the subject of Data Analysis we can assume that a person can attain right answers. As an administrator (and anyone else) has to reach conclusions in order to act and has to act correctly to ensure his own or his group's continued survival, it is vital that he be able to observe and conclude with minimal error. Thus we will not be stressing how to think but how to analyze that with which one thinks-which is data. This gives us the importance and use of data analysis. L.

Analyze the data, 2. Using the data thus analyzed, to analyze the situation. The way to analyze data is to compare it to the 5 primary points and see if any of those appear in the data. The way to analyze the situation is to put in its smaller areas each of the data analyzed as above. Doing this gives you the locations of greatest error or disorganization and also gives you areas of greatest effectiveness. Example: There is trouble in the Refreshment Unit. There are 3 people in the unit. Do-ing a data analysis on the whole area gives us a number of outpoints. Then we assign these to A, B and C who work in the unit and find B had the most outpoints. This indicates that the trouble in the Refreshment Unit is with B. B can be handled in various ways such as his hat, his attendance, etc. Note we analyzed the data of the main area and assigned it to the bits in the area, then we had an analyzed situation and we could handle. Example: We analyze all the data we have about the Bingo Car Plant. We assign the data thus analyzed as out (outpoints) to each function of the Bingo Car Plant. We thus pin-point what function is the worst off. We then handle that function in various ways, principally by organizing it and grooving in its executives and personnel. There are several variations. We obtain an analysis of the situation by analyzing all the data we have and as-signing the outpoint data to the areas or parts. The area having the most outpoints is the target for correction. In confronting a broad situation to be handled we have of course the problem of find-ing out what's wrong before we can correct it. This is done by data analysis followed by situa-tion analysis. We do this by grading all the data for outpoints (5 primary illogics). We now have a long list of outpoints.

EXPERIENCE The remarkable part of such an exercise is that the data analysis of the data of a period of I day compares to 3 months operating experience. Thus data and situation analysis is an instant result where experience takes a lot of time. The quality of the data analysis depends on one knowing the ideal organization and purpose on which the activity is based. This means one has to know what its activities are supposed to be from a rational or logical viewpoint. A clock is supposed to keep running and indicate time and be of practical and pleasant design. A clock factory is supposed to make clocks. It is supposed to produce enough clocks cheaply enough that are good enough to be in demand and to sell for enough to keep the place solvent. It consumes raw materials, repairs and replaces its tools and equipment. It hires workmen and executives. It has service firms and distributors. That is the sort of thing one means by ideal or theoretical structure of the clock company and its organization. Those are the rational points. From the body of actual current today data on the clock company one spots the out-points for a Data Analysis. One assigns the outpoints to the whole as a Situation Analysis. One uses his admin know-how and expertise to repair the most aberrated subsection. One gets a functioning clock factory that runs closer to the ideal. Military, political and PR situations, etc., are handled all in the same way. We call these two actions: Data Analysis Situation Analysis.

I have ordered all Dissem personnel to help clear the backlogged filing in Mimeo because as you can see, we are in need of available policy in our Org. Unfortunately, we have a major ethics situation in our Org with Mimi and Bill (two new HCO Expeditors) and it does appear that their mar-riage is breaking up. The Ethics Officer has spent all of his time this week doing Third Party interviews between the two of them. My last staff member in the Distribution Division blew this week – dear me! The new LRH Int ED for rais-ing GI is fabulous – we will begin it after we have completed my program to get our field to contribute paint to the Org for painting the Staff Room. Bye for now. b. We plan to move to new premises. The Dist Sec, who is full time on this, has three possible buildings located which look to be good as regards locations. All have lots of local foot traffic. The one I am partial to has a lovely view from the penthouse, though it is not as large as the other two. It is also much higher rent (more than our FP No. 1 can afford), but its elegance is such that it will attract us many more public and thereby increase our income. All are okay per local zon-ing laws. On the basis of all the attached data, I recommend we rent the building with the penthouse. c. As CO/Prod Off of this Class IV Service org I see no reason why this brochure on training and processing is urgently to be printed. It is a dissemination piece for orgs but I am in the book business. I have as urgent priority getting DMSMH translated into Hindu so we can expand into a new public.

We just enrolled an-other 25 students this week and our student points are the highest they have ever been. Well, yes, the other remaining 10 students have been on course for the past 2 years, but I'm in the business of making real auditors, not bums. Definitely, I have \"What is a Course PL\" in. I scratch off the checksheet every tape or HCOB or whatever it is that I don't have. Yeah, all the tape machines are busted, but that's not my responsibility – that's the hat of Student Admin, In the past year, we had 50 students off our lines. No, they didn't graduate. Ethics got them and it's HCO's hat to bring back blown students. Misunderstood word tech – what's that. Look, I'm busy. I'm taking the course along with my students. f. His neighbours have a very bad opinion of him because he comes home so late at night. Also he's a bit peculiar as he wears his hair fairly long and sports a beard. His employers, the ABC Security Company, think highly of him and say he has been employed by them for the past five years. I spoke to his bank man-ager who said his credit standing with the bank was good. He does not seem to be very sociable as he doesn't bring a lot of friends home to his room in the rooming house, and the landlady says that he hardly speaks a word to her or the other persons rooming there. He must be crazy. g. We are now holding open evenings for our Org's public, five nights a week from 8:00 until 9:00 pm. Each night a lecture is given on some interesting subject, like mysticism, fencing, poker playing, etc. After each lecture we take up a col-lection for the Org Party Fund. We haven't collected; much money because the Public Registrar doesn't know how to pull contributions from people and keeps trying to sign them up for services. I keep telling her the idea is just to pull bod-ies in the shop. Tomorrow night I'll make her ask for contributions first so she won't have any time to go off purpose. h. God is Love, Love is Blind, Ray Charles is Blind. Therefore, Ray Charles is God. i. I didn't get my Weekly Report done this week for the following reasons: a) I had a lot of liberty time to catch up on, b) something very, very urgent came up that required my undivided attention, c) I wanted to wait for the following week's data to arrive first, d) I didn't know it had to be done weekly. Please accept my sincere apologies. j. We in HCO keep very close tabs on internal security in our org. We've given all our lockable file cabinets to mimeo so their Master Copies of HCOBs and HCO PLs don't get continually ripped off. Our own Val Docs are quite safe because HCO is so security conscious. I keep them in my Pending Basket, as no one would ever dream to look for them there. We have a list of all PTS' and SPs in the org, and keep a close watch on them.

One can only guess at how they do it and looking at results wonder if it is actually done at all. Obtaining information is necessary for any analysis of data. If one obtains and analyzes some information he can get a hint of what information he should obtain in what area. By obtaining more data on that area he can have enough to ac-tively handle. Thus how one obtains information becomes a very important subject. Nations have whole mobs of reporters sent out by newspapers, radio, TV and maga-zines to collect information. Politicians go jaunting around collecting information. Whole spy networks are maintained at huge expense to obtain information. The Japanese in the first third of the 20th century had two maxims: \"Anyone can spy.\" \"Everyone must spy.\" The Germans picked this up. They had their whole populations at it. The Russian KGB numbers hundreds of thousands. CIA spends billions. MI-6 _________ well you get the idea. It is not amiss however to point out that those 2 nations that devoted the most effort to espionage (Japan and Germany) were both defeated horribly. Thus the quantity of data poured in is not any guarantee of understanding. Newspapers today are usually devoted to propaganda, not news. Politicians are striv-ing to figure out another nation's evil intentions, not to comprehend it. The basic treatise on data collection and handling used to found the US intelligence data system (\"strategic intelligence\") would make one laugh – or cry. All these elaborate (and expensive) systems of collecting information are not only use-less, they are deluding. They get people in plenty of trouble. A copy of Time magazine (US) analyzed for outpoints runs so many outpoints per page when analyzed that one wonders how any publication so irrational could continue sol-vent. And what do you know! It is going broke! Those countries that spend the most on espionage are in the most trouble. They weren't in trouble and then began to spend money. They began to spy and then got into trouble! News media and intelligence actions are not themselves bad. But irrational news me-dia and illogical intelligence activity are psychotic."},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"INFORMATION COLLECTION 2 HCO PL 15.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 240 DATA SERIES So information collection can become a vice. It can be overdone. If one had every org in a network fill out a thousand reports a week he would not ob-tain much information but he sure would knock them out of comm. There is a moderate flow of information through any network so long as it is within the capability of the comm lines and the personnel. Thus we get a rule about collecting data in administrative structures. Normal admin flows contain enough data to do a data and situation analysis. And The less data you have the more precise your analysis must be. And Indicators must be watched for in order to undertake a situation analysis. And A situation analysis only indicates the area that has to be closely inspected and handled. Thus, what is an \"indicator\"? An indicator is a visible manifestation which tells one a situation analysis should be done. An indicator is the little flag sticking out that shows there is a possible situation un-derneath that needs attention. Some indicators about orgs or its sections would be – dirty or not reporting or going insolvent or complaint letters or any nonoptimum datum that departs from the ideal. This is enough to engage in a data and situation analysis of the scene where the indica-tor appeared. The correct sequence, then, is 8. Have a normal information flow available. 9. Observe. 10. When a bad indicator is seen become very alert. 11. Do a data analysis. 12. Do a situation analysis. 13. Obtain more data by direct inspection of the area indicated by the situation analysis. 14. Handle. An incorrect sequence, bound to get one in deep trouble is C. See an indicator, D. Act to handle. This even applies to emergencies if one is fast enough to do the whole correct cycle in a split second."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"INFORMATION COLLECTION 3 HCO PL 15.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 241 DATA SERIES Oddly enough anyone working in a familiar area can do it all in a split second. People that can do it like lightning are known to have \"fast reaction time.\" People who can't do it fast are often injured or dead. Example of an emergency cycle: Engineer on duty, normal but experienced percep-tion. Is observing his area. Hears a hiss that shouldn't be. Scans the area and sees nothing out of order but a small white cloud. Combines sight and hearing. Moves forward to get a better look. Sees valve has broken. Shuts off steam line. Example of an incorrect action. Hears hiss. Pours water on the boiler fires. ADMIN CYCLE When you slow this down to an Admin Cycle it becomes very easy. It follows the same steps. It is not so dramatic. It could string out over months unless one realized that the steps 1 to 7 should be taken when the first signs show up. It need not. However it sometimes does. Sometimes it has to be done over and over, full cycle, to get a full scene purring. Sometimes the \"handle\" requires steps which the area is too broken down to get into effect and so becomes \"Handle as possible and remember to do the whole cycle again soon.\" Sometimes \"handle\" is a program of months or years duration; its only liability is that it will be forgotten or thrown out before done by some \"new broom.\" DATA COLLECTION But it all begins with having a normal flow of information available and observing. Seeing a bad indicator one becomes alert and fully or quickly finishes off the cycle. BAD INDICATOR What is a \"bad indicator\" really? It is merely an outpoint taken from the 5 primary outpoints. It is not \"bad news\" or \"entheta\" or a rumor. The \"bad news\" could easily be a false-hood and is an outpoint because it is false bad news! \"Good\" news when it is a falsehood is an outpoint!"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"INFORMATION COLLECTION 4 HCO PL 15.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 242 DATA SERIES RELIABLE SOURCE Intelligence services are always talking \"reliable sources.\" Or about \"confirmed obser-vation.\" These are not very reliable ways of telling what is true. The master double spy Philby as a head MI-6 adviser was a Russian spy. Yet for 30 years he determined \"reliable sources\" for the US and England! If three people tell you the same thing it is not necessarily a fact as they might all have heard the same lie. Three liars don't make one fact – they make three outpoints. So it would seem to be very difficult to establish facts if leading papers and intelli-gence services can't do it! Yes it is tough to know the truth. But the moment you begin to work with them, it is rather easy to locate outpoints. You are looking for outpoints. When they are analyzed and the situation is analyzed by them you then find yourself looking at the truth if you follow the cycle 1 to 7. It's really rather magical. If you know thoroughly what the 5 primary outpoints are they leap into view from any body of data. Oscar says he leads a happy married life. His wife is usually seen crying. It's an out-point – a falsehood. The Omaha office is reported by Los Angeles to be doing great. It fails to report. The LA datum does not include that it is 6 months old. Three outpoints, one for time, one for falsehood, one for omitted datum. Once you are fully familiar with the 5 primary outpoints they are very obvious. \"We are having pie for supper\" and \"We have no flour\" at least shows out of se-quence! It is odd but all the \"facts\" you protest in life and ridicule or growl about are all one or another of the outpoints. When you spot them for what they are then you can actually estimate things. And the pluspoints come into view. L.

Remimeo Data Series 6R DATA SYSTEMS Two bad systems are in current use on data. The first is \"reliable source.\" In this system a report is considered true or factual only if the source is well thought of. This is a sort of authority system. Most professionals working with data collection use this. Who said it? If he is considered reliable or an authority the data is considered true or factual. Sources are graded from A to D. A is highest, D lowest. The frailty of this system is at once apparent. Philby, as a high British intelligence official, was a Russian spy for 30 years. Any data he gave the UK or US was \"true\" because he was a \"reli-able source.\" He had every Western agent who was being sent into communist areas \"fin-gered\" and shot. The West became convinced you could not enter or overthrow communist held areas and stopped trying! Philby was the top authority! He fooled CIA and MI-6 for years! Psychiatrists are \"authorities\" on the mind. Yet insanity and criminality soar. They are the \"reliable sources\" on the mind. Need I say more? The other system in use is multiple report. If a report is heard from several areas or people it is \"true.\" The Russian KGB has a Department D that forges documents and plants them in several parts of the world. They are then \"true.\" Propaganda spokesmen located all over the world say the same thing to the press on every major occasion. This becomes \"public opinion\" in government circles and so is \"true\" because it is published and comes from so many areas. Five informants could all have heard the same lie. Thus we see these two systems of evaluation are both birdbrain. TWO PROBLEMS The two problems that information collection agencies have are"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"DATA SYSTEMS 2 HCO PL 1.5.70R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 246 DATA SERIES 3. Data evaluation and 4. How to locate the areas they should closely investigate. For (1), data evaluation, they use primarily reliable source and multiple report. Every item received that is not \"Reliable\" or \"Multiple\" is waste-basketed. They throw out all outpoints and do not report them! Their agents are thoroughly trained to do this. As for (2), areas to investigate, they cannot pinpoint where they should investigate or even what to investigate because they do not use their outpoints. Using outpoints and data and situation analysis they would know exactly where to look at, at what. ERRORS The above data errors are practiced by the largest data collection agencies on the planet-the \"professionals.\" These advise their governments! And are the only advisers of their governments. Thus you can see how dangerous they are to their own countries. Naturally they have agents who have what is called \"flair.\" These, despite all systems, apply logic. They are so few that Eisenhower's intelligence adviser, General Strong, said in his book that they are too scarce so one is better off with a vast organization. These agencies are jammed with false reports and false estimations. An event contemporary with this writing where the US invaded Cambodia shows sev-eral data and situation errors. Yet the Viet Cong HQ were using computers. Yet their HQ was wiped out. The US President used CIA data which does not include, by law, data on the US. So the info on which the US President was acting was 50% missing! He was only told about the enemy evidently. When he ordered the invasion the US blew up! A rather big outpoint (omitted facts) don't you think? FAULTS The reason I am using intelligence examples is because these are the biggest human data collection \"professionals\" in the world. The collection and use of data to estimate situations to guide national actions and the data collection by a housewife going shopping are based on the same principles. Mrs. Glutz, told by a \"reliable source,\" Nellie Jones, that things are cheaper at Finkle-berries and told by enough TV admen she should buy Kleano tends to do just that. Yet Blas-tonsteins is really cheaper and by shaving up laundry soap and boiling it she can have ten dol-lars worth of Kleano for about fifty cents.

This is what also could be called an ideal scene or situation. If one doesn't know the ideal scene or situation then one is not likely to observe non-ideal points in it. Let us send a farmer to sea. In a mild blow, with yards and booms creaking and water hitting the hull, he is sure the ship is about to sink. He has no familiarity with how it should sound or look so he misses any real outpoints and may consider all pluspoints as outpoints. Yet on a calm and pretty day he sees a freighter come within 500 feet of the side and go full astern and thinks everything is great. An experienced officer may attempt madly to avoid collision and all the farmer would think was that the officer was being impolite! The farmer, lacking any familiarity with the sea and having no ideal as to what smooth running would be, would rarely see real outpoints unless he drowned. Yet an experienced sailor, familiar with the scene in all its changing faces sees an outpoint in all small illogicals. On the other hand, the sailor on the farm would completely miss rust in the wheat and an open gate and see no outpoints in a farm that the farmer knew was about to go bust. The rule is A person must have an ideal scene with which to compare the existing scene. If a staff hasn't got an idea of how a real org should run, then it misses obvious out-points. One sees examples of this when an experienced org man visiting the org tries to point out to a green staff (which has no ideal or familiarity) what is out. The green staff grudgingly fixes up what he says to do but lets go of it the moment he departs. Lacking familiarity and an ideal of a perfect org, the green staff just doesn't see anything wrong or anything right either! The consequences of this are themselves illogical. One sees an untrained executive shooting all the producers and letting the bad hats alone. His erroneous ideal would be a quiet org, let us say. So he shoots anyone who is noisy or demanding. He ignores statistics. He ig-"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"FAMILIARITY   2   HCOPL   18.5.70   ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 252 DATA SERIES nores the things he should watch merely because he has a faulty ideal and no familiarity of a proper scene. OBSERVATION ERRORS When the scene is not familiar one has to look hard to become aware of things. You've noticed tourists doing this. Yet the old resident \"sees\" far more than they do while walking straight ahead down the road. It is easy to confuse the novel with the \"important fact.\" \"It was a warm day for winter\" is a useful fact only when it turns out that actually everything froze up on that day or it indicated some other outpoint. Most errors in observation are made because one has no ideal for the scene or no familiar-ity with it. However there are other error sources. \"Being reasonable\" is the chief offender. People dub-in a missing piece of a sequence, for instance, instead of seeing that it is missing. A false datum is imagined to exist because a se-quence is wrong or has a missing step. It is horrifying to behold how easily people buy dub-in. This is because an illogical se-quence is uncomfortable. To relieve the discomfort they distort their own observation by not-ising the outpoint and concluding something else. I recall once seeing a Tammany Hall group (a New York political bunch whose symbol is a tiger) stop before the tiger's cage in a zoo. The cage was empty and they were much disap-pointed. I was there and said to them, \"The tiger is out to lunch.\" They told those on the outer edge of the group, \"The tiger is out to lunch.\" They all cheered up, accepted the empty cage and went very happily on their way. Not one said \"Lunch?\" Or \"Who are you?\" Or laughed at the joke. Even though it was sunset! I pitied the government of New York! ACCURATE OBSERVATION There are certain conditions necessary for accurate observation. First is a means of perception whether by remote communication by various comm lines or by direct looking, feeling, experiencing. Second is an ideal of how the scene or area should be. Third is familiarity with how such scenes are when things are going well or poorly. Fourth is understanding pluspoints or rightnesses when present. Fifth is knowing outpoints (all 5 types) when they appear. Sixth is rapid ability to analyze data."},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"FAMILIARITY   3   HCOPL   18.5.70   ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 253 DATA SERIES Seventh is the ability to analyze the situation. Eighth is the willingness to inspect more closely the area of outness. Then one has to have the knowledge and imagination necessary to handle. One could call the above the cycle of observation. If one calls handle number 9 it would be the Cycle of Control. If one is trained to conceive all variations of outpoints (illogics) and studies up to conceive an ideal and gains familiarity with the scene or type of area, his ability to observe and handle things would be considered almost supernatural.

This has been so far out in the society that the word \"sane\" itself has come to mean \"conservative\" or \"cautious.\" Or something you can agree with. The 19th century psycholo-gist decided he could not define \"normal\" and there weren't any normal people. The 14th cen-tury psychiatrist is the 20th century \"authority\" on sanity. Yet an examination of such shows them to be unable to demonstrate it personally or bring it about, much less define it. Dictionaries say it is \"health, soundness of body or mind; level-headedness, reason-ableness.\" Yet sanity is vital to accurate observation. FIXED IDEAS The \"idée fixe\" is the bug in sanity. Whenever an observer himself has fixed ideas he tends to look at them not at the in-formation. Prejudiced people are suffering mainly from an \" idée fixe.\" The strange part of it is that the \"idée fixe\" they think they have isn't the one they do have. An example of this is the social \"scientist\" with a favorite theory. I have seen tons of these birds pushing a theory as though it was the last theory in the world and valuable as a ten-pound diamond. Such throw away any fact that does not agree with theory. That's how 19th century psychology went off the rails. All fixed ideas and no facts. The physical sciences in Hegel's time did the same thing. There was no 8th planet in the solar system, even when found in a telescope, because \"seven is a perfect number so there can only be seven planets.\" History is full of idiocies-and idiots-with fixed ideas. They cannot observe beyond the idea."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"SANITY 2 HCO PL 19.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 258 DATA SERIES A fixed idea is something accepted without personal inspection or agreement. It is the perfect \"authority knows best.\" It is the \"reliable source.\" A typical one was the intelligence report accepted by the whole US Navy right up to 7 Dec. 1941, the date of destruction of the US fleet by Jap planes. The pre-Pearl Harbor report, from unimpeachably reliable sources was \"the Japanese cannot fly-they have no sense of balance.\" The report overlooked that the Japs were the world's greatest acrobats! It became a fixed idea that caused the neglect of all other reports. A fixed idea is uninspected. It blocks the existence of any contrary observation. Most reactionaries (people resisting all progress or action) are suffering from fixed ideas which they received from \"authorities,\" which no actual experience alters. That British red-coated infantry never took cover was another one. It took a score or two of wars and fantastic loss of life to finally break it down. If any single fixed idea de-stroyed the British Empire, this one is a candidate. NORMAL SCENE The reason a fixed idea can get so rooted and so overlooked is that it appears normal or reasonable. And somebody or a lot of somebodies want to believe it. Thus a fixed idea can become an ideal. It is probably a wrong ideal. Incapable Jap pi-lots would be a wish for a navy. It would be wonderful! Red-coated infantry were supposed to be brave and unflinching. In both cases the ideal is irrational. A rational ideal has this law: The purpose of the activity must be part of the ideal one has for that activity. A navy that has an ideal that the enemy can't fly is stupidly avoiding its own purpose which is to fight. British infantry had the purpose of winning wars, not just looking brave. Thus one can analyze for a sane ideal by simply asking, \"What's the purpose of the ac-tivity?\" If the ideal is one that forwards the purpose, it will pass for sane. There are many factors which add up to an ideal scene. If the majority of these for-ward the purpose of the activity, it can be said to be a sane ideal. If an ideal which does not forward the activity in any way is the ideal being stressed then a fixed idea is present and had better be inspected. This could be said to be a very harsh utilitarian view of things. But it is not. The artis-tic plays its role in any ideal. Morale has its part in any ideal."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"SANITY 3 HCO PL 19.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 259 DATA SERIES An ideal studio for an artist could be very beautiful or very ugly so long as it served him to produce his art. If it was very beautiful yet hindered his artistic activities it would be a very crazy ideal scene. A handsome factory that produced would be a high ideal. But its nearness to raw ma-terials, transport and worker housing are the more important factors in an ideal of a factory. And its location in a country where the government made an atmosphere in which production could occur could be an overriding part of an \"ideal scene.\" You have to look at what the area is for before you can say whether it is ideal or not. And if its area is too limited to produce or too expensive for it to be solvent, then it is-n't a sane scene. URGES TO IMPROVE Sometimes the urge to improve an activity is such that it injures or destroys the activ-ity. If one is familiar with the type of activity he must also realize that there is a law in-volved. The fact that something is actually operating and solvent can outweigh the un-tested advantages of changing it. In other words, an ideal scene might be vastly different but the actual scene IS operat-ing. So the factor of obsessive change enters. Change can destroy with ferocity. Whole areas of London, jammed with small but customer-filled shops, have been swept away to make room for chromium high-rent modern stores which stand empty of buy-ers. Birmingham, where you could get anything made, had all its tiny craft shops swept away and replaced with high-rent huge new buildings all on some progress-crazy psychotic break. Possibly the new stores and the huge new shops fitted somebody's \"ideal\" but they did not match an actual operating environment. It is this difference between an ideal scene and a practical scene which brings down many old businesses and civilizations. Therefore, to have an ideal, familiarity with what works is desirable. It is quite possible without any familiarity, to imagine a successful ideal. But it must not have any fixed ideas in it. It is the fixed idea that knocks a practical operating living environment in the head."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"SANITY 4 HCO PL 19.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 260 DATA SERIES Do-gooders are always at this. They see in a row of old shacks, not economic inde-pendence and a lazy life but P-O-V-E-R-T-Y. So they get a new housing project built, shoot taxes into the sky, put total control on a lot of people and cave in a society. The do-gooder is pushing the 19th century fixed idea of the Comte de Saint-Simon-to gear the whole economy down to the poorest man in it. In other words to reward only the downstat. Everyone becomes a slave of course but it sure sounds good. Newspapermen are probably the world's worst observers. They observe through the fixed ideas of the publisher or the prevailing control group. Their stories are given them be-fore they leave the office. Yet their observations advise the public and the government! The outpoints to be found in any contemporary newspaper brand most stories as false before one proceeds more than a paragraph. Yet this is what the world public is expected to run on. Naturally it distorts the scene toward raving insanity. This conflicts with the native logic of people so the public thinks the world a lot madder than it really is. In two cities all newspapers were suspended from publication for quite a period. In both, crime dropped to zero! And resumed again when newspapers were again published. The ideal scene of the citizen in his workaday world is vastly different than the scene depicted in a newspaper. The difference between the two can make one feel quite weird. Thus there should not be too wide a difference between the ideal and the represented scene. And not too wide a difference between the ideal and the actual scene. R (reality) consists of the is-ness of things. One can improve upon this is-ness to bring about an ideal and lead the R up to it. This is normal improvement and is accepted as sane. One can also degrade the R by dropping the representation (description) of the scene well below the actual. In the black propaganda work traditionally carried on by many gov-ernments this latter trick of corrupting the R is the means used to foment internal revolt and war. Both actions of upgrade and downgrade are outpoints when reported as facts. \"We made £1000 in reserves this week\" is as crazily outpoint as \"the government went broke this week\" when either one is not the truth. When the report says, \"we should plan a higher income,\" it is leading to a higher idea! and is not an outpoint mainly because it is not representing any fact but a hopeful and ambi-tious management. 5 POINTS When none of the outpoints are present, yet you do have reports and the scene is func-tioning and fulfilling its purpose one would have what he could call a sane scene."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"SANITY 5 HCO PL 19.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 261 DATA SERIES If all 5 points were absent yet the scene was not functioning well enough to live, it would be such a departure from the ideal that that itself would be outpoint in that importance was altered. What is out here is the whole situation! The situation analysis would be instantly visible. But in practice this last happens only in theory, not in practice. A collapsing situation is forecast by outpoints in its data. Organisms and organizations tend to survive. A decline of survival is attended also by outpoints. SANITY IS SURVIVAL Anything not only survives better when sane but it is true that the insane doesn't sur-vive. Thus survival potential can be measured to a considerable degree by the absence of outpoints. This does not mean that sane men can't be shot or sane organizations can't be de-stroyed. It means only that there is far less chance of them being shot and destroyed. So long as men and organizations are connected to insane men and organizations, wild things can and do happen unexpectedly. But usually such things can be predicted by outpoints in others. When sane men and organizations exist in a broad scene that is convulsed with irra-tionality, it takes very keen observation and a good grip on logic and fast action to stay alive. This is known as \"environmental challenge.\" It can be overdone! Too much challenge can overwhelm. The difference between such happening to a sane man or organization and to the in-sane would be that the failure did not itself become a fixed idea. INSANITY The 5 primary illogics or outpoints as we call them are of course the anatomy of insan-ity. In their many variations the insanity of any scene can be sounded and the nucleus of it located. By locating and then closely inspecting, such a point of insanity can then be handled. When you know what insanity really is you can then confront it and handle it. One is not driven into a huge generality of \"everything is insane.\" By detecting and eliminating small insane areas, taking care not to destroy the sane things around it, one can gradually lift any situation up to sanity and survival."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"SANITY 6 HCO PL 19.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 262 DATA SERIES By seeing what is insane in a scene and seeing why it is insane, one has by comparison also found what is sane.

An error may show something else. It is nothing in itself. An error obscures or alters a datum. Example: Asking someone to spot the outpoints in a Russian passenger vacation cruise liner in a foreign port, the answers were, \"The hammer and sickle are upside down.\" \"The courtesy flag is not flying right side up.\" These aren't outpoints. The hammer and sickle weren't backwards so saying it was an outpoint. The actual outpoint was passenger vacation cruise liner. There is no Russian idle class. It was too big to be giving cruises to winning trac-tor drivers. Russian and vacation cruise liner just don't go together. Either the reports of Rus-sian refusal to let Russians travel is false or it wasn't a vacation cruise liner but it was. Hence it's an outpoint. An omitted datum. Two contrary data means one is false. Investigation dis-closed it was Russian all right and a vacation cruise liner all right. But it was chartered to an Italian company that sold cruises to Italians! But this leads to a new outpoint. How come the workers paradise is building huge ships for capitalist pleasures? If anyone like a Martian was tracing down what's out on this planet, this one outpoint would lead to others. A situation analysis would indicate an investigation of Russia where outpoints abound and the Martian would know a lot of what's wrong on the planet, In doing so he would find a lot of capitalistic outpoints which would lead him to in-vestigate the so-called West and he would have the basic \"cold war\" of communism versus capitalism. This would lead him into new data the two have in common (economics) and a data analysis of economics would discover the screwiest bunch on the planet, the international banker playing off both sides. He would have analyzed the planet. Given that he knew or could translate languages, it might take him a week, starting with a Russian luxury cruise liner, to run down the planetary bad spot."},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"ERRORS 2 HCO PL 23.5.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 268 DATA SERIES Now if he reversed his investigation and used pluspoints he would arrive with a situa-tion analysis of what group would be strong enough to handle the down spot and by investiga-tion possibly pinpoint what could tip over the bad spot. If he just used \"errors\" he would get no place. The ideal he would have to be working from would be a planet at peace where indi-viduals could go about their affairs and be happy without threats of immediate arrest or de-struction. It would be a very simple ideal or it would be based only on how planetary popula-tions and cultures survive and that is already laid down in an earlier rule in this series. Ask somebody to look at a table used for meals at the end of a meal and indicate any outpoints. Usually he'll point out a dirty plate or crumbs or an ashtray not emptied. They are not outpoints. When people finish eating one expects dirty plates, crumbs and full ashtrays. If none of these things were present there might be several outpoints to note. The end of a meal with table and plates all clean would be a reversed sequence. That would be an outpoint. Evi-dentially the dinner has been omitted and that would be quite an outpoint! Obviously no meal has been served so there's a falsehood. So here are three outpoints. It is best to get what outpoints are down pat. One does this first by thinking up exam-ples and then by observing some body of data and then by looking at various scenes. It will be found that outpoints are really few unless the activity is very irrational. Simple errors on the other hand can be found in legions in any scene. Child's games often include, \"What's wrong with this picture?\" Usually they are just errors like a road sign upside down. But if you had a brown rabbit in winter holding down a man with its front paws and a caption, \"Japanese parasols attack ____________ ,\" you'd have some real outpoints. A lot of people would try to figure it out and supply new outpoints (being reasonable). A learned professor could point out the symbolism. Some would laugh it off. Some would be annoyed by it. And the reason anybody would do anything about it is that it is sort of painful to confront the irrational so instead of seeing its is-ness of illogics an effort is made to make it logical or to throw it away. The reason misunderstood words or typographical errors were not regarded as a bar-rier to study was that people converted them or not-ised them. In actual fact a word one does not understand made a missing datum. Reasonableness or nonconfront enter in and one drops the book. Errors do not count in pluspoints either. That a factory has a few errors is no real indicator. A factory has pluspoints to the de-gree it attains its ideal and fulfills its purpose. That some of its machinery needs repair might not even be an outpoint. If the general machinery of the place is good for enough years to easily work off its replacement value there is a pluspoint.

A person who does not know how the scene should be can thereafter miss most of the outpoints in it. An example is the continual rewrite of the International Code (signaling by flags be-tween ships) by some \"convention\" composed of clerks who have never gone to sea. Not knowing the scene, the International Code of Signals now contains \"How are your kidneys?\" but nothing about lifeboats. College education became rather discredited in Europe until students were required to work in areas of actual practice as part of their studies. Educated far from reality students had \"no scene.\" Thus no data they had was related by them to an actual activity. There was even an era when the \"practical man\" or \"practical engineer\" was held in contempt. That was when the present culture started to go down. On the other hand one of the most long-lived activities around is the wine industry of Portugal. It has almost no theory trained. It is total scene. Every job in it is by apprenticeship for years. It is very constant and very successful. A good blend would be theory and practical in balance. That gives one data and activ-ity. But it could be improved by stressing also the ideal scene. BODIES OF DATA Data classifies in similar connections or similar locations. A body of data is associated by the subject to which it is applicable or by the geo-graphical area to which it belongs. A body of data can also be grouped as to time, like an historical period. Illogic occurs when one or more data is misplaced into the wrong body of data for it. An example would be \"Los Angeles smog was growing worse so we fined New York.\" That is pretty obviously a misplace."},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"THE MISSING SCENE 2 HCO PL 23.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 274 DATA SERIES \"Cars were no longer in use. Bacterial warfare had taken its toll.\" \"I am sorry madam but you cannot travel first class on a third class passport.\" Humanoid response to such displacements is to be reasonable. A new false datum is dreamed up and put into the body of data to explain why that datum is included. (Reasonable-ness is often inserted as explanation of other outpoints also.) In the smog one, it could be dreamed up that New York's exports or imports were causing LA smog. In the car one, it could be imagined that bacteriological warfare had wiped out all the people. In the train one, it could be inserted that in that country, passports were used instead of tickets. The brain strains to correctly classify data into its own zones and is very rejective or imaginative when it is not. Intelligence tests accidentally use this one very often. It remains that an outpoint can occur when a datum belonging to one zone of data, lo-cation or time, is inserted into another zone where it doesn't. Algebra is sometimes hard to learn for some because numbers are invaded by letters. 2x = 10. X is of course 5. But part of a new student's mind says letters are letters and make words. Primitive rejective responses to foreigners is a mental reaction to a body of people, in this case, being invaded by a person not of that tribe. If the scene is wholly unknown, one doesn't know what data belongs to it. Thus a sense of confusion results. Recruits can be sent for ruddy rods for rifles and apprentice paint-ers can be ordered to get cans of sky blue lampblack. A sense of humor is in part an ability to spot outpoints that should be rejected from a body of data. In fact a sense of humor is based on both rejection and absurd outpoints of all types. Reasonable people accept displacements with an amazing tranquility by imagining connecting links or assuming they do not know the ideal scene. A reasonable person would accept a pig in a parlor by imagining that there was a good reason for it. And leave the pig in the parlor and revise their own ideal scene! Yet pigs belong to a body of data including barns, pens, farms, animals. And parlors belong to a body of data including teacups, knickknacks, conversation and humans. Possibly Professor Wundt who \"discovered\" in 1879 that humans were animals had seen too many pigs in parlors! And based the whole of \"psychology\" on a confusion of bodies of data!"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"THE MISSING SCENE 3 HCO PL 23.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 275 DATA SERIES Murder in a hospital, as done by psychiatry, would be a confusion of bodies of ac-tions. Actions belong to their own bodies of data. One drives a car, rides a horse. One doesn't ride a car but one can drive a horse. But the action, the motions involved with, driving a horse are very different than those used in driving a car. This is a language breakdown called a \"homonym.\" One word means two dif-ferent things. Japanese is an easy language except for its use of the same word for several different things. Two Japanese talking commonly have to draw Chinese characters (Japanese is written with Chinese characters) to each other to unravel what they mean. They are in a perpetual struggle to pry apart bodies of data. \"1234 Red 789 P 987 Green 432 Apple\" as a statement would probably tie up CIA codebreakers for weeks as they would know it was a code. The same statement would tie up a football coach as he would know it was a team play. A mathematician would know it fitted into some other activity than his. Hardly anyone would classify it as a totally meaningless series of symbols. So there is a reverse compulsion-to try to fit any datum found into some body of data. The mind operates toward logic, particularly in classes of things. The sensible handling of data of course includes spotting a datum, terminal, item, ac-tion, grouped in with a body of data wrong for it. And in spotting that a datum does not have to belong anywhere at all. Included in mental abilities is putting similar data into one type of action, items, or data. Car parts, traffic rules, communications, are each a body of data in which one can fit similar data. When a person has some idea of the scene involved, he should be able to separate the data in it into similar groups. An org board is an example of this. Sections are broad classes of action or items into which one can fit the related data. Departments are a broader body of related data, actions, items. Divisions are even broader but still cover related classes of data. The whole org is a very broad class of data, determined in part by the type of product being made. If a person has trouble relating data to its proper body of data (if he were unaware or \"reasonable\") he would have an awful lot of trouble finding his way around an org or routing despatches or getting things or wearing his own hat. Orders are a broad class of data. Orders from proper sources is a narrower body of data. If a person cannot tell the difference he will follow anyone's orders. And that will snarl him up most thoroughly. I once knew a carpenter so obliging and so unable to classify orders that he built knickknacks, cabinets, shelves, for any staff member who asked and wasted all the time and materials and orders from his boss that were to have built a house! The house materials and money and the carpenter's time and pay were all expended without anything of value to show"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"THE MISSING SCENE 4 HCO PL 23.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 276 DATA SERIES for it! Not only was he unable to relate orders to their own classes but also couldn't relate ma-terials and plans to a house! In most miscarriages of projects it will be found that someone on the line cannot relate data or actions to their own classes. Along with this goes other illogics. So the ability to spot illogics in a known scene can directly relate to efficiency and even to success and survival. A switch intended for a house put into an airplane electrical system cuts out at 30,000 feet due to the wrong metal to withstand cold and there goes the airplane. A part from one class of parts is included wrongly in another class of parts. So there is an incorrectly included datum which is a companion to the omitted da-tum as an outpoint. This most commonly occurs when, in the mind, the scene itself is missing and the first thing needed to classify data (scene) is not there. An example is camera storage by someone who has no idea of types of cameras. In-stead of classifying all the needful bits of a certain view camera in one box, one inevitably gets the lens hoods of all cameras jumbled into one box marked \"lens hoods.\" To assemble or use the view camera one spends hours trying to find its parts in boxes neatly labeled \"camera backs,\" \"lenses,\" \"tripods,\" etc. Here, when the scene of what a set up view camera looks like and operates like, is missing, one gets a closer identification of data than exists. Lens hoods are lens hoods. Tri-pods are tripods. Thus a wrong system of classification occurs out of scene ignorance. A traveler unable to distinguish one uniform from another \"solves\" it by classifying all uniforms as \"porters.\" Hands his bag to an arrogant police captain and that's how he spent his vacation, in jail. Lack of the scene brings about too tight an identification of one thing with another. This can also exclude a vital bit making a disassociation. A newly called-up army lieutenant passes right on by an enemy spy dressed as one of his own soldiers. An experienced sergeant right behind him claps the spy in jail accurately because \"he wasn't wearing 'is 'at the way we do in the Fusileers!\" Times change data classification. In 1920 anyone with a camera near a seaport was a spy. In 1960 anyone not carrying a camera couldn't be a tourist so was watched! So the scene for one cultural period is not the scene for another. ____________________ Thus a class of data for a given time belongs broadly or narrowly to itself.

To some, a despatch is a situation. A small error to others is a situation. Yet, if one wishes to know and use data and logic one must know exactly what is meant in this logic series by situation. English has several meanings for the one word. In the dictionary it's a \"place,\" a 64state or condition of affairs,\" \"a momentous combination of circumstances,\" \"a clash of passions or personalities,\" or \"a job.\" One gets the feeling that people are fumbling around for a meaning they know must be there. For our purposes we had better give an exact definition of what is meant by situation. If we are going to do a situation analysis by doing an analysis of data, then WHAT is a situa-tion? We can therefore specifically define for our purposes in logic the word situation. A situation is a major departure from the ideal scene. This means a wide and significant or dangerous or potentially damaging circumstance or state of affairs which means that the ideal scene has been departed from and doesn't fully exist in that area. THE IDEAL SCENE One has to work out or know what the ideal scene would be for an organization or de-partment or social strata or an activity to know that a wide big flaw existed in it. To be somewhat overly illustrative about it, let us take a town that has no one living in it. One would have to figure out what was the ideal scene of a town. Any town. It would be a place where people lived, worked, ate, slept, survived. It could be pretty or historical or well designed or quaint. Each of these would possibly add purpose or color to the town."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"SITUATION 2 HCO PL 30.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 282 DATA SERIES But this town in question has no people living in it. That is a departure from the ideal scene of towns. Therefore the situation would be no people live in this \"town.\" Data analysis would lead us to this by noting outpoints.  6 P.M. - No smoke from house chimneys. (omitted item)  9 P.M. - No lights. (omitted item)  Dawn - No dogs. (omitted terminals)  1910 election poster. (wrong time) That would be enough. We would then realize that a situation existed because data analysis is also done against the ideal scene. We would know enough about it to look more closely. No people! That's the situation. HANDLING Thus if one were responsible for the area one would now know what to handle. How he handled it depends upon (a) the need, (b) availability of resources, and (c) ca-pability. Obviously if it's supposed to have people in it and if one needs a town there one would have to get a bright idea or a dozen and eventually get people to live there. How fast it could be done depends on the availability of resources-those there or what one has (even as little resource as a voice, paper, pen, comm lines). One's own capability to get ideas or work or the capabilities of people are a major fac-tor in handling. But so far as the situation is concerned, it exists whether it is handled or not. HOW TO FIND A SITUATION When you are called upon to find out if there is a situation (as an inspector or official or soldier or cat or king, whatever) you can follow these steps and arrive with what the situa-tion is every time. 1. Observe. 2. Notice an oddity of any kind or none. 3. Establish what the ideal scene would be for what is observed. 4. Count the outpoints now visible."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"SITUATION 3 HCO PL 30.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 283 DATA SERIES 5. Following up the outpoints observe more closely. 6. Establish even more simply what the ideal scene would be. 7. The situation will be the most major departure from the Ideal Scene. HANDLING Just as you proceed to the most major situation – go big, when it comes to handling it usually occurs that reverse is true – go small! It is seldom you can handle it all at one bang. (Of course that happens too.) But just because the situation is big is no real reason the solution must be. Solutions work on gradient scales. Little by more by more. When you really see a situation it is often so big and so appalling one can feel inca-pable. The need to handle comes first. The resources available come next. The capability comes third. Estimate these and by getting a very bright workable (often very simple) idea, one can make a start. An activity can get so wide of the ideal scene the people in it are just in a confusion. They do all sorts of odd irrelevant things, often hurt the activity further. Follow the steps given 1-7 above and you will have grasped the situation. You will then be able to do (a), (b), (c). That begins to make things come right. In that way most situations can be both defined and handled. INTERFERENCE Lots of people, often with lots of authority, get mired into situations. They do not know they are in anything that could be defined, isolated or stated. They bat madly at unim-portant dust motes or each other and just mire in more deeply. Whole civilizations uniformly go the route just that way. So do orgs, important activities and individuals. One can handle exactly as above, if one practices up so he can really do the drill on li-fe. The only danger is that the situation can be so far from any ideal that others with fixed ideas and madness can defy the most accurate and sensible solutions."},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"SITUATION 4 HCO PL 30.6.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 284 DATA SERIES But that's part of the situation, isn't it? ____________________ Data analysis is done to make a more direct observation of exactly the right area pos-sible.

These are defining the ideal scene itself, detect without error or guess any departure on it, find out why a departure occurred and work out a means of reverting back to the ideal scene. In order to resolve a situation fully one has to get the real reason why a departure from the ideal scene occurred. \"What was changed?\" or \"What changed?\" is the same question. That \"change\" is the root of departures comes from a series of plant experiments I conducted. (The type of experimentation was undertaken to study cellular life behavior and reaction to see if it was a different type of life-it isn't. The experiments themselves were later repeated in various universities and were the subject of much press for them over the world.) In setting up conditions of growth I observed that plants on various occasions greatly declined suddenly. In each case I was able to trace the last major change that had occurred and correct it. Changes made in temperature, water volume, humidity, ventilation, greatly affected the plants in terms of wilt, decreased growth rate, increase in parasites, etc. When the change was isolated and the condition reverted to that occurring during the previous healthy period, a recovery would occur. At first glance this may seem obvious. Yet in actual practice it was not easy to do. Gardeners' records would omit vital data or alter importance or drop out time, etc. A gardener might seek to cover up for himself or a fellow worker. He tended to make himself right and would enter falsehoods or reassurance that was a falsehood into the analysis. A new gardener would seem to affect the plants greatly and one could build a person-ality influence theory on this-until one found that, being untrained in the procedure used, he would enter even more outpoints than usual. At such a juncture one would of course train the gardener. But that didn't locate what had been changed. And one had to locate that to get the plants to recover. The conditions in use were extreme forcing conditions anyway and lapse of duty was very apparent. Six-"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 2 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 288 DATA SERIES teen-foot hothouse American corn from seeds usually furnishing 5-foot stocks, 43 tomatoes to the truss where 5 is more usual were the demands being met. So any change showed up at once. The fact of change itself was a vital point as well. One discovery was that life does best in a near optimum constancy-meaning that change just as change is usually harmful to plant life. The fact of isolating change in the environment as the sole harmful cause was one dis-covery. That one had to isolate the change in order to obtain full recovery was another discov-ery. Change itself was not bad but in this experimental series conditions were set as opti-mum and the beneficial changes had already been made with remarkable results. Thus one was observing change from the optimum. This would be the same thing as \"departures from the ideal scene.\" The action was always 5. Observe the decline. 6. Locate the exact change which had been made. 7. Revert the change. 8. A return to the near ideal scene would occur if one were maintaining the ideal scene meanwhile. THE IDEAL SCENE There are two scenes: C. The ideal scene D. The existing scene, These of course can be wide apart. How does one know the ideal scene? At first thought it would be very difficult for a person not an expert to know the ideal scene. For years certain \"authoritarian\" people in the field of mental healing fought with lies and great guile to obscure the fact that the ideal scene in mental healing can be known to any-one. Such imprisoned and tortured and murdered human beings with the excuse that they themselves were the only experts. \"It takes 12 years to make a psychiatrist.\" \"Expert skill is required to kill a patient.\" The existing scene these \"experts\" made was a slaughterhouse for asylums and the in-sanity and crime statistics soaring."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 3 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 289 DATA SERIES They fought like maniacs to obscure the ideal scene and hired and coerced an army of agents, \"reporters,\" \"officials,\" and such to smash anyone who sought to present the ideal scene or ways to attain it. Indeed it was a world gone mad with even the police and govern-ments hoodwinked by these \"experts.\" Yet any citizen knew the ideal scene had he not been so propaganda frightened by the existing scene. By constantly pounding in the \"naturalness\" of an existing scene consisting of mad-ness, crime, torture, seizure and murder, these mad \"experts\" put the ideal scene so far from reach that it appeared incredible. It was so bad a situation that anyone proposing the ideal scene was actively resisted! Yet the ideal scene is so easy to state that any citizen could have stated it at any time. And often believed it was occurring! The ideal scene of an asylum would be people recovering in a calm atmosphere, re-stored to any previous ability, emerging competent and confident. The ideal scene in the society would be, probably, a safe environment wherein one could happily make his way through life. Of course, the technology of the mind was the missing data. But the experts in charge of that sector of life paid out hard cash to hoods to prevent any such technology developing-a matter fully documented. The gap between the ideal scene and the existing scene can be very wide and in any endeavor elements exist that tend to prevent a total closure between the two. However, approached on a gradient with skill and determination, it can be done. DEPARTURE The mental awareness that something is wrong with a scene is the point at which one can begin reverting to the ideal scene. Without this awareness on the part of a group then an individual can be much im-peded in handling a situation. The mental processes of the person seeking to improve things toward an ideal scene or change them back to an ideal scene must include those who are also parts of the scene. Seeing something wrong without seeking to correct it degenerates into mere faultfind-ing and natter. This is about as far as many people go. That something, real or imagined, is wrong with the scene is a not uncommon state of mind. Not knowing what's intended or being done, or the limitations of resource or the magnitude and complexity of opposition, the arm-chair critic can be dreadfully unreal. He therefore tends to be suppressed, particularly by reac-tionaries (who try to keep it all as it is regardless). Unfortunately, the continual battle of life then is between the critic and the reaction-ary. As this often blows up in pointless destruction, it can be seen there could be something wrong with both of them."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 4 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 290 DATA SERIES Particularly the inactive carping critic is at fault on three counts. D. He isn't doing anything about it. E. He is not conceiving or broadcasting a real ideal scene. F. He is not providing any gradient approach to actually attain an ideal scene. The reactionary of course simply resists any change regardless of who is suffering providing the reactionary can retain what position and possession he may have. A revolutionary of course usually 4. Is doing something about it even if violent. 5. Is conceiving and broadcasting his version of the ideal scene, and 6. Is planning and acting upon some means of bringing about his own ideal scene. History and \"progress\" seem to be the revolutionary making his version of progress over the dead bodies of reactionaries. And although it may be history and \"progress\" the cycle is usually intensely destruc-tive and ends up without attaining an ideal scene and also destroying any scene existing. The ancient world is filled with ruins over which one can wander in contemplative and philosophic reverie. These attempts to make and maintain an ideal scene certainly left enough bruised masonry around. So it is really not enough to natter and it's rather too much to thrust violent change down on the heads of one and all including the objectors. Violent revolution comes about when the actual ideal scene has not been properly stated and when it excludes significant parts of the group. It's no good having a revolution if the end product will be a further departure from the ideal scene. The pastoral nonsense of Jean Jacques Rousseau was about as wide from an ideal scene as you could get, and it and other efforts, also wide, brought on the French Revolution. The Russian 1917 revolution had already been preceded by the democratic Kerensky revolt. But it failed because Russia being Russia was about a century and a half late. Also the French Revolution was late. And in both cases those who should have led didn't. Lesser ranks overthrew command. These and countless other human upheavals mark the fluttering pages of history and history will be written in similar vein again and again to eternity unless some sense and logic gets into the scene. Revolt is only an expression of too long unmended departures from the ideal scene of society. Usually the stitches taken to mend the growing social order are too weak and too hast-ily improvised to prevent the cultural fabric from being torn to rags."},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 5 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 291 DATA SERIES Street battles and angry infantry are the direct opposite of the ideal political scene. What was needed in such a case was an awareness of departure from the ideal scene, the discovery of Why a departure occurred and a gradient, real and determined program to return the scene closer to the ideal. The elements of improved mechanical arts and progress in the humanities may be util-ized to effect the recovery. In any event (which is missed by the reactionary and his \"good old days\") cultures do change and those changes are a part of any new ideal scene. So one does not achieve a reversion to the ideal by turning back the clock. One must be bright enough to include improvements in a new ideal scene. IDEAL SCENE AND PURPOSE Let us look this over, this concept of the ideal scene, and see that it is not a very com-plex thing. One doesn't have to be much of an expert to see what an ideal scene would be. The complex parts of the whole may not make up the whole, but they are not really vi-tal to conceiving an ideal scene for any activity, as small as a family or as big as a planet. The entire concept of an ideal scene for any activity is really a clean statement of its purpose. All one has to ask is \"What's the purpose of this?\" and one will be able to work out what the ideal scene of \"this\" is. To give a pedestrian example let us take a shoe shop. Its purpose is obviously to sell or provide people with shoes. The ideal scene is almost as simple as \"This activity sells or pro-vides people with shoes.\" Now no matter how complex may be the business or economics of shoe sales, the fact remains that that is almost the ideal scene. Only one factor is now missing: Time. The complete ideal scene of the shoe shop is then, \"This activity is intended to provide people with shoes for (time).\" It can be always or for its owner's lifetime or for the duration of the owner's stay in the town or the duration of the state fair. Now we can see departures from the ideal scene of this shoe store. One has to work out fairly correctly what the purpose of an activity is and how long it is to endure before one can make a statement of the ideal scene. From this one can work out the complexities which compose the activity in order to establish it in the first place including the speed of the gradient (how much shoe store how fast) and also how to spot the fact of departure from the ideal scene. This process would also work on any portion of the shoe store if the main ideal is not also violated. The children's department, the cashier, the stock clerk also have their sub-ideal scenes. And departures from their ideal scenes can be noted."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 6 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 292 DATA SERIES It doesn't matter what the activity is, large or small, romantic or humdrum, its ideal scene and its sub-ideal scenes are arrived at in the same way. METHODS OF AWARENESS Statistics are the only sound measure of any production or any job or any activity. The moment that one goes into any dependence on opinion, he goes into quicksand and will see too late the fatal flaw in restoring anything. If the fact that anything can be given production statistics seems too far out, it is visi-ble that even a guard, who would at first glance seem to be producing nothing but giving only security, is actually producing minutes, hours, weeks, years, of continued production Time. Probably the most thoughtful exercise is not conceiving the ideal scene but working out what the production statistic of it is. For here, the activity or subactivity must be very cor-rectly staticized to exactly measure the ideal scene of any activity or the statistic will itself bring about a departure! Just as the purpose from which the ideal scene is taken must be correct, so must the statistic be all the more thoughtfully correct. As an example, if the ideal scene of the shoe store is given the total statistic of its in-come then three things can happen: 1. It may cease to provide people with shoes that persuade them to come back for more. 2. It may sell shoes without enough profit to cover overhead and cease to exist. 3. It may conduct itself with more interest in the cashier than the customer and lose its trade. Probably its statistic is \"percentage of citizens in the area profitably shod by this store.\" Working out how long it takes to wear out an average pair of shoes, any ex-customer would be retired from the percentage after that time span had elapsed from buying his last pair. Given a fairly accurate and realistically updated census figure, that statistic would probably tell the tale of the ideal scene, which has its element of continuance. The sole fixation on making money can depart from the scene. Abandonment of mak-ing any money would certainly cause a departure of the shoe store. A commando battalion would have just as serious an examination for its ideal scene and statistic as a shoe store! And it would give a very, very effective activity if fully worked out. You'd really have to work out, probably better than the generals who think they have, the real purpose of a commando battalion (which is probably \"to disperse enemy preparations by unexpected actions and overinvolve enemy manpower in expensive guarding\"). The statistic could be something like \"our individual soldiers freed from opponents\" and/or \"casualties not occurring by reason of interrupted enemy preparations.\""},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 7 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 293 DATA SERIES In effect the commando battalion would be \"producing.\" The results would be an ef-fective increase in men under arms for their own side. WHY Knowing, then, the ideal scene and its statistic, one, by keeping the statistic, can notice without \"reasonableness\" or somebody's report or some fifth column propaganda, an immedi-ate departure from the ideal scene. Remember, violent change only becomes seemingly vital when the departure from the ideal scene is noticed too late . Opinion, reports, subject to outpoints as they almost always are, seldom tell one more than somebody else's prejudices or his efforts to cover or failures to observe. Now that a departure is seen (because the statistic drops) one can quickly go about no-ticing when and so get at Why. When he has the Why of the departure he can proceed to handle it. The statistic, guarded against false reports, and verified, is a clean statement not as subject to outpoints as other types of statements. Whole activities have been smashed by not having a statistic of success but taking an opinion of trouble, and reversely, by having a statistic indicating disaster but a broadcast opinion of \"great success.\" Probably the latter is the more frequent. It is not possible to locate Why the departure soon enough to remedy unless one takes the most reliable datum available-which is the datum most easily kept clean of out-points-which is a statistic. You don't really even know there is a Why unless there has been a departure. And the departure may be very hard to spot without a statistic. I have seen a group producing like mad, doing totally great, but which had no statistic, become the subject of wild outpoints and even contempt within itself. If an activity lacks an ideal scene and a correct statistic for it, it has no stable datum with which to rebuff opinion and outpoints. To that extent the group goes a bit mad. Group sanity depends. then. upon an ideal scene. correct sub-ideal scenes and statistics to match. One of the calmest safest groups around had a bad reputation with fellow groups be-cause it did not have or make known its ideal scene and did not have or release its statistics. And it had a hard time of it for quite a while, meantime working exhaustedly but dedi-catedly. Planet, nation, social groups, businesses, all their parts and the individual have their ideal scene and their statistic, their departures and successes and failures. And none fall out-side these data."},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND AND ESTABLISH 8 HCO PL 5.7.70 AN IDEAL SCENE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 294 DATA SERIES L.

Here is one which if left out would cause mystery. This is the principle of traffic flows we now use. It is called the Fast Flow System of Management. A being controlling a traffic or activity flow should let the flow run until it is to be re-inforced or indicates a turbulence will occur and only then inspects the part of the flow that is to be reinforced or is becoming enturbulated and inspects and acts on only that one flow. This principle would operate on a committee of 3 in this fashion: the committee does not act as a body. Each member acts individually in three spheres of influence (three types of flow). There is no committee (collective) action until one of the three members wants concur-rence from the other two on greatly reinforcing a flow or until the other two, by observation, see the third is going adrift. Only in these cases does the committee act as a Committee. In other words all 3 members go about their work independently until there is a change in one of their three spheres and then they act. Otherwise the flows of orders and actions are independ-ent. Not doing it like this is why Committees have gotten the reputation of being unable and a waste of time. To do this one, of course, needs another principle: that of Indicators. An Indicator is something that signals an approaching change rather than finding the change is already present and confirmed. We get this from auditing. An auditor audits so long as things go evenly. He knows when they will begin to deteriorate or change by an Indicator. He acts on seeing the indicator. He doesn't wait until the collapse or total change of the pc occurs and then look it over and act. The pc could be run into the ground or a good process that was bettering the case could be neglected if an auditor could not predict from indicators how it was going before it was gone.

The flows which needed watching would be buried in a huge vol-ume of flows that did not need watching. Instead, the principle of flows tells us that the executive should have statistical indica-tors such as OIC charts on every part of the activity each week and should act only on the basis of the charts' behaviors. If a chart went down the Executive would not wait for that area to collapse before in-specting it. At a dip point the executive should go over all the plans and traffic and despatches of the area dipping down and unearth the real reason why it did dip. If the matter needs minor remedy, it should be corrected. If then the graph still dipped down, the executive would not only be advised of it by the OIC Indicators but would know, having inspected earlier, what had to be done on a more drastic scale to get the graph going up again. The OIC system must be used and all data plotted and circulated to the Executives in an org before this system will work. If the OIC system is put into effect fully the executive can then (and only then) let go the comm lines and let the traffic flow. He then only needs to: 1. Keep alert for and correct Dev-T (off-line, off-policy, off-origin and non-compliance); 2. Keep an eye on the weekly OIC charts; 3. Find from OIC the upward trends and inspect and find out what's working so well it can be reported; 4. Be alert to any down dip and inspect the activity itself and correct the matter; and 5. Spend most of his time getting his own job done (since executives do have jobs be-sides supervision). The one thing he mustn't do is \"get reasonable\" about dips or zooms and not act to really check the decline or to reinforce the rise: (a) Thinking one does know when he has not gotten it inspected closely; (b) Not believing the graph and Indicators; and (c) Not acting, are the fatal errors. Doing 1 to 5 tells us who's an executive and doing (a), (b) and (c) tells us who should-n't be an executive. If this system is in effect the org can't help but boom. We will call this the Fast Flow System of Management. It is a very precise art. It's like auditing. One predicts the slumps and reinforces the tendency to boom. It can't miss.

Example: Letter out statistic falls and falls. In investigating look for the last major change in that area and if possible cancel it and the statistic will then rise. Let us say that just at the top of the down drop, the 3rd week in November, the Dept of Registration was given new dictation equipment. Take it away and restore the old arrangement and routing pattern that was in use with it and sit back and see what happens. The statistic will probably recover. Example: The Field Staff Member Commission statistic has been very low and sud-denly leaps to affluence. You want to reinforce it so you study what happened just before it. As it takes a bit of time on a statistic that has longer comm lines, you look a bit earlier. You find the Dir Clearing began to send FSMs big info packets they could give people. So you okay lots of such info packets to be given out and the affluence of the statistic continues. And you write LRH what made it do that so a Pol Ltr can be written. I learned this while researching the life force of plants. Everytime I saw a research bed of plants worsen, I queried what routine had been varied and found invariably some big change had been made that wasn't usual. It is change that changes things for better or for worse. That's the simplicity of the natural law. If you want to hold a constant condition, don't change anything. If you are trying to improve something make changes cautiously and keep a record of what is changed (like all orders must be by SEC EDs). Then you watch statistics and if they decline you hastily wipe out the last change. And if they improve you reinforce the change that began it. For instance we know the 7 Division System pattern works for the better it's gotten in in an org the more its graphs go up. The Org Board of summer 1964 also works for a small org because it started their sta-tistics up. But it was not good enough to maintain height of statistic when a certain size was reached. So we got the 7 Division pattern of 1965."},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"STATISTICS, ACTIONS TO 2 HCO PL 1.02.66 IV TAKE STATISTIC CHANGES ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 300 DATA SERIES It is of course obvious that if Joe as Org Sec did okay and if replaced with Bill who is only 15 the Org Division will falter. But frankly it is not just a personnel question by far. Personnel equates against case gain more than personality. In December 1965 at Saint Hill, the gross divisional statistics very closely matched the case progress of the Secretaries of each division. You can almost assign a post by: 1. Grade of Release, and 2. Leadership Survey, plus 3. Experience in org. Those 3 factors take into no account personality or aptitude much contrary to all the tests the 19th Century psychologist or 18th Century phrenologist would have made and used. So while personnel changes are always a possible reason for radical shifts in statistics, they are by no means the major ones. Shifts of comm lines, functions, policies, equipment, duties, locations are quite often far more responsible for graph shifts. Personnel comes into it this way: When you make a bad rearrangement and you have an incompetent personnel also you have disaster! If you make a bad rearrangement and the personnel are good the statistic drop may be only a small one as they cope. So even small drops should be investigated, particularly around good personnel. The morals are these: If you have a disaster (big Danger Condition) find the big change which preceded it or the missed order and get that fixed and also shift personnel. If you see a person who has a good record coping like mad, inspect the area of that post to find what needs fixing up, what changes were made that overpressured that post and get it right. THE PAUSED STATISTIC During expansion, one has areas where statistics become level. Here statistics pause because lines jam. People get overworked and confused. The traffic is just too heavy. And where do you really repair in such a case? More clerks? No! Always look to the lines of the highest post in the overloaded area and get them eased. In expansion the person who never notices is the man in charge. And his lines are the most crippling to the org if jammed. Example: Org Sec and Org Division stacked up and coping frantically. Org Exec Sec wonders what to do. Their statistics are paused (in a level line). They are overworked. Hire"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"STATISTICS, ACTIONS TO 3 HCO PL 1.02.66 IV TAKE STATISTIC CHANGES ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 301 DATA SERIES more clerks? No. Sort out the Org Sec and be sure more help is furnished on that post. Then the Org Sec (with a personal Secretary to sort her mail, etc.) looks up and starts sorting out the Division. The old trick I used to use was to tell an overworked director \"Draw me up a list of all the hats you are wearing\". And he or she would finally bring one in, round-eyed. \"35 hats!\" I recall one saying. I would take the one nearest the director in duties and rill it with a staff member and the department would ease off. Somebody like the Div 7 Sec or the LRH Communicator can do this to Exec Sees. If they are slaving, make them put on somebody to unjam their lines. They'll straighten the rest out. So a paused statistic comes from the jammed lines of the topmost executives and is best remedied by easing them. ___________________ An org today is not run on personalities. It's run on statistics.

It is not possible to draw the graph at all if the line changes are too large. If the ups and downs are not plainly visible on a graph then those interpreting the graph make errors. What is shown as a flat looking line really should be a mountain range. By Scale is meant the number of anything per vertical inch of graph. The way to do a scale is as follows: Scale is different for every statistic. 1. Determine the lowest amount one expects a particular statistic to go – this is not al-ways zero. 2. Determine the highest amount one can believe the statistic will go on the next three months. 3. Subtract 1 from 2. 4. Proportion the vertical divisions as per 3. Your scale will then be quite real and show up its rises and falls. Here is an incorrect example. We take an org that runs at £500 per week. We proportion the vertical marks of the graph paper of which there are 100 so each one represents £100. This when graphed will show a low line, quite flat, no matter what the org income is doing and so draws no attention from executives when it rises and dives. This is the correct way to do it for gross income for an org averaging £500/week. 1. Looking over the old graphs of the past 6 months we find it never went under £240. So we take £200 as the lowest point of the graph paper. 2. We estimate this org should get up to £1,200 on occasion in the next 3 months so we take this as the top of the graph paper."},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"STATISTIC GRAPHS, 2 HCO PL 6.03.66 II HOW TO FIGURE THE SCALE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 304 DATA SERIES 3. We subtract £200 from £1,200 and we have £1,000. 4. We take the 100 blocks of vertical and make each one £10, starting with £200 as the lowest mark. Now we plot gross income as £10 per graph division. This will look right, show falls and rises very clearly and so will be of use to execu-tives in interpretation. Try to use easily computed units like 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and show the scale itself on the graph. (1 div = 25.) The element of hope can enter too strongly into a graph. One need not figure a scale for more than one graph at a time. If you go onto a new piece of graph paper, figure the scale all out again and as the org rises in activity sheet by sheet the scale can be accommodated. For example it took 18 months to get Saint Hill statistics up by a factor of 5 (5 times the income, etc) and that's several pieces of graph paper, so don't let scale do more than represent current expectancy. On horizontal time scale, try not to exceed 3 months as one can get that scale too con-densed too, and also too spread out where it again looks like a flat line and misinforms. Correct scaling is the essence of good graphing. L.

How one draws one. But the subject of what they mean after they are drawn is another subject and one which execu-tives should know well. Things are not always what they seem in statistics. BACKLOGS A backlog caught up gives one a high soaring statistic which promptly slumps. To call the soar affluence and the slump emergency is an executive error. When you see a leaping and diving pattern on something that can be backlogged you can be very sure it has been. This activity is working in fits and starts, usually only occasionally manned. For a long time, nothing is done or counted, then suddenly a month's worth is all counted in one week. So when you see one of these draw a line halfway between peaks and depressions, more or less the same distance from each and you can then read the statistic as rising or fal-ling. CAUSATIVE STATISTICS In any set of statistics of several kinds or activities, you can always find one or more that are not \"by luck\" but can be directly caused by the org or a part of it. An example is the \"Letters Out\" and \"Completions\". Gross Divisional Statistics. Whatever else is happening, the org itself can improve these as they depend only on the org, not on \"fate\". So if you see the gross divisional statistics generally down or going down for the last couple or three weeks and yet see no beginning upsurge in the current week in \"Letters Out\""},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"STATISTIC ANALYSIS 2 HCO PL 6.11.66 I ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 306 DATA SERIES and \"Completions\", you know that the org's management is probably inactive and asking to be removed. For if they saw all stats going down they should have piled in on \"Letters Out\" and \"Completions\" amongst other things as the least they could do. They can push those up. So amongst any set of statistics are those which can be pushed up regardless of the rest and if these aren't, then you know the worst – no management. ENROLLMENT vs COMPLETIONS If you see a statistic going up in \"Completions\" and see a falling \"Enrollment\" statistic you know at once the body repeat sign-up line is out. People who graduate are not being handed their Certs and Awards by a Registrar but are being given them by Certs and Awards or in mass meetings, or in some way repeat sign-up is not being procured. Thus the 40% to 60% repeat sign-up business is being lost. This also means, if continued over a long period of time, that bad technology is pre-sent as poor word-of-mouth advertising is going around. Look in such a case at a third statistic, Qual Collections. If this is poor or very, very high, you can be sure that lack of enrollments is caused by bad tech. A very high Qual Collections statistic and a low enrollment statistic is a terrible con-demnation of the Tech Division. Gross income will soon after collapse as tech service just isn't good. COMPARING STATISTICS Thus you get the idea. Statistics are read against each other. A statistic is a difference between two or more periods in time so is always compara-tive. Also two different statistics are comparative such as in examples above. PREDICTION You can predict what is going to happen far in advance of the occurrence, using statis-tics. High book sales mean eventual prosperity. Low book sales mean eventual emergency all along the line. High gross income and low completions mean eventual trouble as the org isn't deliver-ing but is \"backlogging\" students and pcs simply by not getting results. Carried on long enough this means eventual civic and legal trouble."},{"pageNumber":327,"pageContent":"STATISTIC ANALYSIS 3 HCO PL 6.11.66 I ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 307 DATA SERIES Low FSM commissions may only mean no FSM programme. But if there is an FSM programme, then it may mean bad tech. So a low Completion and low Qual will mean an eventual collapsed FSM statistic also as the FSM's own area is being muddied up by failed cases. High book sales, high letters out, high Tech and high Qual statistics mean the gross income statistic will soon rise. If these are low then gross income will fall. Bills owed and cash in hand are read by the distance between the two lines. If it is nar-rowing, things are improving; if widening, things are getting worse. If they are far apart and have not closed for a long while, with the cash graph below, the management is dangerous and not at all alert. THE DANGEROUS GRAPH All statistics on one set of graphs giving a sinking trend line is a dangerous situation. One draws a trend line by choosing the mid-way point between highs and lows and drawing a line. If all these lines or most of them are down, the management is inactive. FALSE COMBINATIONS When a Continental Org includes its own org on its combined graphs for area orgs it can have a very false picture. Its own org's stats obscure those of the area orgs which may be dying. Thus if you include a big function with a lot of small ones on a combined graph you can get a very false idea. Thus, graph big functions as themselves and keep them out of small functions of the same kind. The Continental Org should not be part of a Continental Exec Div's statistics. Simi-larly SH stats should not be part of WW's. A combined statistic is of course where you take the same stats from several functions and add them up to one line. A very large function added into a combined graph can therefore obscure bad situations. It can also obscure a totally inactive senior management as the big function under its own management may be wholly alert and competent but the senior man-agement is masked from view by this one going concern, whereas all its other points except the big one may be collapsing."},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"STATISTIC ANALYSIS 4 HCO PL 6.11.66 I ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 308 DATA SERIES THE BIGGEST MISTAKE The one big godawful mistake an executive can make in reading and managing by graph is being reasonable about graphs. This is called Justifying A Statistic. This is the sin-gle biggest error in graph interpretation by executives and the one thing that will clobber an org. One sees a graph down and says \"Oh well, of course, that's...\" and at that moment you've had it. I have seen a whole org tolerate a collapsed Completions graph for literally months because they all \"knew the new type process wasn't working well.\" The Tech Sec had JUSTI-FIED his graph. The org bought it. None thought to question it. When it was pointed out that with the same processes the preceding Tech Sec had a continual high graph and a suppressive was looked for it turned out to be the Tech Sec! Never JUSTIFY why a graph continues to be down and never be reasonable about it. A down graph is simply a down graph and somebody is goofing. The only explanation that is valid at all is \"What was changed just before it fell? Good. Unchange it fast!\" If a graph is down it can and must go up. How it is going to go up is the only interest. \"What did we do each time the last few times just before it went up? Good. Do it!\" Justifying a graph is saying, \"Well, graphs are always down in December due to Christmas.\" That doesn't get it up or even really say why it's down! And don't think you know why a graph is up or down without thorough investigation. If it doesn't stay up or continues down then one didn't know. It takes very close study on the ground where the work is done to find why a graph suddenly rose or why it fell. This pretended knowledge can be very dangerous. \"The graph stays high because we send out the XY Info Packet\" as a snap judgment may result in changing the Dissem Sec who was the real reason with his questionnaires. And the graphs fall suddenly even though no Info Packet change occurred. GROSS REASONS Graphs don't fall or rise for tiny, obscure, hard to find reasons. As in auditing, the er-rors are always BIG. Book sales fall. People design new flyers for books, appropriate display money, go mad trying to get it up. And then at long last one discovers the real reason. The book store is always shut. A big reason graphs fall is there's nobody there. Either the executive is double hatted and is too busy on the other hat, or he just doesn't come to work."},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"STATISTIC ANALYSIS 5 HCO PL 6.11.66 I ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 309 DATA SERIES STICKY GRAPHS Bad graphs which resist all efforts to improve them are made. They don't just happen. A sticky graph is one that won't rise no matter what one does. Such a graph is made. It is not a matter of omission. It is a matter of action. If one is putting heavy effort into pushing a graph up and it won't go up then there must be a hidden counter-effort to keep it down. You can normally find this counter-effort by locating your biggest area of non-compliance with orders. That person is working hard to keep graphs down. In this case it isn't laziness that's at fault. It's counter-action. I have never seen an org or a division or a section that had a sticky graph that was not actively pushing the graph down. Such areas are not idle. They are not doing their jobs. They are always doing some-thing else. And that something else may suddenly hit you in the teeth. So beware of a sticky graph. Find the area of non-compliance and reorganize the per-sonnel or you, as an executive, will soon be in real hot water from that quarter. Those things which suddenly reared up out of your In basket, all claws, happened after a long period of sticky graphs in that area. Today's grief was visible months ago on your stats. SUMMARY The simple ups and downs of graphs mean little when not watched over a period of time or compared to other graphs in the same activity. One should know how to read stats and what they mean and why they behave that way so that one can take action in ample time. Never get reasonable about a graph. The only reason it or its trend is down is that it is down. The thing to do is get it up. L.

Another way, often used in conjunction with the above, is to pound a key executive with alarming entheta about staff, divisions or activities. This urges the key executive to take uncalled for action which upsets things and which may lead to the dismissal of valuable staff. Also it is a symptom of an org under external pressure to come down on its own per-sonnel rather than on the public or on real SPs. SPs tend to vanish in memory since they speak in generalities. \"Always\" \"everyone\" salt their language so that when you say, \"Who told you?\" in tracing a rumor, it is hard to re-member since \"everyone\" seems to have said it. Actually the SP who did say it used \"every-one\" in his comm so often as to become in memory \"everyone\". A good manager ignores rumor and only acts on statistics. Had I heeded over the years any rumormonger, we would have no orgs. I generally don't listen and if I do, only go so far as inspecting stats. It is easy to discipline staff and hard to discipline the public. A lazy executive only disciplines staff. It takes more confront to tackle the public. When an executive listens to rumor and bad things about his fellow staff members without looking at the actual production statistics, that executive can harm the org badly. I have never tried to make staff members \"be good\". I have only tried to make them produce and wear their hats. Our whole statistic system exists to end excessive discipline of valuable staff mem-bers. To me a staff member whose stats are up can do no wrong. I am not interested in wog morality. I am only interested in getting the show on the road and keeping it there. Also I detest having to discipline anyone for anything, particularly a Scientologist. And the only discipline I use is to hold the fort until people are clear enough to see the light. They always do. All misconduct comes from aberration."},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"DISCIPLINE SPS AND ADMIN 2 HCO PL 15.8.67 HOW STATISTICS CRASH ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 312 DATA SERIES However if anyone is getting industrious trying to enturbulate or stop Scientology or its activities I can make Captain Bligh look like a Sunday school teacher. There is probably no limit on what I would do to safeguard Man's only road to freedom against persons who, disdaining processing, seek to stop Scientology or hurt Scientologists. I well know Man's fixation on trying to make \"everybody good\". Which means, really, inactive. The best men I have had in wars routinely have been continually arrested and gener-ally frowned on by \"shore patrols\", \"military police\", etc. To the body politic a quiet person is the ideal. When the guns begin to go, these quiet ones are all hiding and only the active ones are there to fight. I often wonder what would happen to a state if it did achieve its apparent goal of making one and all inactive little sheep. So I don't care what men or women do if they just wear their hats and keep their stats up. Only when Scientology is being slowed or stopped do you find me rigging up the tools of discipline. In actual fact I rather hold the person who is inactive because he is afraid of punish-ment in contempt. I respect only those who are strong enough to be decent without the \"self protection\" of evil. I use discipline to hold the edges of a channel, not to stop the flow. SPs love to coax those with power to slay. As the basic ambition of any SP is \"every-body dead so I can be safe\" he or she will use all manner of lies and mechanisms to excite a thirst for discipline in those in power. If I ever heed any \"Kill everybody\" advice it is to put the adviser up against a brick wall. ____________________ All evil stems from aberration. And it can be pretty evil. And awfully aberrated. The only road out from evil is processing. Therefore one must protect the road to freedom as the answer to evil and must protect as well all those who are working to keep the road in. The world will never become good because of discipline or oppression of evil. All dis-cipline pre-supposes that the person being disciplined wants to survive. The truly evil only want to succumb so discipline threat is no answer. The truly evil love pain and suffering and deprivation. So it coerces nothing and improves nothing when you seek to solve all evil with discipline. Only the already decent can be disciplined. It only obliges the evil ones. So all you can do really is to get the evil ones parked off the lines. The Executive in disciplining is concerned with those who would stop or hinder the flow and those who are just plain idle or stupid. So he severely leaves alone all up stats and only acts to move the suppressives off the lines and not let the idle and stupid slow the flow. An executive could never make the world reform by discipline alone. He can by processing. So his only use of discipline is to continue to make processing possible. It's as simple as that.

There can be a tendency for management and staffs to believe an org is all right be-cause it has a rising gross income graph. This is not true. The Gross Divisional Statistics must be observed before the Gross Income can mean very much. \"We can't touch the South Lansing Org because its GI is on a rising trend.\" \"The EC was changed when the GI was rising.\" \"I was wrongly removed because the GI was rising.\" These are all meaningless statements unless we studied all the Gross Divisional Statistics. Statistics must be studied and judged alongside the other related statistics. A rising income graph can even be shown sometimes as an actual threat to an org if the Tech delivery stats are down and stay down. It means the org is selling and not delivering and may very well crash shortly. A high Qual graph once got a Qual Sec removed. It was high because Qual ran a cam-paign against Tech, invalidating gains so the pcs would have needed reviews. A high Qual Income graph compared to a low \"successful hours delivered\" graph in Tech can mean the org is sick. Tech isn't delivering good service so Qual is in Affluence. Low books sold means the org will fall flat in a few months. Low outflow means trouble soon. An income graph needs the bills figure (Cash-Bills Ratio Graph) to see if the org is solvent and is handling its Financial Planning well. It might be costing far more than it makes. An org can have an increasing gross income graph and a much more rapidly increas-ing bills graph. It is unhealthy and may crash. A good Cash-Bills ratio with low bulk mailing means the org is staying solvent but not promoting – and it will go to pieces soon. Somebody is idiotically saving money on promotion and probably wasting it like mad elsewhere. It has happened often. The GI should be rising. That seen, the next action is to reinforce it by making all the other Gross Divisional Statistics rise also, making bills go down and reserves go up.

Stats posted and looked over but reasonably explained. The head of an organization or division who is not going to make it operates this way: Handling everything and too busy to organize and enforce stats. Sooner or later but we hope at some time he will realize that he is only handling un-worn hats that result in no stats.

If one does not devote some time to organizing then his cope will increase and he will drown for sure with increased cope. If everyone in an org wore his hat there wouldn't be odd bits left to handle. If an org staff half wears its hats then everyone in the org is wearing some piece of everyone else's hats and the result is bedlam. At the top there is total cope. A measuring stick for a worn hat is a stat. Half worn hats have half stats or none. By making sure every post is filled and every post has a stat, one can then progress toward less and less cope, more and more result. If the stats are an indication of the Ideal Scene then low stats show a departure from the Ideal Scene and one can find out why and get the stat up again. Thus the Ideal Scene can be approached. Down stats or none at all are a wide departure from the Ideal Scene. Where the stats are lowest or absent the departure is greatest. For example, one org's individual stats were very low.

I know why . . . . . .\" \" . . . . . .I know why . . . . . .\" That off the cuff \"I know why\" without even looking carries with it a spectator flavour unless one (1) went and looked and (2) figured out how to get it up. One area with 15 blown students using a \"I know why, Joe graduated\" explanation is being a bit kooky. \"Yes, we know all the stats are down but there's been a football game . . . . . .\" is a big out-point statement in itself. I traced some of these \"I know whys\" down once and found them covering up holes you could lose an elephant in. The \"Joe graduated\" explanation for lowered point stats dis-closed a 50% non-attendance being neglected! So this off the cuff shrug showed a hat not being worn, seniors sweating and the head of the place madly trying to handle other complications arising from the same post. So if you don't have stats and they're not collected and posted and used prepare to do an awful lot of coping! Also prepare to have injustice, overload of good workers, heavy ethics, unpleasantness and overloaded seniors. To have anything running one has to have stats, they have to be computed, posted and used. Locating the real Why of down stats takes a considerable study of the area where they are down. The gross outnesses are usually  Inadequate personnel procurement  Inadequate training for or on post  Inadequate Org Bd  Use of PR instead of sweat to get by. One lesson you learn when you have been at this for a while: The income of an org is totally under its own control."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"STATISTIC MISMANAGEMENT 3 HCO PL 16.08.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 319 DATA SERIES All public flaps and catastrophes do is upset the staff. They have almost no effect on public or inflow potential. One could even say that public flaps are assisted by down stats in the org. The staff, having produced poorly or poor quality of basic product then invites a flap. Down stats generate down stats. In this universe and on this planet in particular there are a lot of nuts. They would fight baby rattles if they thought it threatened their baby poisoning business! The percentage of nuts is about 10%. Of that 10% 2½% are the Chief Nuts. They are so crazy one almost has to help them shoot himself. When Dianetics was not used for 18 years (1953-1969) to handle illness orgs eventu-ally got into trouble = No Dn stat. When Scientology was not fully used (1965-1970) there was a lot of public trouble. The most trouble was in 1968 when neither Dn nor Scn was in use. So a no product no stat condition is the same graph as the trouble graph. But the org stats were affected only internally! By Internal causes! So any org determines it? own stats – all of them! So the basic gross outness re stats is not to have real stats and not to compute, publish, use and push them up. The \"I know why\" doesn't carry with it a \"let's find a Why that we can remedy and push the stat up\". While all this is modified of course by whether or not you have an org product you can do and offer, it is a comment that the quality of the product and creating a demand for it only determines the ceiling of the org as a whole. Having a real product that one does well brings about an almost no-ceiling condition. As I write this our ceiling is retarded only by the necessity of catching up with 18 years of disuse of Dianetics and 5 years of Scientology \"quickie delivery\". We are issuing new scenes and stats at this writing that give an index of quality of product delivered. That takes off the ceiling. The only thing that could go wrong is not establishing, collecting, computing, posting and using the stats to establish a nearer and nearer approach to the Ideal Scene, not just for us but for the planet.

Trend means the tendency of statistics to average out up, level or down over several weeks or even months as long as the situation remains. The closer one is to the scene of the stat, the more rapidly it can be adjusted and the smaller the amount of time per stat needed to interpret it. One can interpret one's own personal statistic hour to hour. A division head can interpret on a basis of day to day. An Executive Secretary needs a few days' worth of stat. An Executive Director would use a week's worth of stat. A more remote governing body would use a Trend (which would be several weeks) of divisional stats to interpret. In short the closer one is to a statistic the easier it is to interpret it and the easier it is to change it. One knows he had no stat on Monday – he didn't come to work. So Tuesday he tries to make up for it. At the other end of the scale, a Continental Executive Council would have to use a trend of weeks to see what was going on. Trends can be anything from Danger to Power, depending on the slant and its steep-ness. This would be a Danger Trend: (plotted by weeks) The dotted line is drawn roughly through an average in all Trend cases."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"STAT INTERPRETATION 2 HCO PL 3.10.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 322 DATA SERIES This would be an Emergency Trend: As you can see, it is not so steep.

The Trend however is barely normal as the single surge did not maintain itself."},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"STAT INTERPRETATION 4 HCO PL 3.10.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 324 DATA SERIES REMOTE MANAGEMENT Not knowing Trends, remote management can err. An Org or Division may be in an Affluence Trend and because the last week's stat was a bit down, actions can be (and have been in the past) taken against the org or one of its divisions and broke the winning streak. The reason for this Policy Letter is several cases of remote management failures to use trends to estimate the state of an org by its stats. A remark \"All GDSes were down\" could be at first glance factual until it was seen that all GDSes were in Affluence Trend. REASON The reason for this is found in the Data Series Policy Letters. A valid statistic is the best indicator of the Ideal Scene. When an Org or Division has departed from its Ideal Scene, it cannot be made to re-cover in an instant. The re-approach to the Ideal Scene for a group is by a gradient approach because so much has to be done. One can't ordinarily jump from making 2 cars a week for months to 2,000 cars a week in one week. Workers, tools, materials, machinery out of use all have to be moved back into line. It may go to 15 cars, then 120 cars then 200 cars then 750 cars then 800 cars then 20 cars then 1,000 cars then 1,500 cars then 1,800 then 2,000. It is so easy for a thetan to postulate a fact and so arduous to move it into Mest Uni-verse existence that management tends to be impatient. \"Get CF Straight\" takes 1½ seconds to say but may take 6 weeks of time for a manned up specially appointed crew to accomplish. \"Get CF Straight\" is easily said to an existing undermanned staff. They do but \"Letters Out\" falls to 10 from 1,200. It is so easy to think it. But thinking it isn't doing it. The right way is to program it. \"Recruit 2 new staff members. Hat and train on CF. Get CF straight\" is the right statement. Why stats go up and down traces to backlogs being caught up, to new projects given overloaded staffs, to unreal planning, to Finance squabbles and failures to hire, hat, train and program. So wildly varying stats in an org's divisions almost always mean Finance poorly han-dled, hiring, hatting, training is poor. Utilization of staff is not good. But by Trend it shows the overall tendency to approach or depart from the Ideal Scene."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"STAT INTERPRETATION 5 HCO PL 3.10.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 325 DATA SERIES When you are close up you can do something about it and when you are far away the day's or the week's stat has already changed before any order could ever arrive. In remote management, not managing by Trend is a serious fault as one's orders are always rather unreal. An upward Trend even if only slightly upward shows people are trying and level or downward shows it is in trouble. Trend is the overall measure of expansion or contraction and is the most valuable of stat messages. L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH:sb.rd"},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":" ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 327 DATA SERIES HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO POLICY LETTER OF 5 MAY 1971 Issue II Remimeo OEC Checksheet READING STATISTICS In a local org area one reads the Division stats for the week. A Dept reads its stats by the day. A section does it by the hour. You can also read all Div GDSes by the day; success-ful orgs do. Trends are used in more remote areas from the org, to indicate successful leadership or broad admin or tech situations. Trends are used locally to estimate expansion or warn of contraction. Thus in weekly condition assignments one only considers two things: that exact week and the slant of that one line. Steep near vertical down: Non E. Down: Danger. Slightly down or level: Emergency. Slightly up: Normal. Steeply up: Affluence. Near vertical up: Power. The volume of the stat has little to do with it. Level at high or level at low are alike Emergency. The proof of this is that you always find a why and it's always some change. Typical argument about stats: \"I know it's down a bit but it's so high generally that it's Power.\" \"I know it rose but it's so low that it's really Non E.\" All this is being reasonable. Status think. When you don't value stats this way you don't catch the improvements or flubs that, piled up, wreck an org. I recall a DofT who had high high stats. One week they plunged. He said, \"Oh of course. We graduated some students and . . . . . . .\" But I rejected that and looked and looked and lo and behold they'd changed their method of handling students! This, found and repaired, sent their stats soaring! When you let status reasoning get into stat assignment of conditions, the org has had it! The weekly condition assignments must be accurate. Only in that way can one main-tain expansion. Also, it's a bit mean to nag around about a rise. \"But it isn't much of a rise, you're really in too low a range to have a rise count . . . . . . .\" A rise is a rise. They at least got more. Now, better organizing, they will get more than that. Week by week it goes up."},{"pageNumber":348,"pageContent":"READING STATISTICS 2 HCO PL 5.05.71 II ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 328 DATA SERIES Similarly to discount a fall just because stats are high high high is folly. They could do week before last's as they did it. So what was wrong that they couldn't do it again? If they got exhausted at it week before last they need more help, obviously. Or better organization. Only if you use the single week can you properly locally manage. If you keep it up the org will start to occupy more space, need more people, need more equipment. Actually the area control of the org increases and stability and viability increase. If stat declines for the week are brushed off the org will shrink, become less stable, will demand more work by fewer and will be a burden. When you manage by the stat you don't go wrong. But it has to be an honest stat and explanations that aren't the real why have to be rejected. As you work with this, all becomes revealed. And one has a total control of survival. L.

Therefore outpoints indicate departures. It must follow then that rationality is connected to an ideal scene. These three assumptions should be studied, observed and fully grasped. They are very adventurous assumptions at first glance for if they are true then one has not only the definition of sanity in an organization or individual but also of neurosis and psy-chosis. One also sees that organizations or social groups or companies or any third dynamic (the urge to survival as a group) activity can be neurotic or psychotic. It therefore would follow that the technology of the ideal scene, existing scene, depar-tures, outpoints and statistics would contain or indicate the means of establishing sane groups or individuals or measuring their relative sanity or re-establishing relative sanity in them. THE PLAGUE OF MAN Man has been harassed by irrationality in individual and group conduct since there has been Man. The existing scene of Man's activities is so immersed in departures and outpoints that at first survey there would seem to be no possible handling of the situation. Most people have accepted the existing conditions as \"inevitable\" and toss them off with a \"that's life.\" This is of course an overwhelmed attitude. And it is true that the departure from any ideal is so distant as to obscure any feeling of reality about possibly achieving an ideal scene even in a limited area. Philosophies exist to \"prove\" that chaos is needful to furnish challenge. That is like saying \"Be glad you're crazy\" (as 19th century psychologists did say). Or \"Suffering refines one,\" as the playwrights of the early 20th century so fondly used in their plots. One whole religious order preached the necessity to accept Man as he is."},{"pageNumber":352,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 2 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 332 DATA SERIES Thus Man is plagued with defeatism, has lacked technology, and civilization after civilization has succumbed, either in a flash of flame and war or in the slow erosion of grind-ing distress. Most men, it has been said, live lives of quiet desperation. One doesn't have to live through several wars to learn that Man and his leaders are something less than sane. Every sword-waving conqueror has exploited Man's seeming inability to avoid broth-erly slaughter and no conqueror or army seems to have noticed that wars only rarely shift boundaries no matter how many are killed. Europe for centuries has excelled in the develop-ment of marble orchards and failed remarkably to establish any lasting political scene at all. In other lands government leaders, who should have at least a partial duty of preserv-ing their citizenry have sat raptly listening to the advice of madmen for some centuries now. US leaders lately have taken to acting on the mental health guidance of many civilian com-mittees, each one of which contains at least one member of an organization directly connected to Russia! The country most interested in fomenting US civil commotion! A former head of CIA once cracked for a joke, \"What if there were a Russian KGB agent inside CIA?\" The shudder of horror that went through US politicians was interesting to see. Yet every new em-ployee of CIA was \"vetted\" before employment by members of two organizations connected to Russia! The \"American\" Psychological Association and the \"American\" Psychiatric Asso-ciation are directed by the World Federation of Mental Health founded by Brock Chisholm, the companion of Alger Hiss and Whittaker Chambers, the famous US communist traitors. And the US government pays the WFMH to hold congresses which are attended by Russian KGB delegates. And all intelligence given the President on Vietnam, where the US was \"fighting communism\" was passed through the hands of a man whose parents are both Rus-sian born communists. And the US Defense Department intelligence on the same war was led and \"coordinated\" by another communist-connected employee. With that many outpoints showing up in their social welfare and intelligence scene, the US government seems something less than bright in wondering, \"What riots?\" \"Why drugs?\" \"Why defeats?\" The statistics of the US welfare and social scene under the domination of the World Federation of Mental Health are soaring insanity, crime and riot graphs. It is so bad that Rus-sia will never have to fight an atomic war. The US economic, political and social scene will deteriorate and is deteriorating so rapidly that the US will have lost any will to fight or any economic or social power to resist Russia. (In case you wonder as to the factualness of data given above, it is all documented.) I have given this existing scene so that you can see the outpoints. The deteriorated state of public safety in the US is well known. The fantastic sums it spends are well known. I have given visible outpoints. One glance at psychiatric and psychological statistics (which are all negative) would tell any sane person that they must be doing something else as they were given all the money,"},{"pageNumber":353,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 3 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 333 DATA SERIES political power and authority ever needed to handle the scene. But it got worse! So, checking the scene for outpoints, one finds them directly connected to the No. 1 US enemy. Their data is marvellous for outpoints. Paid to serve the US, their literature discusses mainly abolishing boundaries and the Constitution. The US official, so drowned in the chatter and confusion of double-talk and false intel-ligence and situation reports, apparently cannot see any solution. And heaps money on his traitors and finances their avid destruction of the country. Yet, outpoints are so many and so visible that even the citizen sees them while the of-ficial remains apparently numb and inactive. Very well, Man can and does get drowned in his own irrationality. And his civiliza-tions rise and fall. Man's primary plague is irrationality. He is not in the grip of a \"death wish,\" nor is he having a love affair with destruction. He has just lacked any road out or the technology to put him on it. RESOLVING THE SCENE All the US would have to do is count up the outpoints, look at the statistics, drop their passionate affair with Russian psychiatry, conceive an ideal scene of a productive America, re-channel welfare monies into decent public works to give people jobs and improve produc-tivity per capita, knock off foreign funds and wars, give the money to increasing the value of American resources and even now the US would become all right. National production would catch up with destructive inflation, money would return to value and an ideal national scene would be approached. Even the military-industrial clique would be happy making bulldozers instead of tanks and youth would have a future in sight instead of a foreign-made grave. The odd part of it is, even the Senate and House would vote for such a program as their own statis-tic today is how much federal money can they bring home to their own states. The only ones that would resist are the people who are the ones causing the above outpoints and who knowingly or unknowingly serve other masters than the US. And that's a simple security problem after all. I have put the example on a large canvas just to show that the steps of handling depar-tures are the same for all situations large or great. When done this way, by the steps mentioned in the Data Series, big situations can be analyzed as well as little ones. Available resources and all that play a part in getting the solution into effect. But the cost in time and action of the original effort to introduce the cycle of revertment to an ideal scene is not anywhere near as costly as letting the departure continue. The easier thing to do in all cases is to work out the ideal scene, survey the existing scene for outpoints, work out statistics that should exist, find out WHY the departure, pro-gram a gradient solution back to the ideal, settle the practical aspects of it and go about it."},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 4 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 334 DATA SERIES LOSING ONE'S WAY One's direction is lost to the degree one fails to work out the ideal scene. It is so easy to toss off an \"ideal scene\" that is not the ideal scene that one can begin with a false premise. As he tries to work with an incorrect \"ideal scene\" for an activity he may fail and grow discouraged without recognizing that he is already working with an omitted datum-the real ideal scene for that activity. This is a major reason one can lose one's way in handling a situation. Also in trying to find a why of departure one may refuse to admit that something he himself did was the reason for the departure-or why the ideal scene never took place. It re-quires quite a bit of character to recognize one's own errors; it is much easier to find them in a neighbor. Thus one may choose the wrong why, for this and other reasons. Failures to examine the scene, reasonableness which causes blindness to the obvious, errors of penetration and defensive reasons not to admit it all impede a proper analysis. The existing scene may be missing in one's view because one doesn't really look at it or because one has no correct ideal scene for it. Many would rather blame or justify than be honest. Others would rather criticize than work. But this all adds up to outpoints in the examination itself. If one keeps at it one will however arrive at the right answers with regard to any scene. BUILDING THE IDEAL SCENE To suppose one can instantly hit upon an ideal scene for any activity without further test is to be very fond of one's own prejudices. There is however a test of whether you have the ideal scene or not. Can you staticize it? Strangely, but inevitably, since we live in the physical universe where there is both time and association of beings with beings and the physical universe and the physical uni-verse with itself, there is a production-consumption factor in all living. There seems to be a ratio between producing and consuming, and establishing it would probably resolve that strange subject, economics, as well as social welfare and other things. It seems to be fatal to consume without producing. Many social observations teach us this. Evidently one cannot, at the physical universe level, produce without consuming. And it seems that it is destructive to produce only and consume too little. One can produce far more than one consumes. apparently, but cannot consume far more than one produces. This seems to be true of groups."},{"pageNumber":355,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 5 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 335 DATA SERIES Some dreamers puffing on a hash pipe of unreality believe one can really be happy producing nothing and consuming everything. The idyllic ideal of a paradise where no one produces has been tried. In interviewing secretaries in New York I found the larger percentage had the personal ideal scene of \"marrying a millionaire.\" Aside from there not being that many millionaires, the dream of idle luxury forever was so far from any possible ideal scene that it was busy ru-ining their lives and giving their current male escorts a life of critical hell. One, having mar-ried a boy who was fast on the road to becoming a millionaire, was so dissatisfied with him not being one right now that she ruined his life and hers. In short, it sounds nice, but having met a few who did marry millionaires, I can attest that they were either not producing and failing as beings or were working themselves half to death. These no-production dreams, like the harp in heaven, lead at best to suicidal boredom. Yet Madison Avenue's ads would have one believe that one and all should own all manner of cloth, wood and metal just to be alive. A whole civilization can break down, flop, on propaganda of no-production, total con-sumption. The sweat that flies off a \"workers' paradise\" would rival the Mississippi! There is some sort of balanced ratio and it favors apparently, for pride and life and happiness, higher production of something than consumption. When it gets too unbalanced in values, something seems to happen. The unhappiness and tumult in current society is oddly current with the Keynesian economic theory of creating want. It's a silly theory and has lately become to be abandoned. But it was in vogue forty years or more, as I recall. It produced the \"welfare era\" of the psy-chiatrist and the total slavery of the taxpayer! So, whatever the economics of it, an ideal scene apparently has to have a statistic or the whole thing caves in, either from lack of continuity in time, from disinterest, or from plain lack of supply. Death is possibly, could be in part, a cessation of interested production. Hard pressed, a living being dreams of some free time. Give him too much and he be-gins to crave action and will go into production and if blocked from doing so will tend to cave in. Loss of a job depresses people way out of proportion and subsequent declines often trace back to it. Destructive activities carry their own self-death. The state of veterans after wars is not always traced to wounds or privation. Destructive acts put a brand on a man. Some of this is answered by the absence of production. IDEAL SCENE AND STAT Whatever the facts and economic rules may be about production and the ideal scene, it would seem to be the case, sufficient at least for our purposes, that this rule holds good:"},{"pageNumber":356,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 6 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 336 DATA SERIES The correctly stated ideal scene will have a production statistic. The way one defines \"production\" in this is not necessarily so many things made on an assembly line. That's an easy one. It isn't just pairs of shoes. Production can be defined as the regulation or safeguarding of it, the planning or the designing of it, a lot, lot, lot of things. A stat is a positive numerical thing that can be accurately counted and graphed on a two-dimensional thing. To test the correctness of an ideal scene, one should be able to assign it a correct sta-tistic. If one can't figure out a statistic for it, then it probably is an incorrectly stated ideal scene and will suffer from departures. Wrong stats assigned the ideal scene will wreck it. A wrongly conceived ideal scene will derail the activity quickly. To understand something it is necessary to have a datum of comparable magnitude. To understand logic one needs to be able to establish what is illogic. One then has two things for comparison. The ideal scene can be compared to an existing scene. This is one way to establish the ideal scene. But both need a factor to keep them in reality. To test the ideal scene for correctness one needs to be able to formulate its statistic. The exercise of testing the statement of the ideal scene, to keep it real and not airy-fairy and unattainable, is to work out a realistic stat for it. One can go back and forth between the statistic and the stated ideal scene, adjusting one, then the other until one gets an attainable statistic that really does measure the validity of the stated ideal scene. A statistic is a tight reality, a stable point. which is to measure any departure from the ideal scene. In setting a statistic one has to outguess all efforts to falsify it (predict possible out-points in collecting it) and has to see if following the statistic would mislead anyone from the ideal scene. So let's walk back to the shoe store. Test statement of ideal scene: to make money. Test statistic: pairs of shoes sold. Now if you tried to marry up those two you'd get a prompt catastrophe. The potential departure would be immediate. We sell shoes at no profit to raise the stat, we make no money. We try only to make money, we sell cheap shoes at high cost and our customers don't come back and we don't make money."},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 7 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 337 DATA SERIES So those two are both no good. Departure would occur, indeed it already exists right in the badly worked out ideal scene and the stat. Test ideal scene: Cobblers are entitled to the shoes they make. Test statistic: how many shoes cobbler makes. So that's loopy! Test ideal scene: all citizens furnished with shoes. Test statistic: number of shoes given away. Well, that's bonkers for a shoe store in any economic set-up. The citizens for sure would have no shoes once the shoe store was empty, for if everything is given away, who'd raise cows for hides or drive nails in soles unless he had a gun held on him so what workers' paradise is this? Slave state for sure. So that's no ideal scene for a shoe store no matter how \"ideal\" it looks to a do-gooder. Too airy-fairy. Since no shoes would exist to be given away. Test ideal scene: shoes for any worker who has coupons. Test statistic: number of coupons collected. Well, maybe. In some society. But can the shoe store get shoes for the coupons? Maybe if there's enough economic police. But then this would have to be a monopoly shoe store and the quality would not be a fac-tor, So this must be an army quartermaster depot or a state monopoly. If no incentive were needed it would work. Sure would be hard on the corns but it would barely work. Rather insecure though. But this is a shoe store where people buy. Test ideal scene: to provide workers with good shoes that can be replaced from suppliers. Test statistic: ??? Number of shoes from suppliers given to workers ... Happy workers ...??? Amount of control that can be exerted on suppliers ...??? Ah. Number of shoes supplied well-shod workers. Okay, that's a QM depot. Now what's a shoe store? And we probably get what was given in an earlier example: Ideal scene: to provide people with shoes and continue in business for owner's lifetime. Statistic: percentage of citizens in area profitably shod by this store. But even this would need to be played back and forth. And if this shoe store was in a so-cialist country both might require amendment. And if it was in a beach resort thronged with tour-ists who were also mostly foreigners the ideal scene and statistic would suffer an immediate de-parture and the store would fail, crash if the ideal scene were not correctly stated and the statistic real. The class of tourist would have a bearing on it. Maybe the state has currency control demands on shopkeepers and requires them to get in foreign currency or no new stock!"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 8 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 338 DATA SERIES Thus you could get: Ideal scene: engendering acquisitiveness for novelty footwear made in this country. Statistic: pairs of gift shoes bought by foreigners. That sure would shift the whole atmosphere of the store! Thus one plays the ideal scene against the statistic. Maybe one can't find any ideal scene for the activity and no statistic of any signifi-cance to anyone. Could be that the activity is totally worthless even to oneself as a hobby. Although this opens the door to cynicism or a lazy way of not doing anything about anything, it just could be. Even a \"reporter\" who writes nothing could have an ideal scene and statistic. But it would have to be really real even then. Like, Ideal scene: unsuspected as a spy while accepted as a \"reporter.\" Statistic: cash collected for reports undetectedly delivered to my government. If that seems unreal as a scene the staff of TIME magazine recently held a mass meet-ing protesting the use of TIME credentials for government spying. \"Nobody will talk to us anymore,\" the staff of that dying WFMH mouthpiece wept. So anything could have an ideal scene, even a police state. Idealism has nothing to do with it. VIABLE The word \"viable\" means capable of living, able to live in a particular climate or at-mosphere. Life over a period of time requires viability, or the ability to survive. Any organism or any group or any part of a group must have a potential of survival. It must be viable-life-able. This is true of any ideal scene. The statistic measures directly the relative survival po-tential of the organism or its part. This tells you the plain fact that life contains the essential purpose of living, no matter how many misguided philosophers or generals may decree otherwise. The planetary population is now not fully viable since weapons exist capable of mak-ing it a billiard ball at the whim of some madman. The potential survival of the whole is of course an influence and limitation on its parts. Men who live \"only for self\" don't live. An organism or group can live a dangerous life in that it risks its survival. But is more of a threat than its enemies if it does not know or adjust its ideal scene. A military company, told on posters the ideal scene is all brag in the bar with girls on each arm, who find in fact that their actual scene is military police outside every bar with"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 9 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 339 DATA SERIES clubs and a real short life under the orders of sadistically disinterested and inexpert govern-ment, is presented with an instantly visible departure. The government believed such posters were needful to get recruits and did not realize that a truthfully stated scene and an effort to promote survival to commanders would also have recruited and conscription needn't be resorted to as the end product of lies. Men will become part of the most onerous and dangerous groups imaginable provid-ing the purpose is there and stated and they have a chance of survival. The ideal scene of a nation worshipping death is that of a nation that will not survive anyway. At least not as that nation. A group or an organism must be viable. The state is relative to the time the group needs to live to accomplish its purpose. Each part of a group, in any ideal scene, should contribute viability to the whole group. Production of something is mandatory on any part of a group if the group is to be fully viable. Painting, writing, music, all have positive roles in a society. So productivity, as is vi-ability, can be seen as a very broad inclusive term. The sub purposes of any group make up the sub-ideal scene of its various parts. In other words each part of a broad group has its own ideal scene and its own statistic. These combined bring about the broad group's ideal scene. The statistics each lead to viability of the part and then the whole group. In reverse, with so many parts of a planet desirous of extinguishing so many other parts, the viability of the planet becomes questionable. In an organization each part has its own ideal scene and its own statistic on up to the main ideal scene and the main statistic. In practice one works back from the ideal scene of the group into its smallest part, so that all lesser ideal scenes and lesser statistics mount up to and bring about the main ideal scene and statistic. Examining the lesser ideal scenes and statistics, one can find outpoints first in how the whole thing is organized and then the main ideal scene and the statistics and how the lesser ones bring it about. Dominant is the viability of the whole. Where any part does not support total viability it is an outpoint. Contributive is the viability of each part and cohesive is the scheme in which the lesser ideal scenes and the lesser statistics bring about the big ideal scene and the big sta-tistic. If this does not occur the non-supportive lesser ideal scene or statistic is an outpoint. Groups that falter have to have all this restudied. As departures did occur, the organi-zation itself, as part of any action, must be reexamined against experience and new greater and lesser ideal scenes and statistics must be worked out for it and put into use."},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"IRRATIONALITY 10 HCO PL 6.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 340 DATA SERIES Agreement of the group is a necessary ingredient as many reformers have learned, of-ten too late, and as many groups have seen, also generally too late.

Interpersonal relations with many strata of many societies in many lands with many activities demonstrates plainly that Man's largest and most unjust fault consists wholly of act-ing on opinion. Opinions can be as varied as the weather in Washington, all on the same subject. When one says \"opinion\" one is dealing with that morass of false reports and prejudices which make up the chaos of current social orders. Some seek an answer in status. \"If one has status one is safe\" is about as frail as a house of cards. Ask some recently deposed dictator or yesterday's idol what his status was worth. Yet many work exclusively for status. In Spain it is enough to have an executive de-gree. One doesn't have to do any executiving. Work at it? Caramba no! In capitalisms it is enough to be an heir and in communisms it is only necessary to be the son of a commissar. Work? Nyet. Revolts are protests against idle status. Where are the kings of yesteryear? Riding along on the last generation's statistics is as fatal as a diet of thin air. Undeserved status is a false statistic. Nothing is more bitterly resented, unless it is a statistic earned without status by those who live by status alone! William Stieber, the most skilled intelligence chief of the 19th century, who won the Franco-Prussian war for Bismarck, was hated by German officers because he was not a proper officer but a civilian! When German officers took over German intelligence they lost two wars in a row and the caste is very unlamentedly dead. So long as \"character\" can be reviled, so long as \"opinion\" is used, so long as govern-ments run on rumors and false reports, the social scene will continue to be a mess. You will not believe it but governments think newspaper stories are \"public opinion.\" One US President was astounded to be given a wildly enthusiastic public reception at an air-port. The press had been hammering him for a year and the poor fellow thought it was \"public opinion.\" Texts on public relations remark this strange governmental fixation on believing the press."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"WORKING AND MANAGING 2 HCO PL 7.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 344 DATA SERIES That means all a nation's enemies have to do is bribe or hire some underpaid reporters or semibankrupt publishers, and voila! it can steer the government any way it wishes! Do a survey on any personality or subject and the conflicts in opinion are revealed as fantastic. Seven witnesses to one street accident will even give seven conflicting accounts. Thus this whole field of \"opinion\" and \"reports\" is a quicksand endangering both per-sonal repute and management skill. It is so bad that wars and revolutions stem directly from the use of opinion and the ne-glect of statistics. In a chaos it is necessary to set up one point or terminal which is stable before one can really decide anything much less get anything done. A statistic is such a stable point. One can proceed from it and use it to the degree that it is a correct statistic. One can detect then, when things start to go wrong well before they crash. Using opinion or random rumors or reports one can go very wrong indeed. In fact, us-ing these without knowing the statistics one can smash a life or crash a group. The US Navy operates on the social attainments and civilized behavior of their people. A naval officer is promoted on the basis of his amiability and the social skill of his wife! A clerk is promoted because he marries the boss's daughter. A governor is elected because he could play a guitar! This is a whirlwind of chaos because of the falseness of the statistics used. So the stat used is itself an outpoint in each case. PREDICTION Outpoints are more than useful in prediction. The whole reason one does a data analysis and a situation analysis is to predict. The biggest outpoint would be a missing ideal scene, the next biggest would be a cor-rect statistic for it. If these are missing then prediction can become a matter of telling fortunes with bam-boo sticks. One predicts in order to continue the viability of an organism, an individual, a group, an organization, a state or nation or planet, or to estimate the future of anything. The more outpoints the less future. A disaster could be said to be a totality of outpoints in final and sudden culmination."},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"WORKING AND MANAGING 3 HCO PL 7.7.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 345 DATA SERIES This gives one a return to chaos. The closer one approaches a disaster the more outpoints will turn up. Thus the more outpoints that turn up the closer one is approaching a disaster. When the outpoints are overwhelming a condition of death is approached. By being able to predict, the organism or individual or group can correct the out-points before disaster occurs. Each sphere of activity has its own prediction. A group of different activities with a common goal can be predicted by the outpoints turning up in parts of the general activity. In theory if all parts of a main group or organization had an ideal scene for each, a sta-tistic and an intense interest in maintaining the ideal scene and statistic of each part, the sur-vival would be infinite. Any group or organism or individual is somewhat interdependent upon its neighbors, on other groups and individuals. It cannot however put them right unless it itself has reached some acceptable level of approach to its ideal scenes. The conflict amongst organisms, individuals and groups does not necessarily add up to \"the survival of the fittest,\" whatever that meant. It does however mean that in such conflict the best chance of survival goes to the individual, organism or group that best approaches and maintains its ideal scene, lesser ideal scenes, statistic and lesser statistics.

In auditing when one reviews or \"corrects\" a case that is running well, one has trouble. It is made trouble. Similarly on the third dynamic, correcting situations which do not exist and neglecting situations which do exist can destroy a group. All this boils down to correct investigation. It is not a slight skill. It is the basic skill behind any intelligent action. SUPPRESSIVE JUSTICE When justice goes astray (as it usually does) the things that have occurred are 3. Use of justice for some other purpose than public safety (such as maintaining a privileged group or indulging a fixed idea) or 4. Investigatory procedure. All suppressive use of the forces of justice can be traced back to one or the other of these. Aberrations and hate very often find outlet by calling them \"justice\" or \"law and or-der.\" This is why it can be said that Man cannot be trusted with justice. This or just plain stupidity brings about a neglect of intelligent investigatory proce-dures. Yet all third dynamic sanity depends upon correct and unaberrated investigatory pro-cedures. Only in that way can one establish causes of things. And only by establishing causes can one cease to be the effect of unwanted situations. It is one thing to be able to observe. It is quite another to utilize observations so that one can get to the basis of things."},{"pageNumber":376,"pageContent":"INVESTIGATORY PROCEDURE 2 HCO PL 19.9.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 356 DATA SERIES SEQUENCES Investigations become necessary in the face of outpoints or pluspoints. Investigations can occur out of idle curiosity or particular interest. They can also occur to locate the cause of pluspoints. Whatever the motive for investigation the action itself is conducted by sequences. If one is incapable mentallv of tracing a series of events or actions, one cannot investi-gate. Altered sequence is a primary block to investigation. At first glance, omitted data would seem to be the block. On the contrary, it is the end product of an investigation and is what pulls an investigation along-one is looking for omitted data. An altered sequence of actions defeats any investigation. Examples: We will hang him and then conduct a trial. We will assume who did it and then find evidence to prove it. A crime should be provoked to find who commits them. Any time an investigation gets back to front, it will not succeed. Thus if an investigator himself has any trouble with seeing or visualizing sequences of actions he will inevitably come up with the wrong answer. Reversely, when one sees that someone has come up with a wrong or incomplete an-swer one can assume that the investigator has trouble with sequences of events or, of course, did not really investigate. One can't really credit that Sherlock Holmes would say \"I have here the fingerprint of Mr. Murgatroyd on the murder weapon. Have the police arrest him. Now, Watson, hand me a magnifying glass and ask Sgt. Doherty to let us look over his fingerprint files.\" If one cannot visualize a series of actions, like a ball bouncing down a flight of stairs or if one cannot relate in proper order several different actions with one object into a proper sequence, he will not be able to investigate. If one can, that's fine. But any drilling with attention-shifting drills will improve one's ability to visualize se-quences. Why? Stuck attention or attention that cannot confront alike will have trouble in visualizing sequences. INVESTIGATIONS In HCO Policy Letter 11 May 1965 Ethics Officer Hat, HCO Policy Letter 1Sept 1965 Issue VII, HCO Policy Letter 1 Feb 1966 Issue II and pages 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Manual of Justice, the subject of investigation as applied to justice is given. It will be noted that these are sequences of actions."},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"INVESTIGATORY PROCEDURE 3 HCO PL 19.9.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 357 DATA SERIES Neglect of these items or a failure to know and follow them led here and there to sup-pressive uses of justice or to permitting orgs to be suppressed by special interest groups in the society. Indeed, had these been in and followed we would have had a great deal less trouble than we did. But investigation is not monopolized by law and order. All betterment of life depends on finding out pluspoints and why and reenforcing them, locating outpoints and why and eradicating them. This is the successful survival pattern of living. A primitive who is going to survive does just that and a scientist who is worth anything does just that. The fisherman sees seagulls clustering over a point on the sea. That's the beginning of a short sequence, point No. 1. He predicts a school of fish, point No. 2. He sails over as se-quence point No. 3. He looks down as sequence point No. 4. He sees fish as point No. 5. He gets out a net as point No. 6. He circles the school with the net, No. 7. He draws in the net, No. 8. He brings the fish on board, No. 9. He goes to port, No. 10. He sells the fish, No. 11. That's following a pluspoint-cluster of seagulls. A sequence from an outpoint might be: Housewife serves dinner. Nobody eats the cake, No. 1, she tastes it, No. 2, she recognizes soap in it, No. 3. She goes to kitchen, No. 4. She looks into cupboard, No. 5. She finds the soap box upset, No. 6. She sees the flour below it, No. 7. She sees cookie jar empty, No. 8. She grabs young son, No. 9. She shows him the set-up, No. 10. She gets a confession, No. 11. And No. 12 is too painful to describe. Unsuccessful investigators think good fish catches are sent by God and that when cake tastes like soap it is fate. They live in unsuccessful worlds of deep mystery. They also hang the wrong people. DISCOVERY All discoveries are the end product of a sequence of investigatory actions that begin with either a pluspoint or an outpoint. Thus all knowledge proceeds from pluspoints or outpoints observed. And all knowledge depends on an ability to investigate. And all investigation is done in correct sequence. And all successes depend upon the ability to do these things. L.

The purpose of the Ethics Officer is \"To help Ron clear orgs and the public if need be of entheta and enturbulation so that Scientology can be done.\" The activities of the Ethics Officer consist of isolating individuals who are stopping proper flows by pulling withholds with Ethics technology and by removing as necessary po-tential trouble sources and suppressive individuals off org comm lines and by generally en-forcing Ethics Codes. The technology of how this is done is quite precise. In a nutshell, (a) one finds an imperfect functioning of some portion of the org and then (b) finds something that one doesn't understand about it and then (c) interrogates by des-patch the individuals in that portion connected with the imperfect functioning. Just those three steps done over and over are usually quite enough to keep an org run-ning quite smoothly. On first taking over post in an enturbulated org, or in viewing a portion of the org in an enturbulated condition the actions of the Ethics Officer consist of: (1) Run back entheta by asking for names of who said it to the person who is now saying it, (2) locate those persons and find out who told them and then (3) look amongst those names for no-case-change or for potential trouble sources. Bill voices a rumour (usually with a \"they\" say ...). The Ethics Officer asks Bill what"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"ETHICS OFFICER HAT 2 HCO PL 11.5.65 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 360 DATA SERIES \"they's\" name is, Bill thinks and finally says it was Pete. The Ethics Officer locates Pete and asks Pete who told him, and when Pete says \"they\" the Ethics Officer finds out what \"they's\" name is. Pete says it was Agnes. Ethics Officer locates Agnes. Agnes maintains it is true and can't say who said it. Ethics Officer looks up Agnes' case folder or puts Agnes on a meter and sees by high or very low TA that he has a Sup-pressive. Or he finds Agnes has a suppressive husband and that she is a Potential Trouble Source. The Ethics Officer then handles it as per Ethics Policy Ltrs. In short, rumour comes from somewhere. The somewhere is a Potential Trouble Source or a Suppressive. One runs it down and applies the remedies contained in Ethics HCO Policy Letters to that person. An Ethics Officer's first job is usually cleaning up the org of its potential trouble sources and requesting a Comm Ev for the Suppressives. That gets things in focus quickly and smooths an org down so it will function. Then one looks for down statistics in the OIC Charts. These aren't understandable, of course, so one interrogates by sending Interrogatives to the people concerned. In their an-swers there will be something that doesn't make sense at all to the Ethics Officer – Example \"We can't pay the bills because Josie has been on course.\" The Ethics Officer is only looking for something he himself can't reconcile. So he sends Interrogatives to the person who wrote it and to Josie. Sooner or later some wild withhold or even a crime shows up when one does this. The trick of this \"Org Auditing\" is to find a piece of string sticking out – something one can't understand, and, by Interrogatives, pull on it. A small cat shows up. Pull with some more Interrogatives. A baby gorilla shows up. Pull some more. A tiger appears. Pull again and Wow! You've got a General Sherman tank! It isn't reasonable for people to be lazy or stupid. At the bottom you find the real cause of no action in a portion of an org or continuous upset. When you have your General Sherman, call a Court of Ethics on it. Or take action. But in actual fact you have probably already fixed it up. There's always a reason behind a bad statistic. Send out Interrogatives until you have the real reason in view. It will never be \"Agnes isn't bright.\" It is more likely, Agnes is on a typing post but never knew how to type. Or worse – the D of P audits org pcs for his own profit. Or the D of T simply never comes to work. The real explanation of a down statistic is always a very easily understood thing. If you Interrogate enough you'll get the real explanation and then you can act. Never use conduct for anything but an indicator of what you should interrogate. Never buy rumours as generalities.

There is a probable long list of Good Indicators. When these are present, Ethics is quiet and hangs onto an interrogation, etc only long enough to get policy and technology in. There is a probable long list of Bad Indicators. When these are present Ethics becomes industrious in ratio to the number of bad indicators. The first indicators, Good or Bad, are Statistics – the OIC graphs for units, sections, departments, divisions and the org. When these are rising, the rise is a Good Indicator. When these are falling the fall is a Bad Indicator. The second of these indicators, good or bad, is Technical Gains. When technology is in cases are gaining. This is a Good Indicator. When technology is out, cases are losing. This is a Bad Indicator. Ethics only exists to hold the fort long enough and settle things down enough to get technology in. Ethics is never carried on for its own sake. It is pushed home only until tech-nology is functioning and then technology resolves matters and Ethics prowls off looking for other targets.

Then things simmer down and we can begin to get tech in. That's the whole purpose of Ethics – to Get Tech in. And we use enough to do so, to get correct standard tech in and being done. When there are lots of bad indicators about – low and falling statistics, goofed cases, we get very handy with our Interrogatories and put the place very nearly under martial law – we call this a State of Emergency. Once Emergency is declared, you usually have to put a head or two on a pike to convince people that you mean it. After that necessity level rises and the place straightens up. If an Emergency is continued beyond a reasonable time, we resort to very heavy discipline and Comm Ev the executives who wouldn't get off it. Ethics, then, is applied to the degree required to produce the result of getting tech in. Once tech is really in on a person (with a case gain) or a tech division, let us say, and auditors actually audit standard processes by the book, we know it will resolve and we ease off with Ethics. Ethics, then, is the tool by which you get Good Indicators In by getting tech in. Ethics is the steam roller which smooths the highway. Once the road is open we are quite likely to skip remaining investigation and let it all be. But somebody promising to be good is never good enough. We want statistics. Bet-tered statistics. SYMPTOMS OF ORGS Orgs have various symptoms which tell us how things really are Ethic-wise. One of these is Dilettantism. DILETTANTE-ISM Dilettante = One who interests himself in an art or science merely as a pastime and without serious study. In an org, this manifests itself with \"people should live a little.\" \"One needs a rest from Scientology.\" \"One should do something else too.\" All that kind of jazz. It also manifests itself in non-consecutive scheduling, part-time students, \"because things are different in this town and people can come only two nights \". Ask what they do with other nights. Bowling. Horse-racing. Boy, you better mark the case folders of staff. You have a Suppressive aboard. Maybe six. Scientology, that saves lives, is a modern miracle, is being compared to bowling.

Ethics exists primarily to get technology in. Tech can't work unless Ethics is already in. When tech goes out Ethics can (and is expected to) get it in. For the purpose of Scientology amongst others, is to apply Scientology. Therefore when tech is in, Ethics actions tend to be dropped. Ethics continues its actions until tech is in and as soon as it is, backs off and only acts if tech goes out again. The purpose of the org is to get the show on the road and keep it going. This means production. Every division is a production unit. It makes or does something that can have a statistic to see if it goes up or down. Example: a typist gets out 500 letters in one week. That's a statistic. If the next week the same typist gets out 600 letters that's an up statistic. If the typist gets out 300 letters that's a down statistic. Every post in an org can have a statistic. So does every portion of the org. The purpose is to keep production (statistics) up. This is the only thing that gives a good income for the staff member personally. When statistics go down or when things are so organized you can't get one for a post, the staff members' pay goes down as the org goes down in its overall production. The production of an organization is only the total of its individual staff members. When these have down statistics so does the org. Ethics actions are often used to handle down individual statistics. A person who is not doing his job becomes an Ethics target. Conversely, if a person is doing his job (and his statistic will show that) Ethics is considered to be in and the person is protected by Ethics. As an example of the proper application of Ethics to the production of an org, let us say the Letter Registrar has a high statistic (gets out lots of effective mail). Somebody reports the Letter Registrar for rudeness, somebody else reports the Letter Registrar for irregular con-duct with a student. Somebody else reports the Letter Registrar for leaving all the lights on. Proper Ethics Officer action = look up the general statistics of the Letter Registrar, and seeing that they average quite high, file the complaints with a yawn."},{"pageNumber":388,"pageContent":"ETHICS PROTECTION 2 HCO PL 1.09.65 VII ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 368 DATA SERIES As the second example of Ethics application to the production of an org, let us say that a Course Supervisor has a low statistic (very few students moved out of his course, course number growing, hardly anyone graduating, a bad Academy statistic). Somebody reports this Course Supervisor for being late for work, somebody else reports him for no weekly Ad comm report and bang! Ethics looks up the person, calls for an Ethics Hearing with trimmings. We are not in the business of being good boys and girls. We're in the business of going free and getting the org production roaring. Nothing else is of any interest then to Ethics but (a) getting tech in, getting it run and getting it run right and (b) getting production up and the org roaring along. Therefore if a staff member is getting production up by having his own statistic excel-lent. Ethics sure isn't interested. But if a staff member isn't producing, shown by his bad statistic for his post, Ethics is fascinated with his smallest misdemeanor. In short a staff member can get away with murder so long as his statistic is up and can't sneeze without a chop if it's down. To do otherwise is to permit some suppressive person to simply Ethics chit every producer in the org out of existence. When people do start reporting a staff member with a high statistic, what you investigate is the person who turned in the report. In an ancient army a particularly brave deed was recognized by an award of the title of Kha-Khan. It was not a rank. The person remained what he was, but he was entitled to be forgiven the death penalty ten times in case in the future he did anything wrong. That was a Kha-Khan. That's what producing, high statistic staff members are – Kha-Khans. They can get away with murder without a blink from Ethics. The average fair to poor statistic staff member of course gets just routine ethics with hearings or courts for too many misdeeds. The low statistic fellow gets a court if he sneezes. Ethics must use all org discipline only in view of the production statistic of the staff member involved. And Ethics must recognize a Kha-Khan when it sees one – and tear up the bad report chits on the person with a yawn. To the staff member this means – if you do your job you are protected by Ethics. And if you aren't so protected and your statistic is high, cable me. L.

FEBRUARY 1966 Issue II Gen Non-Remimeo Exec Sec Hats LRH Comm Hat Exec Div DANGER CONDITIONS INSPECTIONS BY EXECUTIVE SECRETARIES, HOW TO DO THEM An Executive Secretary who does not get around his or her divisions now and then and see what is going on can make a lot of mistakes. Inspections are desirable. But when an Executive Secretary makes one he or she commonly issues an order or two, and if this is done without that division's secretary being present it is a by-pass and willy-nilly begins the formula of the Danger Condition and can unmock a section or department or even that Division. A senior can inspect, chat, advise, but must never issue an order on a by-pass unless he or she means to handle a dangerous situation and start the formula. For the formula will run, regardless, if a by-pass begins. The way to inspect, then, is to collect the seniors and go around, and issue orders only to the next senior on the command channel, never to his or her staff. Example: HCO Exec Sec wants to see if books are stored safely. The HCO Exec Sec can nip out and look on his or her lonesome providing no orders are issued. Or the HCO Exec Sec grabs the Dissem Sec and the Dir Pubs and the head of the books section and goes out and looks. And if the HCO Exec Sec wants a change in it all, the order is issued to the Dissem Sec only. It is a great temptation to tell Books-in-Charge how and where to put what, for an HCO Exec Sec is one normally because he or she is smarter and more knowledgeable about orgs. But if one is to advise Books-in-Charge, one had better have the rest of the command chain right there and talk to the next senior below HCO Exec Sec. You would be surprised how many random currents a senior type senior like an Exec Sec can set up with a few comments that skip the command channels and what a mess it can make for a Secretary or Director, no matter how wise the comments. Secretaries who order a Director's officers in the absence of the Director or, much worse, section staff without Director or Section Officer thereby court and make trouble."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"DANGER CONDITIONS INSPECTIONS BY 2 HCO PL 1.2.66 II EXECUTIVE SECRETARIES, HOW TO DO THEM ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 370 DATA SERIES You can unmock a section or a whole department by sloppy command lines. It is not merely the \"correct\" thing. It's the vital thing to follow command channels as nobody can hold his job if he is being by-passed by a senior. He feels unmocked, and the Danger Condition formula begins to unroll. The correct way to route an order to a person two or three steps down the command channel is to tell the next one below you to order the next, and so on. If you have to tell the Director of Tech Services to have his Housing Officer post a list of houses on the bulletin board, you really don't have a Director of Tech Services anyway as he would have done it as the natural thing. So an order in such an obvious case is not the right comm. The right comm is an Ethics chit on the Dir of Tech Services for not posting the avail-able houses on the bulletin board. A smart senior is a senior because he is smarter. But when this is not true and the jun-ior is smarter, you get an intolerable situation where the senior interferes. If a dull senior in-terferes continually on a by-pass, it's a sure way to start a mutiny. And a senior who doesn't inspect or get inspections done does not know and so looks dull to his juniors who have looked. The safe way in all cases is to issue orders that are very standard on-policy and obvi-ous and to issue them to the next one on the command channel and then in the future inspect or get an inspection. If on the inspection one finds non-compliance with a standard on-policy order, one promptly calls for a hearing on the next one down the line who received the order. Here's a terribly simple example: Org Exec Sec sees statistic for Tech Div down. Is-sues order to Tech Sec. \"Get the gross divisional statistic up at once.\" Now nothing could be plainer or more standard. In two weeks the Org Exec Sec looks at the statistic, sees it is even further down and calls for a hearing on the Tech Sec for non-compliance or a Comm Ev to get all the evidence in about the matter. This is about as basic as you can get with an inspection, an order and a further action all by a senior, the inspection being done by OIC and reported by graph. Life in actual fact is very simple and an org is today a very elementary mechanism. It is easy to run an organization providing one makes it run and handles things in it that refuse to run. Where an Exec Sec is baffled on occasion is the apparent unwillingness of a section to function. Now this is so far down the command channel that info on it does not easily arrive back at the top. The thing to do where possible is personally inspect. Or get it inspected. One often finds the silliest things. Example: Book Shipping statistic is really down, man, down. One orders and ha-rangues and argues trying to get books shipped. One gets the quantity of books looked into. it's okay. One gets shipping materials looked into. They're okay. A Shipping clerk is on the Org Board. But orders to the Dissem Sec just never get books shipped. So finally one gathers up the Dissem Sec.

The order? \"Break that machine up and start wrapping books by hand and I want that backlog gone in one week.\" To the Dissem Sec. of course, in front of everyone for his soul's sake. And publish the order in writing as soon as possible. So you see, you have to inspect because what seems logical and okay to juniors may be completely silly. Remember, that is why they are juniors and have seniors. Frankly you can never guess at what holds some things up. You have to look. Often you can solve it for them. But solve it with their agreement and on command channel if you want it done. You can't always sit in an ivory tower and issue orders. You have to know the ground and the business. Over a period of fifteen years of active management of these organizations I have a pretty good idea of what can happen in one. And to one. I try to be right more often than wrong. I don't try to be perfect as one's best plans are often goofed. I try to get done what can be gotten done. And I carry a little more pressure on the org that it can really accomplish. I inspect. You would be surprised at how often I do and what I find out. It sometimes looks to people that I use a crystal ball in taking the actions I take be-cause they see no possible route by which the data could have reached me. They forget how many lines I keep in operation. And also, I do operate on a \"sixth sense\". For instance all accounting summaries today are done for governments, not for man-agement. A manager has to develop a sixth sense concerning financial status of the org. One has to be able to know when the bills are up, the income inadequate and to know when to promote hard and stall creditors even with no data from accounts or contrary data that proved false. Today with OIC this is easy. But I ran orgs successfully with no OIC for years just by sensing the financial situation. In theory accounts keeps one fully posted. In actual fact they often goof in filing bills owed and even in depositing money. There are many things one can sense, OIC or no OIC. The thing to do is to inspect or to get the area you sense is wrong inspected. I have today LRH Communicators. They are pushing projects home. They also can tell me why projects won't push home because they have looked. An Exec Sec or a Secretary has HCO's Inspection and Reports and a Time Machine to check compliance.

The lazy and popular way is to generalize \"They're all confused.\" \"The organization is rickety.\" \"They're doing great.\" That's all very well but it doesn't get you much of anywhere. The way to observe so as to find out what to observe is by discarding areas. This in fact was the system I used to make the discoveries which became Dianetics and Scientology. It was obvious to me that it would take a few million years to examine all of life to find out what made it what it was. The first step was the tough one. I looked for a common denominator that was true for all life forms. I found they were attempting to survive. With this datum I outlined all areas of wisdom or knowledge and discarded those which had not much assisted Man to survive. This threw away all but scientific methodology, so I used that for investigatory proce-dure. Then, working with that, found mental image pictures. And working with them, found the human spirit as different from them. By following up the workable one arrived at the processing actions which, if applied, work, resulting in the increase of ability and freedom. By following up the causes of destruction one arrived at the points which had to be eradicated. This is of course short-handing the whole cycle enormously. But that is the general outline. Survival has been isolated as a common denominator to successful actions and suc-cumb has been found as the common denominator of unsuccessful actions. So one does not have to reestablish these. From there, to discover anything bad or good, all one has to do is discard sterile areas to get a target necessary for investigation."},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"NARROWING THE TARGET 2 HCO PL 19. 9.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 378 DATA SERIES One looks broadly at the whole scene. Then discards sections of it that would seem unrewarding. He will then find himself left with the area that contains the key to it. This is almost easier done than described. Example: One has the statistics of a nine division org. Eight are normal. One isn't. So he investigates the area of that one. In investigating the one he discards all normal bits. He is left with the abnormal one that is the key. This is true of something bad or something good. A wise boy who wanted to get on in life would discard all the men who weren't getting on and study the one who was. He would come up with something he could use as a key. A farmer who wanted to handle a crop menace would disregard all the plants doing all right and study the one that wasn't. Then, looking carefully he would disregard all the should be's in that plant and wind up with the shouldn't be. He'd have the key. Sometimes in the final look one finds the key not right there but way over somewhere else. The boy, studying the successful man, finds he owed his success to having worked in a certain bank seven states away from there. The farmer may well find his hired man let the pigs out into the crop. But both got the reason why by the same process of discarding wider zones. Pluspoints or outpoints alike take one along a sequence of discoveries. Once in a purple moon they mix or cross. Example: Gross income is up. One discards all normal stats. Aside from gross income being up only one other stat is down-new names. Investigation shows that the public execu-tives were off post all week on a tour and that was what raked in the money. Conclusion-send out tours as well as man the public divisions. Example: Upset is coming from the camp kitchen. Obvious outpoints. Investigation discloses a 15-year-old cook holding the job solo for 39 field hands! Boy is he pluspoint. Get him some help! DRAWN ATTENTION Having attention dragged into an area is about the way most people \"investigate.\" This puts them at effect throughout. When a man is not predicting he is often subjected to outpoints that leap up at him. Conversely when outpoints leap up at one unexpectedly he knows he better do more than gape at them. He is already behindhand in investigating.

One gets a despatch which says Central Files don't exist. By now keeping one's attention narrowly on that, one can miss the whole scene. To just order Central Files put back in may fail miserably. One has been given a single observation. It is merely an outpoint: Central Files omitted. There is no why. You follow up \"no CF\" and you may find the Registrar is in the Public Division and Letter Registrars never go near a file and the category of everyone in CF is just \"been tested.\" You really investigate and you find there's no HCO Exec Sec or Dissem Sec and there hasn't been one for a year.

This can be an omitted person, terminal, object, energy, space, time, form, sequence, or even an omitted scene. Anything that can be omitted that should be there is an outpoint. This is easily the most overlooked outpoint as it isn't there to directly attract attention. On several occasions I have found situation analyses done which arrived at no why that would have made handling possible but which gave a false Why that would have upset things if used. In each case the outpoint that held the real clue was this one of an omitted something. In a dozen cases it was omitted personnel each time. One area to which orders were being issued had no one in it at all. Others were undermanned, meaning people were missing. In yet another case there were no study materials at all. In two other cases the whole of a subject was missing in the area. Yet no one in any of these cases had spotted the fact that it was an omitted something that had caused a whole activity to decay. People were working frantically to remedy the general situation. None of them noticed the omissions that were the true cause of the decay. In crime it is as bad to omit as it is to commit. Yet no one seems to notice the omis-sions as actual crimes. Man, trained up in the last century to be a stimulus-response animal, responds to the therenesses and doesn't respond as uniformly to not-therenesses. This opens the door to a habit of deletion or shortening which can become quite com-pulsive. In any analysis which fails to discover a why one can safely conclude the Why is an omission and look for things that should be there and aren't."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"SUMMARY OF OUTPOINTS OMITTED DATA 2 HCO PL 19.9.70 III ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 384 DATA SERIES ALTERED SEQUENCE Any things, events, objects, sizes, in a wrong sequence is an outpoint. The number series 3, 7, 1, 2, 4, 6, 5 is an altered sequence, or an incorrect sequence. Doing step two of a sequence of actions before doing step one can be counted on to tangle any sequence of actions. The basic outness is no sequence at all. This leads into Fixed Ideas. It also shows up in what is called disassociation, an insanity. Things connected to or similar to each other are not seen as consecutive. Such people also jump about subjectwise without relation to an obvi-ous sequence. Disassociation is the extreme case where things that are related are not seen to be and things that have no relation are conceived to have. Sequence means linear (in a line) travel either through space or time or both. A sequence that should be one and isn't is an outpoint. A \"sequence\" that isn't but is thought to be one is an outpoint. A cart-before-the-horse out of sequence is an outpoint. One's hardest task sometimes is indicating an inevitable sequence into the future that is invisible to another. This is a consequence. \"If you saw off the limb you are sitting on you will of course fall.\" Police try to bring this home often to people who have no concept of se-quence; so the threat of punishment works well on well-behaved citizens and not at all on criminals since they often are criminals because they can't think in sequence – they are simply fixated. \"If you kill a man you will be hanged,\" is an indicated sequence. A murderer fixated on revenge cannot think in sequence. One has to think in sequences to have correct sequences. Therefore it is far more common than one would at first imagine to see altered se-quences since persons who do not think in sequence do not see altered sequences in their own actions or areas. Visualizing sequences and drills in shifting attention can clean this up and restore it as a faculty. Motion pictures and TV were spotted by a recent writer as fixating attention and not permitting it to travel. Where one had TV raised children, it would follow, one possibly would have people with a tendency to altered sequences or no sequences at all. DROPPED TIME Time that should be noted and isn't would be an outpoint of \"dropped time.\" It is a special case of an omitted datum. Dropped time has a peculiarly ferocious effect that adds up to utter lunacy. A news bulletin from 1814 and one from 1922 read consecutively without time as-signed produces otherwise undetectable madness."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"SUMMARY OF OUTPOINTS OMITTED DATA 3 HCO PL 19.9.70 III ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 385 DATA SERIES A summary report of a situation containing events strung over half a year without say-ing so can provoke a reaction not in keeping with the current scene. In madmen the present is the dropped time, leaving them in the haunted past. Just tell-ing a group of madmen to \"come up to present time\" will produce a few miraculous \"cures.\" And getting the date of an ache or pain will often cause it to vanish. Time aberrations are so strong that dropped time well qualifies as an outpoint. FALSEHOOD When you hear two facts that are contrary, one is a falsehood or both are. Propaganda and other activities specialize in falsehoods and provoke great distur-bance. Willful or unintentional a falsehood is an outpoint. It may be a mistake or a calculated or defensive falsehood and it is still an outpoint. A false anything qualifies for this outpoint. A false being, terminal, act, intention, any-thing that seeks to be what it isn't is a falsehood and an outpoint. Fiction that does not pretend to be anything else is of course not a falsehood. So the falsehood means \"other than it appears\" or \"other than represented.\" One does not have to concern oneself to define philosophic truth or reality to see that something stated or modeled to be one thing is in actual fact something else and therefore an outpoint. ALTERED IMPORTANCE An importance shifted from its actual relative importance, up or down, is an outpoint. Something can be assigned an importance greater than it has. Something can be assigned an importance less than it has. A number of things of different importances can be assigned a monotone of impor-tance. These are all outpoints, three versions of the same thing. All importances are relative to their actuality. WRONG TARGET Mistaken objective wherein one believes he is or should be reaching toward A and finds he is or should be reaching toward B is an outpoint. This is commonly mistaken identity. It is also mistaken purposes or goals."},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"SUMMARY OF OUTPOINTS OMITTED DATA 4 HCO PL 19.9.70 III ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 386 DATA SERIES If we tear down X we will be okay often results in disclosure that it should have been Y. \"Removing the slums\" to make way for modern shops kills the tourist industry. Killing the king to be free from taxation leaves the tax collector alive for the next regime. Injustice is usually a wrong target outpoint. Arrest the drug consumer, award the drug company would be an example. Military tactics and strategy are almost always an effort to coax the selection of a wrong target by the enemy. And most dislikes and spontaneous hates in human relations are based on mistaken as-sociations of Bill for Pete. A large sum of aberration is based on wrong targets, wrong sources, wrong causes. Incorrectly tell a patient he has ulcers when he hasn't and he's hung with an outpoint which impedes recovery. The industry spent on wrong objectives would light the world for a millennium.

Why = that basic outness found which will lead to a recovery of stats. Wrong Why = the incorrectly identified outness which when applied does not lead to recovery. A Mere Explanation = a \"Why\" given as the Why that does not open the door to any recovery. Example: A mere explanation: \"The stats went down because of rainy weather that week.\" So? So do we now turn off rain? Another mere explanation: \"The staff became over-whelmed that week.\" An order saying \"Don't overwhelm staff\" would be the possible \"solu-tion\" of some manager. But the stats wouldn't recover. The real Why when found and corrected leads straight back to improved stats. A wrong Why, corrected, will further depress stats. A mere explanation does nothing at all and decay continues. Here is a situation as it is followed up: The stats of an area were down. Investigation disclosed there had been sickness 2 weeks before. The report came in: \"The stats were down because people were sick.\" This was a mere explanation. Very reasonable. But it solved nothing. What do we do now? Maybe we accept this as the correct Why. And give an order, \"All people in the area must get a medical exam and unhealthy workers will not be accepted and unhealthy ones will be fired.\" As it's a correction to a wrong Why, the stats really crash. So that's not it. Looking further we find the real WHY. In the area there is no trained-in org bd and a boss there gives orders to the wrong people which, when executed, then hurt their individual stats. We org board the place and groove in the boss and we get a stat recovery and even an improvement. The correct Why led to a stat recovery. Here is another one. Stats are down in a school. An investigation comes up with a mere explanation: \"The students were all busy with sports.\" So management says \"No sports!\" Stats go down again. A new investigation comes up with a wrong Why: \"The students are being taught wrongly.\" Management sacks the dean. Stats really crash now. A further more competent investigation occurs.

Management and organizational catastrophes and successes are all explained by these three types of Why. An arbitrary is probably just a wrong Why held in by law. And if so held in, it will crash the place. One really has to understand logic to get to the correct Why and must really be on his toes not to use and correct a wrong Why. In world banking, where inflation occurs, finance regulations or laws are probably just one long parade of wrong Whys. The value of the money and its usefulness to the citizen de-teriorate to such an extent that a whole ideology can be built up (as in Sparta by Lycurgus who invented iron money nobody could lift in order to rid Sparta of money evils) that knocks money out entirely and puts nothing but nonsense in its place Organizational troubles are greatly worsened by using mere explanations (which lead to no remedies) or wrong Whys (which further depress stats). Organizational recoveries come from finding the real Why and correcting it. The test of the real Why is \"When it is corrected, do stats recover?\" If they do that was it. And any other remedial order given but based on a wrong Why would have to be cancelled quickly. L.

WRONG SOURCE \"Wrong Source\" is the other side of the coin of wrong target. Information taken from wrong source, orders taken from the wrong source, gifts or materiel taken from wrong source all add up to eventual confusion and possible trouble. Unwittingly receiving from a wrong source can be very embarrassing or confusing, so much so that it is a favorite intelligence trick. Dept D in East Germany, the Dept of Disinfor-mation, has very intricate methods of planting false information and disguising its source. Technology can come from wrong source. For instance Leipzig University's school of psychology and psychiatry opened the door to death camps in Hitler's Germany. Using drugs these men apparently gave Hitler to the world as their puppet. They tortured, maimed and slaughtered over 12,000,000 Germans in death camps. At the end of World War II these ex-tremists formed the \"World Federation of Mental Health,\" which enlisted the American Psy-chiatric Association and the American Medical Association and established \"National Asso-ciations for Mental Health\" over the world, cowed news media, smashed any new technology and became the sole advisors to the US government on \"mental health, education and wel-fare\" and the appointers of all health ministers through the civilized world and through their graduate Pavlov dominated Russian communist \"mental health.\" This source is so wrong that it is destroying Man, having already destroyed scores of millions. (All statements given here are documented.) Not only taking data from wrong source but officialdom from it can therefore be suffi-ciently aberrated as to result in planetary insanity.

But in doing data analysis one cannot offhand distinguish which is the false fact. Thus it becomes a special outpoint. \"They made a high of $12,000 that week\" and \"They couldn't pay staff\" occurring in the same time period gives us one or both as false. We may not know which is true but we do know they are contrary and can so label it. In interrogation this point is so important that anyone giving two contrary facts be-comes a prime suspect for further investigation. \"I am a Swiss citizen\" as a statement from someone who has had a German passport found in his baggage would be an example. When two \"facts\" are contrary or contradictory we may not know which is true but we do know they can't both be true.

Coaching Stress: This is a drill which can be done over and over to higher standards of iden-tification and understanding. As written earlier, Step One is not repeated unless it is obvious it has been done incorrectly earlier. The Coach must avoid discussion of the actual data and stick to the drill and the HCO PLs on the Out Points and Plus Points. If a student gives a wrong example of an Out Point or Plus Point, the Coach must flunk the student and hand him the PL which describes the Out Point he has incorrectly identified. The Reference Policy Letters for this drill are: HCO PL 11 May 70 Logic HCO PL 19 Sep 70 Summary of Out Points HCO PL 26 Nov 70 More Out Points HCO PL rev 26 Feb 72 17 Feb 72 Proper Format and Correct Action HCO PL 15 Mar 71 Data Series Auditing HCO PL 30 Sep 73 Out Points, More These must be studied by the student and coach, and Method 4 Word Cleared individually before doing the drill. The various written materials for this drill can be prepared in advance and filed in folders for future use by other students. The Supervisor should check the examples and definitions to ensure they are correct. For example, there would be a folder for Step One with many typed up or mimeoed copies of the Out Point and Plus Point dictionary definitions of words for use by students. There would be a folder with various newspaper or magazine clippings stuck onto pieces of paper. There would be typed up written reports containing Out Points and Plus Points for use in Step Four.

When the student has outpoints, it has been found that he has a terrible time grasping or retaining the Data Series material. This does not mean the student is in any way crazy.

The inability to observe and find an actual useable Why is the downfall of beings and activities. This is factually the Why of people not finding Whys and using them. The prevalence of historical Man's use of \"fate,\" \"kismet\" (fatalism), superstition, for-tune telling, astrology and mysticism confirms this. Having forgotten to keep seed grain for the spring, the farmer starves the following year and when asked Why he is starving says it is the Gods, that he has sinned or that he failed to make sacrifice. In short, unable to think, he says \"The Why is God.\" This condition does not just affect primitives or backward people. All through the most modern organizations you can find \"The Why is God\" in other forms. By believing that it is the fault of other divisions or departments, a staff member does not look into his own scene. \"The reason 1 cannot load the lumber is because the Personnel Section will not find and hire people.\" It does not seem to occur to this fellow that he is using a WHY which he can't control so it is not a Why for his area. It does not move the existing to the ideal scene. Thus it is not a Why for him. Yet he will use it and go on nattering about, it. And the lumber never gets loaded. The real Why for him more likely would be, \"I have no right to hire day laborers. 1 must obtain this right before my area breaks down totally,\" or \"My department posts are too specialized. I need to operate on all-hands actions on peak loads.\" A Course Supervisor who says, \"I haven't got any students because Ethics keeps them for weeks and Cramming for months\" is using a \"The Why is God.\" As he cannot control Ethics or Cramming from his post his Why is illogical. The real Why is probably \"I am not mustering all my students daily and keeping them on course. If they are ordered to Ethics or Cramming they must be right here studying except for the actual minutes spent in Ethics and Cramming.\" But this does not just apply on small activities. It applies to whole nations. \"The rea-son we Germans cannot advance is because England is against us.\" This wrong Why has killed many tens of millions in two world wars."},{"pageNumber":426,"pageContent":"THE WHY IS GOD 2 HCO PL 31.1.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 406 DATA SERIES Intelligence organizations are often almost dedicated to \"the Why is over there.\" It seldom is. Most staffs of orgs, when pay is poor, are completely addicted to over-thereness. In one org, the Finance Banking Officer was continuously hammered to \"give more money\" by the people who were responsible for making the money and yet who were not raising a finger to do so. An actual survey of four org staffs showed that only 2% were aware that their pay depended upon the org gross income! Thus survival is very closely tied to logic. If one finds he is sinking into apathy over his inability to get his job done, it is certain that he is operating on self-conceived wrong Whys in areas that he cannot ever hope to control. And in living any life, most major points of decline can be traced to the person's oper-ating on Whys that do not allow him to improve his own scene. The Greek cut open the guts of birds to find the Why. He called this \"divination\" or \"augury.\" Don't look now. but that civilization has long been dead! Just as anyone will be whose illogic leads him to over-thereness to find his Why. Strength and power in the individual consists of being logical enough to find Whys he can use to advance his existing scene toward the ideal scene. The Why is not God.

To handle this, it is proper form to write up an evaluation so as to keep in view the reason one is doing one. This is accomplished by using this form Situation: ______________________________________________________ Data: ______________________________________________________ Stats: ______________________________________________________ Why: ______________________________________________________ Ideal scene: ______________________________________________________ Handling: ______________________________________________________ CONSISTENCY The whole of it should concern itself with the same general scene, the same subject matter. This is known as consistency. One does not have a situation about books, data about bicycles, stats of another person, a Why about another area, a different subject for ideal scene and handling for another activity. The situation, whether good or bad, must be about a certain subject, person or area, the data must be about the same, the stats are of that same thing, the Why relates to that same thing, the ideal scene is about the scene of that same thing and the handling handles that thing and especially is regulated by that Why. A proper evaluation is all of a piece."},{"pageNumber":432,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 2 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 412 DATA SERIES SITUATION First, to do an evaluation, some situation must have come to notice. There is a report or observation that is out of the ordinary. This \"coming to notice\" occurs on any line. Usually it is fairly major, affecting a large portion of the area, but it can be minor. So observation in general must be continuous for situations to be noted. To just note a situation and act on it is out of sequence as it omits evaluation. You can be elated or shocked uselessly by noting a situation and then not doing any evaluation, It is the hallmark of a rank amateur or idiot to act on reports without any evaluation. So, the first step is noting, from general alertness, a situation exists. A situation is defined as a not expected state of affairs. It is either very good or it is very bad. If it is very good it must be evaluated and a Why found so one can even upgrade an ideal scene. If it is very bad, it must be evaluated and a Why found so that it can be handled to more closely approach the ideal scene. DATA Data is the information one has received that alerts one to the situation. Intelligence systems use various (mainly faulty) methods of \"evaluating\" data so as to \"confirm it.\" They do this uniformly from reports. No matter how many reports one may see there is always a question as to their truth. Intelligence chiefs have started most wars (US vs. Germany 1917) or failed to start them in time (US vs. Japan 1936) by depending on \"authori-tative sources,\" \"skilled observers,\" \"valid documents\" and other confetti they class as \"re-ports\" or \"documents.\" As noted above, the \"raw document\" or \"raw materials\" as they are called have led, when accepted, to the most terrifying catastrophes. British Admiral Hall, without permission of the British government, leaked the famous \"Zimmerman telegram\" to US President Wilson and stampeded the US into World War 1. The alleged German \"instructions\" to their US Am-bassador \"intercepted\" by Hall were passed on with confidence tricks and President Wilson, elected to keep the US out of the war, being no great evaluator, dived overboard on one flimsy questionable report and carried America into the disaster of two world wars and a communist supremacy. The US was lulled by false Japanese assurances and false data on the smallness of Japanese armaments and considered the country no danger. The true situation would have led to a US declaration of war in 1936! Before Japan could sink the whole Pacific fleet in one raid and cause 41/2 years of war and open all of China to communist supremacy."},{"pageNumber":433,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 3 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 413 DATA SERIES These are just a couple of the thousands of disasters in international affairs brought about by a pathetic reliance on reports or documents. If you knew the game well, with a half a dozen agents and a document factory, you could have half the countries of the planet in turmoil. Because they rely on reports and \"au-thoritative sources\" and \"expert opinion\" instead of data as viewed in this Data Series. If one does not court disaster and failures one does NOT rely on reports, but an ab-sence of reports or a volume of reports carefully surveyed for outpoints and counted. To do this one must be very skilled at spotting outpoints. Most people confuse simple errors with actual outpoints. You can get so good at this you can recognize outpoints and pluspoints at a fast glance over reports. Essentially, \"data\" regarded from the angle of outpoints is a lack of consistency. \"Our Div 2 is doing very well\" doesn't go with gross income $2. This gives you a guideline, the \"string to pull\" (see investigation checksheet on fol-lowing down things you just don't understand, the first emergence of the Data Series). So the data you give is not a lot of reports. It is a brief summary of the \"strings pulled\" on the outpoint or pluspoint route to finally get the Why. Example: (from a situation where an org was going broke) \"The sign-ups reported for service and new names to Central Files were both high yet gross income was down. An inves-tigation of the service area showed no backlogs and no new customers with the staff idle. Tech Services was fully staffed. Examining complement showed no one in the Department of Income. People were signed up but there was no one to receive the money.\" The why of course was a wrong complement particularly no cashier and an Executive Director neglecting his duties. Example: (on a situation of a stat soaring) \"The Promo Dept had very down stats with no promo going out. Bulk mail was low. Div 6 was idle, yet the GI was soaring. Nothing in the org could be found to account for it. Investigation of what promo incoming public had, showed that the promo was coming from a lower level org promoting itself as a route to upper level services.\" The Why of course was an effective promo campaign being run outside the org. And one could bolster that up and get the org active too. Data, then, is the Sherlock Holming of the trail that gave the Why. It at once reflects the command the evaluator has of the Data Series. And his own cleverness. Sometimes they come in a sudden blue flash a yard long, a piece of insight into what must be going on if these outpoints add up this way. Rapid investigation of further data on this trail proves or disproves the flash of insight. One does not run on insight alone (or crystal balls). To one not trained and practiced in evaluation the finding of a Real Why may look as mysterious as an airplane to an aborigine."},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 4 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 414 DATA SERIES It is a fact that people who do not understand evaluation can get the idea that man-agement acts on personalities or whims or that management has spies everywhere to know that the Distribution Secretary never came to work. To the expert it is easy. To the ignorant it looks very supernatural. It is the trail followed that counts. This is what is required under \"data.\" STATS Situations and data trails are supported by statistics. Where statistics are not in numeral form this may be harder. Where they are outright lies, this is an outpoint itself. A person or nation without any statistic may be a puzzle at first but statistical ap-proximations can exist and be valid. Statistics of CIA would be very hard to dig up. They don't even let the US Congress in on it. But the deteriorating overseas influence of the US would show that CIA was not batting any high average and that its data fed to policy-makers (its avowed purpose) might well be false or misleading causing policy errors that cause a deteriorating scene. So statistics can be estimated by the scene itself even when absent in numerical form. England has lost its whole empire in a quarter of a century, without a single defeat in war. This gives an adequate statistic for the government's good sense or lack of it. It is at this writing losing even parts of the homeland and is itself joining what might be called the Fourth Reich and so will soon cease to exist as a political sovereignty. This statistic can even be drawn as a dive-bombing down curve. A deckhand's statistic may not exist on a chart but the areas he tends do exist for view. One either has a numerical statistic or a direct observation. One can use both. I once answered the question, \"Why are paid completions high and gross income low?\" by finding that the \"paid\" completions stats were false. So one statistic can be compared to another. Three or more stats can be compared to each other and often lead directly to a Why. The main point is don't act without statistical data. After a fine data analysis, one may well find the stats are quite normal and there is no situation. One may have a great PR PR PR data analysis and collide with statistics you'd need a submarine to read. And one may have data that says the whole staff of Keokuk should be shot without waiting for dawn and then discover that, by stats, they're doing great."},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 5 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 415 DATA SERIES And one can also do a data analysis that shows somebody should be commended and prove it by stats and then discover belatedly the stats are false and the guy should have been shot. However, if one looks at all available stats after doing a data analysis one may find they look good at a glance but are sour as green apples. One could see a high lot of stats, GI, etc., and then see a cost stat that shows someone is making $2 million at a cost of $4 million and that the place is going straight into the garbage can. Do not give a Why or recommend handling without inspecting the actual stats. And do not be thrown off a situation you are sure exists without looking at all the stats. (Example: High hour interns' stats throw one off interfering until one sees NO interns graduating and NO programs completed by them.) THE WHY This is the jewel in the crown, the main dish at dinner, the gold mine in the towering mountains of mystery. A real Why must lead to a bettering of the existing scene or (in the case of a wonder-ful new scene) maintaining it as a new ideal scene. Therefore the Why must be something you can do something about. (See THE WHY IS GOD policy letter.) Thus the Why is limited by what you can control. It is never that other division or top management or the bumps on the moon. Even if all this were true, the Why must be something which you can do something about yourself from your level of authority or initiative that will lead to the improvement of a poor existing scene toward the Ideal Scene. The Why is a special thing then. It is a key that opens the door to effective improve-ment. It is not a prejudice or a good idea. It is where all the analysis led. And a Real Why when used and handled and acted upon is like a magic carpet. The scene at once becomes potentially better or gets maintained. \"Acting on a wrong Why\" is the stuff of which coffins are made. No matter how brilliant the program that follows, there it is, the same old mud. Wrong Whys work people half to death handling a program which will lay ostrich eggs and rotten ones at that. It will cost money and time that can't be afforded easily. It will distract from the real tiger in the woods and let him roar and eat up the goats while everyone is off chasing the ghosts which \"really were the cause of it all.\""},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 6 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 416 DATA SERIES Wrong Whys are the tombstones of all great civilizations and unless someone gears up the think will be the mausoleum of this one. Do not think you won't get them. It takes 28,000 casualties in battle, they say, to make a major general. Well it may take a few wrong Whys to make an evaluator. The evaluator who has done the evaluation is of course responsible for it being cor-rectly done and leading to the right conclusion and verified by stats to give the correct real Why. And the real ones are often too incredible to have been arrived at in any other way. Or they are so obvious no one noticed. In one instance Whys were found by experts for six months on a certain course with-out improving the flagrantly bad situation but actually messing it up more until a huge real Why jumped out (the students had never been trained on earlier levels) and the situation be-gan to improve. Using one Why for all situations can also occur and fads of Whys are common. True, a Why often applies elsewhere. That's what gives us technology including policy. But in any area of operation where a situation is very abnormal the Why is likely to be very peculiar and too off the ordinary to be grasped at once. There can be an infinity of wrongnesses around just one rightness. Thus there can be an infinity of wrong Whys possible with just one real Why that will open the door. For the real Why does open the door. With it on a good situation one can maintain it and with a bad situation one can improve it. Thus the Real Why is the vital arrival point to which evaluation leads. THE IDEAL SCENE If a bad situation is a departure from the ideal scene and if a good situation is attaining it or exceeding it, then the crux of any evaluation is the Ideal Scene for the area one is evalu-ating. Viewpoint has a lot to do with the ideal scene. To Russia a collapsed America is the ideal scene. To America a collapsed Russia is an ideal scene. To some have-not nations both Russia and the US competing at vast expense for the favor of a coy petty ruler is the ideal scene to that ruler. To most other parts of the world both these major countries interested only in their own affairs would be an ideal scene. So, with viewpoint the ideal scene can be \"bad\" or \"good.\" The ideal scene is not necessarily big and broad. An intelligence evaluator that gave the ideal scene as \"a defeated enemy\" on every evaluation would be very inexpert."},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 7 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 417 DATA SERIES By consistency the ideal scene must be one for that portion of an activity for which one is trying to find the Why. Example: (Situation: renewed activity on a front held by one platoon. Evaluation: No other points along the lines are active and a tank road leads toward the front where the activ-ity is. Why: area being prepared for a tank breakout.) Ideal Scene: an uninhabitable area in front of the platoon. (Which could be done with napalm as there is a wood there and a heavy crossfire maintained and a renewed supply of bazookas for the platoon if the napalm didn't work.) Example: (Situation: a lot of silence from Plant 22. Evaluation: no trucks arriving with materials, no raw materials being sent by outside suppliers, suppliers irate. Why: The ac-counting office forgot to pay the raw materials bill and the suppliers held up all further sup-plies.) The Ideal Scene: high credit rating and good accounts PR established with all credi-tors. (And handling would include a recommendation for an evaluation of the accounting of-fice as to why it forgot and why there is no high credit PR with a new ideal scene for that ac-counting office, which might be a wholly different thing: Ideal Scene: an accounting office that enforces income greater than outgo.) By giving the Ideal Scene for every situation, the evaluator is not led into a fatal con-tempt for the competence of all work actually being done. The ideal scene clarifies for one and all whither we are going. But even more important, the evaluation that includes an ideal scene postulates a win from the viewpoint of those for whom it is being done or for one's activities. Sometimes when one gets to the ideal scene and writes it down he finds his Why won't really lead to it, in which case he must get another Why or familiarize himself with the scene in general to find out what he is trying to send where. In the case of an abnormally good situation one finds he has exceeded what was for-merly thought to be the ideal scene and must state a new one entirely with the Why concerned with how to maintain it. Anyone reading a full evaluation in proper form can better estimate whether the Why and handling are workable if the Ideal Scene is there. And sometimes it will be found that the evaluator is trying to do something else entirely than what everyone else thinks is a correct attainment. Thus it is a very healthy thing to include the ideal scene. It serves as a discipline and incentive for the evaluator and those executing the program. HANDLING Handling must be consistent with the situation, the evaluation, the Why and the ideal scene. Handling must be within the capabilities of those who will do the actions. Handling must be within the resources available."},{"pageNumber":438,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 8 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 418 DATA SERIES Handling quite often but not always requires a bright idea. It is peculiarly true that the less the resources available the brighter the idea required to attain effective handling. Handling must be supervised by one person who acts as a coordinator of the program and a checker-offer and debug expert. And last but most important handling must be effective and final. The steps of handling are in program form. They are numbered 1-2-3, etc. Or A-B-C, etc. They can be in the sequence they will be done but this is mostly important when one person or one team is going to do the whole thing step by step. These steps are called targets. Each part of the program (each target) is assigned to someone to do or to get done. Care must be taken not to overload persons already loaded and where this occurs one appoints a special personnel or mission for that specific target. The supervision must see that each target gets fully done and no targets not-done and no targets half-done. It is up to supervision to keep track of all completions on a master sheet. Supervision debugs those targets that bog or lag by finding in them a Why, which may mean a rapid evaluation of that target to rephrase it or get it clarified without altering its in-tended accomplishment. Supervision can reassign a target. PROJECTS It is expected that any complex or extensive target will have a project written for it by the person to whom it is assigned if not by the originator. By completing this project the target is done. Often these projects have to be passed upon by a senior before being begun. COMPLIANCE When the master sheet shows all targets done (not not-done and not half-done and not falsely reported) full situation handling can be expected. REVIEW When the supervisor reports all targets done, it is in the hands of fate whether the situation will now be progressed toward or attain the ideal scene. The accuracy of the data, the skill of the evaluator, the correctness of the why, the competence of the supervisor and the skill of those executing the targets and the willingness"},{"pageNumber":439,"pageContent":"PROPER FORMAT AND CORRECT ACTION 9 HCO PL 17.2.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 419 DATA SERIES of those receiving the effects of all this activity (their human emotion and reaction) determine whether this evaluation approaches or attains the ideal scene. All such evaluations should be reviewed as soon as the actions have had time to take effect. An idiot optimism can suppose all is well and that it is needless to review. But if this why was wrong then the situation will deteriorate and a worsening situation will be apparent. Thus a sharp watch has to be set. No thirst for \"always being right\" or arrogance about never being wrong must prevent an honest review. Was the ideal scene approached or attained? Or was it a wrong Why and now is all Hades breaking loose? Now we don't have just renewed insistence that the Why was right and that the pro-gram must go in in spite of all. We have a wrong Why. MAGIC It will be found that where you have a real why people will cooperate all over the scene. The only exception is where there are traitors around. But this is an easy explanation, too often bought to excuse wrong Whys. The Germans, when they found in World War II, how ineffective the Italian intelli-gence service was, couldn't believe it, tried to improve it, became convinced they were trai-tors, probably shot them in scores and took the service over themselves. And lost Italy even more rapidly. Whatever the right Why was, the Germans had the wrong one. And so does any executive who has to shoot everybody-he just can't find the right Whys. It is no disgrace to find a wrong Why. It is only a disgrace not to keep trying on and on until one does find it. Then the clouds open, the sun shines, the birds pour out their souls in purest melody and the ideal scene is approached or reached. So review is damnably important. Situations have to be handled very fast. And reviews have to be as quick as possible after effect can occur. WHOLE VIEW So here you have the whole view.

It works because it has unlocked logic. In management one is very fortunate since he can program and handle. In intelligence one is less fortunate as his handling can only be suggested and many an intelligence officer has watched a useless Battle of the Bulge after he told them all about it and \"they\" had other ideas. But the Data Series works in intelligence as well. Data analysis was not developed in a professorial out of a lost-to-the-world tower. It was evolved by attempting to explain logic, then was developed on one of the hottest cross-fire but successful evaluation posts on the planet against a background of blood, sweat and tears war intelligence experience. So it is itself real. The key to it is handling Data. So here it is. I do sincerely hope it serves you in helping to attain your ideal scene. L.

To handle any confusions on the words and substance of \"policy,\" \"plans,\" \"pro-grams,\" \"projects\" and \"orders\" the following descriptive definitions (see Scn Logic No. 5) are laid down for our use. Policy: By this is meant long-range truths or facts which are not subject to change ex-pressed as operational rules or guides. Plans: Short-range broad intentions as to the contemplated actions envisaged for the handling of a broad area to remedy it or expand it or to obstruct or impede an opposition to expansion. A plan is usually based on observation of potentials (or resources) and expresses a bright idea of how to use them. It always proceeds from a Real Why if it is to be successful. Program: A series of steps in sequence to carry out a plan. One usually sees a pro-gram following the discovery of a Why. But in actual fact a plan had to exist in the person's mind, whether written or not, before a program could be written. A program, thus, carries out the plan conceived to handle a found Why. A plan and its program require authorization (or okay) from the central or coordinating authority of the general activities of a group before they can be invested in, activated or executed. Projects: The sequence of steps written to carry out one step of a program. Project or-ders often have to be written to execute a program step. These should be written but usually do not require any approval and often are not generally issued but go to the person or persons who will accomplish that step of a program. Under the category of project would come or-ders, work projects, etc. These are a series of guiding steps which if followed will result in a full and successful accomplishment of the program target. Orders: The verbal or written direction from a lower or designated authority to carry out a program step or apply the general policy."},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"HANDLING POLICY, PLANS, PROGRAMS 2 HCO PL 29.2.72R PROJECTS AND ORDERS DEFINED ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 428 DATA SERIES In short: Policy = the rules of the game, the facts of life, the discovered truths and the invariable procedures. Plans = the general bright idea one has to remedy the WHY found and get things up to the ideal scene or improve even that. (Approval.) Program = the sequence of major actions needed to do the plan. (Approval.) Project = the sequence of steps necessary to carry out one step in a program. (No ap-proval.) Orders = some program steps are so simple that they are themselves an order or an or-der can simply be a roughly written project. Thus, by these definitions a data analysis would look like this: Policy: (What brings the evaluation into existence in the first place.) Situation: (Departure from or improvement of the ideal scene expressed in policy.) Data: (Observations leading to investigation.) Statistics: (The independent continuing survey of production or lack of it.) Why: (The real reason found by the investigation.) Ideal Scene: (The state of affairs envisioned by policy or the improvement of even that.) HANDLING: A Plan whether written in full or not based on the why to use the resources available to move the existing scene toward the ideal scene. A Program: A sequence of broad steps to get the plan executed. Projects: Any sequence of steps ordered or written to get a program step completed. Orders: The program step itself or the verbal or written project to get the program step fully done.

Personnel. ____________ ___________________ This of course is a very simple plan and simple program. The orders are seen as \"Personnel,\" \"Dir of Personnel Enhancement,\" \"Action Mis-sion Writer,\" etc., at the paragraph ends. The program step itself is an order to the person or unit named at program step end. But it also authorizes that person or unit to do the step or issue orders to do the step or even write a project and get it done. That final end word on the program step is an authority as well as being an order to the person or unit named. ROUND-UP A copy of a full program marked Master is placed in a folder. The folder is marked on the edge with the program name and number. The program itself is stapled along its left edge to the inside left cover of the folder. A \"Flag Rep\" is responsible for \"LRH programs.\" A Deputy Executive Director or Deputy Commanding Officer is responsible for an ED's or C/O's programs. The responsibility lies in seeing that each step is fully effectively done. All related papers, copies of projects' orders, etc., are collected in that folder and as each done is reported and investigated as done it is marked off on the Master program sheet. When all those projects or orders bred by the program steps are done then the pro-gram is considered done. One does not \"report progress\" but only dones and when something is not done yet it is chased up by the 'Flag Rep\" or Deputy ED or C/0 and \"debugged.\" DEBUGGING The word \"bugged\" is slang for snarled up or halted. Debug is to get the snarls or stops out of it. This itself requires an evaluation. The evaluation may be done at a glance or it may take a full formal evaluation by form. The ideal scene here is the program step done or even improved. So the Why here would be the real reason it was not being done or couldn't be done and that may require hours to locate and sometimes days to remedy."},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"HANDLING POLICY, PLANS, PROGRAMS 4 HCO PL 29.2.72R PROJECTS AND ORDERS DEFINED ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 430 DATA SERIES When \"debugging\" one usually finds the persons assigned the target already have a \"Why\" and it is usually a false Why for if it was the right one the program step would get done. Thus debugging usually begins with finding \"their Whys\"-which is to say reasons, ex-cuses, apologies, etc. Getting these into view is a main part of the program step evaluation. A project, often written, comes out of this debug evaluation. In extreme cases it will be found that the whole program is based on a wrong Why and rapidly needs redoing by the original authority. Example: The Why found was that the Jinx office was not making money. In doing one step of the program: \"3. Survey past invoices to find where money is coming from and why they don't get it now. mission,\" the mission sent finds Jinx Office was making money by the ton but it was being wasted by their having bought a huge building whose rent is three times normal rental \"in the hopes new subtenants would pay the rent but nobody wants the place.\" Rapid debug is needed because the target can't really be done. They are making money and they do get it now. In such a case doing the program unearthed a new Real Why and scrubbed that pro-gram. A super-frantic hysterical communication would be sent to the authority of the pro-gram, \"New Why found by Pgm 891 target 3 observation. Jinx Office paying $80,000 a quar-ter for skyscraper. Obvious real Why ED has delusions of grandeur, is a bad business head. Suggest Pgm 891 redone on new Why and suggest plan of mission here for instant offload of this skyscraper and office into proper quarters and replacement of ED.\" At which the 'Flag Rep\" or Deputy ED or Deputy C/O will approach the authority for the pgm to get immediate cancellation of 891 and all program targets and a new Program 891R based on the Real Real Why. Debug, however, is not always so dramatic. \"We don't have anyone to put on it\" is the usual excuse as they sit lazily chatting amongst their piled up dev-t. So one evaluates the area against the program target and finds a Why that, executed as a project will get that target done. The Perfect Debug Evaluation (a) gets the target done (b) improves the area (c) leaves no dregs of human emotion and reaction behind it. Just plain screaming often works. But if one has to, there is a real Why there some-place that should be found, a project handed out and done. HANDLING SUMMARY You can find out all the situations and Whys in the world but if there isn't a plan and program and if these are not done fully, then nothing beneficial will happen. Indeed the not-dones, half-dones and backlogs will mount up (per HCO P/L 26 Jan 72, Admin Know-How 29, Executive Series 5) and set the whole thing a step backwards."},{"pageNumber":451,"pageContent":"HANDLING POLICY, PLANS, PROGRAMS 5 HCO PL 29.2.72R PROJECTS AND ORDERS DEFINED ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 431 DATA SERIES Bad programs and clumsy projects develop useless traffic (dev-t) and tie people up all over the place, pull them off normal needful actions and send the existing scene even further from the ideal scene. They make people very busy but nothing beneficial is gained and as the useless actions distract from normal duties, the whole place is at risk. Staffs subjected to programs that are not based on sound observation evaluation, a real why and the points in Data Series 23, become apathetic as they see no result. So programs that are bad and programs that are right but don't get fully done are alike deadly. There is no substitute for correctly done data analysis. There is no excuse for not getting correct programs done. In this way and only in this way can one raise the existing scene toward an ideal scene. Data analysis is a powerful tool. you can use it. L.

Illegal policy set at unauthorized levels jams the actions of a group and IS responsible for the inactivity, non-production or lack of team spirit. Counter policy independently set jams the group together but inhibits its operation. Out-Reality on org bds, hats, etc, is to a large degree caused by disagreements and conflicts which are caused by illegal policy. If we had a game going in which each player set his own rules, there would be no game. There would only be argument and conflict. VARIETIES OF COUNTER POLICY At the start it must be assumed or effected that there is someone or somebody to set authorized policy for the group. Absence of this function is an invitation to random policy and group conflict and disintegration. If such a person or body exists, new proposed policy must be referred to this person or body and issued, not set randomly at lower levels or by unauthor-ized persons. Policies so set by the policy authority must be informed enough and wise enough to forward the group purpose and to obtain agreement. Ignorant or bad policy even when author-ized tends to persuade group members to set their own random policy. When no policy at all exists random policy occurs. When policy exists but is not made known, random policy setting will occur. Ignorance of policy, the need or function of it, can cause random policies. Hidden not stated random policies can conflict. Correct policy can be relayed on a cutative basis – a few words left off or a qualifying sentence dropped which makes policy incorrect or null. \"Children may not go out\" can be made out of \"Children may not go out after midnight\". Altered policy can be limitless in error. Attributing a self set policy to the authorized source can disgrace all policy as well as pervert the leadership purpose."},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"THIRD DYNAMIC DE-ABERRATION 2 HCO PL 6.12.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 434 DATA SERIES Policy can be excluded from a zone of a group that should be governed by it. \"Pipe making policy does not apply to the small pipe shop.\" Such masses of unnecessary policy can be issued that it cannot be assimilated. Policy can exist in large amounts but not be subdivided into relevant subjects as is done in hat checksheets. Disgrace of policy can occur in a subsequent catastrophe and render any policy dis-graceful, encouraging self set policy by each group member. CLEARING A GROUP All authorized policy must be set or made available in master books and adequate complete policy files. This makes it possible to compile hats and checksheets and issue packs. Group surveys of \"What policy are you operating on?\" can reveal random policy. All bugged (halted) projects can be surveyed for illegal policy and cleaned up and got-ten going again. Other actions can be taken all of which add up to: 1. Get existing policy used. 2. Get areas without policy crisply given policy from the authorized source. 3. Debug all past projects of false policy. 4. De-aberrate group members as per the Organization Misunderstoods PL and other ma-terials. 5. Educate the group members concerning policy technology. 6. Set up systems that detect, isolate and report out-policy and get it corrected and prop-erly set, issued and known. 7. Monitor any new policy against statistics and include policy outnesses as part of all statistical evaluations. ADMIN SCALE I have developed a scale for use which gives a sequence (and relative seniority) of subjects relating to organization.  Goals  Purposes  Policy  Plans  Programmes"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"THIRD DYNAMIC DE-ABERRATION 3 HCO PL 6.12.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 435 DATA SERIES  Projects  Orders  Ideal Scenes  Stats  Valuable Final Products This scale is worked up and worked down until it is (each item) in full agreement with the remaining items. In short, for success all these items in the scale must agree with all other items in the scale on the same subject. Let us take \"Golf Balls\" as a subject for the scale. Then all these scale items must be in agreement with one another on the subject of golf balls. It is an interesting exercise. The scale also applies in a destructive subject. Like \"Cockroaches\". When an item in the scale is not aligned with the other items, the project will be hin-dered if not fail. The skill with which all these items in any activity are aligned and gotten into action is called Management. Group members only become upset when one or more of these points are not aligned to the rest and at least some group agreement. Groups appear slow, inefficient, unhappy, inactive or quarrelsome only when these items are not aligned, made known and coordinated. Any activity can be improved by debugging or aligning this scale in relation to the group activity. As out-Reality breeds out-Comm, and out-Affinity, it follows that unreal items on the scale (not aligned) produce ARC Breaks, upsets and disaffection. It then follows that when these scale items are well aligned with each other and the group there will be high Reality, high Communication and high Affinity in the group. Group mores aligned so and followed by the group gives one an ethical group and also establishes what will then be considered as overts and withholds in the group by group mem-bers. This scale and its parts and ability to line them up are one of the most valuable tools of organization. DEBUG When orders are not complied with and projects do not come off, one should Detect, Isolate and Report and handle or see that it is handled, any of the scale items found random or counter."},{"pageNumber":456,"pageContent":"THIRD DYNAMIC DE-ABERRATION 4 HCO PL 6.12.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 436 DATA SERIES If any item below Policy is in trouble – not moving, one can move upwards correcting these points, but certainly concentrating on a discovery of illegal or counter policy. Rarely it occurs some old but legal policy needs to be adjusted. Far more commonly policy is being set by someone verbally or in despatches, or hidden, that is bugging any item or items below the level of policy. So the rule is that when things get messed up, jammed up, slowed or inactive or down-right destructive (including a product as an overt act) one sniffs about for random or counter policy illegally being set in one's own area or \"out there\". Thus in the face of any outness one detects-isolates-reports and handles or gets han-dled the Out-Policy. The detection is easy. Things aren't moving or going right. The isolation is of course a what policy that must be found and who set it. Reporting it would mean to HCO. Handling it is also very easy and would be done in Qual. This Admin tech gives us our first 3rd Dynamic de-aberrater that works easily and fast. Why? Well, look at the Admin Scale. Policy is just below Purpose. Purpose is senior to policy. The person who is setting random or counter illegal policy is off group purpose. He is other purposed to greater or lesser degree. From 1960 to 1962 I developed a vast lot of technology about goals and purposes. If we define a goal as a whole track long long term matter and a purpose as the lesser goal ap-plying to specific activities or subjects we see clearly that if we clean up a person's purposes relating to the various activities in which he is involved and on the eight dynamics we will handle the obsession to set random or counter policies! So it is an auditing job and the tech for it is extensive. (The African ACC was devoted to this subject. Lots of data exists on it.) It happens however that around 20% (probably more) of any group's members are ac-tively if covertly anti-group and must be handled at a less profound level under Personal Ab-erration in the Org Misunderstoods Policy Letter before you can begin to touch purpose. Thus any group member, since this tech remedy helps them all, would be handled with: 1. General case de-aberration (called L10s on Flag). 2. Purpose handling for posts. 3. Org bd, hatting and training."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"THIRD DYNAMIC DE-ABERRATION 5 HCO PL 6.12.70 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 437 DATA SERIES Those setting random or counter purpose later detected would get further no. 2 and no. 3. ____________________ As the universe is full of beings and one lives with them whether he likes it or not, it would be to anyone's interest to be able to have functioning groups. The only way a group jams up and (a) becomes difficult to live in and (b) impossible to fully separate from is by random and counter purposes. If one thinks he can go off and be alone anywhere in this universe he is dreaming. The first impulse of a hostile being is \"to leave\" a decent group. What a weird one. The only reason he gets in jams is his inability to tolerate or handle others. There's no road out for such a being except through. Thus all we can do to survive even on the first dynamic is to know how to handle and be part of the third or fourth dynamic and clean it up. Probably the reason this universe itself is considered by some as a trap is because their Admin Scale is out. And the only reason this universe is sometimes a trial is because no one published its Admin Scale in the first place. All this is very fundamental first dynamic tech and third dynamic tech. It is the first true group technology that can fully de-aberrate and smooth out and free within the group every group member and the group itself. Thus, combined with auditing tech, for the first time we can rely wholly on technology to improve and handle group members and the group itself toward desirable and achievable accomplishment with happiness and high morale. Like any skill or technology it has to be known and done and continued in use to be effective. The discovery, development and practical use of this data has made me very very cheerful and confident and is doing the same thing on the test group. I hope it does the same for you. L.

Misunderstood words. One has not gotten the definitions of the words used. This does not mean \"new words.\" It is usually old common words. It is not just long words, it is more usually little ones. To handle this one takes each policy letter (or chapter) in turn and looks it over carefully to see what words he cannot rapidly define. To help in this one uses an E-Meter and \"Method 4\" Word Clearing which is the method of using a meter to see if-\"Are there any words in this policy misunderstood?\" Any upset or an-tagonism or boredom felt comes only from a misunderstood word or misunderstood words. 13. The person has himself an outpoint in his routine thinking. This is found and handled by what is called an \"HC (Hubbard Consultant) List.\" This list assessed on a meter de-tects and handles this. 14. Lack of knowledge of an existing or an ideal scene. This is handled by observing the existing scene directly or indirectly by reports and for the ideal, study of the basic pol-icy of the scene which gives one its ideal, its expected products and form of organiza-tion. 15. Not having studied the Data Series. Handled by studying it properly. 16. Not having studied data analysis from the viewpoint of needing to apply it. 17. Thinking one already knows all about analyzing and data. Handled by looking over some past failures and realizing they could have been prevented by a proper collection of data and analyzing it. 18. Tossing off \"reasons\" personally on one's own personal area which are usually just ex-cuses or justifications and not Whys. \"I was too tired,\" \"I should have been tougher,\" \"They were just bums anyway,\" which loads up one's own life with wrong Whys. Handled by being more alert to and more honest about the causes and motives of one's life and the scene, and doing a better analysis. 19. Confusing errors with outpoints. Handled by practice."},{"pageNumber":464,"pageContent":"LEARNING TO USE DATA ANALYSIS 2 HCO PL 19.3.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 444 DATA SERIES 20. Confusing outpoints with Whys. Handled by learning to observe and better study of data analysis. 21. Too narrow a situation. Handled by getting more data and observing the scene more broadly. 22. Missing \"omitted data\" or particles or people as a frequent outpoint. Handled by knowing the ideal scene better. What should be there and isn't. THE BEGINNER When one begins to apply data analysis he is often still trying to grasp the data about data analysis rather than the outpoints in the data. Just become more familiar with the Data Series. Further one may not realize the ease with which one can acquire the knowledge of an ideal scene. An outpoint is simply an illogical departure from the ideal scene. By comparing the existing scene with the ideal scene one easily sees the outpoints. To know the ideal scene one has only to work out the correct products for it. If these aren't getting out, then there is a departure. One can then find the outpoints of the various types and then locate a Why and in that way open the door to handling. And by handling one is simply trying to get the scene to get out its products. Unless one proceeds in this fashion (from product back to establishment), one can't analyze much of anything. One merely comes up with errors. The definition and nature of products is covered in several P/Ls and especially in HCO P/L 13 Mar 72 Establishment Officer Series No. 5. An existing scene is as good as it gets out its products, not as good as it is painted or carpeted or given public relations boosts. So for any scene, manufacturing or fighting a war or being a hostess at a party, there are products. People who lead pointless lives are very unhappy people. Even the idler or dilettante is happy only when he has a product! There is always a product for any scene. The analyst when he begins may get the wrong product. He may get a doingness in-stead of something one can have. And he may look upon a half completion or half-done thing as a completed product. All this makes his data analysis faulty. As he can't figure out an ideal scene, he then has nothing to compare the existing scene to. It is simply a matter of the cost and time in-volved in not or half getting a product compared to the ideal scene of a really valuable prod-uct with exchange value and what it takes to get it. These two things can be worlds apart. The trail that leads to a Why that will close the gap is plainly marked with one kind or another of outpoints. Where the most and biggest are, there is the Why. Found, the real Why and actual handling will move the existing toward ideal."},{"pageNumber":465,"pageContent":"LEARNING TO USE DATA ANALYSIS 3 HCO PL 19.3.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 445 DATA SERIES Hideously enough, what I say about products is true. Even a government could have a product. Like \"a prosperous happy country.\" An intelligence agency often muffs its product such as, \"a properly briefed head of state.\" But to do it the head of state would have to have a product concerning other nations like, \"friendly, cooperative allies which are a help and no threat,\" or some other product. Otherwise the agency would wind up going straight out of the intelligence business and being required to conduct its business by assassination of foreign notables or other actions to do handlings based on wrong Whys. As there would be no product, there could not really be an ideal scene. If there is no ideal scene then there is no way to compare the existing scene. Thus, outpoints would expose situations but no WHY would really be possible as there's no ideal scene to approach. One has often heard some agency or activity say, \"Where the hell are we going anyway?\" Translated this would be, \"We haven't had any ideal scene set up for us.\" And translated further, \"The policy-makers have no product in view.\" So they aren't going any place really and lack of an objective would cause them to go down and lack of a product would cause them to be miser-able. That's the way life has been running. Parents and others often ask children, \"What will you do when you grow up?\" Or \"What are you going to be?\" This is not baffling for a 5-year-old, perhaps, but it is a confuser for a child of 12. There are Be, Do and Have as three major conditions of existence. One must BE in order to Do and Do in order to Have. A product is the Have. It is not the Do. Most peo-ple give \"Do\" as \"product.\" A product is a completed thing that has exchange value within or outside the activity. If one asked a 12-year-old, \"What product are you going to make when you grow up?\" he'd likely give you the exchange reward as the answer, like \"money.\" He has omitted a step. He has to have a product to exchange for money. To \"make money\" directly he'd have to be the Secretary of the Treasury, superinten-dent of the mint or a counterfeiter! Only if you cleared up product and exchange with him could he begin to answer the question about what's what with growing up. Let's say this is done and he says he is set on making photographs of buildings. The do now falls into line-he'd have to photograph things well. The be is obviousarchitectural photo-grapher. The exchange of architectural photographs for salary or fee is feasible if he is good. So now we find he is a poor boy and no chance of schooling or even a box camera. That's the existing scene. The ideal scene is a successful architectural photographer making pictures of build-ings. You see the gap between the existing scene and the ideal scene. Now you can follow back the outpoints and get a Why."},{"pageNumber":466,"pageContent":"LEARNING TO USE DATA ANALYSIS 4 HCO PL 19.3.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 446 DATA SERIES It isn't just that he's poor. That's no Why as it opens no doors to get from existing scene to ideal scene. We investigate and find his \"father\" is very religious but an alcoholic and that the boy is illegitimate and his \"father\" hates his guts. So we find a Why that his \"father,\" much less helping him, is not about to let him amount to anything whatever ever. This opens a door. Handling often requires a bright idea. And we find the local parson has often shown interest in the boy so an obvious handling is to get the parson to persuade the \"father\" to let the boy apprentice in the local photo store and tell the boy what he has to do to make good there. Situations cannot be handled well unless a real Why is found. And a real Why cannot be found unless the product is named and an ideal scene then stated. This compared to the existing scene gives us, really the first outpoint. In going the other direction, to find a Why of sudden improvement, one has to locate poor existing scenes that suddenly leap up toward ideal scenes. This is done by locating a high product period (by stats or other signs of production) and comparing it as an ideal scene to the existing scenes before it (and just after if there was a slump) and looking into that for a Why. But one is looking for Pluspoints. And these lead to a real Why for the prosperity or improvement. A \"Who\" will often be found. Like \"James Johnny was shop foreman then.\" Well, he's dead. So it's not a Why as it leads nowhere. What did James Johnny do that was different? \"He got out products\" leads nowhere. We keep looking and we find he had a scheduling board and really kept it up-to-date and used it as a single difference. Aha \"The Why is a kept up scheduling board!\" The handling is to put a clerk on doing just that and hatting the current foreman to use it or catch it. Result, up go the stats and morale. People can look at it and see what they're producing today and where they're at! So not all Whys are found by outpoints. The good situations are traced by pluspoints. If the high peak is current, one has to find a Why, in the same way, to maintain it. STANDARD ACTION A beginner can juggle around and go badly adrift if he doesn't follow the pattern: 1. Work out exactly what the (person, unit, activity) should be producing. 2. Work out the ideal scene. 3. Investigate the existing scene. 4. Follow outpoints back from ideal to existing, 5. Locate the real Why that will move the existing toward ideal."},{"pageNumber":467,"pageContent":"LEARNING TO USE DATA ANALYSIS 5 HCO PL 19.3.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 447 DATA SERIES 6. Look over existing resources. 7. Get a bright idea of how to handle. 8. Handle or recommend handling so that it stays handled. This is a very sure-fire approach. If one just notes errors in a scene, with no product or ideal with which to compare the existing scene, he will not be doing data analysis and situations will deteriorate badly because he is finding wrong Whys. THINKING One has to be able to think with outpoints. A crude way of saying this is \"learn to think like an idiot.\" One could also add \"without abandoning any ability to think like a gen-ius.\" If one can't tolerate outpoints at all or confront them one can't see them. A madman can't tolerate pluspoints and he doesn't see them either. But there can be a lot of pluspoints around and no production. Thus one can be told how great it all is while the place edges over to the point of collapse. An evaluator who listens to people on the scene and takes their Whys runs a grave risk. If these were the Whys then things would be better. A far safer way is to talk only insofar as finding what the product is concerned and in-vestigating. One should observe the existing scene through data or through observers or through direct observation. An evaluator often has to guess what the Why might be. It is doing that which brings up the phrase \"Learn to think like an idiot.\" The Why will be found at the end of a trail of outpoints. Each one is an aberration when compared to the ideal scene. The biggest idiocy which then explains all the rest and which opens the door to improvement toward the ideal scene is the Why. One also has to learn to think like a genius with pluspoints. Get the big peak period of production (now or in the past). Compare it to the existing scene just before. Now find the pluspoints that were entered in. Trace these and you arrive at the Why as the biggest pluspoint that opened the door to improvement. But once more one considers resources available and has to get a bright idea. So it is the same series of steps as above but with pluspoints."},{"pageNumber":468,"pageContent":"LEARNING TO USE DATA ANALYSIS 6 HCO PL 19.3.72 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 448 DATA SERIES VETERAN A veteran evaluator can toss off evaluations in an hour or two, mainly based on how long it takes him to dig up data. A big tough situation may require days and days. Sometimes luck plays a role in it. The data that was the key to it was being sat on by someone not skilled in the subject and who had no idea of relative importances. Sometimes the datum pops up like toast from an electric toaster. Sometimes one has it all wrapped up and then suddenly a new outpoint or pluspoint appears that changes the whole view of the evalua-tor. Example: A firm's blacklist has just been published in a newspaper or as a scandal. Evaluator: \"They do what?\" in a voice of incredulity. \"They ship their security files to Mem-phis in open crates? Because they are saving on postage?\" Wrath could dangerously shoot a wrong somebody. The idiocy is not believable. But a new datum leads to personnel who hired a reporter in disguise because it no longer requires or looks up references. Example: Situation where stats soared. \"They used schoolchildren to pass out litera-ture?\" That's just a point but a strange one. Turns out they also hired a cashier and had Never had one on post before! Why? Nobody to take money. Man gets dedicated to his own pet theories very easily. A true scientist doesn't fixate on one idea. He keeps looking until he finds it, not until his pet theory is proven. That's the test of an evaluator. STATISTICS One always runs by statistics where these are valid. Statistics must reflect actual desired Product. If they do not they are not valid. If they do they give an idea of ideal scene. From a statistic reflecting the desired products one can work out the departure from the ideal scene. A backlog of product production must reflect in a stat. As a backlog is negative pro-duction. From such tools an evaluator can work. __________________ The use of data analysis is relatively easy compared to learning a musical instrument. You have the hang of how it is done.

For years I wondered why this was so. Well, I found it. When people do not clearly know what their products are they require constant orders. To the Establishment Officer, this reflects most visibly in trying to get program targets done. Some people have to be ordered and ordered and ordered and threatened and howled at. Then, in a bewildered way, they do a target, sometimes half, sometimes nearly all. Behind this apparent blankness lies an omitted datum. When they're like that they don't know what their product is or what it adds up to. Or they think it's something else or should be. That blankness can invite overts. It is very seldom that malice or resentment or refusal to work lies behind the inaction. People are seldom that way. They usually just don't understand what's wanted or why. Because they don't know what a Product is! A whole Ad Council of a downstat org was unable even to define the word. They had required orders, orders, orders and even then didn't carry them out. HAT SURVEY FOR ORDERS A staff member who requires orders may also think that any order is a policy and lasts forever. If you look into hats you will even find casual \"close the door\" type of orders, given on one occasion to fit one circumstance are converted over into standing (continual) orders that forever keep a certain door closed."},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"PRODUCTION AND ESTABLISHMENT 2 ESTO-05 – HCO PL 13.03.72 ORDERS AND PRODUCTS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 452 DATA SERIES An Esto surveying the hats of a unit may very well find all manner of such oddities. It is a standard Esto action to survey hats. In hats you will find despatches giving specific orders or quoted remarks preserved in-stead of notes on what one has to know to produce a product. In auditors' hats, directions for 1 specific pc in 1960, never published and from no tape or correct source, held onto like death like it was to be applied to every pc in the world! A dishwashing hat may have orders in it but not how to wash dishes rapidly and well. This is all a symptom of a unit or activity that does not know what its products are. DISESTABLISHMENT Where you find lots of orders kicking around, you will also find disestablishment by bypass, command channels not held and staff members like to take their orders from anyone but those in authority-any passerby could give them orders. This is rampant where an executive has not been well on post. By counting such orders up and seeing who they are from one can determine the un-hattedness of staff, their org bd weaknesses and principally their lack of knowledge of their products. HATTING FOR PRODUCT If an Esto is to hat so as to get the staff member to get his product out, then the Esto has to know how to clear up \"products.\" Now an Esto is an Establishment Officer? There are Product Officers. The product of an Esto is the establishment. Then what is he doing with products? Well, if he doesn't hat so staff members get out products then the org will be a turmoil, unhappy and downstat. Production is the basis of morale. Hattedness is a basic of 3rd dynamic sanity. But if you don't hat so as to get the staff member you are hatting producing you will hat and hat and it will all be in vain. The person won't stay hatted unless he is hatted so as to be able to produce. The Product Officer should be working to get the products out. So if you don't hat for the product then the staff member will be torn between two sets of orders, the Esto's and the Product Officer's. Only when you hat to get product will you get agreement with Product Officers."},{"pageNumber":473,"pageContent":"PRODUCTION AND ESTABLISHMENT 3 ESTO-05 – HCO PL 13.03.72 ORDERS AND PRODUCTS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 453 DATA SERIES If you are in disagreement with Product Officers, then the Esto is not hatting to get production. RIGHT WAY TO There is a right direction to hat. All others are incorrect. 1. Clear up what the product is for the post and hat from there. 2. Hat from the top of the division (or org) down. These are the two right directions. All other directions are wrong. These two data are so important that the failure of an Esto can often be traced to viola-tion of them. You can have a senior exec going almost livid, resisting being hatted unless you hat by first establishing what the product is. If product is first addressed and cleaned up then you can also hat from the top down. If this is not done, the staff will not know where they are going or why and you will get silly unusual situations like, \"All right. So you're the Establishment Officer. Well, I give up. The division can have 2½ hours a day establishment time and then get the hell out of here so some work can be done! . . .\" \"Man, you got these people all tied up, stats are down! Can't you understand. . . .\" Well, if you don't do one and two above you'll run into the most unusual messes and \"solutions\" you ever heard of, go sailing off policy and as an Esto wind up at your desk doing admin instead of getting your job done in the division. And an Esto who is not on his feet working in the division is worth very little to anyone. So see where the basic errors lead and Hat on product before doing anything else and Hat from the top down. STEPS TO CLEAR \"PRODUCT\" This is a general rundown of the sequence by which product is cleared and recleared and recleared again. This can be checklisted for any exec or staff member and should be with name and date and kept in the person's \"Esto file folder\" for eventual handing to his new Esto when the person is transferred out of the division or in personnel files if he goes elsewhere. 1.

So don't \"quickie\" product. If this is poorly done on them there goes the old balloon. Hatting won't be possible. Orders will have to be poured in on this terminal. Dev-t will generate. Overt products will occur, not good ones. And it won't be worthwhile. DISAGREEMENT There can be a lot of disagreement amongst Product Officers and Estos on what prod-ucts are to be hammered out. In such a case, or in any case, one can get a Disagreements Check done in Dept of Personnel Enhancement (who should look up how to do one). This is a somewhat extreme way to settle an argument and should only be a \"when all else fails.\" It is best to take the whole product pattern of the org apart with the person, starting from the biggest product of the org and working back to the person's product. Almost always there will be an outpoint in reasoning. An exec who only wants GI can be a trial as he is violating Exchange. As an org is paid usually before it delivers, it is easy to get the org in trouble by backlogs or bad repute for non-delivery. An org that has credit payments due it that aren't paid maybe didn't deliver. But Div III may soften up collections for some reason like that and then where would the org be? __________________ Vol 0 of the OEC Course gives an excellent background of how a basic org works. As one goes to higher orgs, lower orgs are depended upon to continue to flow upward to them. (See HCO PL 9 Mar 72 Issue I Finance Series No. 11 \"Income Flows and Pools.\") A study of Vol 0 OEC and a full understanding of its basic flows and adapting these to higher orgs will unsnarl a lot of odd ideas about product. The Esto has to be very clear on these points or he could mis-hat a person. Usually however this is very obvious.

In the case of any undue difficulty, the coach uses M4 and M7 Word Clearing. Training Stress: This drill must be done on a gradient of wins. The first two or three times through the drill may take some time. The time will be well spent. The standard operating procedure to correct a student who has not done a step correctly is: 1. Give the student a Flunk. 2. Refer the student to the relevant HCO PL. 3. Reclear the definition of the key term of terms involved and get a few ex-amples given. 4. Use first M7 and then M4 Word Clearing on any Policy Letter to handle any persisting difficulty. 5. Go back and check the earlier step done to ensure correctness. 6. Rehandle the step that was flunked and take the student to a win and then proceed with the rest of the drill. Start off with very very simple Situations and Whys and build these up as the student becomes more confident and in control of the technology. The Qual Librarian should be standing by to give Policy references for students doing these Why Finding drills. If a student is having any difficulty on doing two way comm, he should be re-ferred to Dianetics 55 Chapters 7, 8 and 9.

The tech of finding a Why on an individual person is extremely important and is the fundamental tool of the Est O, Cramming Officer, Dept of Personnel Enhancement and oth-ers. The resolution of a major broad Why can depend on the finding and handling of indi-vidual Whys. Example: In LRH ED 174R INT the Why of failures in Tech and Admin areas was found to be \"Study Tech not in use for individual whys for each supervisor and stu-dent\". A similar example exists where tapes with Scientology materials were not in full or proper use, the Why being \"Tapes with Scientology materials not in use for an individual Why for each org person concerned\". In each case, the tech of finding the individual Why is necessary to handling the broad Why. This tech is contained in the Data Series PLs and is restated here in brief form for finding the Why on a person. STEPS 1. Know the Data Series PLs. (Don't have any misunderstood words on them.) 2. Work out exactly what the person should be producing. 3. Work out the ideal scene. 4. Investigate the existing scene. Observe the scene around the person for outpoints related to what the person should be doing in an Ideal Scene."},{"pageNumber":484,"pageContent":"HOW TO FIND A WHY ON A PERSON 2 CRS 16 BTB 6.04.72R AND HANDLE ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 464 DATA SERIES Verify that there is a situation with that individual and that you know what the situa-tion is. Don't go trying to find the Why of a no situation. (A bad situation is measured by the difference between existing scene and an Ideal Scene and threat to Ideal Scene.) 5. Ask the person exact specific questions pertaining to the situation. 6. Do not at any time ask the person for the Why. If the person knew the Why, the situa-tion wouldn't exist. 7. Use the comm formula and get your questions answered. Don't be diverted by the per-son's \"reasons\". 8. Note all outpoints. 9. Be alert for the area(s) with the most outpoints which relate to the situation. 10. Verify the data by looking. This will often reveal the major outpoint which leads to the Why. It must be realized that you are often looking for an omitted something, hence a knowledge of the Ideal Scene and product is required. 11. When you find a major outpoint, trace down the chain of outpoints to the Why. Pull the string by asking more questions in the area of the Major Outpoint. 12. The big crashing outpoint that explains all the other outpoints will be the Why. 13. The Why must have something to do with the person. If not, you will have a \"Why is God\" and it won't resolve. 14. Indicate the Why to the person. Correct Whys result in Cogs and VGIs. A wrong Why can make the person feel degraded, will not bring in VGIs and will not lead to a resolution of the situation. 15. Look over existing resources. 16. Get a Bright Idea of how to handle. 17. Handle or recommend handling so that it stays handled. The handling of the Why must directly relate to the Why that was found. EXAMPLES 1. Situation: Supervisor not using study tech. Investigation: Supervisor was observed, found to be very casual with students. No 8-C. Supervisor questioned. All outpoints in area of Supervisor not wanting to tell stu-dents what to do and himself not liking to be told what to do. Why: Big button on control and does not want to control others.

Situation: Student taking forever on study of tapes. Investigation: Observed student transcribing tapes so he could later look up the words. Didn't know why you don't go past a misunderstood word. Why: Never studied the study tech. Handling: Primary Rundown. 3. Situation: Staff member not doing his job. Ineffective on post. Investigation: Found out what the person was doing.

Situation: Folder Page backlogging folders. Not getting them through to C/S. Investigation: Questioned Folder Page to find her product. Found it was a C/S not overloaded with folders. Why: Working for a wrong product. Didn't know required product. Handling: Product Rundown. 5. Situation: D of P not doing standard duties. Letting Pcs stall on lines. Investigation: Checked hat and flow chart. Found flow chart had been done but never referred to and missing all the key points where Pcs can stall on lines. Expecting Pcs to arrive back at HGC of their own accord. Why: Unawareness of lines and terminals and how they can be influenced. Handling: Line Drills (following pipes and flow lines in an engine room). Make up correct flow chart and drill it. After finding the Why and getting the handling implemented, the situation is again re-viewed to see if it still exists. If so, a wrong Why was found. The Handling is to redo the steps and get the correct Why. A Why which cannot be handled or does not lead toward at-tainment of the Ideal Scene is of course a wrong Why. The finding of individual Whys on persons is normally a very fast action. The Why is simply found and the handling implemented.

Non-Remimeo Flag Bureau FOLOs Guardian Office Business Mgmt Orgs Business Management Tech Series No. 10R ALL DATA NOT BEING SENT TO DATA FILES (Compiled from a recorded conference given by L. Ron Hubbard to selected Flag Bureau staff on 30 April 1972.) It has been found that there can be only one line into a Management Org and that line goes direct to Data Files. Any other incoming line of data going to the person it's addressed to, dispatches fol-lowing the dispatch routing or reports ending up in In baskets results in vital data being parked all over the management org making evaluation impossible. A while back an org was being evaluated that had been ignored by others for 8 months and had a seriously deteriorating situation for the past 5 months. Two whole days were spent trying to evaluate the situation from a skimpy Data File while looking for more data, reports, anything to give the scene in that org. After 2 days without success, the evaluator thought all of a sudden, \"I wonder if someone might be holding on to an LRH Comm report for the area since it's coming up in another evaluation.\" He sent for it. Sure enough, it was on someone's desk. There was a note on it: \"Return it to me so that I can go through it and then send it down to Data Files.\" This key report was not in Data Files. It was on some other line and the Data Files did not have enough Data to evaluate. This is why management personnel were making mis-takes and why they were not getting things handled, at the time."},{"pageNumber":488,"pageContent":"ALL DATA NOT BEING 2 BMTS-10R – BPL 8.03.73R SENT TO DATA FILES ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 468 DATA SERIES The missing LRH Comm report was chock full of out-tech reports and tech diffi-culty reports and tech questions. It had vital information that was not available where it belonged. It contained a tech question that undoubtedly was being asked in numerous places in the world but had not been clarified by the Training and Services Aide because it was in an LRH Comm report. It would not have come anywhere near the Training and Services Aide who would have had to do an actual evaluation and get that tech question handled. Do you see the scene? While management staff were answering their own dispatch traffic, the actual situa-tions they should have been handling were just passing them by. They tried to handle it on individual dispatch lines and they could not. It could have been handled 8 months earlier and then again 5 months earlier. It could have been handled again later and now all of a sudden, it was practically over Niagara Falls with no barrel. Then when a senior Executive tried to evaluate that org. he found that others were holding on to vital data on what he was trying to evaluate. If everybody holds on to all of the essential information of evaluation and themselves do not evaluate, then you're going to end up with a down-stat scene. Where should all this traffic go? All traffic goes into the Data Files. DATE CO-ORDINATION The Why was found on this evaluation by using what is known as \"Date Co-ordination\". This is the common police action of finding out what happened against a certain date. For example: \"Joanna Lou was found in the swamp. Three days before that her ex-husband came to town. One day after that he left. The police take that as enough to pick him up and he's got swamp-grass all over his clothes and so forth.\" That's how they solve the crime. This eval used Date Co-ordination but in a different guise. As of the first time that org's stats started going down, the Org Officer started calling Comm Evs and ethics actions on everybody in sight. He removed the whole Dissem Division four months before the time of the eval. In the missing traffic was found concrete evidence that the CO of the org at the same time was doing a perfectly competent job of evaluating her supervisors' and other actions of getting the show on the road."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"ALL DATA NOT BEING 3 BMTS-10R – BPL 8.03.73R SENT TO DATA FILES ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 469 DATA SERIES In the meantime, the Org Officer was telexing the FOLO a lot of weird reports on the CO and dispatching the Guardian Office. The FOLO bought it and was writing Flag tons of dispatches how they have got to get the CO out of there. A proper evaluation showed that the Org Officer had been working on the destruction of that org for at least 5 months. However, this didn't show up on the dispatch line. If people had acted on those dis-patches they would have issued a bunch of unreal orders wrecking that org. If all these dispatches and reports had been sent directly to that org's Data Files, then Training and Services Aide would have seen the Tech Scene and someone else could have done an Eval and would have seen there was something very: out-ethics about that org's scene and traced it down to the actual Who. But only by looking through all of the data. Answering dispatches and \"handling traffic\" without evaluations only leaves us wide open to unreal orders and mis-management! ALL DATA TO DATA FILES The WHY for single dispatch handling is: \"It is easier to confront a dispatch than it is to confront the whole org scene.\" It was true that as long as the Data Files were only relatively competent and as long as the data wasn't centrally located, management personnel had an excuse to hold on to their traffic. People were concerned about handling traffic addressed to them that went directly to the Data Files. What was worked out was that all the incoming data was assembled together as it came in and an Acknowledgment Clerk would ack it immediately with mimeographed slips mailed to the sender. Individual management terminals were then notified of anything impor-tant that required their immediate handling. The data itself went directly into the Data Files. The Data Aide was augmented sufficiently to make sure the orgs sent in the data and it was relayed on to Flag by the FOLOs. No data from that time on has gone to the person it was addressed to who would just have to read the traffic again in the files. So there were no longer any independent areas where the data got parked. It all went directly to the Data Files. The only exception is Guardian Mail Packs and comm and FBO Network material. From that time on, the orgs managed by Flag have had their stats going up, up, up higher and higher out the roof."},{"pageNumber":490,"pageContent":"ALL DATA NOT BEING 4 BMTS-10R – BPL 8.03.73R SENT TO DATA FILES ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 470 DATA SERIES WATCH THE STATS AH that is done is to watch the stats. The stats of a division in an org go down and the org is evaluated. Management real-ized that nobody was going to find out anything about it until he did evaluate. All one cares about is evaluation. Evaluation should jump out of those Data Files. You count the outpoints and there it is! The people operating in many of the orgs were not operating them. It was found that they would operate them if there was heat put on. The only way you can put on heat is with correct Whys! You can't put on heat with wrong Whys. ANTIQUATED SYSTEM Here is a beautiful piece of technology that works like a bomb and it was not being used in the field of administration. The dispatch system is as archaic as the Roman Empire. It was done in those days by couriers and clay-tablets. Clay-tablets were little thin sheets always painted black or red and dipped in white wax. You wrote with a stylus and of course what you wrote came through in red or black words. You could get a copy off one by blowing soot across the thing letting it collect in the grooves in the wax. Flop it over onto a sheet of papyrus and you'd get a backwards message that you could read holding it up to the sun. So this is an old administration system, ancient and borrowed. People write dispatches and people answer dispatches and so forth. But you can't manage orgs that way! REPEATING DISPATCHES You saw here the situation of a dispatch from a Suppressive Person repeated over and over. He sent these to several different terminals who each relayed the data back to manage-ment making it look like the data was being confirmed from several separate sources. But it all came from the same person. He had \"confirmations\" working in all directions. Think with a whole brain. You cannot manage an area with a lack of adequate data. It must be all together in a complete data files system."},{"pageNumber":491,"pageContent":"ALL DATA NOT BEING 5 BMTS-10R – BPL 8.03.73R SENT TO DATA FILES ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 471 DATA SERIES It would be like someone trying to think with half his brain otherwise. Each time you answer a dispatch, you're trying to think with one-half of the data bank. That dispatch has to go into the data files and the whole file for that area has to be evaluated before you act! This is a beautiful piece of technology that has proven it boosts stats faster than rock-ets! It's been done the old way since the beginning of time without all that much success. This new way works a lot better! So do it this way and win. Compiled by Fred Hare CS-G Assistant from a recorded conference by L.

This is your first consideration in taking on a new business management client. Are the products or services of the client of real benefit to society? Once it is established that the client's purpose is beneficial, you must then ensure he makes money. In the commercial society of this day and age it is a crime to be broke. Some say it is the only crime a group can commit. The moral rightness or wrongness of it is not the question because if you fail to make money, you're dead. The word \"business\" means remunerative activity. No matter how altruistic are your goals, you are in the business of making money. Cold, hard cash! From experience, if you cite that as a target, the worthwhile purpose will be achieved and the rest will succeed. You can't ever push anything but the exchange. There are always ways we can monitor that exchange so that the org will produce for it.

That is a cavalryman's maxim. Marat, Napoleon's Calvary leader, won more actions than you could shake a stick at with that one. In other words, you keep hitting where it's hot and you'll gradually come out of a bat-tle situation. What is a hotspot? Where everything is going to hell? No. Not necessarily. A hotspot is where attention would save you a great deal of trouble and would make you a great deal of money. The way you make money is by putting up the stats of orgs. THE DIVISION OF LABOUR The action in which you are engaged in is finding an org that has been responsible for income in the past and evaluate it. Then do your outline of Mission Orders, programs or other actions that are to be done. The evaluation and Mission Orders or primary programming would be done at top exec level or by a special Evaluation Unit (Staff level on Flag). The general observation and getting missions and programs executed is the business of Div 4, your production or Management Division (called Operations on Flag). In other words, operating and bringing into effect the planning is the business of pro-duction. This does not relieve Div 4 from evaluation as it must handle and debug missions and programs. It does relieve it from what you might call \"primary evaluation.\" We have a Multiple Viewpoint System in our Data Department (Bureau) and we can do very hot evaluations. You'll suddenly find out that it is often necessary to evaluate something that went on 3 years ago. \"What did they do then that was so successful? All right, let's do it!\" That would be at planning level or a primary evaluation. Your secondary evaluation or your operating evaluation is against the actual conduct of the mission or program. There also has to be somebody posted someplace who alerts people when something has got to be handled because stats are low, etc. You are operating against income."},{"pageNumber":495,"pageContent":"MANAGEMENT EVALUATION 3 BMTS-12 – BPL 9.04.73 AND HANDLING OF ORGS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 475 DATA SERIES The way you do this is you find something that isn't producing and you make it pro-duce. Production means that it has got to deliver. And if you do this sensibly, the next thing you know you will get expansion. You will also get an accuracy of Technology. ADMINISTRATION FAILURE Administration fails because executives accept any false reports that are given to them. They are in the same boat as the Case Supervisor who said run such and such and the auditor came back and said \"that didn't work!\" In the old days before we knew better the C/S might give him something else to run. We've learned our lesson. Now a C/S will ask the question, \"What didn't work?\" and find the auditor ran something entirely different. We found out that this is almost uniform. There was one executive recently who was saying: \"But you know policy doesn't really work. I mean I'm having an awful time making it work. Because you see I sent my HAS to do dummy runs on the public lines several times. He kept doing them, but it didn't go in.\" Do you see what was out? He did not handle administration in the same way that we handle auditors. He should have said, \"What did you do?\" Do you see? Knowing that much we can change the whole scene. The reason it's like that is out Study Tech. The end phenomenon of Study Tech is now being told as follows: \"It is very com-fortable to read. I learn what I read and as soon as I read something I know how to do it!\" People can't read an instruction book and then simply walk over and operate the ma-chine because of out Study Tech. Beyond making them go through some mechanical motions, hatting people is a waste of time until they have done a Study Rundown. That's the source of false reports from clients and they don't even know they are false reporting. They defend or protect themselves as best they can because they don't know what they are talking about. They go into a sort of robotism. HANDLING THE PROBLEM This phenomena was covered years ago in HCO Policy Letter of 5 May 1959 quoted here in full.

However, when we make a staff the effect of the post too much we spoil the necessity of the staff member creating his post and job. He ceases to be at cause and cannot solve the problems of his post. It is vital that HCO Area Sees at once get staff members to realize the real role of Sec E.D.s and Hats and despite these to create the post continually and handle the problems of that post. HCO Sees should insist upon the necessity to be causative on a post while still abid-ing with policy and purpose. Let's get these staff members at Cause Point. The actual mechanics are these. The individual case-wise is being a total effect of something (nothing to do with Scientology or his post). Sec E.D.s and hats come in as a lock on this – not themselves bad. The thing to do is get an individual on post case-wise up to cause by modern proc-esses. Then preach at him (1) Keep the post created and in line and (2) Solve the problems of his post and handle things.

The CCHs, Confront, Hav-ingness. After all these years we collide with Havingness, and we find out that it solves sup-pression and PTSness. You will find most organizations are full of PTSes and people whose ethics are out. You've got all the weapons to take care of them. With proper PTS handling and tech applica-tion by EstOs and through auditing, you can rescue some people. You don't necessarily have to continue to kick people out. What good does it do to put in a vast quantity of study when personnel are not reading in such a way that they can apply what they are studying?"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"MANAGEMENT EVALUATION 5 BMTS-12 – BPL 9.04.73 AND HANDLING OF ORGS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 477 DATA SERIES You are interested in a problem in resources. What can you do with what you've got, while you improve what you've got? It will all have to be done by a gradient. The worse off things are, the brighter you have to be. EVALUATION/HANDLINGS This is covered in the Data Series. There is an Admin Why which is the normal one that you're trying to handle. Below that there will be an Ethics Why and above that there will be a Bright Idea. You have to know how to do a pluspoint analysis as well, all by pluspoints. Who was where, what did they do and what were the stats? With programs and mission orders done by your top exec structure or in an Evalu-ations Unit, they then have got to have the resulting actions operated by Div. 4. That tells you at once that if you write something that can't be operated, nothing will happen. It immediately tells you whether you have a good evaluation or a bad evaluation. A bad evaluation, for example, would have its Why insufficiently specific to do any-thing about. It basically just can't be operated. All of a sudden we turn this over to the fellow who has to operate it. What can he do with targets that do not result in direct action. Your Why must be specific. The Ethics Why is basically that the people who receive it can't read, and that's Why your projects have such a hard time. If people cannot read the sense of something, you have to issue it as an order in such a way to overcome that obstacle. You write it up saying exactly what to do with what, specifi-cally stated. For example you say exactly what promotion goes out and that is all. It consists of this and it doesn't consist of that and that is it. Your Why has to be simple and your handling consist of specific targets. SAMPLE PROGRAM 1. Three copies of duplistickers are typed for all New Names to C/F. 2. Each duplisticker is put on a magazine mailing envelope and mailed out with a maga-zine. 3. The next three Mag issues go to each new name to C/F regardless of what they are. It's just exactly one, two, three. Now you can monitor it on the basis of \"We did that!\" \"What did you do?\" \"Oh, we put them under the spittoons...\""},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"MANAGEMENT EVALUATION 6 BMTS-12 – BPL 9.04.73 AND HANDLING OF ORGS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 478 DATA SERIES Do you see? You can send a program like this or even a missionaire over to the org to enforce it and suddenly you have got some promotion going out. This is a new system. With the old system the best you could do was write some things out and hope for some compliances. But you can't buy anything with hope. Therefore you must write things up as your handling that can be executed and then you're in the money. You're in the business for the \"buck.\" Like the fellow says, \"If you can't do anything else, you can make money.\" It's easy to make money! There are plenty of millionaires around doing it and they don't have much tech. If they can make money, you sure can. As far as your delivery is concerned, it is mostly slowed down because you are not selling enough. The change here is in people doing things. You'll find that staffs are idle. While look-ing terribly frantic, rushing all over the place, they are not producing anything. Why do an evaluation if you're not going to get people to do something with it. Be-cause they can't read, you have to spell it out in a simple series of actions that get the results you want. COMBATING INFLATION Inflation is going up at a mad rate and the way you keep ahead of it is a difficult prob-lem in itself. It's a finance problem and the only way you can keep ahead of it is by giving smaller packages of the same thing for the same price. Because you can't raise prices. You can re-package your services. You can work out new services and get new clients one after the other and bang their stats up one after the other. You can get very hot on your evaluations, get very bright and boost stats with a simple action like a telex or a letter. You can get very clever with mission handling and cross-evaluate mission reports to see if they make sense, with additional evaluations made for what the mission is running into. They are groomed in on it and guided like you handle guided missiles. GETTING ETHICS IN The reason you can't get an org's stats up when you can't is because you don't put eth-ics in on it. You have to get ethics in to get tech in."},{"pageNumber":499,"pageContent":"MANAGEMENT EVALUATION 7 BMTS-12 – BPL 9.04.73 AND HANDLING OF ORGS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 479 DATA SERIES Most people have \"getting ethics in\" equated to just a general assignment of a condi-tion or a Comm Ev or something of that character. That's a justice action before ethics has been tried. You're getting into the redefinition of ethics and justice actually. It is a brand-new posh-up of existing technology and it can be handled with auditing if you have it available or with EstO tech. RESOURCES AND VIABILITY This brings up the question. \"What are the resources of an area?\" When you do your evaluation and handling, it is against resources. Part of that is \"What is the excellence of the tech of the area?\" When you do an evaluation then, you must have these conditions. What money is it going to save? Or what stats is it going to raise where? There is no such thing as a general stat for all orgs. Read Problems of Work and apply to your org handling. You just handle them one at a time and it will all come right. The next question is. \"What is the viability of the operation?\" The operation must make more money than it costs. So far the cheapest handling that we've sent out was one telex and one postage stamp. Look at your pluspoints. You've got a network. You have a great deal of admin tech, mission tech, ethics tech and other kinds of tech. You have the Multiple Viewpoint Manage-ment System and a lot of things to work with. These are tools, and just as you are going to take a preclear and figure out what you are going to do to him, you do the same with an org. MANAGEMENT CONSULTATION Your Management Division has a Management Consultant Department of some sort who can write clients letters, stay in communication, and give them service. No orders, just service. Clients have queries and needs. You don't have to interpret tech, just send a clari-fication and fill their needs. You start coming unstuck when you start issuing independent orders instead of clarifying. You have to run it by areas or type of client. Each consultant has his or her own group of clients to handle personally. When something interesting is going along it is sent to the client. Programs are pushed through but no orders outside of pushing program targets. Clients will demand orders almost at once, so beware. It's in the line of getting in ARC and getting proper programs done."},{"pageNumber":500,"pageContent":"MANAGEMENT EVALUATION 8 BMTS-12 – BPL 9.04.73 AND HANDLING OF ORGS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 480 DATA SERIES DATA COLLECTION There is another line which is a demand for reports. A Data Collection Officer has a checklist and checks off the reports orgs have sent and then nags them until they get in those reports. He carries this on endlessly and alerts people on certain reports that are not coming in from such and such a place. This also requires a simplification of the reports because you could tie up a whole staff just writing reports while no production got done. They can also get so simple that you don't get any data out of them at all, and they can get so complex they tie up the lines totally. You also have an Acknowledgment Officer who is doing acknowledgments of stan-dard reports coming in. He just plain acks them. Nothing is done, no orders are given until you have an idea of the scene and it is fully evaluated. Then you know what you are doing. EVALUATING ORGS The trouble with most evaluations is that the whys are wrong and the handlings too weak or unreal. The first indicator is stats. You take a stat book of an org and look over its GDSes. You know their inter-relationships and find the outpoint. Then from that outpoint you know what part of a folder to read. If you are doing evaluations by reading the whole folder, you're being silly. You're in-terested in the first outpoint that always occurs in stats. It's a stat oddity of some sort, an in-consistency. \"Advertising and promotion costs are way up but sales are way down.\" Something that doesn't make sense, is contradictory or false. Just the fact that an org's stats are down is an outpoint. If their stats were up at one point they must have been doing something right, so why are they now down? So you look for a downstat. Having found that you look to see if that org ever did make money. If the org was ever affluent, you've got something that approximates its ideal scene. You can't evaluate one thing, as you learn in the Data Series, unless you have some-thing to compare it with. That's why stats are separate from Data Files, as you haven't approached Data Files yet. Let's say you find an org was really booming in July of 1969, and that rise started on the 6th of June. What did they do in May and June of '69? You want those two folders, or for a new client you'll have to collect the data and make up folders for that period that gives you something dimly resembling an Ideal Scene."},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"MANAGEMENT EVALUATION 9 BMTS-12 – BPL 9.04.73 AND HANDLING OF ORGS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 481 DATA SERIES It isn't the Ideal Scene, but it is certainly an upstat scene that gives you a comparative. You might have to collect a little bit more data to fill in the missing holes by telexing the org. You know that it was doing something then that it is not doing now. You have to watch handling of expenses. The cost of an operation has to be well planned and real. Orgs have to be effective per number of staff members which at once gives you an Ethics Why, not a \"they haven't been hatted Why!\" After finding some period of affluence for an org that gives you some sort of ideal scene, you then must do something of a pluspoint evaluation for that period to get an ap-proximation of the Ideal Scene. You have already found a main outpoint in the stats. This leads directly to other out-points in that area. You don't have to read 8,752 folders, just count up the outpoints in that area and the thing will just fall apart. ETHICS SITUATION You will notice that the Ethics situation develops when you try to get in the admin or tech Why. In one case the Ethics situation developed to such a degree that after an observa-tion mission, an evaluation and handling was done and orders were directly issued to the area, they did not execute a single one of them. When this happens, an Ethics Why has to be looked for. There is also a sort of Ethics action in reverse. It's looking for who really pushes it. You could find that certain people have a vast effect on stats. This is how you evaluate a personnel scene. When you don't know, you've got to send an investigatory mission. It has got to be run well otherwise they just wind up shooting all the people the staff complain about, like their Executives who interrupt their afternoon nap and make them work, etc. You have to be sure you get the right person, not some pawn who wouldn't have affected the stats one way or an-other. The reason stats go up is not necessarily because certain people are removed but it may be. In an Ethics investigation you have to compare personnel for the ideal scene and you may have to act fast to put people back that had been removed. The important point here is that you must operate with a comparison every time. Comparison Admin Why, comparison on the stats, ethics comparisons, etc. If you try to oper-ate on a single datum, it won't buy you any pie, because it has nothing to compare with. What the Data Bureau gives us is experience, huge files full of experience going back over the years and you are just as interested in 1970 as in 1973."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"MANAGEMENT EVALUATION 10 BMTS-12 – BPL 9.04.73 AND HANDLING OF ORGS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 482 DATA SERIES OPERATION TIPS 1. A Special Stats Unit is needed for correcting past false stats that may have occurred or drawing up a special graph for some evaluation or constructing stats for an org back before they kept stats or what have you. 2. You can have Liaison Offices near client orgs that nag them for reports and push for program compliances. They can also handle small clients in the area for you that don't provide you with large income. They should have several management experts (mis-sionaires) on their staff to handle minor matters with clients but operated from your HQ. 3. You have to have a terminal in your production division that takes care of providing future management experts (missionaires). You can have newly recruited or other per-sonnel, after their basics are in and they have proven themselves on a post, run through special training to become future management experts. 4. Every single client org is peculiar. It is particularly itself. What's wrong with it? – is your first question. 5. The amount of care and attention to be given is answered by the question, \"Did we ever make any money out of it?\" Where you have made money is where you will make money. 6. We have more technology than any planet, any dozen planets could absorb in the next two or three centuries. 7. If you do one expert evaluation for an org and that gets enforced, they really do it and finish it up, and if your lines are so rigged that it goes in all the way, their stats will go up. 8. What is production? Production as far as the top exec structure or Evaluations Unit (\"Staff\" on Flag) is concerned is an evaluation which will when operated raise stats right now. Production as far as Management Experts (\"Action\" on Flag) is concerned is concluded missions. Production as far as the Data Department (\"Bureau\" on Flag) is concerned is a complete set of individual viewpoints one for each org. As far as Man-agement Consultants (\"Management\" on Flag) are concerned it's completed programs. SUMMARY You have to learn to get very sharp with evaluations and to cut corners to speed them up. This is the way you do this: 1. You don't read everything. 2. For your Admin Whys look at your GDSes which tell you that big outpoint and what type of information you're looking for in the files. You're only interested in that infor-mation."},{"pageNumber":503,"pageContent":"MANAGEMENT EVALUATION 11 BMTS-12 – BPL 9.04.73 AND HANDLING OF ORGS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 483 DATA SERIES 3. You start counting up that type of information and see where it lands. The why will practically jump out at you out of the folder whether you used a comparative datum or not. 4. Then do an analysis of who and what went on when and where at a good stat time and a bad stat time. The placement of stats in the outline of an evaluation in the Data Series is probably out of sequence. It belongs at the beginning as you start by looking for your outpoint in the GDSes. 5. An Ethics Why has got to go in on it. 6. When you've got your evaluation all done, your handling has got to be a bright idea that will actually drive those stats up. 7. When you're writing up your evaluations remember that your Target No. 1 is never an Organizational Target. Never! It's always a Production Target of some kind. If all else fails you'll get there just on production. 8. Your handling has to be something that can be operated at this stage of the game or you're just wasting your time. The orgs are full of people who cannot read. They will organize themselves black in the face because they do not produce. For example, it was found through observation of the early EstO system that the why of the system not functioning was that EstOs could not confront. These observations made it obvious what EstOs were doing. They were not doing! They were not going into their areas and hatting the personnel. The Exec EstO took 4 days of pounding before he saw that fact. When he did, we were away. The first point to be made here is to get across how much \"knock on the door\" you have to do to an org to get action. This shows you how high your handling has to be scaled to bite! The second point here is that through these observation reports we had a sort of Data File of the area and we therefore knew more about the scene than the Exec EstO. That's what your Data Bureau has got to do at all given times. They have got to know more about an org than the org does. It's not hard to do because the top executives of an org do not read all the reports coming out of an org. If you're going to train lions, you've got to know more than the lions. You don't neces-sarily have to know more technology than the lions, but you sure have to know more than the lions. This system tells you more about the org than they know in the org. You've got to be a better evaluator than any around in the org. Then do your evaluations in such a way that they are dead on. They have got to be something that can be operated, and the next thing you know, the stats will go up. Then per Problems of Work you take them one org at a time or two orgs at a time or three orgs at a time."},{"pageNumber":504,"pageContent":"MANAGEMENT EVALUATION 12 BMTS-12 – BPL 9.04.73 AND HANDLING OF ORGS ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 484 DATA SERIES Your phasing is something like this: When it leaves the top executive or evalua-tion/planning area, you walk right alongside of that mission or program to your production level. Here they operate the mission or program and if there is not a new one pushed out or completed every day, you're not even faintly in production. Now with right Whys, Bright Ideas, right on the button and management actually completing programs and missions every day, what do you think will happen to your stats? Pretty simple, isn't it?

Ron Hubbard on 2 August 1972 and adapted slightly for additional use by Business Management Orgs.) The essence of the Management Consultant Department in Business Management Orgs and the Management Bureau on Flag is world coverage as Management. You are the people who manage the respective zones and areas of the planet as our interests apply to them. Take a look at a map of your country or of the world and, if there is any smallest sector of our interest which you do not cover, you will not have been performing your full duties. You have both the specialization of territory areas of the world and the specialization of types of actions. There are certain specialized types of actions which are represented in the Management Consultant Department or Management Bureau. Whether you are fully manned up or not, you are fully responsible no matter who is or is not assigned to a sector. If anything goes wrong in your sector that the Management Consultant Department or Management Bu-reau is not handling from a specialist point of view, it is your responsibility. We recently found that we had two clients which were not covered in any way by the Management Bureau. Well, that can't be under this system. So if you want to know the total scope of your specialties, look over every scope and area which we control and that will give you the entire list. It is very simple."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE AND ACTION 2 BMTS-14R - B PL 25.04.73R OF MANAGEMENT ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 490 DATA SERIES DIVISIONAL SPECIALISTS You will need a group of national or international specialists covering Divisions 1 to 7 as specialized actions (International Secretaries on Flag). A full list of hats that would belong to international divisional specialists going back to the WW Management days in late 1965 and covered in Policy and CBOs would actually be-long to the Management Consultant Department or Management Bureau. This is a specialized sector which goes international (or national for a Business Man-agement Org) and goes across the lines of the Management Personnel or Management Con-sultants who are responsible for their areas. They would give you the actions necessary gener-ally for these divisions all over the world. Until you have these 7 Divisional Experts, the individual area chiefs or consultants would have these hats. First and foremost you cover it all whether organized to do so or not. How you organ-ize to cover it all is secondary, but it will very soon catch up with you if it is not then organ-ized. You can ask yourself individually what you have done as a Management Consultant or Management Personnel to raise the stats directly in your area without any question that it was your action to do so. When you have seen the results of what you did. then you can say, \"I raised the stats in Kokomo!\". It is very important that you take responsibility for your areas, because you actually are the ones held responsible for all the stats down to the smallest GDS in the area for which you are the Management Consultant or Management Personnel. MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS The reason we call it Management Bureau on Flag is so that in Liaison Offices they will not go autonomous. An autonomous action is something they dream up all by themselves, push forward all by themselves and is not co-ordinated in any way with other management. We have found that that is destructive. So the essence of the whole operation is co-ordination. Co-ordination means working in agreement together, therefore you must have a one-channel line from Flag through a Liaison Office to an org. With a Business Management Org, as it grows and extends its operation, it will de-velop first some type of franchise system and then branch offices. These will act as Liaison Offices for the more important clients that are signed up for Multiple Viewpoint Management Service, therefore the pattern as developed on Flag is quite applicable to them as well. The Flag-Liaison Office-Org system was the first and foremost, and earliest successful plan of management. It was put into effect in 1969 and we have worked hard to get it in."},{"pageNumber":511,"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE AND ACTION 3 BMTS-14R - B PL 25.04.73R OF MANAGEMENT ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 491 DATA SERIES The system depends on a Liaison Office near the client org seeing that your programs are carried out and that reports and observations are sent to you. However, the lack of an ade-quate Liaison Office does not excuse a Management Personnel or Management Consultant from getting good results. It isn't God, or luck, or distance. If you were in charge of orgs on Mars and their stats were down and you had no way in which to communicate with Mars, you would still be held responsible. You see, it's just an extreme view. GET VERY, VERY BRIGHT When you cannot expend fabulous amounts of money on air fare or on telexes or on fancy teams of experts because the client or org is too small or not worth it, what do you do? Well, I'll tell you what you do. You get very, very bright! If you just go on a basis that all that is required of you is to be a genius, you have a very simple look at the scene the way it is. Yes, it's very difficult, but one org's stats kept going up for several months after one evaluation and a letter. So it can be done. When you have barriers all you have to do is get brighter. Very elementary. These bar-riers are not insurmountable at all. STABLE TERMINALS Your communication line is Flag – Flag Operations Liaison Office – Org or Man-agement Org – Liaison Office – Client. This is the pattern which you have to get in. Although somebody is in charge of the Liaison Office, the fellow at the other end of the line is hearing from you via your Liaison Office Management Consultant or Management Personnel opposite number. You are trying to communicate with Mr. Glutz in Kokomo and to communicate with him depends totally upon the co-operative action of your Liaison Office relay. Therefore getting your Liaison Office Management Consultant or Management Rep-resentative to work for you is part of your problem. A survey was done and it was found that stronger comm lines were needed and wanted between Flag and FOLO personnel. So if you don't pay any attention to that relay point in your Liaison Office, if he doesn't know you, if he doesn't trust you, if he doesn't trust your good sense and if he isn't willing to push hard, your line is broken. No matter how bright you get here, you're going to get nothing happening at the other end, because the pattern is Flag-FOLO-Org or Business Management Org-Liaison Office-Client. That is a one-channel pattern. No matter how many people use that channel, it still goes through that channel."},{"pageNumber":512,"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE AND ACTION 4 BMTS-14R - B PL 25.04.73R OF MANAGEMENT ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 492 DATA SERIES The number of things that get done depends on the cooperation of that person at the Li-aison Office. You should send a photograph of yourself to your people that you are communicating with and you should make it your business to get a photograph of them. They will be happy to receive a photo of you, but they will be twice as flattered for you to ask for a photo of them. This is the person who believes in you or who doesn't and the conviction in his tele-phone voice is probably the thing you are depending upon for getting something done smoothly. You have a Stable Datum in your Liaison Office and you have to have a Stable Datum at the other end of the line with your client or org. (Read \"Problems of Work\", Confusion and Stable Datum.) The stability of your relay terminal and the stability of the person at the other end of the line depends in a large measure upon the smoothness of your communication, your ability to hat on a long distance communication line, and your ability to put them there as a Stable Da-tum. If you haven't got anybody there at all, you are going to have a total confusion. If you confuse a client with too many cross-orders, \"back and forwards\" and cancellations, you're creating a confusion. What you must do is make the stable terminal you've got there more stable. We are totally dependent upon this datum about Stable Terminals. Our communication lines must go through Stable Terminals. If you don't have Stable Terminals to pass them through, you won't get there. Now and then somebody tries to violate this. \"Let's remove the Management Rep of FOLO Canada. We'll remove the Management Rep of FOLO Canada and then let's get To-ronto org to ...\" What's wrong with that sequence? How are you going to communicate to To-ronto? You took the telephone pole out and now wonder why the lines are on the ground. Do you see? You have to pay a lot of attention to the stability of the terminals at your relay point and at the org. A lot of attention. One of the ways you do this is, first and foremost, hat him. Another way is to earn his respect. You do this by making things clearly understood to him. Keep him genned in. You don't just regard your relay terminal as a soulless something or other. You are re-sponsible for him. Keep him genned in so that he isn't left in the dark. If you put him in a posi-tion where he knows a little bit more than the head of the org he is talking to, he'll talk with some cockiness and pride. If you put him in a position where he doesn't know what is going on, he'll start saying so over telephone and communication lines, and then where are you going to be?"},{"pageNumber":513,"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE AND ACTION 5 BMTS-14R - B PL 25.04.73R OF MANAGEMENT ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 493 DATA SERIES \"I don't know what they're thinking of but I was told to tell you. ...

Out in Ohio there was a company with a very sad story and this is only one of scores today in the US. It seems they ran into an operating loss of more than a million dollars and a total loss after write-offs of 9.4 million. They were so successful putting out those give-away stamps for Supermarkets, they decided that they were going to diversify. They went into the hotel business and they took on some other chains as well. Their stock went up like a rocket from 6 dollars to 42 dollars in one year, which sure is better than a slight increase! It is now back down to $5 and they are not expected to live. What happened to this company is that the President and Officers were unable to man-age these new diversified corporations. STAT ANALYSIS You have to be hotter than a pistol on stat analysis. You have to get as good as I am on the subject. I can look through a stat book in the course of ten minutes and tell you what is wrong with an org and I ask you to be able to do the same. After I have looked through a stat book at the GDSes, I can tell if an evaluation done on that org is correct or not. Of course, the Data Files must be gone through to evaluate why the stats of an org are the way they are. But you can see what the general scene is in an org by the stats. This is true even if they are false stats, because the first thing you see is a false stat. Here is an obvious false stat: \"Gross Income 2 cents, Paid Completions (or product sales) 2,000\". Obviously one is false. Or \"Letters Out 3, Letters In 200\". Not true! In other words, stats can be too silly, or they can be too rude. But, normally, stats are not false. You should be able to take the GDSes of an org, simply go through them and spot the main trouble. What is happening is very easily read from the stats, and Why it is happening is found by your evaluation from the Data Files."},{"pageNumber":514,"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE AND ACTION 6 BMTS-14R - B PL 25.04.73R OF MANAGEMENT ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 494 DATA SERIES As a Management Personnel or Management Consultant you want to get the Stat Management PLs and look these things over. Get accustomed to looking at an org's GDSes and at Continental GDSes and spot where to curve in on an evaluation. Your evaluation will find the Why. If you're very clever in your stat analysis, you can spot exactly where the stops and the crazinesses are in an org. Then you know exactly what to evaluate. That is the mysterious fact behind how an expert evaluator can take a bunch of GDSes. look through them and then go through the Data Files counting outpoints and wind up with a Why in a relatively short space of time. He is only reading those things to find out something, not just to gather facts like an almanac. The highest stat period tells you how the org was running well and the stat analysis tells you exactly how it is stopped now. You're only doing a Data Analysis to find out the Why of that stop. WHY FINDING Who would that concern? What reports would you have to read to do that? You cer-tainly are not interested in product success stories if you are looking for a complete stop in personnel hiring. It would be disrelated. You go through the file and the more data analysis you do, the more bullpen data you get. When you don't find a good enough idiot reason, you've got to look further. \"Bulk Mail Out is high and Letters In very low ... Letters Out very, very high, Letters In very low. ...\" And you go a little further on the thing and you finally find out that: \"There is nobody answering the mail and probably not even counting it.\" Or something like that. In handling orgs you have to be a genius. In doing evaluations you have to think like an idiot. The more you figure: \"Oh, they would never do that!\", the more evaluations you are go-ing to fail on. They depended upon the people who were managing that hotel chain to go on and suc-cessfully manage it but they didn't. Then the company as a Management Activity couldn't fig-ure out how to handle the people who were running these hotels. In each of their new activities they ran into the same problem. They didn't know what was wrong with them and they couldn't get their orders followed. The guy who was running all this couldn't have been a complete dummy, because he understood that that was the trouble, even though he shared in the guilt of it. They didn't know what was wrong with that outlying company. They didn't give it or-ders and instructions that were intelligent. They couldn't even get the orders they did give fol-lowed. And down she went! This last point is the reverse side of the coin.

A survey of one set of clients demonstrated conclusively that being solvent – making money – was about the lousiest thing anybody ever did in his life. If you're red hot, even without remedying that HE&R (Human Emotion and Reaction) on the subject of money, you could have made them make money.

And if you're red, red hot, you can get them to understand that you're not asking them to do something silly, but it is quite desirable for them as well. It's done with PR techniques. So, if you're real good and your reputation is kept up, if you answer up and your com-munication line is good, if you operate on right Whys and you get your terminals established, they will do anything you want them to do, including having high stats! That is the pattern! It's the pattern that has been driving stats up since 1969. SOLVENCY It isn't how much money you are making. It's how solvent you are. The first threat you watch for in orgs and with clients is solvency! It can be deceptive. Why anybody would raise their stats two cents and immediately start spending 50 cents is some kind of local problem. The first thing that will make your orgs cease to be there is solvency. The second thing is a failure to deliver correct tech or good products. You have got to learn to think like an idiot. The phrase is used advisedly. What would an idiot do? And that's usually the source of where you get your Why. Some Whys fail to be spot on. There can be a sentence wording not quite right, or there's some little phrase missing in it that would make all that difference. Sometimes a Why is kind of obscure. Therefore when your program doesn't work you offload fast. The three main reasons programs don't work after you've evaluated are: 1. They are not communicated."},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE AND ACTION 8 BMTS-14R - B PL 25.04.73R OF MANAGEMENT ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 496 DATA SERIES 2. They are not done (even though they're correct). 3. They are wrong. After you have settled that the first two are in, and you still don't get an immediate rea-sonable resurgence, then you'd better start looking at the Why again. But make sure the first two are there. COMMUNICATION Part of all this is getting yourself understood. If you can get yourself understood, you're in clover. If you can't get yourself understood, you have had it. When you communicate you have to know what you are communicating. You must have something to communicate. If you do stat analysis and evaluations, you know what you are communicating about. But is that communication going to be understood? Even though you are writing a very short telex, your communication has to be under-stood at the other end. There is a trick that can be cultivated. It's writing something and then reading it back as though you were the recipient and had never heard of it. If you put your tel-exes and your dispatches to that simple test as a routine action, you will be a long way ahead and you will save yourself a lot of Dev-T. This is your stock in trade: Communication. You are communicating over a long-distance communication line. A lot of people have guilty consciences and they are defensive. They think they are do-ing great when they are doing badly, and they misread things all over the place. You are com-municating to people who often cannot read very well and they misunderstand words. Add that to the general situation and you find you have to express yourself to a person who has misunderstood words. Therefore your communication has to be very clean and be very well understood. You need to sell the guy at the other end the idea of understanding and cooperating with you. You must be a good salesman and able to do a sales talk. When all else fails, you may have to use threats and sledgehammers. Don't shoot them or deafen them until they have given a clear understanding that there is only one way you can get through to them and that is with sledgehammers. The number of times you will get through with a sledgehammer are very few as well. Your communication should be very, very clear and every word should count. A letter should simply take up a situation and keep it going. It tries to solve the thing. It says what the situation is and each statement is a clearcut statement of what is happening. When they receive a letter like this, it is read very carefully and several times. This should reward them a complete understanding of what is going on. It would be very disheartening if the communication omits something so that after it was read very carefully, they still don't know what was happening."},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE AND ACTION 9 BMTS-14R - B PL 25.04.73R OF MANAGEMENT ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 497 DATA SERIES Supposing a letter was written this way: \"Dear Joe.

By the way, we are shifting one of your production lines over to another org. You've been awful nice sending reports and we're very glad ...\" Do you get the idea? Your \"Dear Joe\" relay of communication has very, very little to do with the clarity of the communication. The friendliness does not necessarily add to its clarity. If you want to be totally friendly, give him enough data and state it clearly enough that he can understand it. That is the friendliest kind of communication possible. Here is a good example: \"Based on the Jones debrief which was very favourable to you ...\" (Knocking out his HE&R potential, 'Ole Jones went in and gave a bunch of bad stuff on me, did he?'). Based on the Jones debrief which was very favourable to you, the following telex was sent you: (telex text). As I did not want to put anything more on a long distance comm line to be seen by your staff, the Why found was, an Executive Director who while exhibiting commendable personal leadership, is taking offline orders and has ambitions to leave and is looking for justifica-tions!\" This letter was right on! You know, it was totally accepted. It was the correct Why and it has proven out now over several months. After some time went by, another letter was sent: \"Thank you very much for the nicest acknowledgment I've had for some time, your or-ganization's stats! Each week the good indicators come in all over when the lovely rises you're making happen come through. Commend your staff.\" This is actually all that has happened to this org. This guy wasn't running an org because he had one foot outside the org ready to cut and run and work somewhere else. He was told so and that blew that. It was true. He got down to work and made the stats go up, because he is quite capable if he would stay on post. That was the total evaluation and a dead on Why. When you are trying to get your line through to an org, it requires a clear-cut com-munication. It also requires that you use \"Problems of Work\", Confusion and the Stable Datum, as explained earlier, and put a stable terminal there. VARIETY OF VIEWPOINTS It's very, very funny, but it doesn't seem there are very many people in the society that can produce stats for themselves. We must realize that we are going into a society which for a number of decades has been under the hammer and pound of how nasty money is. Somebody could also go on a campaign of how nasty food is or how nasty it is to sleep in bed. So any kind of campaign can get going."},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"THE PURPOSE AND ACTION 10 BMTS-14R - B PL 25.04.73R OF MANAGEMENT ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 498 DATA SERIES There seems to be only one \"crime\" that you can commit in this civilization, even in Russia, and that's to have no money. It appears that is the only crime you can commit. It is an unforgivable death sentence. The rest of it, murder, etc, well you can hire lawyers and bail yourself out and extend proceedings, etc. as long as you have money. Weird! Therefore, you may not be talking to people who share your belief in survival. They may have entirely different ideas. You don't know very often what local enthusiasms are popu-lar. You are operating through Opinion Leaders and sometimes they have some remarkable opinions. It will be very difficult to guess at some of them. You will find these things in your evaluations and you must not do a not-is of the out-points. One of the reasons people have trouble evaluating is they say, \"Oh now, that's too in-credible!\", and pass on down the line. No, it isn't too incredible. That was what you were looking for. EXPANSION We are in a state of expansion. You are undermanned and as your stats go up, you will find that your traffic increases. The lines are going to speed up. When lines speed up, they find every weak point that you have. They find the weak points of hatting. They find the weak areas that are not covered. They find the little points where things aren't quite aligned right. At that point, as the lines speed up, you'll see a little puff of smoke and the fuses start going. Then as the lines speed up from there, the place just becomes a screaming mist. And we're speeding them up. Therefore you want to get the traffic under rather perfect control as you are now, at its present volume and level. If you have your traffic under perfect control, you stand a chance when it expands. There is no point going into a state of overwhelm by suddenly realizing it in the middle of the night. It is better to realize it here and now. Take a look at that map. Take a good look!

MODEL EVALUATION In the Data Series it says the data by definition is that major outpoint which when in-vestigated brought one to the Why. That may take upwards to 75 words, if you are verbose. Here is an almost classic evaluation I did that becomes a howling, screaming success! It shot a Tech Division's Completions and Student Points into Affluence in no time at all. It's a very simple evaluation: SITUATION The Situation is: \"Drop of bodies on course.\" That's an elementary Situation taken straight off a reliable action. There is a Situation. There were something like 265 bodies on course and now there are 20 bodies on course with no completions in the meantime."},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"HANDLING AND EVALUATING ORGS 2 BMTS-15 – BPL 26.04.73R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 502 DATA SERIES STATS The stats are: \"Crashed, then recovering to three-quarters former level.\" They did recover somewhat, for reasons we're not going to bother to investigate. These are the remaining stats in the Tech Division, not the bodies on course. So those few guys left on course must be sweating like mad to get any stats up because the situation is the bodies have dropped. DATA The Data is: \"Unbelievable musical chairing, rip-offs and changes in Supervisors.\" Pe-riod. No names or when they were ripped off or anything else is needed. The stat drop was the alert. A query was done. No Supervisors could be found on post. The DofT was no fool and managed to write down what had happened to her Supervisors when asked to do so. She actually exposed the situation to view. If you want to find out about it – go to their Data Files or go down and ask the Tech Sec. But that doesn't give you a Why. That's just data. WHY Due to other investigations and so forth, the Why was fairly obvious. The Admin Why was: \"Org Form non-existent in the org including the Department of Training.\" If you couldn't find anybody on post and nobody posted, it's pretty obvious that you don't have any org form. The Ethics Why was: \"Personnel policy violations in Dept of Training in musical chairs, transfers, training, hatting and Course PLs by the Executive Director, HAS, Tech Sec and D of T.\" The Ethics Why is taken care of in the handling targets by just drilling these persons so named on the form of the org. So this is actually a very standard evaluation. IDEAL SCENE The Ideal Scene was: \"A stable Department of Training with a proper org form, stably posted, and handling and servicing its customers.\" TARGETS Then there follow a series of targets which handle the situation returning it to the Ideal Scene given above."},{"pageNumber":523,"pageContent":"HANDLING AND EVALUATING ORGS 3 BMTS-15 – BPL 26.04.73R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 503 DATA SERIES This was a violently successful evaluation and program which produced affluence stats immediately and the totality of Data listed in it was as follows: \"Unbelievable musical chairing, rip-offs and changes of Supervisors.\" This was simply the major outpoint which was discovered upon investigation. The important point here is that Management Consultants can run into the danger of operating covertly by reports and call it evaluation. The above evaluation started out from a stat analysis and then went to the specific reports for that area and the Why fell right out. You cannot do it the other way around, if you want to stay out of trouble. STATS ALONE You can take stats all by themselves and you can send out a telex which will do some-thing fast. There isn't any reason to go on battering your head against a wall trying to do a whole evaluation before taking action. For example, one org's stats showed Income crashing while Reg Interviews were soar-ing. They were simply telexed quickly to handle their registration line forthwith, instantly and immediately! After this was done the situation could be evaluated to get the actual Why. In this case, there were a total of 4 or 5 major situations with that org shown up by their stats. They were sent a telex pointing up all the major situations and were ordered to report immediately by telex their handling of each one. None of this is evaluating. The ED at the other end would actually find this very easy to repair if he could evalu-ate. But just calling his attention to the scene is doing something. You have now sent a telex out, and in the meantime you can get it evaluated. But if you fiddle around with an evaluation without getting out a telex, all the time it's being evaluated they are sitting out there with their stats going out the bottom. Every day they do not have high stats is money you will never see again. Don't think it all piles up mysteriously some place, because it doesn't. We know that by experience. You don't recover yesterday's failures by a splurge today. This doesn't short-cut evaluation. It just tells you that you can operate an org out of a stat book to some limited degree because it in itself is a bunch of out-points. If you really wanted to get industrious, you could find five Whys for this org at this moment, telex all of them with a program one right after the other and their stats would go up. The wrong thing to do about it is nothing. Issue an order, \"Get the following done while we get a program for you ...\" If they don't do it, you know they will not do the program so you know you have an Ethics Why to find. It's also a new way of figuring out if they need a mission."},{"pageNumber":524,"pageContent":"HANDLING AND EVALUATING ORGS 4 BMTS-15 – BPL 26.04.73R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 504 DATA SERIES ETHICS SCENE Most of your break-down even after you've done a clever evaluation is the fact that you've got such an Out-Ethics Scene that they are not about to do the program ordered. You have suppression on your lines. The magnitude of the Suppression will often surprise you. When you can't get stats up and people producing for a very long time, the amount of suppression you'll uncover will be staggering. And an org isn't going to recover until you do something about it. EVALUATION STEP At this point you have only sent out a telex with a short program to handle a series of major outnesses. Not having done an evaluation, you'll find that some of the orders will be complied with, some partially done, some alter-ised, some done backwards and some totally ignored. Whatever the case, the next bunch of stats will show who was interested in correcting the situations brought to light and who was out to sabotage any attempt to correct. Some stats will improve, some will shoot way up and some will crash. With this data, you'll actually have a clearer picture of the scene than before. The Whys often show up easily at this point. From our previous example the Reg Interviews now go into screaming affluence, al-most vertical power rise, and the org's GI goes to zero! You can now read the data here. \"Oh, we have an SP in charge of registration. Get rid of her.\" That's easy handling. The second she was given an order to open the door, she closed it, locked it, got chains on it and so forth. Don't monkey around with it. It's very simple, very elementary. You can get too sig-nificant. To hell with the significance, let's get the stats. Do you see? It's beautiful when you can do an analysis like this. It's a sign of the old maestro. All of a sudden you have the answer. The data is: \"The ED never comes to work.\" The handling is: \"Appoint a new Glouchester ED.\" (When you do something like that you have to send a mission, by the way.) All of a sudden all the stats rise. Marvelous. It's a piece of art when it happens and it's gorgeous! WHY FINDING TIPS A. Your search in Data Analysis is the effort to find the data which would explain an outness found in stats. Sometimes you try proceeding from a no-outness. You end up looking for an outness to find a Why for. In this case, you are not doing an evaluation but something else. You can get trapped into evaluating by reports and you should watch out for this. The only thing you are interested in is stats and from there on it's outpoints and pluspoints."},{"pageNumber":525,"pageContent":"HANDLING AND EVALUATING ORGS 5 BMTS-15 – BPL 26.04.73R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 505 DATA SERIES B. Sometimes you go looking for something so deeply hidden that you are missing the elephants. These things are big! The outnesses are the size of mountains and the Whys the size of redwood trees. Only sometimes it's hard to find which side of the mountain you've got to walk around to find the redwood tree. But they're big! Sometimes you get too complex or write up too much or get too significant. It's a very easy action. C. There can be 5 Whys for an org and nobody said a mission order had to go out on only one Why. You theoretically could have 21 Whys for an org if there were 21 situations because there are 21 departments. Sending a mission out to handle a section only would be a little bit of a downgrade. You have to look over how many situations there are, how big are these situations and how many big situations there are. They are evident enough to knock your head off. They are great big, huge situations that are very visible and nobody has to write their life history to explain them. Once in a while you will get \"an accordion out and then back in\" type of scene. You have all these different situations and then you find a major overall why that handles a lot of them. Then you just put the different situations in the handling. D. It's better to have a very short eval and red tag the pertinent places in the Data Files for the Authorizing Verifier to check on the source of your data if need be. Ex-ample – Data: Org totally disorganized. Why: An ED who is not about to control the org. This just speeds up your own work. Don't go slipping over into a bunch of verbosity on the excuse that you're finding out-points because that's an outpoint in itself. It means you're not finding the great big, gi-gantic, huge, enormous outpoint. E. We can look at the big stat period and what pluspoint was present in that stat period which is not present in this stat period. We don't need a history of that period nor a history of this period, just what isn't present now that was present then. That required one sentence. \"Data: They used to have public co-audits. They don't now. Why: No public co-audit. Handling: Public co-audit.\" F. It takes a while to look in some cases. I was actually looking for months before I had the Why in one case, but I wasn't inactive in that period. I was making it go. I continued to watch it and then all of a sudden. Bang!, it fell out of the hamper one day. I know I could not have possibly found it earlier because stats didn't soar. It went along all right, but it didn't soar."},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"HANDLING AND EVALUATING ORGS 6 BMTS-15 – BPL 26.04.73R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 506 DATA SERIES GRADIENT SCALE OF WHYS Therefore any Why is a good Why, but do you find anywhere in the Data Series that there is only one Why? No. You will find this to be the case: There is a gradient Scale of Whys; It's a question of what Why can one get in with what resources. Yes, it would be great to have a $10,000 org in Chicago, but what resources have we got at the moment. Well, we can get up to a $100 org using what we've got. But at least do that. There could be a whole gradient scale of Whys. You could get a gradient from, \"Why: The doors of the org are closed all day. Handling: Open them. Have a receptionist there to meet the people who might accidentally wander in.\" This could go as far as, \"Why: They do not own the largest skyscraper in town, but are still in the third largest.\" This gradient Why depends on the resources, so you have to know what's there. If a wholesale handling of an org that has one and a half people in it treats it like it's full of FEBCs, you're going to fall on your head. Another important thing is that the less resources you've got, the more of a genius you have to be, hence the importance of Bright Idea. HANDLING ORGS To raise your overall Management Stat you have to take every org that isn't being handled and make sure something is being done about it on your network. Don't ever use \"You can't find it\" as an excuse not to do something. Don't let it go on for days because every day of letting it drift is GI not in, PCs not audited, students not trained, products not produced while you write a life history of Kokomo. It's not a question of being sloppy. It is a question of being causative. You can cause stats to rise. You can cause them clumsily or cleverly, but you can cause them! It is not true that any evaluation is better than no evaluation. It is true that pointing out a situation is better than not pointing out a situation. An evaluation with a wrong Why is about the most ghastly thing you ever saw in your life. The net result of all this is, if you are going to raise your own stats, you first and fore-most must look at the orgs which you have and make sure that none of them are omitted from your attention. Then you be sure you are doing something with everyone of them that is push-ing their stats up. It must be something that all by itself, evaluation or no evaluation, gets that org's stats up."},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"HANDLING AND EVALUATING ORGS 7 BMTS-15 – BPL 26.04.73R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 507 DATA SERIES If you have 7 orgs, let's say, and you've got to evaluate each one of them in turn, there is no reason to leave Org Number 7 for 6 weeks while you are evaluating Org Number 1.

By that time you'll have become familiar enough with them, do an evaluation and you find it with no trouble. BUSINESS MANAGEMENT ORGS This is very applicable with a small business management org that has not yet set up a Multiple Viewpoint Management System as one of their services. It may take this new org months to get personnel adequately trained, proper reports and stats coming in from clients and a comprehensive Data Files operating. Before they are equipped to do proper, full evaluations, there are a great number of services they can deliver that will boost a client's stats. These go from \"Problems of Work\" through basic Executive Training Courses to standard Admin procedures and systems that have proven themselves over the past twenty years of application in Scientology orgs. Don't ever hesitate to deliver service. Practically any standard policy action will boost a client's stats. Keep pushing in standard actions and eventually you will be able to deliver the sophisticated Multiple Viewpoint Management System and reap its incredible results. The thing to do is to be causative and cause stats to rise and you'll win the planet sooner than you realize.

First amongst these is of course poor evaluation. Second would be a considerable dis-agreement in the evaluated scene with the WHY, especially if it is interpreted as condemna-tory. Third would be a failure to obtain actual compliance with the targets in the evaluation. Fourth would be interference points or areas which, although affecting the scene being evalu-ated, are not looked at in relationship to it. In any scene being evaluated, there are two areas which are not likely to get much at-tention from the evaluator as they may not be remarked on in any of the reports or data being used in his evaluation. These two types of area are (1) local environment and (2) relay points and lines between policy and order source and the scene itself. These two areas may be looked at as (1) the plane upon which the scene exists and (2) the upper stages of authority under which the scene reacts. THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT The surrounding area to the scene being evaluated in the matter or a person would be the general third dynamic or other dynamic in which he or she lives his day-to-day life and which influences the person and therefore influences his hat or post. The search for the WHY which exactly causes Joe or Joanna to fail to hold post or wear a hat and which when handled will greatly better Joe or Joanna may well be their reactions to environments at their level and which may be or may not be there with them. Family or distant friends, not visible to an evaluator, or the work environment or on-the-job friends of Joe or Joanna may greatly influ-ence Joe or Joanna. This might prove too inviting for the evaluator to blame environment for the state of the existing scene and a caution'would have to be introduced: that any WHY must lead to a bettered scene and must not just explain it."},{"pageNumber":530,"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUATIONS 2 HCO PL 25.5.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 510 DATA SERIES EVAL BY RELAY PTS. Thus, in such a problem it should be understood that one has two existing scenes, one, the person and two, his environment; that they interrelate does not make them just one scene. Thus two evaluations about Joe or Joanna are possible, each with its program. To go about it otherwise is likely to prove as unsuccessful as the original evaluation of the person. Life and orders are reaching Joe or Joanna through relay points which are not ordinarily taken into consideration. Thus those areas should be separately evaluated. Usually, in the case of a per-son, something would have to be done to those areas, on the same plane as the person, by the person himself. So the program might include what the person himself could do about them. The local environment of a material object, such as a machine or an office or a vehi-cle, may also be evaluated as well as the machine or the office or vehicle itself. In short, there are relay points of difficulties that produce situations, on the same plane as the person or thing being evaluated. And these make additional evaluations possible and often profitable to the evaluator in terms of bettered ideal scenes. Yet at first glance, or using only the usual reports, it may seem that there is only one situation such as the person himself. Completely in the interests of justice, it is unfair to put down a target in some greater area situation like \"Remove Joe.\" It may well be that stats did go down when Joe was ap-pointed to a post. Well, that may be perfectly true. But by only then evaluating Joe and not the greater zone of Joe's personal scenes, one may very well come up with a very wrong and abrupt and unjust target. Who in other words, when found, may not solve the scene at all even when one only targets it as \"specially train\" or \"audit\" without removal. There may be another scene that is having an effect on Joe which, if not evaluated properly with a proper program of its own, will make nonsense out of any program about Joe himself related only to his post or position. Another scene may be relaying fatality to Joe which if unhandled will unsuit him to any other post of any other kind. Thus Joe and Joanna would have, each of them, two or more full evaluations possible. What the person is failing at or not doing on the job may have a plain enough Why that can be corrected by programming and moved to an ideal scene or at least toward it. What is hit-ting the person at an environmental or familial or social level might be an entirely different situation, requiring its own evaluation, with a proper Why and program for Joe or Joanna to carry out themselves or even with some help from others. In a broader case, we have, let us say, an organization or division that is in a situation. One, of course, can evaluate it as itself, finding a proper Why and a nice bright idea and a program'. And one can also do a second evaluation of the local environment. This might be the society or an adjacent division or even another organization. And this will require the lo-cation of a situation and finding its Why and working out a program to handle that can be done by the org or the division itself or with help from outside. The local environment outside the scene being evaluated is then a proper subject for another evaluation. It is a serious error to only evaluate the local environment as all too often the person or org or division will insist that that is the only situation and also that it is totally beyond any"},{"pageNumber":531,"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUATIONS 3 HCO PL 25.5.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 511 DATA SERIES remedy by their own actions. Thus, if the evaluator is going to evaluate the local environment of a subject that is in a situation, he does it after he has evaluated the subject on its own ground totally. EVALUATION OF ECHELONS On any command or communication channel there are always a certain number of points extending from source through relay points down to the final receipt or action point. These may be very numerous. Some may be beyond the authority of any evaluator. But each is capable of having its own situation that will cause an evaluation of the receipt or action point to fail. These can be called \"echelons\" or step-like formations. The receipt or action point that is to comply finally with the program may be the subject of hidden sources of effect in the relay points of any program or order. Thus, as in the case of a dangerous decline of some activity somewhere, an evaluator has several evaluations possible and probably necessary. It would be, by experience, a severe error to try to evaluate all these different scenes (such as many echelons each in a different area) in one evaluation and find a Why for the lot as one is attempting to find a single Why for several different scenes in different places which violates the strict purity of evaluation procedure. One may find the exact and correct Why for the point of action and do a splendid pro-gram only to find that somehow it didn't come off or didn't last. Yet it was the right Why for that scene. Hidden from view is the influence on that scene from one or more upper echelons which have, themselves, an individual situation and need their own Why and their own pro-gram. Only then can the influence on the action point be beneficial in its entirety. There is a system by which this is done. 8. One recognizes that there is a situation in an area which has not responded well to previous evaluation or has not maintained any benefit received very long. 9. One realizes that there are several, echelons above the point being evaluated. 10. One draws these points without omission. This makes a sort of graph or com-mand chart. It includes every command or comm relay point above the level of the point being evaluated. 11. The points, if any, below the point under consideration as in I above are then added to the chart below it. 12. One now undertakes a brief study of each of these points above and below to see if any have a situation of its own that could influence the success or failure of the original point evaluated as in I above. 13. One does a full separate evaluation of each of these echelon points where any situation seems to exist. Each of the evaluations done must have its own local situation, Why and program. Care is taken not to evaluate \"n o- situations.\""},{"pageNumber":532,"pageContent":"SUPPLEMENTARY EVALUATIONS 4 HCO PL 25.5.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 512 DATA SERIES Care is also taken to keep this Series of evaluations consistent with the main idea of remedying I above. 14. The evaluations are released as a series and executed as feasible. In doing such a series, brand new data may leap out as to the interrelationship of all these relay points and this may bring about a recommendation for a change of organization requiring new policy. But this would be another evaluation entirely as it is in effect an evalua-tion of basic organizational policy and may even require that tech be issued or withdrawn. Take a case where the area which has not bettered or sustained a betterment has in ac-tual fact two echelons below it and six above. The area, let us say, is a continental manage-ment office of an international hotel chain. Below it are its state offices and below that the hotels on that continent. Above it is the international comm relay center, the international headquarters executive at international headquarters for that continent, above that the interna-tional management organization, above that the chief executive of the international manage-ment organization, above that the advisors to the board and above that the board itself. By drawing these out as a series of echelons one sees that there is potentially a series of eight evaluations in addition to the main evaluation of that continental office which is where the situation originally was. By scanning over all these eight other influencing areas, one may find one or more of them which have situations of real influence on the original evaluation subject. One then evaluates separately and handles separately while still going on handling the original subject. One can then also do the local environment evaluation of the original subject if there seems to be a situation there. No evaluation is done where there is no situation. But one should assert in a covering note to the series that there are no known situations in the remaining points. Doing a series of evaluations and local environment evaluations can be extremely fruitful only so long as one realizes that they comprise separate situations which only by their influence are preventing an ideal scene from being achieved in the original area where bet-terment cannot be attained or maintained. Supplementary evaluations, when necessary and when done, can rescue a long series of apparently fruitless evaluations of a subject and move the evaluator himself toward a more ideal and happier scene of success.

Each sub-head in an eval form must be consistent with the whole. \"And the main action of an eval is counting outpoints. And the hardest outpoint to see is the \"omitted\" type, as it is not there, not to be seen at once. So it is missed. But all outpoints are important and must be counted. \"Handling amongst Aides means \"Handle the Hell out of it\", meaning nothing left to chance about it; in, boots and all. \"The Purity of an eval, is the main stress point.

To correct, one stresses Purity, all consistent, all by the book. \"Common faults are not really knowing and seeing outpoints and knowing them so well they are visible at a glance. Most people think errors are outpoints and when you ask them to point out an outpoint for you, they point out a missing comma or some error. I once asked a whole group what was the outpoint in a Russian luxury liner that was in view. Some said the sickle was rusty, some said it was backwards, some said it hadn't hoisted its flag at 8:00 A.M. but at 8:30. Not one in the group saw the conflicting data right there in view. A rich-bitch deluxe upper class luxury liner with fat cat passengers astroll on the decks versus the other datum of Russia, land of the workers and dead capitalists. The failure to see that quite astonished me. (The outpoint led, by the way, directly to another on investigation: it was an Italian built liner chartered to English tourists and flying the Russian flag, and the Why had to do with Russia being pretty damned starved for dough and trying to compete with the capitalists, but that only led to a situation which, had CIA analyzed it, would have put them one up.) \"The failure to see such an outpoint led to drilling people in naming outpoints, then finding them of specific types until they were rapid.

What follows is taken from LRH notes.) MULTIPLE SITUATIONS \"Somebody has evaluators on a 'whole org' kick where the evaluation must handle the whole org. Evidence of this is 'the Why' lately was defined as something that handled all out-points. The initial step of the stat analysis to find the area and then find its situation and its Why is not being done. Hence individual org situations do not get spotted or evaluated and evaluations take forever.\" (One of the org evaluations submitted to LRH was returned with the following note.) \"This evaluation has almost no outpoints in it. Almost every paragraph is a situation requiring evaluation. \"A situation is something that affects stats or survival of the org. \"An outpoint is something that contributes to a situation and should not be in the situa-tion area. \"A Why is the real basic reason for the situation which, being found, opens the door to handling. \"Evaluators who are trying to embrace the whole org of world in one evaluation are missing all the real situations or landing only in Division Seven.\" (The following is a despatch written by LRH in May 1976 regarding an earlier evalua-tion done on an org which LRH was evaluating at the time.) \"That evaluation, that was to pull in the CO, had one of these 'philosophical Whys,' 'The CO and HCO have prevented execs from being made by omitting actions that would ac-complish this (i.e. choosing suitable ones, hatting, training and apprenticing them) which has led to blows and 19th century solution of transfers and removals and eventually no execs at all.'

And the org is delivering. \"So this is what I am working on now. The new type of evaluation would use telex lines and FRs to ask a lot of questions after one had found the real situation. It would go: Find the situation area from stats, find the situation from data files, get some sort of a Why (that will now become the situation) and burn the telex lines or send a mission from the FOLO to find out how come that situation.

Almost all of them were sim-ply the basic outpoints in a different guise and needed no special category. However, two new outpoints did emerge that are in addition to the basic number. The new outpoints are ADDED TIME In this outpoint we have the reverse of dropped time. In added time we have, as the most common example, something taking longer than it possibly could. To this degree it is a version of conflicting data = something takes three weeks to do but it is reported as taking six months. But added time must be called to attention as an outpoint in its own right for there is a tendency to be reasonable about it and not see that it IS an outpoint in itself. In its most severe sense, added time becomes a very serious outpoint when, for exam-ple, two or more events occur at the same moment involving, let us say, the same person who could not have experienced both. Time had to be added to the physical universe for the data to be true. Like this: \"I left for Saigon at midnight on April 21st, 1962, by ship from San Francisco.\" \"I took over my duties at San Francisco on April 30th, 1962.\" Here we have to add time to the physical universe for both events to occur as a ship would take two or three weeks to get from San Francisco to \"Saigon.\" Another instance, a true occurrence and better example of added time happened when I once sent a checklist of actions it would take a month to complete to a junior executive and received compliance in full in the next return mail. The checklist was in her hands only one day! She would have had to add 29 days to the physical universe for the compliance report to be true. This is also dropped time on her part. ADDED INAPPLICABLE DATA Just plain added data does not necessarily constitute an outpoint. It may be someone being thorough. But when the data is in no way applicable to the scene or situation and is added it is a definite outpoint."},{"pageNumber":554,"pageContent":"OUTPOINTS, MORE 2 HCO PL 30.9.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 534 DATA SERIES Example: Long, long reams of data on an eval write-up, none of which is giving any clue to the outpoints on the scene. By actual survey it was found that the person doing it did not know any Why (not having used outpoints to find it) and was just stalling. Often added data is put there to cover up neglect of duty or mask a real situation. It certainly means the person is obscuring something. Usually added data also contains other types of outpoints like wrong target or added time. In using this outpoint be very sure you also understand the word inapplicable and see that it is only an outpoint if the. data itself does not apply to the subject at hand. There is more about another already named outpoint: WRONG SOURCE This is the opposite direction from wrong target. An example would be a president of the United States in 1973 using the opinions and congratulations of Soviet leaders to make his point with American voters. A more common version of this, not unknown in intelligence report grading for prob-ability, would be a farmer in Iowa reporting a Mexican battleship on Mud Creek. The farmer would be a wrong source for accurate naval reports. A private taking an order from a sergeant that countermands an order he had from a lieutenant would be an example of wrong source. What is sometimes called a \"Hey You\" \"organization\" is one that takes orders from anyone = a repeating outpoint of wrong source. There are many examples of this outpoint. It must be included as a very important out-point on its own. It produces a chaos of illogical ideas and actions when present. PLUSPOINTS Correct Time or the expected time period is a pluspoint.

If several outpoints come to view in any scene (or even one), if you look further you will find a situation. There is not any real art to finding situations if you can see outpoints. The sequence is simple. (1) You see some outpoints in a scene, (2) you investigate and \"pull a few strings\" (meaning follow down a chain of outpoints) and (3) you will find a situa-tion, and (4) then you can evaluate. Statistics are leaders in pointing the way. They should be X, they are not X. That is conflicting data. Behind that you will find a situation. If anyone has any trouble finding situations then one of three things is true (a) he can-not recognize outpoints when he sees them, (b) he does not have any concept of the ideal scene or want it, or (c) he does not know how to pull strings, which is to say ask for or look for data. On the positive side, to find situations one has to (A) be able to recognize outpoints, (B) has to have some idea of an ideal scene and want it, and (C) has to be able to \"pull strings.\" Evaluation is very much simpler when you realize that the art lies in finding situations. To then find a Why is of course only a matter of counting outpoints and recognizing what (that can be handled) is retarding the achievement of a more ideal scene. REASONABLENESS One often wonders why people are so \"reasonable\" about intolerable and illogical situations. The answer is very simple: they cannot recognize outpoints when they see them and so try to make everything seem logical."},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"SITUATION FINDING 2 HCO PL 30.9.73 II ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 538 DATA SERIES The ability to actually see an outpoint for what it is, in itself is an ability to attain some peace of mind. For one can realize it is what it is, an outpoint. It is not a matter for human emotion and reaction. It is a pointer toward a situation. The moment you can see this you will be able to handle life a lot better. The human reaction is to react! to an outpoint. And then get \"reasonable\" and adopt some explanation for it, usually untrue. You can safely say that \"being reasonable\" is a symptom of being unable to recognize outpoints for what they are and use them to discover actual situations. NATIVE THINK It may come as a surprise or no surprise at all that the ability to evaluate as given in this Data Series is not necessarily native to a being. In a native state a being detests illogic and rejects it. He seldom uses it for any other purposes than humor or showing up a rival in debate as a fool or using it in justice or a court of law to prove the other side wrong or guilty. A being is dedicated to being logical and he does, usually, a wonderful job of it. But when he encounters illogic he often feels angry or frustrated or helpless. He has not, so far as I know, ever used illogic as a systematic tool for thinking. Certain obsolete efforts to describe Man's thinking processes stressed \"associative thought\" and various other mechanisms to prove Man a fully logical \"animal.\" The moment they tried to deal with illogic they assigned it to aberration and sought drugs, tortures or exe-cutions that would \"cure it.\" None of them ever thought of using illogic as a tool of rational thinking! Thus they did not advance anyone's intelligence and conceived intelligence as un-changeable and fixed. The only Greek school of philosophy that dealt with illogic was the Sophist school. But even they had no real idea of the illogic. They were employed by politicians to make their political acts seem reasonable! Even humorists have no real idea of illogic. Reading their ideas of the theory of humor shows them to be off the mark. They don't really know what is \"funny.\" Laughter is rejection, actually. And humor you will find usually deals with one or another outpoint put in such a way that the reader or audience can reject it. The groan of most humorists is that too often their hearers go reasonable on them. Pat. \"Who was that hobo I saw you with last night?\" Mike: \"That wasn't no oboe, that was my fife.\" Listener (puzzled): \"But maybe it was a very slender hobo.\" The tendency of a being is to try to keep it reasonable, logical, rational. And that is of course a very praiseworthy impulse or all life's endeavors might unhinge."},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"SITUATION FINDING 3 HCO PL 30.9.73 II ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 539 DATA SERIES The fear of being illogical is a secret fear of being crazy or insane. (Not an idle fear when psychiatry was roaming around loose.) Or at the least being thought a fool or dullard or at the very very least, unworldly and uneducated. To evaluate and be a fine evaluator is to be able to prevent a slump toward a painful collapse. And to be able to steer the way from the non-ideal present to the ideal future. A person who feels queasy about his sanity really doesn't dare look at outpoints or confront and use illogic. Yet it is the way to full sanity itself. The ability to evaluate puts one at cause over both the mad and ideal. It places a being at a height it is unlikely he has ever before enjoyed in the realm of commanding the situations of life. Evaluation is a new way to think. It is very worthwhile to acquire such an ability as it is doubtful if it ever before has been achieved. L.

The evaluator, with all the study for an ideal scene, the exhaustive search for data and the collection and count of outpoints and pluspoints, with the discovery thereafter of the right Why and the brightest of ideas to handle may yet be totally defeated by the simple fact that no one ever chases up the target execution and gets the program really and honestly done. He can even have someone who is responsible for getting his program executed only to find they are themselves issuing additional or even contrary orders. Or even issuing whole new programs which have no relation to evaluation at all. Circumstances have been found where a person with the duty of getting targets done was so deficient in the ability to confront that he accepted any excuse at all and was even pushed over into other subjects. The remedy for this of course is HCOB 21 Nov 73, \"The Cure of Q & A, Man's Deadliest Disease.\" It can be so bad that persons entrusted with target execution did not even speak to or approach any person who had a target to do while not reporting at all or reporting marvelous progress with the program! So, sad to have to relate, it is not enough to be a fantastic and able evaluator. If the program is never truly done, the evaluation is merely a mental exercise. The ability to supervise and obtain cooperation and execution is mandatory for the skill of any evaluator. HCO P/L I Sept 73, \"Admin Know-How No. 30\" and HCO P/L 15 Oct 73, Admin Know-How Series 31, \"Administrative Skill,\" give the evaluator some of the additional data he needs to obtain execution of his programs. One can say right here that the thought, \"Oh well, I'm just a sort of technician here and it's really not up to me to run things. I just evaluate and it's up to 'them' to see that they carry it out,\" is very likely to occur. But if one's repute as an evaluator is to be established, it will come about because The Existing Scene moved up markedly toward or became the Ideal Scene."},{"pageNumber":564,"pageContent":"FINAL TARGET 2 HCO PL 25.11.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 544 DATA SERIES If that does not occur, then seniors or workers don't blame the supervisors or commu-nicators. They blame the evaluator. \"Oh him! He evaluated the building situation and look, the whole situation went to hell.\" No justice at all. The data and Why and all the rest were quite right. The on-paper evaluation was perfect. It would have \"handled the hell\" out of it. But lamentably the program just was never done. Altered or falsely reported or untouched, the targets just weren't done. So the test of an evaluation is: Did it move the Existing Scene toward or attain the Ideal Scene? And that cannot occur without the program being fully and totally and correctly done. See also HCO P/L 26 Jan 72, \"Not-dones, Half-dones and Backlogs\" for more data on this.

Where such a target is written or misused to supplant policy a great deal of trouble can follow. Example: Org policy in authorized issues states that accounts for the week must be fi-nalized at 2:00 P.M. Thursday. Someone writes an evaluation and puts a target in it to end the week on Sunday. People doing the target actions change to Sunday. This is out of phase with all other actions and chaos results. People tend to take orders from anyone and anything in a poorly organized area. When they use evaluation or project targets instead of policy the whole structure may begin to cave in. No eval TGT is senior to official issues and where these conflict the target has the junior position. The only way a target can change policy is to propose that such and such a policy be officially reviewed on proper channels or that a new policy be written and passed upon prop-erly by those in actual authority. Someone attempting to do a target who finds that it conflicts with policy or official technical releases and yet goes on and does the target is of course actionable. TARGETS OUT OF CONTEXT Context: \"The interrelated conditions in which something exists or occurs.\" Out of Context: Something written or done without relation to the principal meaning of a work. Targets must be written within the meaning of the whole evaluation. Example: The evaluation is about pie. There is a target that says to polish shoes just because the evaluator happened to think of it and squeezed it into the program. A program written to increase pies winds up with the ideal scene of polished shoes. No pies get increased so the evaluation fails."},{"pageNumber":572,"pageContent":"TARGET TROUBLES 2 HCO PL 14.12.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 552 DATA SERIES Targets must be done within the context of the evaluation. Example: An evaluation is done to increase central office collections. It calls for an-other evaluation to be done on a statistic. The person doing that target reduces the number of items collected upon and crashes central office collections. The person did not read or understand the whole evaluation before he did the tar-get and so did it in a way that accidentally defeats the ideal scene. Example: An evaluation is done to fill up a big hotel of 450 guest capacity. One of its targets calls for project orders sending a team to the hotel. The person who writes the project orders does not look at the evaluation or the hotel plans and specifies 30 guests must be got-ten! The evaluation is defeated. FALSELY EVALUATING A person who evaluates a situation without chasing up all the data or even looking at the data in his files can bring about a false evaluation. Example: A person has come back into an organization at a high level. The place crashes. The evaluator does not examine personnel changes at the time of the crash and comes up with \"too many football games\" as his Why and the evaluation fails. FALSE DONES False reports that a target has been done when it has not been touched or has been half done at best is actionable in that he is defeating not only the evaluation but the organization. Example: The evaluator has an ideal scene of repaired machines that will increase production. The mechanic reports all machines repaired now when he has not even touched them. The evaluator sees production remains low, looks around for a new Why. But his Why is falsely reported dones on his accurate eval! PERSONAL CONTACT Targets seldom get done without personal contact. Evaluations should carry the name or post of the person who is overall responsible for the completion of the program. Sitting at a desk while one is trying to get people to do targets has yet to accomplish very much. One can have messengers or communicators or Flag Representatives getting the targets done but these in turn must depend upon personal contact. A person assigned responsibility for getting a whole program done is not likely to ac-complish much without personal contact being made. This can be done on a via. Mr. A in location A remote from Mr. C in location C can get a target done reliably only if he has a Mr. B in that area whose sole duty it is to personally"},{"pageNumber":573,"pageContent":"TARGET TROUBLES 3 HCO PL 14.12.73 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 553 DATA SERIES contact Mr. C and have Mr. C get on with it despite all reasons why not. That is how targets get done. That is also how they can be reviewed. Target troubles are many unless the program is under direct contact supervision. Even then targets get \"bugged\" (stalled). But the evaluator can find out why if personal contact is made and the target can be pushed through. SUCCESS Therefore the success of an evaluation in attaining an ideal scene depends in no small measure on 6. Both evaluator and target executor realizing policy and technical materials are senior to targets in programs and that targets do not set senior policy aside. One of the best ways to prevent this is to know and refer to policy and techni-cal issues in targets. 7. Targets must be written in context with the evaluation and done in context with the ideal scene. The best way to achieve this in writing an eval's targets is to make them consistent with the Why and ideal scene. The best way to be sure that targets will be DONE in context is to require that anyone doing a target must first read the whole evaluation (and be word cleared on it) before he does his target so that he does his target in a way to improve the existing scene in the eval not some other scene. 8. To prevent false evaluation one may require that the evaluator attests that all pertinent data and statistics have been examined and to discipline such failures whenever an evaluation fails. 9. To prevent false dones one must review the evidence of dones and statistics af-ter the program is complete and discipline all falsely reporting persons and re-assign the targets or in any way possible get them actually done. 10. The way to get a whole program done, target by target, is through personal contact. Supervise it by personal contact with those assigned the targets. Or use a communicator or messenger. Where the people doing the targets are remote from the evaluator one must have someone there to do the personal contact. And be sure THAT person isn't just sitting at a desk but is actually doing per-sonal contact on targets. Thus all evaluations, on the issue itself or by organiza-tional pattern, should have someone who can personally contact people getting the targets done fully and completely. If these points about evaluations and their programs are understood, one can and only then can move things toward the ideal scene. L.

None of these evaluations would have reached any ideal scene or even improved the existing scene. The real reason for this is that the majority of them had a highly generalized situation such as \"Bidawee Biscuit Company failing\" or \"Stats down from last year.\" They then pro-ceeded on a data trail and got a \"Why.\" In these cases the Why they found was actually the situation! Each of them had failed to use the data trail to find the situation. They were using the data trail to find a Why! The evals then had no Why. The handling was just a bunch of orders that were in fact unevaluated orders since no real Why had been found, Like in playing a game these evaluators had started 50 feet back of the starting line and when they got to the starting line (the situation) they assumed it was the finish. If you look at an \"evaluation\" that has a generalized \"situation\" like \"continental prod-ucts getting fewer\" you will find in a lot of cases (not always accurately) that what was put down as the \"Why\" was in fact the situation. This left the \"eval\" without a Why. Thus the ideal scene would be wrong and the handling ineffective. Example: (not in form) \"Situation: Gus Restaurant failing.\" \"Data: Customers refusing food, etc., etc.\" \"Why: The food isn't good.\" \"Ideal scene: A successful Gus Restaurant.\" \"Handling: Force Gus to serve better food, etc., etc.\" That isn't an eval. That is an observation that if Gus Restaurant is to survive it better get evaluated. It is being evaled because it isn't surviving. Now look at this: The data trail led to \"the food isn't good.\" That's a situation. Why isn't it good enough? Well it turns out the cook got 15% commission from the store for buying bad food at high prices. And Gus didn't know this. So bang, we handle. Gus Restaurant achieves ideal scene of \"Gus Restaurant serving magnificent chow.\" In this example if you used the situation for a Why the Who would probably be Gus!"},{"pageNumber":588,"pageContent":"SITUATION CORRECTION 2 HCO PL 18.7.74 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 568 DATA SERIES The data trail of outpoints from a highly general \"situation\" (that is only an observa-tion like failing stats) will lead one to the situation and then a closer look (also by outpoints) will lead one to the real Why and permit fast handling. DATA TRAIL People can get too fixated on the history of something. They can call this a \"data trail.\" Well, all right, if it's a trail of outpoints. But significances of history have little to do with evaluation. Let us say you see the machine division is failing. Now if you simply take masses of data about it and just start turning over 10 or 12 sheets at a time looking for outpoints only and keep a tally of what they are and to whom they belong, you will wind up with your situation area and probably your situation without reading any significances at all. Now that you have your area and situation in it You can start really reading all about it and get that existing scene's data and its outpoints. And your Why leaps at you. SUBSTITUTION You can't substitute stats for a situation or a situation for a Why. But substitution of one part of an eval for another is a common fault. Substituting a general hope for the ideal scene you really would and could achieve makes a sort of failed feeling in an eval. \"Gus Restaurant being best in town\" is nice but \"Lots of customers very well fed so Gus Restaurant survives\" is what you are trying to achieve. That can occur and will be reached if you find the real Why. L.

Only when no major correction is necessary does one then verify all data or go to an extensive review of the whole eval. This makes the line very fast. It also saves a great deal of work by one and all. If the stats are incorrectly given, that's it. Reject. If the Why is really the situation, that's it. On the reject one gives the letter of Data Series 33 that is not correct and any reference to the Data Series that would seem helpful. An evaluation corrector will see how well this rejection system works when you find that the eval, let us say, has no situation on it, but only some stats. Why verify anything as a whole new body of data may have to be found. In correcting evals, if a situation is given, I usually call for the main stats of the unit being evaluated to see if these show any reason to handle it at all. I recently found an activity had had its chief removed when his stats were in Power. The activity then crashed. And that was the situation. It was made by an evaluator and an eval corrector not looking at the stats! If no error exists in situation or stats I read the eval down to bright idea and look espe-cially at the Why, ideal scene and handling to see if one would make the others. If that's okay, I look at the targets of handling and the resources. If those are okay, I look at data and outpoints. If these are all okay, I then verify the data. But if at any of these steps I find an error, I then reject at once for immediate correction. Often, by using only basic things to reject, the whole eval has to be redone as the basics are so far wrong. If you try to correct the whole thing before rejecting or if you correct tiny little things instead of the big ones, the whole line slows. Eval correction should be a fast, helpful line, strictly on-policy, no opinion. That way the job of correction becomes easier and easier. L.

A situation is the most major departure from the Ideal Scene. Thus: One must be able to envision an Ideal Scene to find a situation. A lot of \"ideal scenes\" you see are just glib. An afterthought. Some people know the proper scene so well they at once recognize that a departure from it has occurred, which is fine. But such people do not realize, when they are teaching evaluation or correcting evals, that others may not know the proper scene well enough to get an idea of what the ideal scene should be. Thus, a wrong target occurs. The teacher or correc-tor keeps putting attention on the incorrectness of the situation given in the eval instead of noticing that the ideal scene is adrift. An ideal scene is future. When one is stuck on the time track it may seem pretty difficult to envision a future. In politics this is called \"reactionary\" or \"conservative.\" These mean any resistance to change even when it is an improvement. The bad old days seem to be the good old days to such people. Yet the old days will not come again. One has to make the new days good. \"Liberals,\" \"socialists\" and such make great propaganda out of this. They inveigh against (criticize) conservatives and say the future must be reckoned with. And they hold up some often incredible future scene and say the way to it is by \"revolution\" or destroying eve-rything that was. Both viewpoints could be severely criticized. The conservative tries to stick on the time track with no reality on the fact that today will be yesterday in 24 hours. The su-per-liberal skips tommorrow entirely and goes up the track 5 or 10 years to a perfect state which can never exist or is falsely represented as possible. In between these two viewpoints we have the attainable."},{"pageNumber":610,"pageContent":"ENVISIONING THE IDEAL SCENE 2 HCO PL 11.8.74 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 590 DATA SERIES And we come to an ideal scene that is possible and will occur if the Why is right and handling is correct and done. Envisioning an attainable future requires some connection with reality. There is no harm at all in dreaming wonderful dreams for the future. It's almost the bread of life. But how about giving oneself a crashing failure by disconnecting from any reality? Some laborers do this to themselves. Taking no steps to attain it, they daydream them-selves as kings or some other grand identity. Well, all right. But that isn't an \"ideal scene.\" That's a delusion engaged upon for self-gratification in a dream world. One can not only dream a possible ideal scene but he can attain it. So an ideal scene is something that can be attained. It should be quite real. Some people setting unreal quotas are really setting some impossible ideal scene. \"Complete this work in I hour!\" to someone working hard on a job that will take 4 days is delusory. It is setting, without saying so, the ideal scene of having a worker who is really a magician! Well, maybe if he were audited and hatted he would be. But that's sure some ideal scene! The here and now is a guy sweating it out and trying. And that's an ideal scene that is missed! And so are many ideal scenes missed. The offices neat and orderly might not even be imagined by someone who has seen them in a mess for two years. He may think that's the way they're supposed to be! And be quite incapable of envisioning the offices in any other condi-tion! Thus, if one cannot see the offices should be clean, he does not see that they are dirty and messy as a situation. Thus when he is told the public won't come into the place, and even if he finds the place is full of old dirty junk, he can't evaluate it as a clean orderly place would not be envisioned by him. So he doesn't get \"dirty place\" as a valuable datum, doesn't get \"a clean orderly place that is inviting to the public\" as an ideal scene, doesn't get \"office so dirty the public won't go near it\" as a situation and so cannot find a Why to lack of public! And so as he didn't find Why it was so dirty and disorderly, it wouldn't handle. So there would be a failed eval. Yet the teacher or evaluation corrector would not realize the person could not envision an ideal scene and so keep telling the person to find the situation whereas the ideal scene was what was out. You can get some very beautiful ideal scenes and attain them-if you can evaluate! L.

If you write down a Why, ask this question of it: \"Does this open the door to han-dling?\" If it does not, then it is a wrong Why. Backtracking to find how it is wrong, one examines the ideal scene and the situation one already has. The outpoints should be checked. The completeness of data should be checked. One may find he is in a wrong area of the scene. Correct that, correct the ideal scene, correct the situation and look for more data. With the outpoints of more data one can achieve the real Why that will open the door to handling. Quite often an \"evaluator\" \"knows\" the Why before he begins. This is fatal. Why evaluate? Some of the most workable Whys I've ever found surprised me! So usually I also ask, did I know this? Am I surprised? The chances are, if I \"knew\" it already (and the situation still exists) it is a wrong Why. And needs proper evaluation. When you have a right Why, handling becomes simple. The more one has to beat his brains for a bright idea to handle, the more likely it is that he has a wrong Why. So if you're not a bit surprised and if the handling doesn't leap out at you the Why has not opened the door and is probably wrong. I have seen evaluators take weeks to do an evaluation. In such cases they went on and on reading as they did not know how to find a real Why. Actually they did not know what one was. By going through the total current files of an activity looking for outpoints just by randomly glancing at data sheets from all sources, you can find the area. Outpoints lead you straight to it. An ideal scene for that smaller area is fairly easy to envision."},{"pageNumber":614,"pageContent":"WHYS OPEN THE DOOR 2 HCO PL 12.8.74 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 594 DATA SERIES The type of outpoint will generally give you how the departure is. One can then get the situation. By looking over (in detail now) the data of that smaller area and counting the out-points, one can find the Why. The Why will be how come the situation is such a departure from the ideal scene and will open the door to handling. If it doesn't, then review the whole thing, do the steps again. Don't just sit and sag! Let's say we find outpoints of added inapplicable data in all reports. And they lead to Reception. The ideal scene of Reception is easy: attractive pleasant atmosphere, welcoming in the public. We find more detailed reports that the place is full of junk and filthy and we get our situation, \"public repelled by filthy messy Reception.\" Now why? So back to the real data and we find the janitor never cleans it. Or anything else. The easy out is just sack the janitor (and leave the post empty). But that won't handle so we have no Why. So we dig and dig and suddenly we find that the staff refer to the janitor in lowly and disrespectful terms: \"Janitor has no status.\" Well, the outpoints all say so. And it opens the door to a handling. So we handle by transferring the janitor org board position from treasury where it went as he \"looks after assets\" to the Office of the President with the president's secretary as his direct senior. We write up a program for clean offices. Magic! The offices get clean! The public again comes in. The ideal scene is attained. (You may think this example is pretty unreal. But actually it once happened and worked!) So a right Why opens the door to handling. If it doesn't, look harder. There is always a reason for things.

Very rarely you also find one that winds up in a Where. Sometimes you find an \"evaluator\" who only finds Whos or Wheres. If this puzzles you when you see such \"evals\" or if you land in that situation yourself while evaluating, remember this: An \"eval\" that only has a who or a where as its why is incomplete. What has happened is this: The \"evaluator\" does an outpoint count only for Who or Where. He does not then really investigate or dig up the real data on that Who or Where but lets it go at that. He says-Why: Dept I not functioning. Who: Director of Personnel. Ideal Scene: A functioning Dept 1. Handling: Shoot the Dir Personnel. Such evals do not raise statistics. They do not work. Because they are not complete! In any eval you have to do an outpoint count to find where or who to investigate. This prior outpoint count does not appear, always, on the eval form. It's just where to look. Having gotten the Who or Where you now do a full read out, lift the rocks, pry into the cracks and find the Why. It can even get worse. Having seen something wrong, one puts down a situation. He does a preliminary outpoint count for a Where or Who and then discovers a more basic or even worse situation. In other words his situation can change! Example: No personnel being hired leads one to Dept 1, Personnel. So one writes the situation: \"No one being hired.\" Then one can easily dash off, \"Why: Dept I inactive. Ideal scene: An active Dept I hiring personnel.\" And write up a handling: \"Hire people.\" Great, easy as pie. But somehow six months later there are still no personnel! The rea-son is simple: The \"evaluator\" never went beyond the Who-Where. He put down a Who-Where as his Why. Real evaluation would go this way: First observed situation, \"no personnel being hired.\" The Who-Where comes up as Dept 1. Now and only now do we have something to evaluate. So our situation has changed. It becomes, \"Dept I inactive.\" And we investigate and lo and behold there is no one in that whole division! Again we could go off too early. It is tempting to say, \"Why: No one in it!\" And say, \"Handling: Put somebody in it!\" But actually \"no one in it\" is just data! Certainly the execs who should be screaming for personnel know there is no one in Dept 1. After all, they get cobwebs on their faces every"},{"pageNumber":622,"pageContent":"WHO-WHERE FINDING 2 HCO PL 28.10.74 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 602 DATA SERIES time they pass the door! So it is just an outpoint, not a Why as it does not securely lead to solution. So we look further. We find seven previous orders to put on a Director of Personnel! The writers of these orders are not the Whos but who they were given to are elected. That's seven noncompliances by the executive in charge of organizing! And this turns out to be Joe Schmoe. Now we have a Who. So what's with this Joe Schmoe? So we go to anything con-nected with Schmoe and we locate Board of Directors minutes of meetings and herein he has been stating for 2 years repeatedly that \"The organization only makes so much money anyway so if we hire anybody to deliver service we might go broke.\" As the organization has been going broke for those two years and the last Dir Personnel was fired two years ago we now also have our date coincidence. But this is still just an outpoint-contrary facts, as one has to deliver to stay solvent. So we look up Joe Schmoe even further and we find he is also the chief stockholder in a rival company! So here is our Why: \"Organization being suppressed by the chief stockholder in the company's rival.\" \"Who: Joe Schmoe. Ideal scene: Organization hiring personnel needed to deliver.\" Now for the handling. Well, Joe Schmoe could mess things up further if we just fired him. So we better know what we're doing. We have found our organization controls the tin Joe Schmoe's company needs for its cans. So we shut off the tin supply and when Schmoe's stock falls we buy it up, merge the companies and fire Joe. Or so a businessman would do. That handles it! Shallow evals that stop with a Who-Where on the first inspection don't succeed. Out-points are usually aberrated and the people there around them usually handle things unless they have depth of mystery. You have to have a Who-Where to begin your investigation. Once you find your Who or your area, now the outpoints begin to count. Very few situations in actual fact are caused by active Whos. Usually it is inactive Whos, confronted with situations they have not grasped and don't see any way through. A classic case was a situation that did not resolve for over a year until very close in-vestigation discovered a statistic was wrongly worked out and which targeted an area in the wrong direction. One could have shot \"Whos\" by the dozen without ever solving it! So when you see a Who-Where as a Why, you know one thing: The eval is incom-plete. You can cure someone doing this chronically by making him first list the outpoints that show Who-Where to look. And then make him go on with the evaluation outpoints that lead to a Why, giving two counts of outpoints. The light will dawn. L.

RON HUBBARD Founder LRH:nt.nf"},{"pageNumber":627,"pageContent":" ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 607 DATA SERIES HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO POLICY LETTER OF 15 MARCH 1977R Revised 17 September 1977 Remimeo Data Series 41R EVALUATION: THE SITUATION (Later developments on situations are contained in Data Series 28R, 28R-1, 34 and 39. However the data following, compiled from an LRH taped conference in 1972, is of sufficient importance to include as part of the Data Series.) There are bad situations, good situations and no situations. A situation is something that applies to survival and if you evaluate the word \"situation\" against survival, you've got it. A good situation is a high level of survival; a bad situation is a threatened survival and a no situation is something that won't affect survival. We've gone ahead of the whole show of intelligence with the Data Series. Note: We are using intelligence as an example solely and only because it is the most inclusive system Man has developed for collection and evaluation of data. We have greatly refined this system. Espionage and other intelligence activities and skills have no part in our application. We are using intelligence as an example of data usage systems, that is all. You are out in an area of greater simplification and far more use. This doesn't neces-sarily make anyone an intelligence officer, but a general or a head of something or a general manager or an executive who does not know how to evaluate a situation will make nothing but mistakes. The mistakes of history are made by people who can not evaluate, by which we mean determine the situation-which even more simplified would be find out the situation. From this given body of data, from that indicator we can find a good situation, or a bad situa-tion or a no situation. And this is what one is trying to determine. The more skilled one be-comes in doing it, the less work it is. It is a matter of skill. To give you an idea: If you tried to play every note of a concerto separately by having to look up each note in the chord and then strike it on the piano, you wouldn't have much of a tune, right? But the longer you did that, the more likely you were to begin to approximate some sort of something that sounds like music. But it would take a lot of practice. Now you can get so all-fired-good at evaluation that you can take an isolated indicator and know immediately where it fits into because you know it fits into the plan of things and because you know it is or isn't part of an ideal scene. It's better than the existing scene or it is too far from an ideal scene. You can pick up an indicator in this way-and it sometimes proba-bly looks magical to you how I will suddenly pick up an isolated instance and look down the line and we find a roaring hot situation at the other end of it."},{"pageNumber":628,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 2 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 608 DATA SERIES Now that is done out of an economy of data. It is done because one has not the time to investigate or read all of the data which might exist on this particular subject being investi-gated. So one learns to do something that looks absolutely intuitive and when you're terrifi-cally hot at this it is called \"flair.\" Prediction from data is an essential part of evaluation. \"This datum is an outpoint-it shouldn't be, peculiar.\" Now it will predict more data. You have to be so hot that you will notice something is an outpoint-it's a wild outpoint of some kind or another-accept its magnitude, size of datum, how important is this datum. The evaluation of importance is one of the more difficult things people have to do. They have a tendency to consider things a monotone importance. You have to train yourself out of that. What do we get here then as a qualification for an evaluator? You have to know all the outpoints in sight. You have to know what outpoints are. But that's rather thinking backwards because you should know that something shouldn't be. And as soon as you get a \"shouldn't be\" you can do a prediction. And that leads you into an investigation-by viewing other data. In other words you find this terrific outpoint or these outpoints and you find out where they exist, it leads you into, very directly, the point that you should be investigating. DEFINITION OF EVALUATION This is as close as the dictionary comes to the definition of evaluation: \"to examine and judge concerning the worth, quality, significance, amount, degree or condition of.\" (The Third Webster's International Dictionary.) Now to edit that down, it's \"to examine and judge the significance and condition of.\" An evaluation: \"the act or result of evaluating, judgement, appraisal, rating, interpreta-tion.\" And an evaluator is \"one that evaluates. An intelligence officer is supposed to be a pro-fessional evaluator.\" (The Third Webster's International Dictionary.) This word is a technical word which isn't given in these dictionaries. It is an action which is basically an intelligence action. The actual meaning which is supposed to be embraced in the word is \"to examine the evidence in order to determine the situation\" and that is the intelligence meaning and then it could have, further: \"so as to formulate policy or planning related thereto. In other words 'What is the enemy going to do?' So the general can say 'Therefore we should. . . .' \" WHAT IS EVALUATION Here is an example of what evaluation is, the type of thing expected of an evaluator. I was looking at an org's graphs, all of a sudden I see a drift down of reserves and a level of bills. The bills are level, level, level-drift down of reserves, until all of a sudden it's about to cross and this was an org where we just changed the CO, so I say \"Hey whoa! Wait a minute, wait a minute! This organization is spending more than its income obviously by the looks of this graph. So let's look into this just a bit further.\" I looked further and got more data"},{"pageNumber":629,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 3 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 609 DATA SERIES and I found out that the org was running insolvent. The Data Bureau already had a report on this; I picked it up on another line. I just picked it up off graphs. Further investigation found out that the new CO had taken over from the old CO and had inherited an extremely backlogged org-included backlogged bills. And the new CO had been sent in there on a set of Garrison Mission Orders-and they just contained standard CO-ing actions when they should have been MOs designed to handle the insolvency scene-forcing the org to promote and make income; then making an announcement that no POs will be signed except promotion, wages and utilities; then get in the date-line paying and forcing Ac-counts to dig it up out of all their mouseholes and all those bills that have been in there for a year or two and the stuff they didn't file and get a date-line paying system in. Then you start surveying like mad to find out what the organization can sell and then you start delivering, beef up your delivery lines and so on. It wasn't any surprise to me to learn that that graph was a false report, of course. But this is no explanation. It doesn't mean the situation doesn't exist but the graph is a false report. That is an outpoint all in itself. It's actually backed up by other data but you could have taken it this way: You could have seen the graph declining-that is reserves going down, bills staying the same and you find out it's a false report. At that moment, by Data Series, you charge in and investigate the heck out of it. Here's an indicator, then another indicator that's a false re-port. Where did I count outpoints? I was counting them all the time. One is enough-a de-clining reserves graph and a holding debts graph-well that was enough. So the counting was \"one,\" and as I looked a little further I got \"two\" and then as I looked a little further I got a \"three\" and a \"four\" and a \"five\" and a \"six.\" We did a handling and more outpoints showed up. Right as you are handling the thing more and more outpoints show up so there is a point where you neglect any more outpoints, you can go on as a lifetime profession finding out-points in one of these areas. It's enough. ' We have actually done something with the Data Series which has never before been done. Other data evaluation systems have to do with the reliability of the observer, which de-termines if the reported fact is a \"proper datum.\" But all of their work is done on computers and those computers are built against logic systems developed by the Greeks. But it is data, data validity of, which monitors logic. A black propaganda operation is almost totally concerned with feeding wrong data into the population and therefore the population cannot come to correct conclusions and their actions will be peculiar. There are experts in black propaganda and they're fully trained in it and they do it all the time. Back of wrong data you will normally find an impure intent. So that somebody is giv-ing you false reports is an evaluation in itself. An evaluation first requires data. The absence of data you should have would give you an evaluation. We knew something was wrong with an area because all of a sudden somebody found out they weren't sending in their reports. The absence of data is an adequate evaluation that there is something wrong. And in one such case it actually took weeks to find out what was wrong."},{"pageNumber":630,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 4 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 610 DATA SERIES If you find the outpoint, you're into evaluating a situation. You're just looking at data-you find an outpoint, you investigate that. You find more outpoints, you go along and say, \"It's the thing that we're looking at now, what the heck. . . \" because you're obviously traveling away from the ideal scene or you've found something that went much closer to the ideal scene or something that didn't change it. You then look it over and say, \"It's this point,\" and at that moment you can figure out why this is occurring. \"Now why is this occurring?\" And that requires quite a bit of data. \"Why is this occurring?\" Therefore when you can say \"Why,\" now you can handle. What you want is the outpoint and an outpoint is a departure from the ideal scene. That tells you that there is an area to investigate and you can investigate it simply by going and finding more data and more outpoints and then as your data accumulates you can get why it's a departure. The accuracy of your Why then gives you the point which you will have to handle which is all very neat and there comes in your recommendation. This is the trick on evaluation: You have to learn what is an outpoint, what is this out-rageous thing and then that cones you down. Now you could find all kinds of little points. REVIEW Having handled the thing or having done something about it, don't be too surprised to now and then find a lot more data suddenly emerge. In fact it is almost usual now that you've started to handle something for more data to emerge. But you have to look it over. You have to say, \"Well, have I handled it? Does this data confirm our Why or doesn't it confirm our Why?\" And that's all you do with that data-it's confirmatory. Sometimes you get data after the fact, after you've taken action. That is a review of your evaluation. When the data comes in after the fact, there's another step involved here. You review the situation and all of a sudden you find out you were looking at a heck of a wrong Why. One of the first things that will tell you you operated on a wrong Why is that the stats went down-because it departed further from the ideal scene. You get injustices and that sort of thing coming out of wrong evaluations, so this is one of the reasons why you watch an evaluation in your line of country-you watch an evalua-tion after the fact. Was it true? So there's a confirmatory step which isn't mentioned in the Data Series-\"Was that the right Why?\" The Data Series does mention it's whether or not the stat goes up. But it's worse than that: \"Did you have the right Why?\" or \"Did you shoot down the wrong man?\" FAMILIARITY We have a considerable amount of technology which is administrative technology, which gives us an ideal scene, and with which we must be familiar in order to evaluate and handle. We would have to be as practiced in this as in the building of armament factories or running navies or building toy balloons or trying to get housing furnished to the great un-"},{"pageNumber":631,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 5 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 611 DATA SERIES housed if that's what we were doing-you have to have some familiarity with the type of scene which you're handling. If you're good at this you don't go on wasting your time and energy. You find the right Why, you set it up, you make sure that it does get set up-but there's nothing more you have to do with it and then that's that. Sometimes that takes quite a while but note that if you're im-mediately pressing down this Why all the rest of the way and you go on past the point where you corrected it-the thing is corrected-now you're handling a no-situation. If you didn't have evaluation you would find yourself handling no-situations and ne-glecting tough situations and not taking advantage of good situations. CLOUDING UP A SITUATION Occasionally you'll find a scene wherein a person's or area's PR is greater to him than his production-PR, personal PR, means more than production. And that is a characteristic of a suppressive. He'll fog the situation up with big PR about how good it is so it can't be handled. THE WHY You have to know when you don't have a Why. It is very, very important to know you don't have a Why. The end product of your evaluation could be said to be \"What do we do about this?\" In other words, your recommendation could be said to be the end product. Actually that's a short circuit. As far as your investigation and your data analysis is concerned your first target, the Why, if skipped will defeat the end product of your evaluation. If that Why is found then you can handle. A Why is just this: It is the reason there has been a departure or closer approach to or an exceeding of the ideal scene. What will defeat you continuously is trying to find Whys in no-situations. You won't find a Why. If you can't find a Why readily then you can possibly suspect that you have a no-situation. A Why, by essence, is something you can do something about. You have to have a recommended action on top of the Why. The Why is something which departed from, the reason it departed from or the reason why it bettered the ideal scene or got closer to it. It is a Why you can use and which will bring you a better scene. Therefore the definition of a Why is: It must be something which will permit you to bring about a better scene-not necessarily bring about the ideal scene. You might actually have a better scene than the ideal scene. We've described the ideal scene as so and so and all of a sudden a Why suddenly emerges which actually makes the ideal scene look pale. Taking the ideal scene of a moderately affluent org-we might all of a sudden move into a situation where the ideal scene was quite something else and we found"},{"pageNumber":632,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 6 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 612 DATA SERIES out \"How come all of a sudden Keokuk has made 8 million dollars in the last 13 days?\" How come? We don't have an ideal scene anymore. IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A WHY We have a system of data handling which is superior to that of other data collection and evaluation organizations of today. 1 can say that because 1 know their systems. Systems? And they don't hold good. Imagine somebody saying \"Well, we shouldn't pay any attention to Agent 622's reports from Kobongo because they're false.\" Oh? That'd mean one had a turned agent or an agent that wasn't working. In other words, it isn't meaningless, it's not something you discard into the wastebasket. Now a good data collection and evaluation officer doesn't always discard this. He says, \"Well, it's false data so therefore it's probably been taken over by the enemy\" and he does make some sort of hit at it. But there are other outpoints that they would never have noticed. \"A datum is OK. . . \" this is the general think-not just of the generals but this is general intelligence think. \"Of the data we receive, a great deal of it is not useful because it doesn't come from reliable observ-ers.\" Well that's a hell of an outpoint in itself. If an enemy battleship was seen on the coast it wouldn't matter who saw it-intelligence organizations would not pick it up unless it had been observed by a trained officer. \"The town could not have been shelled because no reliable ob-server put a report in-there was no artilleryman to tell us whether or not. . . .\" So our system doesn't begin with \"The Slobovians are building 85,000 Panzer tanks, and that's by a reliable observer because Agent 462 has given us factual reports in the past and it's confirmed by aerial observation and satellite pictures. . . .\" So what! The intelligence would be \" Why are the Slobovians building this many Panzer tanks? Now, is this a lot more Panzer tanks than Slobovians normally build?\" because maybe Slobovians go in for a lot of building Panzer tanks so they can call them T-something-or-other and say they were invented in Slobograv. Why? And we right away have a new brand of intelligence-Why? Why are they building these Panzer tanks? One is the fact that they're building these Panzer tanks, is that an outpoint? Well, is it a lot more Panzer tanks than they have built before? Is it a lot less? Did they build a million a year and are only building 200,000 a year now? Now the officer evaluating this hasn't any Why, he hasn't anything so he makes the supposition that the Slobovians are now easing off. \"Yeah, well general, the Slobovians are now easing off.\" \"Yes, Mr. President, the Slobovians are now easing off and everything is going to be fine.\" The fool! What's the Why? Where's the Why? He assumed something-he didn't investigate further. He didn't look all over the place and find a whole lot of political or such ramifications and add it all up and so forth. Now, had he known about it he would have looked from that data to more outpoints and he would have found something or other-building the tanks for Bongoland so that they could knock out their neighboring country. Why? Why? Because they have a contract with Bongoland to furnish them with tanks. He could've found something like that. You get these unwarranted conclusions because they don't have the mechanism of ask-ing \"Why?\" and they don't investigate it until they have an adequate Why that explains it. When you've got a Why you can handle."},{"pageNumber":633,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 7 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 613 DATA SERIES THE CHANGE One more tip on this whole scene. If you can't find the Why, you revert. 1 learned this about life out of plant research. 1 found out that you went back to the point of major change in a greenhouse or a garden and corrected it the second you saw the plants dying. You re-quired, then, a logging of everything that was done. If you had a log of everything that was done you could get the date and the change. You knew the date they started to wilt so what change was around the vicinity of that date. And you inevitably and invariably found a huge change had taken place. Not a small one, and the tip is that if all else fails, why just go back to your major change and you can do that by stats, go to major change, and so on. You won't always be right but you're operating on a general Why-there was a change. Every once in a while you'll be scattering around trying to find this. This works in almost all situations to some degree, what change was there. It has a li-ability. It tends to wipe out improvements. If you go back to the point of high stuff all the time, all the time, all the time, you're pegging yourself into a pattern where, as a matter of fact, there might have been better patterns. There might have been a better Why in there than just a change of pattern. NEW WHY Once in a while you'll have found a Why and handled that, but find it keeps slipping out again. For example, an org having to be told to keep in its FP No. 1. FP No. I resulted from an evaluation of financial difficulties. That was a Why at one time and has since become a standard action-but where you keep having to say to an area \"Get your FP No. I in\"-now why do you have to keep getting in FP No. P The Why is not that FP No. I is out-we have gotten that in as a practiced action. Why does it keep sliding out in this area? There could be several things actually. If you have to keep saying \"Get in C/S Series 25 so that you do have a D of P so that people do come in and are invoiced and so forth,\" you are obviously running into a Why of why something keeps sliding out. WHAT IS A RECOMMENDATION What is a recommendation? Actually-usually-it would be recommended if somebody else were going to execute it. You have a recommended program and then from a recom-mended program you have an executed program, so at that moment you shifted your hat. You're no longer an evaluator, you're an executor or an executive. If your evaluations, that wind up in Whys that wind up in recommendations, are going to autonomously function-that is to say, singly and by itself function-without regard to any other entity or activity, the next thing you know you're going to have fourteen or fifteen pro-grams which are in direct collision which will produce sufficient confusion to reduce the stats. Then you, yourself, will wonder if you've found the right Why because it didn't work. Whereas the reason could be entirely different. The reason is your recommendation was in"},{"pageNumber":634,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 8 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 614 DATA SERIES collision with other Whys and recommendations and so operated to block other actions which were vital to the continuous operation of an activity. You can kill your own recommendation. If you were in a position where you were going to independently of other evaluators execute all your actions, you might wind up with a mess-you've got your neck out as an evaluator. The essence of a recommendation is \"agreed-upon\" and after there is a recom-mendation, there is an \"agreed-upon\" before there is execution. An agreed-upon action means that you'd have to agree with other bodies of data which people had-not their personality-other bodies of data. If you have data which is contrary to an action which is being proposed, you could be put in a position of canceling or trying to cancel or recommending a cancellation of a senior's order. Therefore one has to have \"agreed-upon\" before execution. When you are collecting data you have a torrent of data coming in. You are collecting data, collecting data, collecting data, collecting data. If that data is not evaluated, it is useless. It is just a useless expense. The only way that data is of any value at all is if evaluations are done on it. Any independent order given without the benefit of the other evaluations would be a risk. It isn't agreed upon person to person, it's agreed upon data to data. The only agreement would be on whether there is a situation or a no-situation, a good situation or a bad situation or a no-situation. There'd have to be agreement on that point and there would have to be an agreement on the Why. Only then could you get a coordinated recommendation. EVALUATE You've got to do evaluations. If you don't do evaluations you'll be insufficiently in-formed to be a competent agreer or disagreer. You'll be insufficently informed to be suffi-ciently efficient to get the show on the road. Take advantage of the tremendous volumes of data which come in and, by doing evaluation, provide a sufficient running record of any and all existing situations in your line of country so that there is a general view of what is going on so that the data can be looked at, looked up and one is sufficiently informed so that he can make efficient judgments-and that will decrease the amount of work done on this and that, that doesn't really handle anything. And it amounts to fewer orders which can then be enforced. It amounts to prosperity because one of the Whys we find on occasion is that there are too many orders drifting around which haven't been executed. One winds up operating on somewhat of a jammed communica-tion line just jammed by volume. The guy that's reading all this stuff is out there and he's got noise and he's got this and they've got bill collectors and he's got something else and so on. He never has time to read it. He doesn't know what the situation is and so forth. One could also, without proper evaluation, easily issue an order into an area with a hidden Why-which could destroy it."},{"pageNumber":635,"pageContent":"EVALUATION: THE SITUATION 9 HCO PL 15.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 615 DATA SERIES And the speed of action determines the degree of loss-and that is a rule. The speed of action also determines the degree of gain. And speed has a price. An organization which is not doing well, its Why not accurately found for eight months is a loss for eight months each succeeding week. If an organization should be making fifteen thousand dollars and is only making two thousand dollars you're losing thirteen thousand a week every week that you don't handle it.

(c) Which changes would be a liability to revert. a. Observation: Backlogged pcs getting bit and piece auditing. Data: No daily schedules for auditors and pcs being done. While stats were ris-ing, the ED was in the area Phase One'ing and getting pcs into session for inten-sive auditing and calling in field auditors to help out with the backlog. Then the Dissem Sec blew, and the ED had to go handle that area. b. Observation: Slow service at Jimmy's restaurant losing business. Data: The waitresses have been very slow lately. The new menu, though popular and based on good survey data, is extremely long and is causing waitresses con-fusions. It was found that previously the waitresses were Chinese schooled on the menu and did TRs daily. This has dropped out since. c. Observation: Dir Comm not pushing outflow. Data: Dir Comm was found to be holding down Reception and Telex Operator posts. It was found that there used to be several expeditors in the area helping out – holding Reception, helping out on the telex admin. Then, the HCO Cope Officer, after finding a few misroutes, forbade the use of expeditors in Dept 2. Letters Out stat crashed. Further investigation into the misroutes revealed that the expeditors had just not properly been grooved in on the org bd, so were sometimes confused on what to do with a particle. d. Observation: Snr Execs not using sub-products to get production. Data: During the upstat period it was found that Execs were industriously using sub-products to locate and handle production bugs in areas. These were closely followed up and were getting excellent results. It was found that the HES inno-vated an \"improvement\" in this and got the execs to put in a huge complex admin system on using sub-products which they just couldn't keep up with. Use of sub-products ceased. e. Observation: Cases being mis-C/Sed. Data: Investigation revealed that cases were being programmed backwards. The old good C/S was a Mission staff member whom the Mission pulled out as they were tired of the Org hanging onto him."},{"pageNumber":641,"pageContent":"DATA SERIES EVALUATORS COURSE 5 DRILL SHEET 41R DS: EVALUATION: THE SITUATION ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 621 DATA SERIES f. Observation: Call-in project not biting and org emptying out through com-pletions. Data: Just before the sudden up-surge in Paid Starts it was found that the org was busy promoting public to come in and take services on cut-rate prices. After about a month of this, the AGF found out and ordered the practice ceased. Paid Starts crashed and call-in terminals ceased getting any results on call-in. g. Observation: Books not being used as the first dissemination line. Data: This evaluator found it impossible to locate any one common reason as to Why books were just not being used or pushed as a Dissemination line. A survey of book outlets turned up completely different reasons by each terminal. Tracing back to when books were being used and sold liberally showed that the ex-D/Dir Promo and Pubs was heavily campaigning the use of books. He even had a game going on which outlets could sell the most books, and rewards were given the top book sellers. It was found that the Dir Procurement then started 3P'ing this kind of action and to be spreading around various rumours such as \"books are too complex for public to understand,\" \"Bookbuyers never come in anyway,\" \"Why bother?,\" etc. The Dir Proc's black propaganda campaign was so effective that the D/Dir Promo and Pubs was shot down in flames and all attention on books ceased altogether. B. Now write up: a. What you'd do to go about reverting the changes that were cool to revert. b. What you'd do to find a better Why for the above changes that weren't cool to revert. Drill 6: Recommendations: A. Have a fellow student or the Supervisor write up a brief Sit/Why/Handling for \"Mount Gopher\" org. You also write up a brief Sit/Why/Handling for Mount Gopher org. Now have a third person be Mount Gopher org. You and the second person are to now try and get Mount Gopher org to execute your handlings without any prior coordination. Write up what happened. B. Now take the above \"evals\" and: a. Check if they agree data-to-data. b. Check for any cross orders. c. Once ironed out, now have \"Mount Gopher\" Org execute the eval.

You can take a stat book of an org and look over its GDSes and know their interrelationship and find the outpoint, and then from that outpoint you will know what part of the org's folder to read. If you are doing evaluations by reading the whole folder, you're being silly. You're not interested in that. You're interested in this out-point, because that's your first outpoint. Your first outpoint usually occurs in stats. One outpoint, from stats, was tremendous quantities of bulk mail being mailed at vast cost after the stats had been brought up by regging, and then the stats collapse. That was the first oddity that was noticed from some Dissem stats. So it was a stat oddity. They were busy regging and they made a lot of money, and then they spent it on bulk mail and went broke. Because there was a stat oddity here. It meant the GI did not match the bulk mail. So it's an outpoint. It's inconsistent. Contradictory. Something's false. So right there, you're looking at a great big cracking outpoint. One or the other of those facts is a lie, or something's wrong. And we find out the real outpoint underlying it is wrong target. It's just number of pieces being sent out. They were mailing out fliers several times a week – sending scraps and calling it bulk mail. Now just the fact that an org's stats are down is an outpoint. Having found a downstat you look to see if the org ever did make money? If it was ever affluent. Just taking it from the standpoint of GI, was this org ever affluent? If the org was ever affluent, it must have been doing something right so you've got something that ap-proximates its ideal scene. You haven't approached data files yet. That's why stats are separate from the data files. LOCATING A COMPARATIVE So here's two conditions: (1) the stats are down, and (2) you can't evaluate one thing, as you learn in the Data Series, unless you have a comparative thing. You have to compare it with something. So you can find a period when their stats were up. You find out that in July of 1969 Kokomo was really booming. It had nice climbing stats and they went up and up and up and up and up. And that rise started on the 6th of June. What did they do? In May and June of 69? Those are the two folders you want. Anything you"},{"pageNumber":644,"pageContent":"DATE CONFIDENCE 2 HCO PL 17.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 624 DATA SERIES can find out about that org of May/June 69. That gives you something dimly resembling an ideal scene. It isn't the ideal scene, but it is certainly an upstat scene. That gives you a com-parative. If you were hot you would use your telex lines to fill in the missing holes. For in-stance, if you don't understand something, or if it looked like they moved in 1970 and you can't find out locally, and you don't seem to know whether or not they didlocation seems to be something important here – you could send a telex to somebody who might know and say, \"Where were you located in June of 69? Where was this org located? Can you find out from anybody?\" It might be important you see. This is just a collection of a little bit more data. You know that the org was doing something, at that time, that it isn't doing now. I did just this when I wrote the PL \"Selling and Delivering Auditing.\" I looked back when HGCs were really making the money and wrote that PL. This PL is in use in one org and they're really going to town. They're using the same system. A guy comes in to sign up, they say, \"No you can't sign up for one intensive, thank you, you'll have to buy seven,\" or something. So he does, he pays the money on the barrelhead. That PL comes out of a com-parative – a comparative of HGCs not selling much auditing and having a hard time doing so, and what they were doing in an earlier period. So, when doing an evaluation (1) look at your stats, (2) find your outpoint in the stats, (3) find some comparative – find some period of affluence for the org, if you can, to give you some ideal scene for that org. That requires something of a pluspoint evaluation. Now you can do your outpoint evaluation. Because you've already got the outpoint, you don't have to read 8,752 folders. ETHICS SITUATION A while back, I asked the Data Bureau for the folders of a particular downstat org. The first folder came up, that wasn't even a complete month's folder. I looked through the folder, read scraps of what I was reading, picked out the reports I wanted. Scanned them. Pulled the outpoints out of them. Counted up the outpoints as to where they were going. And the thing just fell apart. The CO was unaware of the fact that Personnel was letting him down. That was their admin Why. And obviously the CO had to take that person in there off. And obviously there was something wrong with this CO. Now every eval done on that org since is grooving on straight down that same Why. We've tried to make orders, and we've tried to do this and we've tried to do that. But now an ethics situation has developed out of the thing. We got the admin Why all right. But an ethics situation developed as we tried to get this in. And notice that the ethics situation develops when you try to get in the Admin or Tech why. In another area the ethics situation developed to such a degree that it then emerged – after an observation mission, after a handling was done and orders were issued – that they did not execute a single one of them. They were told to revert. They did not. Therefore an ethics Why was looked for. Now I've just found out why people can't put in ethics. They don't know investigatory tech, and possibly in some cases their own ethics are out. If you put their own ethics in, they"},{"pageNumber":645,"pageContent":"DATE CONFIDENCE 3 HCO PL 17.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 625 DATA SERIES will get in ethics further. The reason they assign broad conditions and the reason there are so many Comm Evs is they don't know how to investigate. WHO WHEN Someone was given an evaluation to do and had been on that for five days. I kept ask-ing all this time – where's this evaluation? People must think I'm rushing them. Evaluators are slow because the evaluation is not being done in this sequence: (1) stats, (2) who was on where. I gave an order to an evaluator to find out exactly when did a CO of an org come to Flag, and when did this person go back, because that would give you a stat comparison. That was how I found this person was the man-of-all-work and the scooting genius of that org. Now you're talking about ethics. It's the police action called date coincidence. It's how you locate geniuses and murderers. Body found in swamp. Her cousin arrived in town on Tues-day. Body found on Wednesday. Guy departed on Thursday. That's all the police need. That's called date coincidence. That's old time investigatory tech. It's still with us. So, when were they gone out of the org, and when did they arrive back in the org, and'what happened during that period of time? Important! In the case of this particular CO, I found out that two other execs could leave the org and return and nothing happened – but when the CO left, the roof fell in, the front steps col-lapsed under everybody, and the staff went on vacation. I traced this down and I found out that this CO would run around the org wearing hats in rotation. She dived into Tech and wore the Tech Sec hat for a while, and then she dived into another area, and she wore that hat for a while, and the stats would go up. In other words, she supported that area by punching one area at a time. That was the way she was operating. So if she was all over the org like that, her obvious post was D/CO. We put her on that post, and the org has done well ever since. Now that's a sort of ethics action in reverse. That's looking for who really pushes it. You don't just keep on looking for tigers. Tigers are probably more numerous than geniuses. But you could find that certain people have a vast effect on stats. This is how you evaluate a personnel scene. In another org, a guy took over and the place has been crashed ever since and it was right square on the stats. There is your most obvious ethics investigation by stats. When you don't know, you've got to send an investigatory mission and it's got to be run well. Otherwise they just wind up shooting all the people that the staff complain about. If you don't operate on a comparison every time – comparison admin Why, compari-son on the stats, ethics comparisons – if you're trying to operate on a single datum, that single datum won't buy you any pie. Because it has nothing to compare with. SUMMARY What the Data Bureau gives us is experience. And that is huge files full of experience, but you've got to recognize what you're reading. You don't read everything! If you do you're"},{"pageNumber":646,"pageContent":"DATE CONFIDENCE 4 HCO PL 17.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 626 DATA SERIES omitting an analysis of the GDSes and an analysis of who went on where. At a good time and a bad time. What are you looking for? You're looking for the stat – look at your GDSes (this is for your admin Whys), tells you the big outpoint, tells you what information you're looking for in the files – and you're only interested in that information. You start counting up that type of information and see where it lands, and the Why will practically jump out at you out of the folder. It is so easy! It just leaps right out. But you have to know what you're looking at. In writing up one eval, an evaluator verbally gave me more valuable data than she had put into the eval. She was quoting reports. All you want to do is quote the steps of your inves-tigation. The Why has got to be specific. If a Why is insufficiently specific, it just can't be op-erated. There's an admin Why, which is the normal one that you're trying to handle. There'll be an admin or tech Why and below that there'll be an ethics Why and above that there'll be a bright idea. You have a criterion when you've got your evaluation all done, your handling has got to be bright – it's got to be a bright idea, that will actually drive those stats up – and some-thing which can be operated. And if you do an evaluation that cannot be operated at this stage of the game, you're just wasting your time. Look at your resources. What can you do with what you've got? While you improve what you've got. It will all have to be done by a gradi-ent. So the worse off things are the brighter you have to be. When you do evaluations, you've got to be able to operate the resulting actions. If you write something that can't be operated nothing will happen. That at once tells you whether you have a good evaluation or a bad evaluation. Do your evaluations in such a way that they are dead on – bang! bang! bang! – and then, that being the case, they have got to be something that can be operated. And the next thing you know your stats will go up. Compiled from LRH taped confer-ence to Staff Aides \"Current and Future Operations Actions\" 7205TC 18SO L.

We can cause stats at will. External actions don't affect them. A newspaper can write reams of entheta and it doesn't affect our stats at all. We get good publicity-it doesn't affect our stats. It's totally internal. The public demand is apparently exactly as great as we put the wherewithal in their hands with which to demand-apparently exactly proportional. You get as great a response as you require. Therefore, the more efficient your org is, the greater response you will get. It's that elementary. The test of an evaluator or executive is: \"Can you get your org to do a constructive thing at once without any flashback or any nonsense, and will it occur in such a way as to increase stats promptly? If so, you're a good administrator. If you can't do that, we have all kinds of paint to scrape.\" It's just that: The guy can produce an effect or he can't. And if you run a managing body that way, all of a sudden the staff will get happy and cheerful producing effects; everything will be fine-because they'll become at cause. That is the essence of hatting. The person can then come up to cause and he'll get sane, productive and cheerful. Actually, it takes a very able guy to do an administrative line. A ditchdigger has to have a solid line of his arm and a shovel, and that's as far as he can produce an effect. That's why he's a ditchdigger. Now for a guy to produce an effect at 7,000 miles without any solid beam-he has to be right on the ball. He has to know his business."},{"pageNumber":652,"pageContent":"EVALUATION AND PROGRAMS 2 HCO PL 18.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 632 DATA SERIES SPEED OF EVALUATION There was once a situation in an org which was very interesting. Apparently the ED was stopping the reports of the LRH Comm and Flag Rep, so no one was about to find out what was going on in that org. But if the manager had been on the ball, all he would have had to do was to look at that data file and find those reports missing and know that there was something wrong-and it would have been detected a long time before. What you're up against is that most of your evaluation is on omission, and the toughest outpoint for anybody who is not familiar with the scene to recognize is an omission. The speed of recognizing outpoints determines the speed with which one can evaluate. You wonder why it takes people so long to evaluate. It is simply that they are too slow in recognizing an outpoint. The inability to recognize an outpoint is reasonableness. It's that thing, reasonableness. We've been talking about it for years. That's just the in-ability to recognize an outpoint. There was a fellow out in the field saying \"I think we have done all right in the past\"-meaning \"without the Data Series\"-\"in our thinking and planning.\" He didn't think he had to take a Data Series course or something. Whereas I was literally getting rivers of out-points from him and his area. He didn't recognize them as such. Well, what he didn't appreciate is that this is a brand new way of thinking. Man prides himself on being logical so that he has never based any system on illogic-except humor. You have to learn to think backwards-you learn to think backwards, and boy can you think for-wards. It's like a dichotomy, positive-negative. If everybody omits the negative all the time, they never get to the positive. A lot of people are on a stuck flow of being sensible and sane-and that winds up in stupidity. So they get reasonable. Their confront of evil isn't up to it-basically, their confront of outpoints. The ability to recognize outpoints will exactly monitor the speed of evaluation and the ability to handle the scene. An evaluator cannot say, when he hasn't received any reports for 21/2 months, that he doesn't know what to do because he hasn't received any reports . . . he'd better be able to rec-ognize an omitted report when he sees one and that there is a situation and he had better take action to remedy that situation NOW. INACTIVITY Now, nobody ever does nothing. They never do nothing. You have to look around to find out what he is doing."},{"pageNumber":653,"pageContent":"EVALUATION AND PROGRAMS 3 HCO PL 18.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 633 DATA SERIES If it's an exec who can't get juniors to produce, he could probably be putting a stop on production lines. A Why is findable to such a situation. That's probably an ethics scene. But you still will find a Why. You always find a Why for the situation. In other words, he's in a personal situation of some kind or another. He might be able to function, himself, as a junior or he might not-but for a guy to sit there with completely idle staff members and not notice it, with their areas wrapped around a telegraph pole-quite reprehensible. In investigating one inactive Esto, I found out she was operating under an order that she was not to Bait and Badger until she was trained on it-and there were probably many other things she \"was not permitted to do.\" She accepted an illegal order not to do certain Esto actions. Found out one, probably if we had investigated further, why we would find more. In the first place, if anybody has read the Esto Series, he'd find out that you are an Esto (it says it right in the beginning) and that's it. It doesn't matter if the guy has studied it or not studied it, he's an Esto and he's supposed to do the job. So it was a violent policy violation as well as keeping someone from doing her job. EXPANSION PROGRAM An expansion program is for getting an org built. It's based on an evaluation for that org. There is a way you could go about this. Suppose you wrote Kokomo and said, \"What should be done about Kokomo?\" You get a bunch of answers from the whole staff-compulsory answer, not a couple of guys. Evaluate from that what their level and tone and that sort of thing is. And you could then form up, based squarely on policy and forming the org, an expansion program. The expansion program is actually a very basic org rudiment function, but which would be adapted to that org, and within the reality of that org. Highly specialized-and it's terminable. The person executing it, when he gets through with the thing-that's the end of that one. Now let's get another entirely new program. You could actually do it on a blanket basis where each org was treated as an individual org. Then you'd know what policies to get in in this org. You just ask them, \"What should be done about Kokomo?\" \"What should be done about Keokuk?\" they'll tell you. Then you could go down to your Data Files and do an evaluation for the expansion program. You can thus use knowledge of the org's troubles and the staff interviews as the basis for an evaluation. There has to be an immediate organization for production, according to the Prod-Org system. However, long-range, long-term organization actions have got to be done by some-body because the Prod-Org system tears an org to ribbons. There's got to be somebody putting an org there who's not directly involved in that immediate scene. He's got to put it there adroitly enough so that what he puts there expands its production so as to pay for the addi-tional organization."},{"pageNumber":654,"pageContent":"EVALUATION AND PROGRAMS 4 HCO PL 18.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 634 DATA SERIES It's quite neat, that type of program. As they get executed along the line, they wind up with an increased production. Every three or four targets that are done, why all of a sudden you've got more production. There could be some good long-range targets like \"Get 30 audi-tors\" -probably could take a year or more to exhaust such a target. But note-such an expansion program wouldn't go on your production program execu-tion lines at all. Your long-term organizational actions go on another line than your immediate production actions. PRODUCTION PROGRAM Such a program is something concerned with handling an immediate situation which had to do with immediate production. Right now. Such as: Why: Division 6 doing all the sign-ups for Division 2. Handling: 1. Get a Registrar on post in Division 2, right now. 2. Then get an Advanced Scheduling Registrar on post immediately. 3. Then get three letter writing Registrars on post at once. 4. Get them functioning, production, immediately. It's a \"right now\" scene. A short-term production program ought to expire within 30 days-it becomes staledated within 30 days. Some of them become staledated within 10 or 15 days. So you need a very hot, very fast line of very quick compliance. It already takes quite a while for the reports to get to the files through the mail so that you know what the situation is. You're already 10 days behind the gun-10 days, 2 weeks late. And then it's going to take maybe another week to get it assembled-to know that there is a situation and evaluate it and get it through and ready. So you're operating on about a 3-week average comm lag. You have to make up for it at the other end of the line-get this thing done now-now-now. And you've got to have someone there to get it done. The eval probably will not save the bacon of an org for the next two years. It will be lucky if it keeps the stats bolstered for six weeks-then something else will go out. By that time, why Div 6 will have become completely confused because it is not now being permitted to do all the registration of the org, so therefore it would have gone out of existence, and the Registrar would have left, so now we would have to evaluate and handle Division 6. It goes tick-tock. From one situation to another. There are different types of evaluation. There'd be a divisional evaluation. There could even be a departmental evaluation. There could be an org evaluation. An executive stratum evaluation. And so on."},{"pageNumber":655,"pageContent":"EVALUATION AND PROGRAMS 5 HCO PL 18.3.77R ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 635 DATA SERIES You could have several evaluations going at the same time, but they would have to be different divisions or areas, otherwise you'd cross up like mad. Normally speaking and in the-ory, that would be possible. But in fact a competent evaluation would find the imbalance be-tween divisions. The operative word is current evaluation. You could push a current evaluation. How wide is present time? Well, that's a matter of judgment, but a year-old evaluation would be pretty much not current. FIRST TARGET Your first program target must always be a production target-but you can't, in actual fact, write a pure production target. It would be impossible to write a pure production target because somebody would have to do it, and the moment that you have somebody there to do it you have organization. So there is a certain amount of organization that comes into it. If I were evaluating an org right now, say its Dept 7, 1 would have to include in it as its second target, beefing up Dept 7. First target would be for Dept 7 to do anything it could to handle its collections. And the second target would be to beef up that department forthwith, bang bang! Otherwise the production would not continue. It would break. So, as mentioned earlier, there has to be immediate organization for production. TERMINABLE TARGETS Now how do you like a target like this: \"Maintain friendly relations with the environ-ment.\" How do you like that target? It is utterly completely not a doingness target. It isn't a target at all! Now if it said: \"Call on so and so, and so and so and make them aware of your pres-ence . . .\" and so forth, it could have a done on it. Targets should be term inable-doable, finishable, completable. REPEATING TARGETS There is such a thing as a repeating target. You can accomplish it many times-it's like when you do org rudiments. Every time they do one of those targets a compliance is added to the compliance stat. This is especially true of some targets in expansion programs.

Those programs are based on evaluations of the current status of an org from the viewpoint of production. Not from a viewpoint of its organization.

We got several evals through, severely according to the Data Series rules. Here are the results of 7 of them. 8. Program was reported fully done. Stats went up. 9. 18 July eval. Pgm was almost fully done. Finance got bugged. Org crashed 22 August 74. 10. 22 July eval. By 15 Aug stats had gone up. 11. 21 July 74 eval but not started on until 26 Sept 74 as Study Manuals were delayed on which eval depended. Org stats after eval began to be done went up and by the end of Oct hit highest ever almost across the boards. 12. 20 July 74 eval. Started on 10 Aug 74. Half-done. By 24 Oct stats went up. 13. 23 July 74 issue. Bugged. Not completed. Stats went up first couple weeks. Org crashed 24 Oct 74. (Eval was also cross-ordered by removal of CO.) 14. 23 July 74. Three-quarters done. Stats went up. Thus 5 out of 7 of the above evals were successful. The two that failed were obviously insufficiently broad as other matters got in the way of them. The evaluator could not have had the real situation. Means not enough preliminary work to find the area that should have been evaluated. VERBAL TECH Verbal tech on a DSEC should be severely handled if found. Note that the evals as above were very purely supervised referring only to departures from the Data Series P/Ls."},{"pageNumber":658,"pageContent":"EVALUATION SUCCESS 2 HCO PL 18.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 638 DATA SERIES Pure eval per Data Series 33R was the push on getting the evals done. I was simply demanding full Data Series P/L application. The reason for verbal tech is Mis-U words! FAILING EVALS -It is pretty easy to tell if an eval is getting done or if it is failing. The two poor evals in the 7 just weren't watched fast enough by the evaluators. You cancel a failing eval fast and do a better one. Failing to cancel or redo a failing eval on an org would be the real reason for that org continuing to go down. SUMMARY If you got 5/7ths of all our orgs purely evaluated, no nonsense with verbal tech, you would have booming Int stats! Just like pcs-unprogrammed pcs fail-and pcs audited with hearsay tech fail! Orgs without evaluated, pushed programs for that org tend to fail. And evaluations done on hearsay tech are a waste of paper. How about it? A boom or crash? It's up to you.

In each of these cases, personnel whose personnel folders had not been looked into and whose ethics files had not been examined were concerned. In the last one, a person was being proposed for promotion to a high executive position in an org while the stats for the past week demonstrated that his area was seriously downstat, the matter even being men-tioned on the current battle plans. It is not how much you read, it is where you look. In the Data Files, if one is examin-ing the statistics of a division, one does not read all manner of reports from other divisons and other personnel. One has to be selective and right target to get his data. Statistics (as fully outlined in statistical management PLs) are the dominant factors in an evaluation, and most evaluations begin on the basis of statistics which are either suffi-ciently high to merit examination so as to be reinforced, or are too low to be viable. These read in conjunction with other statistics usually give you an org situation. When one discovers a series of outpoints, there is generally a situation underlying them. From the statistical trail, or the gross outpoint trail, one can locate a situation, The situation is then evaluated by looking for and finding the exact data which applies to that situation. From this one can find his Why, and once this is found he can get a bright idea. A program can then ensue which terminatedly handles that situation. Evaluations cannot be done in any other way. The moment that you apply humanoid think to the subject of evaluation, you lose. In the last evaluation I looked over, the evaluator obviously had not gone to personnel files, data files or any other files but had simply read some PR despatches written by the guy himself and had taken single-source data and decided to promote the person to the control of an area. Statistics demonstrated at once that the person's stats were down, that practice evalua-tions done on that very org existed, and that the ethics and personnel files of that person would never have suggested any promotion and on the contrary would have suggested demo-"},{"pageNumber":662,"pageContent":"SUPER EVALUATION 2 HCO PL 20.3.77 ELEMENTARY EVALUATORS COURSE 642 DATA SERIES tion. This would have made a very dangerous situation in the area, would have victimized a great many good people, and would have played hell with Flag statistics. Persons \"evaluating\" without having looked at the vital data concerned with their evaluation, are subject to a Court of Ethics on the charge of false evaluation. While this might be looked on some as a deterrent to evaluating at a// when evalua-tions are vital, remember that it is better to handle one person, the evaluator, than to tie up and maul a thousand people with a program based on a false Why Evaluations not only can be done but are quite magical in handling things when the evaluator knows what he is doing and when he looks for the information he needs to evaluate in the places where that information exists. It is out of correct and brilliant evaluation that high stats are made. We have superlative tools, we must use them right. Compiled from LRH OODs item 15 October 1973 \"Super Evaluation\" L.

Comb closely through all the reports in the files for the last 6 months. c. Dig out the DofP and delivery reports for the last month. d.

The auditors all got 12 hours in the chair, and the internes finally got some checkouts so should be auditing too in the next month or two. The DTS has put up the most magnificent scheduling board – took him all week, but it really enhances the HGC space. The DofP was on the phone to a few pcs this week – claims the DTS is not wearing his hat, but I don't know about that. The ED was all over my back – which bugged the hell out of me – I felt everything was going fine. WDAHs were up from 23 to 25. b. There was a real fight at FP this week. We'd gotten orders down to re-do our FP No. 1 – and boy was it a mad scramble to fit everything in. I feel that I wasn't given enough for xerox paper because the HAS was very insistent that more was allocated to postage – which she got. The Dissem Sec won over the conflict be-tween her and the Treas Sec on who would get a higher amount for Stationary – but then, Dissem with all those Letter Reges does use more stationary. The AGF commended all of us for a job well done – took a bit, but we did it! c. Hey wow! I've never seen so many staff at study before. The SSO has been be-ing an absolute terror about it – been using ethics gradients too. At first there was a lot of flak but now things have calmed down. We had 5 Hat completions this week and 2 SS IIIs!! d. It's been very quiet in HCO this week. Thank goodness! Last week it was so noisy – but we cleared everyone out out!! The E/O now is only seeing people in the mornings (when all other HCO staff have their In Basket Time), the Re-cruiter has been moved to a back office where he won't disturb us with all his traffic. We had to take his phone out as it was ringing all the time – such a dis-traction. The Dir Comm has educated the org into delivering their own comm so he can concentrate on working with our two Mimeo personnel on getting out all the PTS A declares the E/O has been writing – he's real good at shunting them out of the org where they won't bug us. Ah! Here comes the Dir Pers with our coffee – now for a nice long coffee break. (Oh – by the way – I've confiscated all policy files in the org. People were dog-earing them too much.) B.
