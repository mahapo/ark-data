A few days ago when I found that musical chairs and flubbed hatting had unstabilized some areas, I wondered whether or not this might stem from some social aberration that was very general in the societies in which we are working. And it seems to have been the case. I worked on it a bit and found this: Law: The power of a thetan stems from his ability to hold a position in space. This is quite true. In Scientology 8-80 the base of the motor is discussed. It holds two terminals in fixed positions. Because they are so fixed, power can be generated. If a thetan can hold a position or location in space he can generate POWER. If he cannot, he cannot generate power and will be weak. We have known this for nineteen years. It applies here. Observation: Modern society tends to confuse and unstabilize persons with its hec-tic pace. Observation: Beings who are afraid of strong people try to weaken them. Observation: Persons who are pushed around feel they cannot hold a position in space. Observation: People hate to lose their posts and jobs. they find it degrading. In processing, picking up this chain of lost positions achieves very good gains and re-habilitates a person's ability to hold a job. law: by giving a person a post or position he is somewhat strengthened and made more confident in life. Law: By letting a person retain his post he is made more secure. Law: By hatting a person he is greatly strengthened as he is helped to hold his post."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"WHY HATTING 2 HCO PL 29.7.71 EFFICIENCY COURSE 2 17.11.12 A basically insecure person who feels he is unable to hold his position in space is suf-ficiently strengthened by hatting to feel secure enough to do his job. Law: Having a hat, being hatted, and demonstrating competence makes a person feel capable of holding his position in space and he becomes more stable, confident in life and more powerful. Law: Unhatted persons on a post can become criminal on the post because they feel insecure and become weak. When a person is secretly afraid of others he instinctively will not hat them or hats them wrongly and tends to transfer or move them about. When a person is insecurely posted and insufficiently hatted he can try to weaken oth-ers by trying to prevent their hatting and trying to get them transferred or even dismissed. This is apparently the social aberration at work. The answer to a sane org and a sane society is not welfare and removal. It is Recruit them Train them Hat them Apprentice them Give them a post. This is so strong in truth it would de-aberrate the bulk of the crime out of a society. And it sure will put an org in Power. L.

One of the best ways to cut your work in half is not to do it twice. Probably your most fruitful source of Dev-T is your own double work. This is the way you do double work. You pick up a despatch or a piece of work, look it over and then put it aside to do later, then later you pick it up and read it again and only then do you do it. This of course doubles your traffic just like that. One of the reasons I can handle so much traffic is that I don't do it twice. I make it a heavy rule that if I find myself handling a piece of traffic, I handle it, not put it into a hold or a later category. If I happen to be prowling through my basket in the Message Center Stack to see what's there, I do what I find there. If I am given a message or a datum that requires further action from me, I do it right when I receive it. This is how I buy \"loafing time\". Now I'm not trying to hold me up as a model of virtue as the man who always does his job; I do many jobs and many hats; I am holding myself up as an ambitious loafer and as a buyer of valuable loafing time. There's no need to look busy if you are not busy. There is no need to fondle and caress work because there isn't enough of it. There's plenty of work to do. The best answer to work of any kind is to do it. If you do every piece of work that comes your way WHEN it comes your way and not after a while, if you always take the initiative and take action, not refer it, you never get any traffic back unless you've got a psycho on the other end."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"HOW TO HANDLE WORK 2 HCO PL 19.8.59 EFFICIENCY COURSE 4 17.11.12 In short, the way to get rid of traffic is to do it, not to refer it; anything referred has to be read by you again, digested again, and handled again, so never refer traffic, just do it so it's done. You can keep a comm line in endless foment by pretending that the easiest way not to work is to not handle things or to refer things. Everything you don't handle comes back and bites. Everything you refer has to be done when it comes back to you. So if you are truly a lover of ease, the sort of person who yawns comfortably and wears holes in heels resting them on desks, if your true ambition is one long bout of spring fever, then you'll do as I suggest and handle everything that comes your way when it comes and not later, and you'll never refer anything to anybody that you yourself can do promptly. That people begin to point you out as a model of efficiency, as the thing expected to cop the next world's speed record, that articles begin to appear about the marvels you are cre-ating, is all incidental. You and I know we did it so we could be lazy and not have to work. For it can be truly said that the way to all labor of a long and continuous grind is by putting off the action when the message is received and in referring it all to somebody else, that's the way to slavery, to tired muscles and tattered brains; that's the route to baskets piled high. So come loaf with me. Do it when you see it and do it yourself. L.

And it is of such violence that it can crash an area's stats while seemingly working frantically. Backlog (Webster's) noun: 3. an increasing accumulation of tasks unperformed or ma-terials not processed; verb: to accumulate as a backlog. NOT-DONES AND HALF-DONES Backlogs occur for various reasons. But the two main classes are (1) Not-Dones and (2) Half-Dones. For lack of seeing that a backlog exists, lack of supervision of existing personnel, other-intentionedness of personnel, lack of personnel to handle the usual or peak volumes, lack of know-how to handle, lack of resources, and outright sabotage are some of the reasons that account for Not-Dones. Half-Dones are as bad as Not-Dones as they bit and piece an area into a quagmire. Suppose Detroit began to make half-cars. All their resources would be devoured, yet nothing would really be produced, yet everyone would look frantically busy; the executive worries would mount up to an inconceivable fever pitch unless the half-done factor was handled. But half-dones are not always as visible as half-cars. \"Have you handled Bets and Company suit?\" \"Oh yes.\" But the case is lost because the filing papers were only half-prepared and half-filed. The same reasons apply for Half-Dones as are listed above for Not-Dones. The Why of many failures is found in Not-Dones and Half-Dones. The primary effect (there are others) of Not-Dones and Half-Dones is the building up of backlogs. Now, no backlog ever quietly lies there. So long as anything else depended upon the actions being done, there will be pressure or threat of one kind or another on the backlogged area. Thus, when an activity becomes backlogged, it generates new work not concerned with reducing the backlog amount."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"NOT DONES, HALF DONES AND BACKLOG 2 HCO PL 26.1.72 EFFICIENCY COURSE 8 17.11.12 Example: An insurance company backlogs claims payments. Torrents of queries then demand why. The claims section spends its time answering the queries, not reducing the number of claims. The volume of work doubles, trebles, but no claims get paid. Backlogging at once doubles the work by the addition of demand handling. Example: A Central Files fails to stay filed into up to present time. Demands for items in it cause others to consume all the file clerk's time tearing CF apart to find particles. A backlog can increase itself by adding disorder that undoes things already done. Thus a backlog tears up the past work while building up future work. Example: Personnel backlogs its files, causing it to backlog appointments. This over-loads areas. These areas start crashing down on Personnel in mobs demanding it provide peo-ple. Personnel is then so busy fending off people, it can't appoint. Yet is in frantic action. A backlog prevents itself from being handled. ____________ An org that has several backlogs in it becomes frantic and then goes into apathy. The cure is to: 1. Get people and do All Hands actions to get the most important backlogs done. 2. To find the real Why of the backlog and handle it so a present time state is then main-tained. (Requires a program, followed and done.) 3. Check out staff on the book PROBLEMS OF WORK. 4. Get staff to do Training Drill Zero on their work areas, 5. Get staff to reach and withdraw from their materials of operation or areas. 6. Do a survey of attitudes which reveals complaints and reasons for not-dones, half-dones, backlogs. 7. Based on the survey, campaign hard to remedy Not-Dones and Half-Dones. 8. Be very severe with any beginnings of any future backlogs. ____________ When you see an area or org in apathy, know it has gone the route of not-dones, half-dones and backlogs and handle. When you see an area going frantic, know you are looking at not-dones, half-dones and backlogs and handle fast before it goes into the much worse condition of apathy. Production is the basis of morale. Not-dones, half-dones result in backlogs. Backlogs destroy the possibility of future production. Thus you know the situation of not-dones and half-dones will result in backlogs. The backlogs will prevent further handling. This subject is the subject which makes executives harassed.

A person is either the effect of his environment or is able to have an effect upon his environment. The 19th Century psychologist preached that man had to \"adjust to his environment\". This false datum helped begin a racial degeneration. The truth is that man is as successful as he adjusts the environment to him. Being competent means the ability to control and operate the things in the environ-ment and the environment itself. When you see things broken down around the mechanic who is responsible for them, he is plainly exhibiting his incompetence-which means his inability to control those things in his environment and adjust the environment for which he is responsible – motors. When you see the mate's boats broken up you know he does not have control of his environment. Know-how, attention, and the desire to be effective are all part of the ability to control the environment. One's \"standards\" (the degree of rightness one is trying to establish and maintain) are directly related to one's desire to have a controlled environment. The attainment of one's standards is not done by criticism (a human system). It is done by exerting control of one's environment and moving things effectively toward a more ideal scene. Control of the environment begins with oneself. A good case state, a body that one keeps clean and functioning. This extends to one's own gear, his clothing, tools, equipment. It"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ENVIRONMENT CONTROL 2 HCO PL 30.12.70 EFFICIENCY COURSE 12 17.11.12 extends further to the things one is responsible for in the environment. Then it extends out into the whole environment, the people and the MEST. One can get pretty dirty fixing things up. That's okay. But can one then also clean one-self up? The ability to confront MEST is a high ability. After that comes the ability to handle and control it. The ability to confront people is also a high ability. After that comes the ability to get along with them and to handle and control them. There is the Supreme Test of a thetan-the ability to make things go right. The reverse of this is the effort to make things go wrong. Incompetence-lack of know-how, inability to control-makes things go wrong. Given some know-how or picking it up by observation, sane people make things go right. The insane remain ignorant intentionally or acquire know-how and make things go wrong. Insane acts are not unintentional or done out of ignorance. They are intentional, they are not \"unknowing dramatizations\". So around insane people things go wrong. One cannot tell the difference really between the sane and insane by behaviour. One can tell the difference only by the product. The product of the sane is survival. The product of the insane is an overt act. As this is often masked by clever explanations it is not given the attention it deserves. The pretended good product of the insane turns out to be an overt act. A large percentage of this planet's population (undetermined at this time for the \"gen-eral public\" but in excess of 20%) are insane. Their behaviour looks passable. But their prod-uct is an overt act. The popularity of war confirms this. The products of existing governments are mainly destructive. The final product of the human race will be a destroyed planet (a con-taminated air cover rendering the planet unable to sustain life, whether by radiation or fumes). Thus, due to the inability to detect and handle the insane, the sane majority suffers. The hidden actions of the insane can destroy faster than an environment can be created unless one has the know-how of the mind and life and the tech of Admin and the ability and know-how to handle MEST. An area or activity hit by an influx of new recruits or new customers tends to unsettle. Its MEST gets abuse, things go out of control. Gradually, working to put in order, the standards are again being attained. The minor-ity insane get handled, the know-how of groups and orgs becomes more generally known, the tech of MEST gets used again. As an organization expands it goes through cycles of lowered condition and raised condition. This is normal enough since by taking on more and more area one is letting in more and more insane even though they are in a small proportion to the sane."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ENVIRONMENT CONTROL 3 HCO PL 30.12.70 EFFICIENCY COURSE 13 17.11.12 Order is re-established and survival trends resumed to the degree that the sane begin to reach out and handle things around them and as the insane are made sane. Thus one gets downtrends and uptrends. As soon as a group begins to feel cocky, it takes on more area. This includes more unhandled people, admin and MEST and a downtrend begins. Then the sane begin to handle and the insane begin to be sane and the uptrend starts. This is probably even the basis of national economic booms and depressions. This is only bad to the degree that the insane are put in charge. As soon as this hap-pens the downtrend becomes permanent and cultural decay sets in. A group expanding rapidly into a decadent culture is of course itself subjected to the uptrend-downtrend cycles and has to take very special measures to counteract the conse-quences of expansion in order to maintain any rate of growth. The individual member of a group can measure his own progress by increased ability to handle himself, his post and environment and the degree of improvement of the group itself because of his own work within it. A group that is messing up its gear and environment worse than it did a while ago and is not improving it of course has to be reorganized before it perishes. No group can sit back and expect its high brass to be the only ones to carry the load. The group is composed of individual group members, not of high brass. The survival of a group depends upon the ability of its individual members to control their environment and to insist that the other group members also control theirs. This is the stuff of which survival is made. A sane group, knowing and using their technologies of handling men and MEST, can-not help but control their environment. But this depends upon the individual group member being sane, able to control his MEST and those around him and using the tech of life, the tech of Admin, the tech of specific types of activity. Such a group inevitably inherits the culture and its guidance. L.

The support usually adds up to food, clothing, shelter, money, tolerance and cooperation (good will). On an individual basis this is easy to grasp. The individual produces a product or products which, flowed into the dept, div, org, company, community, state, nation or planet, then returns to him his pay and good will or at least sufficient good will to prevent his aban-donment or destruction. Long-range survival of the individual is attained in this fashion. A valuable final product (VFP) is valuable because it is potentially or factually ex-changeable. The key word in this sense is exchangeable. And exchangeability means outside, with something outside the person or activity. A valuable final product could as easily be named a valuable exchangeable product. Sanity and insanity are matters of motive, not rationality or competence. The sane are constructive, the insane are destructive. Thus insanity on the part of the potential receiver of a VFP can prevent an exchange of a final product the receiver should be able to use and for which he should be willing to give active support and good will to the producer. Example: Man starving; you try to sell him good food at reasonable price for which he has money to pay. He tries to shoot you and destroy the food. This is insanity since he is trying to destroy the product he needs and can afford. Crime is the action of the insane or the action of attempting seizure of product without support. Example: Robbers who do not support a community seek to rob from it supporting funds. Fraud is the attempt to obtain support without furnishing a product. Sanity and honesty then consist of producing a valuable final product for which one is then recompensed by support and good will, or in reverse flow, supporting and giving good will to the producer of the product."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"VALUABLE FINAL PRODUCTS 2 OS-26 – HCO PL 25.3.71 EFFICIENCY COURSE 16 17.11.12 Ethical basics, morale, social subjects, law, all are based on this principle of the valu-able final product. Previously it has been \"instinctive\" or \"common sense.\" It has not before been stated. Civilizations which facilitate production and interchange and inhibit crime and fraud are then successful. Those that do not, perish. Persons who wish to destroy civilizations promote departures from these basic rules of the game. Methods of corrupting fair interchange are numerous. The Factors are the first appearance of these principles. The theory of the valuable final product is an extension of the Factors. Parts of organizations or organizations, towns, states and countries all follow the prin-ciples which apply to the individual. The survival or value of any section, department, division or org is whether or not it follows these principles of interchange. The survival or value of any town, state or country follows these principles of inter-change. You can predict the survival of any activity by confirming its interchange regularities or can predict its downfall by irregularities in this interchange. Therefore it is vital that a person or a section, department, division or part of an org or an org figure out exactly what it is interchanging. It is producing something that is valuable to the activity or activities with which it is in communication and for that it is obtaining support. If it is actually producing valuable final products then it is entitled to support. If on the other hand it is only organizing or hoping or PRing and is not producing an interchangeable commodity or commodities in volume or quality for which support can be elicited and even demanded, it will not be viable. It doesn't matter how many orders are issued or how well org boards are drawn or beautiful the plans to produce are made. The hard fact of production remains the dominant fact. How well organized things are increases production volume and improves quality and thus can bring about viability. But it is the valuable final product there and being interchanged that determines basic survival. Lack of viability can always be traced to the volume and quality of an actual valuable final product. Hope of a product has a short-term value that permits an activity to be built. But when the hope does not materialize, then any hoped for viability also collapses. One then must organize back from the actually produced product. For instance, a technical subject is capable of producing an exact result."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"VALUABLE FINAL PRODUCTS 3 OS-26 – HCO PL 25.3.71 EFFICIENCY COURSE 17 17.11.12 If persons are trained to actually produce the result and the result is produced then one can exchange the technicians with the community for support. If the result is produced (by training the technicians well) then the result can be inter-changed with an individual for support and good will. Where any of these factors suffer in volume or quality then an interchange is difficult and viability becomes uncertain. As individuals, communities and states are not necessarily sane, upsets can occur in the interchange even when production is occurring. Therefore the producer has a stake in maintaining the sanity of the scene in which he is operating, and one of his valuable final products is a scene in which production and inter-change can occur. The basics of valuable final products are true for any industrial or political, or eco-nomic system. Many systems attempt to avoid these basics and the end result would be disaster. The individual, section, department, division, org or country that is not producing something valuable enough to interchange will not be supported for long. It is as simple as that. L.

In areas where the abilities which add up to administrative skill are missing, the or-ganization or country can expect to fail or be overthrown. Even such small things as file keeping, accounts records, personnel placement, add up to better longevity. The integrity of personnel is a large factor in administration, and a lack of skills with which to detect and handle false reports and lack of compliance or failed performance of duty can all by itself destroy management and the group. No matter what the intention of those at the top, no matter how bright or honest they may be, if their administrative lines are clumsy or in any way false, if they are not backed up by skillful, well-taught administrators, they can be nullified. The plans and orders put \"on the lines\" seldom if ever arrive at the level of the worker in the shop or the man in the street. The torrents of laws and directives passed by legislators or even boards of directors are 90% of them made necessary by earlier failures in getting earlier laws or directives en-forced. Bad administration, lack of know-how, lack of trained clerks and executives, can de-feat utterly any plan or program no matter how urgent or beneficial.

Let us take an example like starting a car. There is a right way to do this. You see if it has gasoline, you see that it's out of gear and that the brake is on. You turn on the ignition key and make the starter make contact. You feed it some gas and it starts. Now if one varied the sequence or did something else, the car wouldn't start. Then one pushes it or finds a hill. It still doesn't start so a mechanic is sent for. The bulk of the time, the mechanic finds no gas or failure to turn on the ignition. There are an infinity of ways not to start a car. There is only one way to start a car. So it is with any standard procedure. There is a way to do something right. The right ways to do things are called Technical Procedures or Tech when it comes to auditing or scientific or mechanical processes. There is a Tech of Admin. This would be the right ways to do administrative actions or organize something. Administration is the subject of how to organize or establish or correct the spaces, terminals, flows, line duties, equipment, materiel, and so forth of a production group so as to establish optimum volume, quality and viability. Activities, organizations, companies, governments and even Man's civilization depend upon having the Tech of Admin and the knowledge and Application of it. This general subject is known as Administration or Admin for short. There are correct ways to do things in Admin. For each correct procedure there can be an infinity of incorrect actions. To be a good executive or staff member, one has to know the right way something is done and to be able to apply and get done what he knows and be able to correct outnesses so they go back to the correct procedures. Because of the great number of separate actions that go to make up a large activity, the subject looks complex unless one learns to look at one procedure at a time and fit it into other procedures."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"STANDARD ADMIN 2 HCO PL 4.6.71 EFFICIENCY COURSE 22 17.11.12 The subject of admin only appears difficult because those involved in it seldom learn the correct procedures. Instead they do other odd things that, taken as a whole, give a thor-oughly confused scene. The test of any body of procedures is whether or not they will, when done, result in a smooth-running organization which produces final valuable products in volume that have acceptable quality and maintain the organization's survival. Our admin passes this test. When used exactly by the book and applied and corrected back to the book, they will produce high volume, quality and viability. This has been tested over and over. By the book = prosperity. Offbeat use or ignorance or nonapplication = collapse. By just getting \"on-policy\" (knowing and using the procedures with no departures) an org has leaped from long-enduring poverty to high success. Then run by those ignorant of policy, it has in turn collapsed to the degree it went \"off-policy.\" A continent has boomed when \"on-policy,\" has decayed when it went \"off-policy.\" This fact has been seen over and over and over again. \"On-policy\" (knowing and ap-plying our procedures) has been the common denominator of each boom. \"Off-policy\" (not knowing, not applying our procedures) has been the common denominator of every org or continental area collapse. There are enormous numbers of witnesses to this and it is backed up by mountains of statistics. Standard Admin means the usual \"on-policy\" procedure applied. \"Squirrel admin\" means the departure or alteration of standard admin. The use of the word \"squirrel\" is long standing because squirrels in their little cages go 'round and 'round and get nowhere and they are also, a bad pun, \"nutty,\" meaning a bit crazy. The source of Standard Admin is an HCO Policy Letter. The main source of \"squirrel admin\" is simply ignorance of PL procedure or the ne-glect of reading and applying it-as simple as that. So if an org's staff, ignorant or neglectful of policy and failing to apply it, is creating a mad scene daily, just realize they are trying to start a car by welding the trunk shut or polish-ing the tires! The answer is invariably and always, find the policy, apply it and force out the \"off-policy\" actions, and coolness and prosperity will reign. So this is a simple subject. Complicated only by the inability of people to confront and do the actions called for by policy. Following policy is better all around as it is an area of agreement. New procedures can be developed, tested, piloted, used. But until they become policy they can drive an area mad. So there is a right way to do it. And that is the way it should be done. And so doing it \"on-policy\" will result in prosperity."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"STANDARD ADMIN 3 HCO PL 4.6.71 EFFICIENCY COURSE 23 17.11.12 If one is not able to accept this fact, then one will not be able to run an activity pros-perously.

Org Series 46 Exec Series 23 ORGANIZATION AND SURVIVAL Well organized activities survive. The survival of individuals in those organizations depends on the highly organized condition of the activity. A small group, extremely well organized, has excellent chances of survival. Even a large group, badly organized, hasn't a prayer. The essence of organization is org boarding, posting with reality and, in keeping with the duties being performed, training and hatting. To this has to be added the actual performance of the duties so that the activity is pro-ductive. The outward signs of a badly organized group is slovenliness and fumbles. Another ingredient that goes hand in hand with organization and survival is toughness. The ability to stand up to and con-front and handle whatever comes the way of the organiza-tion depends utterly on the ability of the individuals of the organization to stand up to, con-front and handle what comes the individual's way. The composite whole of this ability makes a tough organization. An individual who is not properly posted, isn't performing the duties of the post, is not trained or hatted is soft. He has no Position to hold, therefore he goes down at the first fan of a feather. Confidence in one's teammates is another factor in organization survival. Confidence in one's self is something that has to be earned. It is respect. This is a compound of demon-strated competence, being on post and being dependable. After an individual has failed, confidence in him on the part of his teammates sinks. He has lost face and is not respected. This, then, shows itself up in numerous ways. It is up to that individual to earn back confidence so that his teammates will again trust him. The way to"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"ORGANIZATION AND SURVIVAL 2 HCO PL 11.9.80 II EFFICIENCY COURSE 26 17.11.12 do this is to get properly org boarded, trained, hatted and to confront and handle, with compe-tence, whatever that post is supposed to control. The ultimate in no confidence by a group in a team member is no post at all. Reports from those who have no post or from those who are between posts stress the horrors of having no post. Our survival depends fully on becoming entirely and completely organized. This will happen to the degree that every separate unit, department and division in an org is properly org boarded, properly performing the duties of the post, is trained and fully hatted. L.

We have all the data necessary to make orgs boom. Therefore we find that when they don't, these faults must be present: 1. Completely unreal analysis of what needs to be done to make things really go. 2. Cross orders-juniors setting other targets across vital targets. 3. Non-compliance with vital target accomplishment. 4. False reports on actions or false data concerning targets. 5. Failure to doggedly follow through on one action and get it done fully and completely. 6. Distractions leading to any of the above. MAJOR TARGET The desirable overall purpose being undertaken. This is highly generalized, such as \"To become an auditor\". VITAL TARGET By definition a Vital Target is something that must be done to operate at all. Man's worst difficulty is his inability to tell the important from the unimportant. \"Every target is the same as every other target\" is part of A=A=A. It takes good sense to be able to survey an area and find out 1. What must be done. 2. What shouldn't be done. 3. What is only desirable to be done. 4. What is trivial."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"OT ORGS 2 HCO PL 14.1.69 EFFICIENCY COURSE 28 17.11.12 As Man all too easily specializes in stops he tends to stress what SHOULDN'T be done. While this enters into it, remember that it's a STOP. Stops all occur because of failed purposes. Behind every stop there is a failed purpose. A stuck picture or a motionless org are similar. Each has behind it a failed purpose. There is a law about this-all you have to do to restore life and action is to rekindle the failed purpose. The stops will at once blow. That law (it comes out of OT VIII materials) is so powerful it would practically revive the dead! It applies to orgs. It applies to cities or nations. When you diverge from a constructive purpose to \"stop attacks\", the purpose has been abandoned. You get a stop. The real way to stop attacks is to widen one's zone of responsibil-ity. And pour the coal on the purpose. Thus all attacks one makes should be in the direction of enlarging one's scope and augmenting basic purpose. Thus, in the case of Scientology orgs one should attack with the end in view of taking over the whole field of Mental Healing. If our purpose was this then it had to be this on all dynamics. We only got into trouble by failing to take responsibility for the whole field! We'll win back by reasserting that responsibility and making it good. Targets, to that degree, are purposes. Purposes must be executed. They are something to do. OT Let us look at the definition of OT-cause over Thought Life Form Matter Energy Space and Time. As one falls away from that one becomes a spectator, then one becomes an effect. Then one is gone. One causes things by action. Not by thinking dim thoughts. One can be doing an IN basket as simply a spectator. In the society today spectatorism is very common. Magazine writers, reporters write weird pieces that look at how odd things are. The writer doesn't understand them at all. He just watches them. Spectatorism is not so low as total effect. The total effect-no cause-person has mainly a case. He doesn't even look."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"OT ORGS 3 HCO PL 14.1.69 EFFICIENCY COURSE 29 17.11.12 Thus there is a gradient scale of OT. It's not an absolute. One is as OT as he can cause things. One of the things to cause is target attainment. When somebody can push through a target to completion he's to that degree OT. People who don't push targets are either just spectators or they are total effect. ORG STATE An Org is somewhere on the OT scale. Any org is. Of any kind. An org can figure out the vital targets and push them through to completion or it can't. It's a gradient scale. An org succeeds or fails to the degree its individual executives and staff members can measure up to the OT formula: Cause. Scientology orgs must become cause over their environments. They do this by each executive and each staff member accomplishing targets, small and large. Thus: (a) if the targets of what must be done to operate at all are set and (b) are carried out with no non-compliance and (c) if no false reports are entered into it, Then That org is way high on the OT scale And it will conquer its entire environment complete. That's really all there is to it. One way to fail at it is do (a) with things that are so general that they invite no doing-ness. Some guys are so bad off they set targets like \"Move the Mountain\" and give one and all a big failure. Since there's no way to do it and probably no reason to either, that's an SP target. So what MUST be done means just that. What is vital and necessary. Not what is sim-ply a good idea. Here's some must targets as examples: A. Get Tech delivered 100% in the org itself. B. Get the public aware of its being delivered and wanting it. C. Get the admin machinery in to get the public in and out. Or another series:"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"OT ORGS 4 HCO PL 14.1.69 EFFICIENCY COURSE 30 17.11.12 D. Get 10,000 trained auditors into the org field. E.

Get all Accounts staff and Executives checked out on Finance Policy. I. Shove the throttle down on promotion. J. Deliver fantastic service. K. Get enough tech people in training to handle the flows. L. Find bigger poshier quarters to handle the flow when it rises. M. Get all staff onto the OEC to diminish flow line flubs. You get the idea. An exec who is just a spectator to his In basket flow is doing nothing but cultivating Dev-T. You can assess the situation. You can drive targets home to full completion. Every executive and every staff member is somewhere on the OT Scale. And he can rise higher just by setting up the targets and plowing them through to done, done, done. Yes, it requires ideas. But ideas come from interested looking and sizing it all up be-fore you set the target in the first place. You can even raise an org by gradients so as not to overwhelm it. Set and make small targets. Then bigger and bigger ones. Well, you get the idea. It's the Org's road to OT. L.

This is not just executives nor \"bad staff.\" It tends to be rather prevalent in our modern culture. The basic question really is \"Why can't you do what you are supposed to be doing?\" An Esto will find many people \"busy,\" but really not doing their post hat. As the Esto's own stat depends on people actually doing their jobs, and as the pay and well-being of those people also depend on it, it amounts to quite a problem. You can do a Product Rundown to cognitions. But then in some cases nothing hap-pens. You hat and still nothing happens. ABERRATION To understand this you have to understand \"aberration.\" Get the idea of a being doing wholly what he is doing. You get this: A. It is a straight line of attention. Now get the idea of somebody \"doing a job that is not doing what he is doing.\""},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"DOING WORK 2 HCO PL 3.4.72 EFFICIENCY COURSE 32 17.11.12 We get B. This is aberration. Which means \"not in a straight line.\" So in example A, the person does what he is doing. In example B, he is doing but he is not doing what he is doing mentally. Mentally he is doing something else while he is doing what he seems to be doing. SCHIZOPHRENIA The most prevalent \"mental disorder\" is supposed to be schizophrenia. This means \"SCISSORS\" or 2 plus \"head.\" A two-head in other words. And in this case two heads are not better than one (joke). You see this in institutions. A person is changing valences (personalities) click-click-click, one to the next. But the condition is a gradient one that worsens between sanity and the bottom of the scale. Midway, the condition is common but almost never noticed. It is so common today that it passes as normal humanoid. The person is not doing what he is doing. Examples of this are-people who do not like a job with responsibility because they \"like to do mechanical things so they can dream of something else while working\"; persons who \"have to do something else before they can ________\"; persons who are out of area; per-sons who continually make dev-t. There is also the person who rams sideways into the work of others with \"mistakes,\" \"demands,\" and prevents them from doing what they are doing while himself not doing what he is doing. One can't say these people are crazy. Not today. But one can say they make problems which are very difficult unless you know how to unlock the riddle."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"DOING WORK 3 HCO PL 3.4.72 EFFICIENCY COURSE 33 17.11.12 BARRIERS Study Series No. 2 HCOB 2 June 1971 Issue I \"Confronting\" and the drills given in the Esto tape series can push their way through an astonishing mass of barriers. For this is what the condition is-an effort to get through barriers. The reason example B above occurs is that the person's attention is misdirected by mental barriers each time he tries to do A above. Yet only if he can do A will he have any self-determinism and power. It does not mean he is crazy. It means he is incapable of directing his attention straight. Each time he does, he hits something that deflects it (sends it off at an angle). All this will seem very reasonable to him because it is the way it has always been. And like the little girl who never knew she had had a headache from the time of birth, and only knew it when it quit suddenly, such a person does not realize he cannot control his attention. Such think about lots of other things while apparently thinking about what they are do-ing. And they do lots of other things. MISUNDERSTOODS Misunderstood words prevent them being in communication with materials or others. Thus they do not read or listen. They maunder (which means wander about mentally). This is the inflow side of it. The outflow side are barriers of odd fears and peculiar ideas. Such people appear rather weak and dispersed. Or too heavy and stubborn to make up for it. They have fixed ideas and other outpoints because their thoughts detour instead of running along a highway. HAPPINESS To get someone to actually do what he is doing when he is doing it will sound cruel to some people. That's because they find it painful to confront and would rather withdraw and maunder, sort of self-audit themselves through life. They are not happy. Happiness comes from self- determinism, production, and pride. Happiness is power and power is being able to do what one is doing when one is doing it."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"DOING WORK 4 HCO PL 3.4.72 EFFICIENCY COURSE 34 17.11.12 COMPETENCE When a person is competent, nothing can shake his pride. The world can yell. But it doesn't shake him. Competence is not a question of one being being more clever than another. It is one being being more able to do what he is doing than another is. Example A is competence. Example B is incompetence. MORE THERE You could say a competent person was \"more there.\" But this is really \"more able to put his attention on what he has his attention on.\" WHY Anyone who is not a fireball on his post could be described by this Why: Unable to do his post for an individual Why for each person. Thus there are two ready remedies an Esto can use. 1. He can find the Why a person cannot do his post and then handle it. 2. He can do Esto drills on the person. In finding the Why the observation itself that his stats are low may find the person a bit defensive. It just could be that he does do what he is doing. But if so his stats would be high and he would be moving fast. Thus one has to find his personal Why. If it is the right one he should have very good indicators and speed up and do his job. If it is not quite the right one he may feel degraded or ashamed. The test of any right Why is does it raise the existing scene toward the ideal with ex-isting resources. Thus you can get a Why that is not wholly acceptable until handled. But if you really are spot on it should blow a lot of the barriers. Thus a real Why blows a lot of the barriers, when handled, between the being and his job. The drills then push it on through. The drills sometimes blow through the Why. The Why sometimes blows right through any need of drills."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"DOING WORK 5 HCO PL 3.4.72 EFFICIENCY COURSE 35 17.11.12 So these two actions interact. If you see someone feeling very guilty after the Why \"is found,\" better check it over. It could be a wrong Why and in this case, just find a new one. THIRD ACTION The Primary Rundown, HCOB 30 Mar 72. should be done on a staff member thor-oughly. Otherwise he will remain to some degree out of comm. He will not be able to take in data quickly if he cannot communicate with words. PROCESSING Of course processing removes all the barriers eventually. But it is not necessarily aimed at doing a job. Ability potential is enormously increased by processing. But traditionally we do not rely on processing to handle staff. We handle people and we handle cases. But auditors and staff members, simply because we do handle people and cases, must not have cases on post. We do not admit that they have cases. This raises necessity level. And it is quite amazing how high that necessity level can be raised and how a person can function despite his case. If we admitted that staff had cases we couldn't handle public cases. It's that simple. So an Esto does not advise or use auditing on staff members as a post remedy nor ac-cept case as a Why. Of course \"case\" is a Why. But when you accept it you retreat from example A above and at once get a B. You will be amazed how a person can begin to do what he is doing by finding his Why and doing drills. And of course you also have to handle the fellows who jam in from the side at every turn and disperse the staff member's attention. He too (and especially) isn't doing what he is doing. The same procedure (Why and drills) handles him as well. ____________ In sum, if a staff member isn't doing what he is doing he is doing something else. They never do nothing."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"DOING WORK 6 HCO PL 3.4.72 EFFICIENCY COURSE 36 17.11.12 Ask \"What is the reason you do not fully do your post?\" or any such version. Find the real Why. And handle the person. That's the major part of an Esto's job. And don't be surprised if you get a cheerful \"but I am!\" And find he is. But his stats and speed tell the whole story. L.

Taken from the fact that in many professions such as railroading the type of hat worn is the badge of the job. Organization consists of certain people doing certain jobs. Disorganization consists of each person wearing all hats regardless of assignment. In a smooth organization that runs well and succeeds each person wears his own as-signed hat. When a person has a job that belongs to another hat than his own, he passes the job to the other hat. Each staff member is a specialist. He specializes in his own hat. When people wear only their own hats then one has terminals in the org. If terminals exist then communication can flow correctly. If communication can flow correctly then work gets done and the org can get in income. Terminal – a point that receives, relays and sends communication. If people present each wear any old hat or all the hats, then no terminals exist, no communication can flow properly, work can't get done and there is no income. There is chaos and it is an unhappy place. In a green org staff members don't know what other staff members do. So they don't know where to send things so they do them themselves. Worse, they don't even know there is an org there. It is quite pathetic. Like rookie troops or militia or a mob. Of course the place goes broke. You can tell a good executive. He only hands out despatches and work to the correct hats. A lousy executive hands the work to anyone handy, regardless of title. He's in apathy and doesn't know there's an org there. The whole theory of successful organization is to have posts that only do specific things, to have sections and departments and divisions which specialize, and to have people who only wear their own hats and know who is wearing the other hats and send their work to them. A train crew has a Conductor. He wears a Conductor's hat. It has an engineer. He wears the engineer's hat. It has a fireman. He wears the fireman's hat. Where do you think the train would get to if each of these three didn't know who were the other two? The Conductor wearing the engineer's hat would mean no fares. The fireman wearing the Conductor's hat"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"HATS, THE REASON FOR 2 HCO PL 1.7.65 III EFFICIENCY COURSE 40 17.11.12 would mean no steam. And the engineer wearing the Conductor's hat would mean no train going anywhere. So beware of wearing other hats than your own, or of being ignorant of what other hats are being worn. For nobody will get anywhere and you'll find yourself overworked, dis-mayed and unhappy. Each person to his own job and damn the fellow who tries to give you things which aren't your hat and doesn't know there's an org there. Realize that the basic theory of organization is this: 1. So long as each knows and wears and works at his own hat only, things will be smooth. 2. And so long as each person knows what the other hats around him do, he can give them their work when it comes his way and all will be successful and smooth. If you let somebody steal your hat (do your work for you that you are supposed to do) that person will soon have you in trouble or have your job so snarled it can't be done. If you don't know who in the org is supposed to do what and make them do their own jobs when those drift your way, you'll be overworked like mad. If somebody tries to get you to do something that isn't your job on the org board then file an ethics chit for job endangerment. For at the very least that person is reducing in-come by not knowing the lines and posts of the org. When you are assigned an additional duty, make sure it is also properly in your de-partment or division or you'll be messed up. Don't permit people to mess up hats around you or you will be in chaos. Only organization can make your job smooth. And wearing your hat and doing your own job and knowing and making other people wear only theirs and do their own job, is the total secret of organization.

Remimeo (Corrections in this type style.) Study Series 2 CONFRONTING The first requisite of any subject is the ability to confront the various components (things) (parts) (divisions) of the subject itself. All misunderstoods, confusions, omissions, alterations of a subject begin with failures or unwillingness to confront. The difference between a good pilot and a bad pilot depends of course on consistent study and practice, but underlying this, determining whether the person will study and prac-tice, is the ability to confront the components of study and airplanes. A \"quick study\", by which is meant a student who learns rapidly or a person who grasps a subject quickly, has a high ability to confront that subject. In a dramatic profession, the wild animal trainer who could confront wild animals re-mained alive. The one who couldn't confront was too slow of perception to live long. In a more common line of work, the fast typist could confront study and typing in the first place and the slow typist couldn't and can't. The confusions about \"talent\" and \"native ability\" and such are resolved to no small extent when one recognizes the role played by the ability to confront. Basically, if one can just be there with it, he can then achieve the skill of communicat-ing with whatever \"it\" is and handling it. Thus, before communicating with the components of a subject can properly begin, one must be able to be there comfortably with the components of the subject. All power depends upon the ability to hold a location. To communicate one must be able to hold to a location. This is even true in the physical universe. You can't move a chair unless you can hold a position yourself near the chair. If you don't believe it, try it."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CONFRONTING 2 HCOB 2.6.71 I EFFICIENCY COURSE 42 17.11.12 Thus the ability to communicate with precedes the ability to handle. But before one can communicate with something one must be able to be in a location near it. The age-old puzzle of how some scholars can get \"A\" on a subject they have studied and then not be able to apply even a scrap of the data is resolved by this fact of confronting. They can confront the book, the class and the thought. But they haven't attained the ability to confront the physical objects of the subject. At least such \"glib\" students can confront the book, the paper, the thought. They are partway there. Now all they need to do is confront as well the physical things to which the subject is applied and they would be able to apply what they know. Some people are not so lucky as to be \"glib\" students. They have to work up to \"being there\" with the book, paper, classroom and teacher. Thus \"confronting\" is actually the ability to be there comfortably and perceive. Amazing reactions occur when conscious effort is made to do this. Dullness, percep-tion trouble, fogginess, sleep and even pains, emotions and convulsions can occur when one knowingly sets out to be there and comfortably perceive with the various parts of a subject. These reactions discharge and vanish as one perseveres (continues) and at last, some-times soon, sometimes after a long while, one can be there and perceive the component. As one is able to confront one part he then finds it easier to confront other compo-nents. People have mental tricks they use to get around actual confronting—to be disinter-ested, to realize it's not important, to be sort of half dead, etc—but these discharge (run out) as well eventually and at last they can just be there and comfortably perceive. Eye blinks, swallows, twitches, aches, pains, are all systems of interrupting confront-ing and are the symptoms of discomfort. There are many of these. If they are present then one is not just being there and perceiving. Confronting on a via (using a relay point) is another method of ducking out of it. The worst off cannot even tolerate the idea of being there and perceiving anything. They run away, even go into emotional fits rather than be there and perceive. Such people's lives are a system of interruptions and vias, all substitutes for confronting. They are not very successful. For success in life depends not on running away from it but by being there and perceiving it and then being able to communicate with it and handle it. TERMS \"A gradient scale\" means a gradual increasing condition of, or a little more of, little by little."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"CONFRONTING 3 HCOB 2.6.71 I EFFICIENCY COURSE 43 17.11.12 A \"skipped gradient\" means taking on a higher degree or amount before a lesser de-gree of it has been handled.

Because some people cannot conceive of causing anything they just watch it. They don't do anything. They are not participants. They are spectators. You see this in magazines. Hee hee hee articles about how odd this is or that is. No understanding of it. It's just odd and one watches it in a detached sort of way. Below this is somebody who doesn't even notice. Such a person has to come up scale just to be a spectator. An unfinished cycle of action comes about because (a) The importance of it is not grasped. (b) The cycle itself is not fully understood. (c) Non-compliance and false reports are given as a method of self-protection wherein are hopes it will not be noticed. What we need are more participants, more team mates.

Groups never seem to realize that their hard times are brought on by failures in re-sponsibility and sharing the load. In fact all slavery is the consequence of irresponsibility and failure to do one's Job. There is ample reward in the satisfaction of doing one's Job and being part of a self re-specting group. Riches and power spring from that base. Until one at least gets up to the level of a self respecting group with high Standards one can look forward only to poverty and hard times. One has an Org to the degree he or she contributes to its perfection by showing initia-tive and handling what comes up. Individual Initiative, not orders make a true group. Start adding your Job up to maximum on it and show initiative. Anyone showing ini-tiative is liable to get into an occasional argument. The willingness to accept that too is all part of initiative. One can't be totally safe in this universe. But one can at least be effective! It's your world, your Scientology and your Org too you know. L.

This of course is a rather savage and brutal datum for it thrusts aside all justification, reasonableness, excuses and even does not take into account the size or obstacles of the oppo-sition. But please note that the datum is not \"are things all right around him\" as this is a pas-sive test and could mean only that he was simply sitting still. Whether things are currently all right or not is beside the point. The thetan who is making things go right may be tackling a mountain of confusion and of course things are not all right because what he is attacking is mainly wrong. It is whether or not he is making things go right in spite of \"hell or high water\" that is the test. Many beings live lives of quiet correctness without ever once making anything do anything. Things around them just happen to be orderly. The social system props them up. But someday – bang – the society gets into a turmoil which knocks out the props. then we see that there were too few present who could make things go right and that is the end of the so-ciety. Thus died all old civilizations. Their people lived in a system correctness and things went right only so long as nothing was going wrong. Then one day things go wrong. These sophisticated but weak beings never were able to MAKE things go right and so the whole society collapses. One might also ask, \"What is meant by right?\" This would be forwarding a purpose not destructive to the majority of the dynamics. ____________________ Aberration is by definition \"a crooked line\". It is from the Latin aberratio, \"a wander-ing from\" and from the Latin errare, to wander or to err. A sane person thinks, looks and sees in straight lines. Black is black, white is white. The aberrated person looks toward black and wanders off in his gaze to something else and makes the error of saying it is \"grey\"."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE SUPREME TEST 2 19.8.67 EFFICIENCY COURSE 52 17.11.12 You can consider aberration in a passive way (supinely, of no force or action). A per-son is sane or not sane. He thinks straight or crookedly. Now consider aberration in a forceful way. A person looks, then an opposing force to him pushes aside his gaze or distracts it. But the really sane, forceful person looks right on through and past the opposition and sees what is there anyway. Let us take real action. Mr. Q rolls a ball from A toward B. En route Opposition X pushes the ball aside toward C. Mr. Q then shoves the ball toward C and says the reason he did not arrive properly at B was because... Mr. S rolls a ball from A toward B. Opposition X diverts the ball toward C. Mr. S pulls the ball back into line and despite, over and through Opposition X arrives at B anyway. You can see that Mr. Q in the first example is willing to be aberrated or pushed aside or at least does not contest it enough. Mr. Q is aberrated. Mr. S on the other hand was not willing to be diverted and went right on to B. Mr. S is not aberrated. Now society, being mainly suppressive, observes that Mr. Q never has much commo-tion around him. True, he never arrives and gets nothing done, but he isn't noisy so he is \"okay\". Mr. S on the other hand makes an awful row and bashes Opposition X on the head and snarls his way onward toward B. Society says he is a bad fellow because he has fusses. Of course he also gets something done. But in a decadent society men are measured by how pleasant they are, not how effective they are, so Mr. S is regarded as a bit \"mad\". YET when trouble comes it is only the Mr. Ss who will save the day while the Mr. Qs all give up and die. There is another point here, however. That is purpose. The difference between one thetan's forward thrust and another's is purpose, validity of. A madman can also go from A toward B relentlessly where B is a totally undesirable and destructive point. But in actual practice, real madmen never really arrive at the B they wanted to arrive at. A madman only goes toward but never really arrives. So he only makes everything go wrong. B must be a desirable point not destructive to a majority of the dynamics for rightness to occur. So there is the savage and bare datum: The supreme test of a thetan is the ability to make things go right. People who explain how wrong it is all going and who have reasons why and who AREN'T PUTTING IT RIGHT are the real crazy people in the universe. The only ones cra-zier than they are are the ones who are quite happy to have everything fail and go wrong with no protest from them. And the only ones even worse are those who work endlessly to make things go wrong and prevent anything from going right and oppose all efforts instinctively. Fortunately there are a few around who do make things go right in spite of everything and anyone."},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"THE SUPREME TEST 3 19.8.67 EFFICIENCY COURSE 53 17.11.12 L.

These new OT levels and others to follow will advance a thetan to levels he hasn't even imagined for eons. And hear this! In order to help you along the road to OT, I'm going to release the fol-lowing OT data that you can use to pull up your theta bootstraps and get along up the road. These are OT maxims! Know them well!! The power (defined as light-year-kilo-tons1 per microsecond) of a thetan is meas-ured by nothing else then the distance (defined as spherical spatial lengths) around him in his environment that he can control. And that is the power of a thetan; the totality of it, believe it or not. When a thetan exerts this power uncleverly, he brings about destruction. And thus you get Fascist State that destroy itself. It's got the control but not good sense. And so that is where good sense and judgement enter in. When good sense and good judgement are not added into control, control gets a bad name. And that is where you get the idea that people shouldn't control. A way to improve your control or another's is to do it on a gradient. If a thetan is having trouble controlling things, get him to control things on a gradient and he'll snap right out of it.

A professional is not an audience, and when he views things, he looks for what's good in them and neglects the poor, low-grade things. The reason he does this is so he has an ideal scene. Without an ideal scene, he just operates off technical data and produces, artwise, a low quality product and isn't a professional. Without an ideal scene, he can never get a preconception of the shot. In viewing things that approach an ideal scene, the true professional works out how they did it and when presented with similar tasks of production, can bring off things which approach an ideal scene in his own work. Another thing that separates a member of the audience from a professional is that the professional only thinks in terms of getting out an actual product. It never enters his head that he's just there for the ride or that being an \"expert\" is enough. A member of the audience has no faintest concept or idea of getting out a product. A professional knows the rules of the game as a matter of course so that he can achieve in the upper strata above that, a high quality of art. When a person simply looks at everything as to whether he \"likes them\" or \"not likes them,\" he's just an audience and he's on the wrong side of the footlights. This applies to a writer, a director, an actor, a cameraman, a makeup man. a propsman, a wardrobe man, a producer, an artist, any professional. Without this viewpoint, he never accumulates ideal scenes, so how could he produce anything good? He never has a memory library to compare his own products to. Be a professional. L.

And it should be very well known to executives. There are two triangles, over which the S is imposed. The S simply stands for Scientology which is derived from \"SCIO\" (knowing in the fullest sense). The lower triangle is the A-R-C triangle – its points being Affinity, Reality and Communication. These are the three elements which combined give Understanding. The upper triangle is particularly applicative to an executive but applies to all Scien-tologists. It has not been widely known. It is the K-R-C triangle. The points are K for Knowledge, R for Responsibility and C for Control. It is difficult to be responsible for something or control something unless you have Knowledge of it. It is folly to try to control something or even know something without Responsibility. It is hard to fully know something or be responsible for something over which you have no Control, otherwise the result can be an overwhelm. A being can of course run away from life (blow) and go sit on the backside of the moon and do nothing and think nothing. In which case he would need to know nothing, be responsible for nothing and control nothing. He would also be unhappy and he definitely would be dead so far as himself and all else was concerned. But, as you can't kill a thetan, the state is impossible to maintain and the road back can be gruesome. The route up from death or apathy or inaction is to Know something about it, take some Responsibility for the state one is in and the scene, and Control oneself to a point where some control is put into the scene to make it go right. Then Know why it went wrong, take Responsibility for it, and Control it enough to make it go more toward an ideal scene. Little by little one can make anything go right by Increasing Knowledge on all dynamics"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"THE TOP TRIANGLE 2 HCO PL 18.2.72 EFFICIENCY COURSE 62 17.11.12 Increasing Responsibility on all dynamics Increasing Control on all dynamics. If one sorts out any situation one finds oneself in on this basis, he will generally suc-ceed. Field Marshal Montgomery was supposed to have said that leadership was composed of \"knowledge, will power, initiative and courage.\" These are assumed qualities in a man. This was good advice but offered no road out or no avenue of increase in capability. The KRC triangle acts like the ARC triangle. When one corner is increased the other two also rise. Most thetans have a dreadfully bad opinion of their capabilities compared to what they actually are. Hardly any thetan believes himself capable of what he is really capable of ac-complishing. By inching up each corner of the KRC triangle bit by bit, ignoring the losses and mak-ing the wins firm, a being at length discovers his power and command of life. The second triangle of the symbol of Scientology is well worth knowing. It interacts best when used with high ARC. Thus the triangles interlock. It is for use as well as all of Scientology. L.
