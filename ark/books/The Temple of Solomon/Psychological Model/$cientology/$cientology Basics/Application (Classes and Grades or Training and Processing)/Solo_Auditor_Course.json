Neglect of this Pol Ltr has caused great hardship on staffs, has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out Inter-national effort to restore basic Scientology over the world. Within 5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. “Quickie grades” entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this Policy Letter are High Crimes resulting in Comm Evs on administrators and executives. It is not “entirely a tech matter” as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a two-year slump. It is the business of every staff member to enforce it. ALL LEVELS KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING HCO Sec or Communicator Hat Check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on. We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technol-ogy. The only thing now is getting the technology applied. If you can’t get the technology applied then you can’t deliver what’s promised. It’s as simple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what’s promised. The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is “no results”. Trouble spots occur only where there are “no results”. Attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are “no results” or “bad results”. Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 2 HCO PL 7.2.65 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 2 06.02.10 So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists of: One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the “reasonable” attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too- bright have a bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront, good or bad, and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad. Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 3 HCO PL 7.2.65 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 3 06.02.10 In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide open for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to “eat crow”. On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable “technology”. By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as “unpopular”, “egotistical” and “undemocratic”. It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don’t see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable – only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact – the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called “new ideas” would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve – psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infini-tum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 4 06.02.10 So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it’s not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious “reasons” for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell – and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by “public opin-ion” media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don’t do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It’s the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It’s the Bank that says we must fail. So just don’t play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here’s an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that “It didn’t work.” Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn’t really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor “Process X didn’t work on Preclear C.” Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of “new technology” and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn’t jump down Auditor B’s throat, that’s all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor’s report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C’s TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 5 06.02.10 still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B’s own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B’s IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be “too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases”. All right, there’s an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: “That Process X didn’t work.” Instructor A: “What exactly did you do wrong?” Instant attack. “Where’s your audi-tor’s report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?” Then the Pc wouldn’t have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here’s an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student “because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!” Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. “Of course his model session is poor but it’s just a knack he has” is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he “overcompensated” nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at “set”. So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student “got such remarkable TA”. They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren’t quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 6 06.02.10 Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can’t get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He’s slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don’t wait until next week. By then he’s got other messes stuck to him. If you can’t graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they’ll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they’ll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be auditing. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse – never permit an “open-minded” approach. If they’re going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they’re aboard, and if they’re aboard, they’re here on the same terms as the rest of us – win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It’s a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive – and even they have a hard time. We’ll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don’t make students into good Scientologists and that lets eve-rybody down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she’ll win and we’ll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, “You’re here so you’re a Scientologist. Now we’re going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We’d rather have you dead than incapable.” Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 7 06.02.10 But we won’t have to bear it forever. The bigger we get the more economics and time we will have to do our job. And the only things which can prevent us from getting that big fast are areas in from One to Ten. Keep those in mind and we’ll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It’s our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of “unworkability”. They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We’re not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn’t cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance. Remember, this is our first chance to do so in all the endless trillions of years of the past. Don’t muff it now because it seems unpleasant or unsocial to do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten.

Reason: The effort to get students through courses and get pcs processed in orgs was considered best handled by reducing materials or deleting processes from grades. The pres-sure exerted to speed up student completions and auditing completions was mistakenly an-swered by just not delivering. The correct way to speed up a student’s progress is by using two way comm and ap-plying the study materials to students. The best way to really handle pcs is to ensure they make each level fully before going on to the next and repairing them when they do not. The puzzle of the decline of the entire Scientology network in the late 60s is entirely answered by the actions taken to shorten time in study and in processing by deleting materials and actions. Reinstituting full use and delivery of Dianetics and Scientology is the answer to any recovery. The product of an org is well taught students and thoroughly audited pcs.

I have now discovered that: A Misunderstood on any given subject can prevent the completion of a cycle of action related to that subject. Therefore those people who don’t complete cycles of action on certain subjects have a misunderstood word on them. This then results in no-product situations. Therefore when you are getting no product, look for the misunderstood word on the subject no matter how long and arduous it is. It’s there. And when it’s found the person can go on and complete a cycle of action and get a product. Caution: Make sure the person actually does have an inability to complete a cycle of action before you get into handling him. You don’t handle somebody who is completing cy-cles of action that result in production. MISUNDERSTOODS AND PERCEPTION Misunderstoods can also act as perception shut-offs. They can actually interrupt a per-son’s perception."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MISUNDERSTOOD WORDS AND 2 HCOB 26.3.79RB CYCLES OF ACTION SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 12 06.02.10 It is quite astonishing that perceptions such as sight, sound and even touch can be shut off by Mis-U words. This opens the door to the fact that people apparently do not see, hear, notice or handle outnesses when they have Mis-Us on them. This also may open the door to people who have perceptic shut-offs, such as poor eye-sight, deafness or other perception difficulties. MISUNDERSTOODS AND COMPLEXITY Misunderstoods lead to complexity. People who have Mis-Us in an area are inclined to develop vast complexities. They can generate confusions and complexities beyond belief. People do this because, having misunderstoods, they do not confront and duplicate in the area and so get into a lot of think-think and unnecessary significance. Their ability to get things done in that area dwindles as a result. And at the bottom of all this is simply misunder-stood words. MISUNDERSTOODS AND TOTAL ORGANIZE When you see an area that is organizing only, you know that area is loaded with mis-understoods . When people have incomplete cycles due to Mis-Us they get bogged down into or-ganization. You can tell when people have Mis-Us – they are totally involved in organize, organ-ize, organize. They don’t know what they are doing. There is a level below this – they have overts and withholds which prevent even orga-nizing. Below that level people are PTS. Lacking a sense of organization actually lies below this. It is below the level of Mis-Us, overts and withholds and PTSness – and you’d have to go north through PTSness and overts and withholds to even get to the Mis-Us. MISUNDERSTOODS AND NO ORGANIZE There can also exist a condition where someone does not organize any corner of his area or work or organizations or lines. This manifests itself by irrational demands to only pro-duce and to prevent any organization so that production can occur. At the bottom of this you are very likely to find misunderstood words, particularly on the purpose of the production or why one is producing.

It indicates who has to be word cleared fast, at once, now, before duties go off the rails any further. B. It detects the area just before which there is a misunderstood word. A is useful to the administrator. Knowing it and knowing Word Clearing and being able to do it himself or get it done, he can avoid wholesale dismissals, frantic transfers, gen-eral inefficiency and organizational strain. B is very useful to the Word Clearer. Example of B. A person can do everything on an order except „File the Folders” which he insists on delivering to a wrong room. Look over the order and find where in it it talks about filing folders. Just above or beside that will be a misunderstood word. Locate it, get it identified, defined and used in sentences.

This is the critical band of the Gradation Chart. On Flag it was learned the hard way that you don’t do other major auditing actions be-tween these two points. Example: Action – Completed R6, Clear and OT I, then a Dianetic Completion was at-tempted. Result – failure. Right Action – Complete Dianetics before R6. Right Action – let it go until OT III well begun, then complete Dianetics. Example: Pre OT doing OT II. A new PTS RD is done. Failure. Right Action-do it be-fore R6 or after OT III. Example: R6 done. Drug RD given. Result. Poor. Right Action – Do Drug RD before R6. EXCEPTION It will be found that a pc cannot confront doing Solo Grades. The reason will be found to be Drugs. All pcs who “cannot run engrams” can run Drug Engrams. They are afraid be-cause they get into the bank heavily when on Drugs. Only Drugs can be run. So a pc who has “done R6 and Clearing Course but hasn’t made it” will be found to be a rabbiting (frightened and running away) druggie. He can and will run Drug Engrams. Thus the right action is to do a full Drug Rundown, then start the pc all over again at R6. It is an exception only because he hasn’t done his Solo anyway. REPAIRS Where a Pre OT hasn’t made the grade of a Solo level (or gets sick afterwards) a full repair must be done and the failed grade must be completed before he goes on up."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"NO-INTERFERENCE AERA 2 HCOB 23.12.71 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 26 06.02.10 It is possible to repair a Pre OT between R6 and OT III so long as you are not trying to handle his whole case but only repairing the grade he missed. TRs Never order TRs after Solo Materials study or before OT III is attested. TRs should be done before or during Solo Auditing study but not after materials are issued. And the TR Course may not be done from then on to OT III. A partially completed earlier TR Course found to be hanging up a pc on Solo Grades can be handled to completion and should be. This does not mean long additional hours of TR 0. It usually means word clearing on the TR materials and rehab. MAJOR ACTIONS It is a very losing game to throw a major rundown in between R6 and OT III. Such as L10 after Clearing and before OT I. The result is a mess. The way to recover such a blunder is to get the pc rehabbed or to a rest point and then finish up the Solo Grades to OT III attest and then complete the rundown. SET UP It is therefore very important that a pc be fully set up including Dianetics before he is let onto R6 Solo materials study. AUDITING SKILL None of this states that you cannot improve a pc’s auditing skill between R6 and OT III (excepting only TRs). Big wins are to be had by doing so. The major cause of failure on solo grades is the inability to audit. You can take a Pre OT who didn’t really make Clear or OT I and move him back to R6 study and retread him as an auditor and then let him move back up the line and he’ll win.

The pcs became ill or misemotional toward us. And just the day I write this (original writing 4 October 1965) I myself encountered a pc, very ill, who had had some original R6 data misused on her and did not suspect why her case and health had worsened. She was not ready for it at all. The issue earlier was a trial balloon, in a sense. I found certain persons (a small minor-ity) were not up to responsibility for the material of April 1964. Therefore our firm action will be that the moment we find the material of the Clearing Course or Advanced Course has escaped or been misused we will quickly trace the person who was insecure and cut off all further or any future Clearing or data issue to that person. The likelihood of independent discovery even with clues has proven to be non-existent by actual review of auditors trying to find pieces of it when they had over half of the answers already. You must realize that we suffer, all of us, from the misuse of knowledge concerning the mind at a very early period. To place this data near such people as psychiatrists or even states places them in a position to enslave people or repeat the original action and cave people in. A very small minority, receiving incorrect data did promptly use it harmfully on others after April 1964. Until we ourselves have climbed well out of the hole, we must safeguard the materials. Our case gains depend on it. And others could make our salvage of people impossible. We do not safeguard these materials from any commercial consideration. Our futures, those of each of us and those of all Scientologists, depend on our keeping this material under lock and safeguarded from abuse until we are well away as a group and can handle things better as individuals as well as a group.

For instance the Solo Supervisor is not just responsible for the Solo Course. He is re-sponsible for ALL checkouts of all solo and Advance Courses including R6EW. When there is no In Charge for the whole line, Solo, R6EW, clear to VII on up there is no one to regulate and coordinate flow so it doesn’t flow. If there is no Solo Review Auditor then a patch up can only be done by sending the person to the HGC where an inevitable backlog bars the person off Solo for days, weeks or forever and kills all further course wins and sales. Review for a Solo student must be immedi-ate. It is of course charged for. The only way a Solo student gets off this one line is by be sent to Cramming. That should be a one day action at the most. If Mini Courses have to be taken by Solo students they are taken under the Solo Super. This doesn’t say that the Solo Course Supervisor cannot have persons for Admin and other Course Supers under him. As for Promo, when an AO begins to specialize in intensives, lower grades and Class IV actions they are taking business away from Class IV orgs and SHs and not wearing their own hat. Thus Solo Courses must be promoted. Nothing in this Policy Letter may be interpreted to mean that a Solo sign up can’t be audited on anything but fast reviews. It is totally possible that a person signed up for Solo R6EW may be found to need several intensives and be given them. As long as 1. The student IS signed up for Solo and 2. He is not shunted over into HGC backlog but is actual gotten into auditing with actual intensives being given in rapid succession like one or two 12½ hour in-tensives a week. If these conditions can’t be met the Solo line is justified in expanding its own review. All manner of irregularities can occur on Solo lines. Like giving a “10 day Solo Course” at R6 level and then letting the student who of course could never learn to audit in 10 days, fall flat on his head from there on out. The line up is given in C/S Series No. 5 and C/S Series No. 5 Addition. Solo Courses can and do produce the most fantastic wins and case gains. It is up to those entrusted with the activity to make it so. L.

For fifteen years we have always continued a session that found the pc in trouble and I myself have audited a pc for nine additional hours, all night long in fact, just to get the pc through. Newer auditors, not trained in the stern school of running engrams, must learn this all over again. It doesn’t matter whether the auditor has had a policy on this or not – one would think that common decency would be enough – as to leave a pc in the middle of a secondary or an engram and just coolly end the session is pretty cruel. Some do it because they are startled or afraid and „Rabbit” (run away by ending the session). Auditors who end a process or change it when it has turned on a heavy somatic are likewise ignorant. What turns it on will turn it off. This is the oldest rule in auditing. Of course people get into secondaries and engrams, go through misemotion and heavy somatics. This happens because things are running out. To end off a process or a session be-cause of the clock is to ignore the real purpose of auditing. The oldest rules we have are (a) Get the pc through it. (b) What turns it on will turn it off. (c) The way out is the way through. These now are expressed as policy. A falsified auditor’s report is also subject to a Court of Ethics.

This is because they have not understood what it is. Nearly all their auditing failures stem not from using wrong processes but from Q and A. Accordingly I have looked the matter over and re-defined Q and A. The origin of the term comes from „changing when the pc changes”. The basic answer to a question is, obviously, a question if one follows the duplication of the Comm formula completely. See Philadelphia Congress 1953 tapes where this was covered very fully. A later definition was „Questioning the pc’s Answer”. Another effort to overcome it and explain Q & A was the Anti-Q and A drill. But none of these reached home. The new definition is this: Q and A is a failure to complete a Cycle of Action on a preclear. A cycle of action is redefined as Start – Continue – Complete. Thus an auditing comm cycle is a cycle of action. It starts with the auditor asking a question the preclear can understand, getting the preclear to answer it and acknowledging that answer. A process cycle is selecting a process to be run on the preclear, running the Tone Arm action into it (if necessary) and running the Tone Arm action out of it. A programme cycle is selecting an action to be performed, performing that action and completing it. Thus you can see that an auditor who interrupts or changes an auditing comm cycle before it is complete is „Q and A-ing”. This could be done by violating or preventing or not doing any part of the auditing cycle, i.e., ask the pc a question, get an answer to a different idea, ask the different idea, thus abandoning the original question. An auditor who starts a process, just gets it going, gets a new idea because of pc cog-nition, takes up the cognition and abandons the original process is Q and A-ing. A programme such as „Prepcheck this pc’s family” is begun, and for any reason left incomplete to go chasing some new idea to Prepcheck, is a Q and A. Unfinished cycles of action are all that louse up cases."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Q AND A 2 HCOB 7.4.64 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 42 06.02.10 Since Time is a continuum, a failure to carry out a cycle of action (a continuum) hangs the pc up at that exact point. If you don’t believe it, prepcheck „Incomplete actions” on a pc! What Incomplete ac-tion has been suppressed? etc. cleaning the meter for real on every button. And you’d have a clear – or a pc that would behave that way on a meter. Understand this and you’ll be about ninety times as effective as an auditor. „Don’t Q and A!” means „Don’t leave cycles of action incomplete on a pc.” The gains you hope to achieve on a pc are lost when you Q and A.

When the term Q and A is used it means one did not get an answer to his question. It also means not getting compliance with an order but accepting something else. Example: Auditor: Do birds fly? Pc: I don’t like birds. Auditor: What don’t you like about birds? Flunk. It’s a Q and A. The right reply would be an answer to the question asked and the right action would be to get the original question answered. TR 4 (handling origins) can apply here. The moment TR 4 is violated (Ack and return the pc to original Question) and the original unanswered question is not again asked the Auditor just drifts along with the pc. Things get restimulated, nothing gets really handled or run. In Administration the same thing can happen. The executive gives an order, the junior says or does something else, the executive does not simply TR 4 it and get the original order done, and the result is chaos. Executive: Phone Mr. Schultz and tell him our printing order will be there this after-noon. Junior: I don’t know his number. Executive: Don’t you have a phone book? Junior: The phone company didn’t send one this year as our bill was overdue. Executive (the fool) goes to Accounts to see what about the phone bill. Mr. Schultz never gets his call. The printing order arrives but Mr. Schultz doesn’t know it .... Example: Executive: Do target 21 now. Junior: I don’t have any issue files. Executive: What happened to them? Junior: Mimeo goofed. Executive: I’ll go see Mimeo... DISPERSAL Q and A is simply Postulate Aberration. Aberration is non-straight line by definition."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE REASON FOR Q AND A 2 HCOB 5.12.73 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 44 06.02.10 A sick thetan who is all caved in can’t direct a postulate at anything. When he tries, he lets it wobble around and go elsewhere. The difference between a Degraded Being and an OT is simply that the DB can’t put out a postulate or intention in a direct line or way and make it hold good. The insane are a great example of this. They are insane because they have evil inten-tions. But they can’t even make these stick. They may intend to burn down the house but they usually wind up watering the rug or do some other non sequitur thing. It’s not that they don’t mess things up. The whole point here is that they can’t even properly destroy what they intend to destroy. Even their evil intentions wobble, poor things. But not all people who Q and A are insane. When a person is running at effect he Qs and As. He is confronted by life, he does not confront it. He is usually a bit blind to things as his ability to look AT is turned back on him by his lack of beam power. Thus he gives the appearance of being unaware. His emotional feeling is overwhelm. His mental state is confusion. He starts for B, winds up at – A. Other not too well intentioned people can play tricks on a Qer and Aer. When they don’t want to answer or comply they artfully bring about a Q and A. Example: Bosco does not want to staple the mimeo issue. He knows his senior Qs and As. So we get this. Senior: Staple that issue with the big stapler. Bosco: I hurt my thumb. Q and A Senior: Have you been to see the Medical Officer? Bosco: He wouldn’t look at it. Q and A Senior: I’ll go have a word with him. (Departs.) Bosco gets back to reading “Jesse James Rides Again” humming softly to himself. For HIS trouble is, he Qs and As with the MEST Universe! BODY Q AND A Some people Q and A with their bodies. The body is, after all, composed of MEST. It follows the laws of MEST. One of these laws is Newton’s first law of motion: Inertia. This is the tendency of a MEST object to remain motionless until acted upon by an exterior force. Or to continue in a line of motion until acted upon by an exterior force. Well, the main force around that is continually acting on a human body is a thetan, the being himself."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"THE REASON FOR Q AND A 3 HCOB 5.12.73 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 45 06.02.10 The body will remain at rest (since it is a MEST Object) until acted upon by the thetan that is supposed to be running it. If that being is an aberrated non-straight line being the body reacts on him more than he reacts on the body. Thus he remains motionless or very slow. When the body is in unwanted motion, the being does not deter the motion as the body is acting upon him far more than he is reacting on the body. As a result, one of the manifestations is Q and A. He wants to pick up a piece of paper. The body inertia has to be overcome to do so. So he does not reach for the paper, he just leaves the hand where it is. This would be no action at all. If he then weakly forces the mo-tion, he finds himself picking up something else like a paper clip, decides he wants that any-way and settles for it. Now he has to invent why he has a paper clip in his hand. His original intention never gets executed. Some people on medical lines are just there not because of actual illness but because they are just Qing and Aing with their body. People also Q and A with themselves. They want to stop drinking and can’t. They want to stop or change something about themselves or their body and then disperse off onto something else. Freud read all sorts of dire and awful things into simple Q and A. He invented inten-tions the person must have that made him “sublimate”. All Freud succeeded in doing was making the person introspective looking for wrong whys. The right why was simple – the person could not go in a straight line to an objective and/or could not cease to do something he was compulsively doing. The very word aberration contains the idea of this – no straight line but a bent one. The cure for this sort of thing (Q and A with a body) is objective processes. And a very willing and bright thetan CAN simply recognize it for what it is – not enough push! And instead of going to the MO for a slight ache, he just pushes on through. As the ache is a recoil of body Q and A in a lot of cases, the ache itself goes away as soon as one simply pushes through. Painters and artists buy the idea they are benefited by aberration. “Be glad you are neurotic” was a trick being played by the late and unlamented psychiatrists on artists. One paints because he can push into execution what he visualizes. The best painters were the least aberrated."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE REASON FOR Q AND A 4 HCOB 5.12.73 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 46 06.02.10 Greenwich Village or Left Bank artists, when they don’t paint, never suspect it’s be-cause they just can’t overcome hand inertia to push a paint brush! People live Q and A lives. They never become what they desire to be because they Q and A with life about it. Schopenhauer, the German philosopher of doom, even had a dirty crack about being able to do things: “Stubbornness is the will taking the place of the intellect.” By this, one is “intellectual” if he Qs and As.

In Scientologese it is often used to mean „undecisive”, not making up one’s mind. Q stands for „Question”. A stands for „Answer”. In „perfect duplication” the answer to a Question would be the Question. The real definition as it applies to TRs is „The Question proceeding from the last An-swer.” Example: Question: How are you? Answer: I’m fine. Question: How fine? Answer: My stomach hurts. Question: When did your stomach begin hurting? Answer: About four. Question: Where were you at four? etc. etc. The above example is a grievous auditing fault. As each question is based on the last answer, it is called „Q and A”. It could also be called „Q based on last A”. It never completes any cycle. It tangles pcs up. It violates TR 3. Don’t do it. I trust the above handles any confusion on this subject. L.

SOLO COGNITION’S In HCO B 26 April 1971 Issue I, the definitions and conditions in an audited session are described. The definition of In-Session also applies to Solo Auditing. If the solo auditor is so all-thumbs with his papers, meters, platens that they distract him from his own bank he is not likely to as-is or cognite. Recently, on Flag, we have taken failed IIIs and put them back through a full heavy re-train on R6EW and then pushed them back up the line with good success. When a solo auditor is also a rabbit (runs from everything including his bank) he has no chance to overcome it if he is all thumbs with his tools. Requiring arduous, perfect drills on Solo metering and auditing actions at R6EW level should occur before the pc sees any materials. He must first and foremost be a Solo Auditor, familiar with his meters and papers to such a degree that they do not in any way distract him. Only then can you add a bank to the scene. A poor solo auditor does not cognite as his attention is on the tools not his bank. Where the Solo auditor fails, he has not learned his tools. The remedy is to make him learn them. The bridge between II and III is sometimes a hard one. It may be that an HDC course is vital before the pre- can make this bridge. The Solo Auditor who „attests” rather than confront his bank probably never learned to use his auditing tools in the first place. Then, adding the bank as something to confront results in confusion. Cognition’s in Solo Auditing depend upon the ability to use the tools of auditing so well, they serve no distraction in Solo Session. L.

Thus even if the meter is properly calibrated and reads at 2.0 with a 5,000 ohm resistor across the leads and 3.0 with 12,500 ohms, by the end of the session a pc can be apparently reading below 2.0 because the meter is off trim. The following meter procedure is therefore to be followed at the end of each session (after giving “That’s it”): 1. Don’t move the trim knob 2. Pull out the jack plug 3. Move the TA until the needle is on “Set” at the sensitivity you were using in the session 4. Record the TA position at the bottom of the auditor’s report form as: “Trim check – TA = . . .” 5.

The setting is different for almost every pc. TOO LOW Too low a Sensitivity on some pcs (like Sens 5-32) will obscure reads and make them look like ticks. It will obscure an F/N. Whereas a Sens 16-128 will show reads and F/Ns. A pc can be hindered by the auditor not setting the Sensitivity high enough to show reads and F/Ns. Items are missed as well as F/Ns. TOO HIGH When auditing a flying pc or a Clear or OT the auditor who sets the Sensitivity too high gets weird impressions of the case. „Latent reads” on such a case are common. They aren’t latent at all. What happens is that the F/N is more than a dial wide at high Sensitivity and a started F/N looks like a read as its sweep is stopped by the pin on the right of the dial. In this way uncharged items are taken up, the case is slowed, overrun and general up-sets requiring repairs occur. On one hand electrode an OT VII sometimes has a ¾ dial wide F/N at Sens 5-32. This would mean a 3/4 dial F/N at Sens 2-32 with two cans. A Clear sometimes has a floating TA at Sens 32-32 instead of an F/N. He would have to be run at Sens 3-32 two cans to keep him on a dial or detect F/Ns. This is a very important matter as the auditor will miss F/Ns, think beginning F/Ns are reads and as the Pre-OT is off the dial, miss reads. Thus uncharged areas are run and charged ones are missed. The result is very chaotic to repair. Some lower level pcs also have a need for lower Sensitivity settings."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"SENSITIVITY ERRORS 2 HCOB 18.03.74 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 56 06.02.10 SUMMARY Sometimes an easy pc looks very difficult just because of wrong Sensitivity settings.

To train a student auditor how to get a pc to do an accurate can squeeze. III. To train a student auditor how to determine the sensitivity setting to get 1/3 of a dial drop of the needle on the can squeeze, for use in setting the correct sensitivity for each preclear in an auditing session. IV. To convince a student auditor that he has to use a correct sensitivity setting for 1/3 of a dial drop of the can squeeze to have a workable and readable E-Meter. POSITION: The coach and the student auditor sit facing each other across a table with an E-Meter facing the student auditor. The E-Meter is already set up. TRAINING STRESS: SECTION 1: To give the student auditor a reality on how a can squeeze can be done incor-rectly. so he will know all the points he may have to correct to ensure he gets an accurate can squeeze. 1. Coach picks up the cans and holds his hands on the table so the student can clearly see them."},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"E-METER DRILL 5A CAN SQUEEZE  2  HCOB  7.2.79R  SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 58 06.02.10 2. Coach has student set sensitivity booster knob to lowest position and the sensitivity at I on the sensitivity knob. 3. Coach has student adjust the needle to the set line on the needle dial. The coach will have the student readjust the needle to set as necessary at the begin-ning of each demonstration of the can squeeze. 4. The coach gives the cans a squeeze with an even pressure. If there is no read or a very small one, less than an inch, at sensitivity 1, the student auditor moves the sensitivity knob to 5, and gets another can squeeze. If still no read or it’s smaller than an inch, student moves sensitivity to 16 and gets another squeeze. For purposes of the follow-ing demonstration, you want to set the sensitivity so that you can obviously see a movement of the needle on the can squeeze of about an inch. So the sensitivity could be set lower than 5 or higher than 5, so long as you get a fall of about an inch on the squeeze. 5. With the sensitivity setting determined in 4 above, the coach will then squeeze the cans incorrectly, each time in a different way. The coach shows the student what par-ticular thing he’s doing with his hands, and then has the student observe what happens on the meter and the distance the needle falls on the dial when he does each version of an incorrect can squeeze as follows: A. Coach holds the cans with cups of palms and all fingers and both thumbs in com-plete contact with the cans. As he squeezes the cans, he lifts one finger off and then puts the finger back on after relaxing the squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. B. Coach holds the cans as in A. This time he gives the cans a very fast light squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. C. Coach holds the cans as in A, squeezes them with a gradual pressure and then when he releases the squeeze he relaxes his grip on the cans so it is much looser than before the can squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. D. Coach holds the cans as in A, and this time gives a hard fast squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. E. Coach holds the cans as in A, squeezes them firmly and only partially releases the squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. F. Coach holds the cans as in A, but gives a squeeze in 2 stages. first a little squeeze, then suddenly a harder one. This is an incorrect can squeeze. G. Coach holds the cans as in A, gives a hard fast squeeze, and holds the grip. The student should notice that the needle swings way over to the right due to the sud-den motion, and that it returns only part of the way with the coach still maintaining the squeeze, thus giving an incorrect measurement of the can squeeze. Student should see that the distance between the first needle position at set and the final needle position with the coach still maintaining the squeeze is the actual meas-urement of the can squeeze fall. It is not the distance between the first needle posi-"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"E-METER DRILL 5A CAN SQUEEZE  3  HCOB  7.2.79R  SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 59 06.02.10 tion of set and the needle position at the far swing to the right. A hard, fast can squeeze is an incorrect can squeeze. H. Coach holds the cans so they are not in contact with the cups of his palms and squeezes them. This is an incorrect can squeeze. I. Coach holds the cans with the thumbs going up the sides and sticking out over the top edge of the cans and squeezes them. This is an incorrect can squeeze. J. Coach holds the cans in a fairly tight grip and squeezes the cans. This is an incor-rect can squeeze. K. Coach holds the cans with the forefingers lifted slightly off and puts the forefin-gers on the cans during the squeeze. This is an incorrect can squeeze. The drill is continued until the student auditor gets the idea that an incorrect can squeeze gives inaccurate, unreliable needle reactions. SECTION II: To give the student auditor a proper idea as to what a correct can squeeze is, and to train him how to get a correct can squeeze. 1. The following drill should be done first by the coach to demonstrate to the student auditor what a correct can squeeze is: A. The coach has the student auditor shake his hands until the fingers are loose and floppy. B. Then the coach has the student auditor put his hands on the table, palms up, exert-ing no control on his fingers. The student auditor’s fingers will curl in toward the palm. C. Now the coach simply places the cans in the student auditor’s hands at an angle across the palms. The natural curl of the fingers is sufficient to hold the cans in place, and the placement of the cans at an angle ensures that the maximum skin area is touching the cans. The cups of the student auditor’s palms and all the fin-gers and both thumbs must be touching the cans. Ensure the thumbs go around the cans and not up the sides. D. Now the coach has the student auditor gradually increase the pressure of his grip on the cans until a light squeeze is achieved, and then relax it. This is a correct can squeeze. E. Note: Ensure when the student auditor relaxes his grip that he does not take a fin-ger or thumb or his palms off the cans. He should have about the same contact he had at the start as in C above. 2. Having done the above, the coach now has the student auditor do the drill as follows: A. Have the coach pick up the cans and keep his hands on the table so the student can see them throughout the can squeeze. B. Check the coach’s grip on the cans to ensure it is correct as in B and C above. The student may have to try out different sizes of cans, small, medium or large, de-"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"E-METER DRILL 5A CAN SQUEEZE  4  HCOB  7.2.79R  SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 60 06.02.10 pending on the size of the coach’s hands, to obtain the correct size can which he can hold comfortably without strain and that fits into the cup of his palm, with maximum skin contact. C. Adjust the sensitivity booster knob to the lowest position. D. (a) Set the sensitivity knob at 1 on the sensitivity dial. (b) Adjust the needle to the set line on the needle dial. (c) Give the proper commands for getting a can squeeze as follows: “Squeeze the cans, please.” “Thank you.” The student must ensure the coach gradually increases the pressure of his grip on the cans and relaxes it. (d) Note the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans. E. Now increase the sensitivity setting to 2 and repeat steps D (b), (c) and (d) above, again noting the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans. F. Repeat steps D (b), (c) and (d) for sensitivity setting at 3, then sensitivity setting 4, then 5, then 6, and on up until you have the needle hitting the pin on the can squeeze. With the needle hitting the pin on the can squeeze, you wouldn’t be able to note the length of the needle fall. Flunks are given for not having the coach remove all rings or finger jewelry, as they can cause the needle to give unusual reads; for not checking that there is maximum skin con-tact on the cans; for failing to see that the thumbs go around the can and not up the sides; for failing to set the meter and needle up properly; for failing to notice and handle a sudden or hard or jerky or convulsive can squeeze instead of an even increase of pressure on the cans or sudden letting go of the cans; for not making sure the coach doesn’t take a finger or thumb or palm off the cans when he releases the contact; for failing to note accurately the distance the needle fell on the can squeeze; and for giving the wrong commands. Lack of skill in earlier drills is corrected by pink sheet. SECTION III: To give the student auditor a reality on setting the sensitivity for a 1/3 of a dial drop of the needle on the can squeeze. The student auditor should know that setting the sensitivity for 1/3 of a dial drop on the can squeeze is an integral part of setting up each and every session he does. It is the sensi-tivity he will be using during the session. It is vitally important he gets the correct sensitivity setting for each preclear at each session, so that he will not miss reads or F/Ns. A sensitivity setting which is too low or too high for that particular preclear in the particular session will obscure reads and F/Ns, thus upsetting the preclear’s case. Therefore, the student auditor must be proficient on this drill. 1. A. Have the coach pick up the cans and keep his hands on the table so the student can see them throughout the can squeeze."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"E-METER DRILL 5A CAN SQUEEZE  5  HCOB  7.2.79R  SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 61 06.02.10 B. Check the coach’s grip to ensure it is correct, also ensuring you have the correct can size. C. Adjust the sensitivity booster knob to the lowest position. D. (a) Set the sensitivity knob at 5 on the sensitivity dial. (b) Adjust the needle to set line on the dial. (c) Get the coach to squeeze the cans ensuring he does it properly. (d) Note the distance the needle fell when the coach squeezed the cans. E. On Step D (d) the needle will have fallen a distance of either (a) Less than 1/3 of a dial drop, or (b) More than 1/3 of a dial drop. If it’s (a) raise the sensitivity a bit and repeat steps D (b), (c) and (d) and continue to do this until you have 1/3 dial drop. If it’s (b) lower the sensitivity a bit and re-peat steps D (b), (c) and (d) and continue to do this until you have 1/3 dial drop. In other words, keep adjusting your sensitivity lower or higher according to whether the drop is more or less than 1/3 of a dial drop, until you get the correct sensitivity setting. Each time a new can squeeze is asked for, the student auditor is to make sure the coach is holding the cans properly and is giving a correct can squeeze. F. The student then notes the exact sensitivity setting at which he got the 1/3 dial drop. Flunks are given for errors as in Section II above and for failing to recognize when a 1/3 dial drop of the needle on the can squeeze has been obtained; for fail-ing to recognize if the coach is giving a considerably harder or lighter can squeeze than he was giving at sensitivity 5, and for failing to establish the correct sensitiv-ity setting for 1/3 of a dial drop on the coach. 2. Now the coach has the student auditor do the drill on a number of other students, with the coach watching, until he is satisfied that the student can easily and accurately es-tablish the correct sensitivity setting for a 1/3 dial drop can squeeze. SECTION IV: To give the student auditor a reality on how a correct sensitivity setting for l/3 of a dial drop on the can squeeze gives a readable and workable meter and how an incorrect sensitivity setting gives an unreadable and unworkable meter, so the student will understand why he has to use a sensitivity setting that gives 1/3 of a dial drop. 1. Coach has the student auditor set the sensitivity accurately on a correct can squeeze for 1/3 dial drop as in Section III. 2. The student auditor does a “pinch test” as follows: student pinches the coach’s arm, hard enough to hurt a little bit. 3. Now, while watching the meter, the student says to the coach:"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"E-METER DRILL 5A CAN SQUEEZE  6  HCOB  7.2.79R  SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 62 06.02.10 “Recall that pinch I just gave you.” “Thank you.” 4. Student notes the reaction of the needle to his command and the distance the needle fell. 5. Coach has the student do steps 2, 3, and 4 several times, each time noting what the needle does in response to “Recall that pinch.” 6. Coach now has the student set the sensitivity at 1. Student has coach squeeze the cans and notes whether there’s a read, or not. If there is a read, note size of read and leave the sensitivity at 1. If there’s no read on the squeeze, the student still leaves the sensi-tivity at 1. 7. The student auditor does a new “pinch test” as in 2, 3, 4 and 5 above, noting the dif-ference in needle response to the command “Recall that pinch” as compared to what it was in Step 5 at the correct sensitivity setting. There may be no read at all and the stu-dent should notice that. 8. Coach now has student set the sensitivity at 32, and coach squeezes the cans. 9. Student does the pinch test again and notes the reaction of the needle to his command “Recall that pinch.” 10. Coach has the student then set the sensitivity correctly for 1/3 of a dial drop on a cor-rect can squeeze and does the pinch test again. 11. The student should observe from these pinch tests that an accurate sensitivity setting determined from a correct can squeeze gives a readable and workable meter and that an incorrect sensitivity setting gives an unreadable and unworkable meter. If he does not see this clearly, then the coach would have the student redo steps 7 through 10 un-til the student sees why the sensitivity must be set for 1/3 of a dial drop determined by a correct can squeeze. Flunks are given for failing to note what the needle did and size of read in response to student telling coach to recall the pinch and for errors in setting sensitivity accurately and getting a correct can squeeze when called for in the drill. HISTORY: Developed as a training drill by L. Ron Hubbard at Saint Hill in December, 1963 and revised by L. Ron Hubbard in February, 1979. L. RON HUBBARD Founder LRH:clb/dr.jk"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":" SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 63 06.02.10 HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO BULLETIN OF 10 DECEMBER 1965 Remimeo Academy Students Tech Division E-METER DRILL COACHING The following was submitted by Malcolm Cheminais, Supervisor on the Saint Hill Special Briefing Course. Here are some observations I have made on the coaching of E-Meter drills, which I feel could be of use: 1. The coach’s needle is dirty. The student’s out comm cycle has cut his comm in some way, but PRIOR to that the coach failed to flunk the part of the comm cycle that went out. Correct flunking by coaches equals students with no dirty needles. 2. If a coach’s TA starts climbing on a drill and the needle gets sticky, it means that the student’s comm cycle has dispersed him and pushed him out of PT. The coach is either (1) not flunking at all (2) flunking the incorrect thing. 3. The correct flunking by the coach of an out comm cycle, which has dispersed him and pushed his TA up, will always result in a TA blowdown. If there is no blowdown, the coach has flunked the wrong thing. 4. Needle not responding well and sensitively on assessment drills, although the needle clean. Coach has failed to flunk TR 1 (or TR0) for lack of impingement and reach. 5. Coach reaching forward and leaning on the table, means TR 1 is out with the student. 6. Student asking coach for considerations to get TA down, but TA climbing on the con-siderations – the coach is cleaning a clean, instead of flunking the out comm cycle, which occurred earlier and pushed his TA up. 7. Student getting coach’s considerations off to clean the needle, but needle remaining dirty – student is cutting the coach’s comm while getting the considerations off and the coach is not picking this up. 8. Students shouting or talking very loudly on assessment drills to try and get the Meter to read by overwhelm. The reason for this is invariably – “but I’m assessing the bank!” They haven’t realized that banks don’t read, only thetans impinged upon by the bank – therefore the TR1 must be addressed to the thetan. The meter responds propor-tionately to the amount of ARC in the Session. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":" SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 64 06.02.10 L.

It need only be done once unless the check itself is suspected false, or if conditions of the pc’s hands, etc., change. “The checklist is kept in the pc folder and is entered on the Folder Summary as an ac-tion done. “The value of operating with correct can size should not be underestimated, the refer-ence HCOBs state why.” The auditor signs and answers the following points on the checklist. The auditor must obtain information by checking the pc’s hands himself or herself to see if the hands are dry or wet. The cause of false TA is in the physical universe and that is where the check is done. It is not done by asking the pc or checking the questions on the pc for meter reads. So the auditor would feel the hands of the pc to establish if they are dry or wet, would feel the pc’s hands with cream on them to see if the cream has dried up, would see if the pc’s hands cup so as to form an area that does not touch the cans and so forth. False TA is not think or mental mass. It is in the physical universe and that is where it has to be handled for it to be remedied. The handling follows each line as you check it. This is for simplicity, as that is the way this check-list is done, each line being handled as you go.

Is the meter fully charged? ________ Handling: “Keep a meter charged at least one hour for every 10 of auditing for 240 AC volt charging current, or 2 hrs. for every 10 of auditing on a 110 AC volt charging current. (Mark VI will get about 6 hrs. for every 1 hr. charged.) “Before each session snap the knob over to TEST. The needle should hit hard on the right side of the face. It can even bounce. If the needle doesn’t snap to the right hard or if it doesn’t quite get there on TEST, then that meter will go flat in mid-session and give false TA and no reads or TA on hot subjects.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA, False TA) Note: To ensure an accurate check, the meter should be turned on a minute or two before turning to test."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"FALSE TA CHECKLIST 3 HCOB 21.1.77RB SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 67 06.02.10 2. Is the meter trimmed correctly? ________ Handling: “A meter can be improperly trimmed (not set at 2.0 with the trim knob) and can give a false TA position. When a meter is not left on a minute or two before trimming, it can drift in the session and give a slightly false TA. “The trim can quietly be checked in mid-session by snapping out the jack where the cord goes into the box and putting the TA on 2, seeing if the needle is now on SET. If not, the trim knob can be moved to adjust it. The jack is quietly slipped back in. All without distracting the pc.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA, False TA) 3. Are the leads connected to the meter and cans? ________ Handling: “A properly set up meter with cans (electrodes) fitted to a pc who is holding them properly is always correct.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 1971A) Reference for setting up a meter is covered in E-Meter Drills book, EM 4, and the Mark VI owner’s manual if one is using a Mark VI. 4. Are the cans rusty? ________ Handling: “Corroded cans can falsify TA. Get new ones now and then.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71A) 5. Are pc’s hands excessively dry requiring hand cream? ________ Handling: “A quick test is have the pc put the cans under his armpits and you’ll see if it’s his callused or chemically dried out hands. The excessively dry hand is seen as shiny or polished looking. It feels very dry. The cor-rect treatment is to use a hand cream, but not a greasy hand cream or vanishing cream. A good hand cream rubs all the way into the hand and leaves no excess grease. Hand cream is usually smeared on, rubbed in and can then be thoroughly wiped off. The hands will usually produce, then, a normal TA and meter response.” LRH (HCOB 23 Nov 73RB Re-revised 25 May 1980, Dry and Wet Hands Make False TA) 6.

A small child would be lost even with that can. So a small 35 mm film can could be used. This is 2 inches long by 1 3/16 diameter or 5 cm by 3 cm. This works but watch it as these cans are aluminum. They do work but test for true read with a slightly larger can and then trim to adjust for the aluminum if any different. “Cans of course should be STEEL with a thin tin plating. Regular soup cans. Can size to match the pc avoids slack can grip or tiring the hands into going slack, giving the auditor 3.2 F/Ns and trouble.” LRH (HCOB 24 Oct 71RA) 11a.

Check how the pc is holding the cans and if the entire hand is on the cans and if they are comfortable and adjust accordingly per above. 14. Are the cans just right for the pc? ________ Handling: Check the grip and see if the can size is correct for the pc. Do the cans comfortably fit the pc’s hands with the hand touching the cans so it gets an accurate reading on the meter? If the can size is correct then you must ensure that the grip is also correct on the cans. 15. Are the cans cold? ________ Handling: “Regardless of can size, cold E-Meter electrodes tend to give a much higher tone arm reading particularly on some pcs. “Until the cans warm up, the reading is generally false and is false in the direction of high. Some pcs are ‘cool blooded’ and the shock of ice-cold cans can drive the TA up and it takes a while to drift down. “A practice which gets around this is for the auditor or Examiner to hold the cans briefly until they are warm and then give them to the pc. A variation is for the auditor or Examiner to put the cans under his armpits while setting up. This warms them. There are probably many other ways to warm up cans to body temperature.” LRH (HCOB 12 Nov 71RB) 15a.

You can spread it on exten-sively then wipe it off and then rub a bit more in ensuring the thumbs are included is one way. (Ref. HCOB 13 Jan 77RB) The point is to feel the hands with the cream on them to see if it has handled the excessively dry hand that is seen as shiny or polished look-ing. And it now should no longer feel dry. (HCOB 23 Nov 73RB Re-revised 25 May 80) The correct treatment is to use a hand cream but not greasy hand cream or vanishing cream. A good hand cream rubs all the way into the skin and leaves no excess grease. This restores normal electrical contact. Such a hand cream would only have to be applied once per session – at session start – as it lasts for a long while. If a cream leaves smears on a can, it is too heavily applied or too little absorbed. (HCOB 23 Apr 75A Re-revised 25 May 80) 17.

R/Ses repeat left and right slashes unevenly and savagely, faster than the eye easily follows. The needle is frantic. The width of an R/S depends largely on sensitiv-ity setting. It goes from one-fourth inch to whole dial. But it slams back and forth. A rock slam (R/S) means a hidden evil intention on the subject or question under auditing or discussion. Valid R/Ses are not always instant reads. An R/S can read prior or latently. HCOB 5 DECEMBER AD12, “2-12, 3GAXX, 3-21 AND ROUTINE 2-10 MODERN AS-SESSMENT” is an HCOB composited by others incorrectly and is cancelled as it misdefines an R/S as a single slash left or right. It contains the statements: “One or two slashes make an R/S... If it slashed up or down once call it an R/S.” The data is utterly false. By this wrong definition a rocket read could be mistaken for an R/S, or any sudden rise could be mistaken for an R/S. One slash doesn’t begin to be an R/S. Nor two or three for that matter. The correct definition of an r/s includes that it slashes savagely left and right. DEFINITION OF A DIRTY NEEDLE The following is the only valid definition of a dirty needle: Dirty Needle: An erratic agitation of the needle which is ragged, jerky, ticking, not sweeping, and tends to be persistent.

L. RON HUBBARD The following dispatch, sent in by Terry Milner and Joe Fortner, staff members of Los Angeles, describes a phenomenon which can be caused by a PC wearing rings: “A dispatch on a matter which I consider quite urgent. Since being audited quite a few rock slams have been observed on me. In the rudiments, on lists, between comm lags, button checks, in fact any method of auditing which required the use of an E-Meter. With the advent of R2-12, I had many lists, all chock full of items that had rock slammed at one time or an-other. The supposedly phantom rock slam served to hang up many sessions and auditing be-came quite a drag even though one true package was found in spite of the rock slams that went on forever. Recently I was sent to get HGC auditing and the rock slams were ever present until my Auditor, Joe Fortner, got a little suspicious and had me take off the two rings I wore, one on either hand. They disappeared. Hundreds of things that had rock slammed no longer rock slammed. Hundreds of almost, not quite reliable items are dead now and in all truth, most of them have no meaning to me anyway.

The preclear feels there is more to be done yet the auditor says, “Your needle is float-ing.” This is sometimes so bad that in Scientology Reviews one has to Prepcheck the sub-ject of “Floating Needles”. A lot of by-passed charge can be stirred up which ARC Breaks (upsets) the preclear. The reason this subject of floating needles gets into trouble is that the auditor has not understood a subject called end phenomena. End phenomena is defined as “those indicators in the pc and meter which show that a chain or process is ended”. It shows in Dianetics that basic on that chain and flow has been erased, and in Scientology that the pc has been released on that process being run. A new flow or a new process can be embarked upon, of course, when the end phenomena of the previous process is attained. DIANETICS Floating needles are only one fourth of the end phenomena in all Dianetic auditing. Any Dianetic auditing below Power has four definite reactions in the pc which show the process is ended. 1. Floating needle. 2. Cognition. 3. Very good indicators (pc happy). 4. Erasure of the final picture audited. Auditors get panicky about overrun. If you go past the End Phenomena the F/N will pack up (cease) and the TA will rise."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 2 HCOB 20.2.70 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 82 06.02.10 But that’s if you go past all four parts of the end phenomena, not past a floating nee-dle. If you watch a needle with care and say nothing but your R3R commands, as it begins to float you will find: 1. It starts to float narrowly. 2. The pc cognites (What do you know – so that’s . . .) and the float widens. 3. Very good indicators come in. And the float gets almost full dial, and 4. The picture, if you inquired, has erased and the needle goes full dial. That is the full End Phenomena of Dianetics. If the auditor sees a float start, as in 1, and says, “I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating,” he can upset the pc’s bank. There is still charge. The pc has not been permitted to cognite. VGIs surely won’t ap-pear and a piece of the picture is left. By being impetuous and fearful of overrun, or just being in a hurry, the auditor’s pre-mature (too soon) indication to the pc suppresses three quarters of the pc’s end phenomena. SCIENTOLOGY All this also applies to Scientology auditing. And all Scientology processes below Power have the same end phenomena. The 0 to IV Scientology End Phenomena are: A. Floating needle. B. Cognition. C. Very good indicators. D. Release. The pc goes through these four steps without fail if permitted to do so. As Scientology auditing is more delicate than Dianetic auditing, an overrun (F/N van-ished and TA rising, requiring “rehab”) can occur more rapidly. Thus the auditor has to be more alert. But this is no excuse to chop off three of the steps of end phenomena. The same cycle of F/N will occur if the pc is given a chance. On A you get a begin-ning F/N, on B slightly wider, on C wider still and on D the needle really is floating and widely. “I would like to indicate to you your needle is floating” can be a chop. Also it’s a false report if it isn’t widely floating and will keep floating."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 3 HCOB 20.2.70 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 83 06.02.10 Pcs who leave session F/N and arrive at Examiner without F/N, or who eventually do not come to session with an F/N have been misaudited. The least visible way is the F/N chop, as described in this session. The most obvious way is to overrun the process. (Running a pc after he has exteriorized will also give a high TA at Examiner.) In Dianetics, one more pass through is often required to get 1, 2, 3, 4 End Phenomena above. I know it said in the Auditor’s Code not to by-pass an F/N. Perhaps it should be changed to read “A real wide F/N”. Here it’s a question of how wide is an F/N? However, the problem is not difficult. I follow this rule – I never jolt or interrupt a pc who is still looking inward. In other words, I don’t ever yank his attention over to the auditor. After all, it’s his case we are han-dling, not my actions as an auditor. When I see an F/N begin I listen for the pc’s cognition. If it isn’t there, I give the next command due. If it still isn’t there, I give the 2nd command, etc. Then I get the cognition and shut up. The needle floats more widely, VGIs come in, the F/N goes dial wide. The real skill is involved in knowing when to say nothing more. Then with the pc all bright, all end phenomena in sight (F/N, Cog, VGIs, Erasure or Release, depending on whether it’s Dn or Scn), I say, as though agreeing with the pc, “Your needle is floating.” DIANETIC ODDITY Did you know that you could go through a picture half a dozen times, the F/N getting wider and wider without the pc cogniting? This is rare but it can happen once in a hundred. The picture hasn’t been erased yet. Bits of it seem to keep popping in. Then it erases fully and wow, 2, 3 and 4 occur. This isn’t grinding. It’s waiting for the F/N to broaden to cognition. The pc who complains about F/Ns is really stating the wrong problem. The actual problem was the auditor distracting the pc from cognition by calling attention to himself and the meter a moment too soon. The pc who is still looking inward gets upset when his attention is jerked outward. Charge is then left in the area. A pc who has been denied his full end phenomena too often will begin to refuse auditing. Despite all this, one still must not overrun and get the TA up. But in Dianetics an era-sure leaves nothing to get the TA up with! The Scientology auditor has a harder problem with this, as he can overrun more easily. There is a chance of pulling the bank back in. So the problem is more applicable to Scientol-ogy as a problem than to Dianetics."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"FLOATING NEEDLES AND END PHENOMENA 4 HCOB 20.2.70 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 84 06.02.10 But ALL auditors must realize that the end phenomena of successful auditing is not just an F/N but has 3 more requisites.

Auditors have also called F/Ns which were ARC break needles, thus falsely indicating to the pc. These two actions – disregarding actual F/Ns because the TA was not between 2.0 and 3.0 and calling “F/Ns” that were actually ARC break needles – have upset many preclears. The outnesses here are: A. not considering pc indicators as senior and B. not noting pc indicators when calling an F/N and C. ignoring and giving junior importance to the technol-ogy covered in false TAs. (See list of references at end of this HCOB or the Subject Index of the HCOB Volumes.) Auditors have even been led to falsify worksheets (giving TA as in range when it ac-tually was not when calling an F/N) because they might “get in trouble” for calling an F/N in the wrong range, such as 1.8 or 3.2. The correct procedure for out of range F/Ns is: 1. Look at the pc’s indicators. 2. Call the F/N regardless of its range. 3. Mark down the actual TA position. 4. Handle the false TA at the earliest opportunity when it will not intrude into the current cycle on which the pc is being audited. (You don’t interrupt a Quad R3RA, for in-stance, to handle false TA; you complete it and then, when directed by the C/S, you handle the false TA.)"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"SCIENTOLOGY F/N AND TA POSITION 2 HCOB 10.12.76RB SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 86 06.02.10 5. On any pc you suspect has had his F/Ns disregarded because of false TA, you C/S for and get run a repair and rehab of this error. E-Meter cans can monitor or change TA position when the palms are too dry or too wet or when the cans are too big or too small or when the wrong hand cream is used. The E-Meter does not read on hand moisture alone as was long believed by people in electronics. But TA depends upon resistance to electrical current in the palms, leads, and meter as well as its main resistance which happens to be mental masses or lack of them. To simply tell some interne “Always disregard an F/N not in correct range” is to set him up for loses and set the pc up for crashes. The correct information is that an F/N which isn’t in range is accompanied by pc indicators that indicate whether it is an F/N or not. And indicates you better get the false TA handled fast as soon as it won’t interrupt the current cy-cle. And you always note where it F/Ned so the C/S can C/S for false TA handling. Where an ARC break needle (which looks like an F/N) is observed, whether it is in range or out of range (2.0 to 3.0 or below 2.0 or above 3.0) you look at the pc and establish the pc’s indicators before falsely calling an F/N. A pc who is about to cry is not an F/Ning pc and if you indicate an F/N to that pc you will further the ARC break and suppress the emo-tional charge that is about to come off. REPAIR Where the above matters have not been fully understood and errors have occurred on pcs, it must be assumed that: 1. Auditors have falsified their worksheets as to TA position and thus built up withholds and made themselves blowy. 2. That every pc who has ever had high or low TA trouble has had F/Ns disregarded and ARC break F/Ns falsely indicated. 3. That a briefing and drilling of all internes and auditors must occur on this HCOB. 4. That a brief program of clean-up of disregarded F/Ns and falsely called ARC break F/Ns be done on every pc. 5. That every such pc be considered as having false TA troubles and these must be C/Sed for and corrected. 6. That all auditors and internes be drilled on all HCOBs relating to pc indicators.

DIANETIC F/NS An F/N seen by the auditor in running R3RA is not called until the full Dianetic EP is reached. An auditor running R3RA is NOT looking for F/Ns. He is looking for the postulate which is sitting at the bottom of the chain he is running. The EP of a Dianetic chain is always always always the postulate coming off. The postulate is what holds the chain in its place. Release the postulate and the chain blows. That’s it. The auditor must recognize the postulate when the pc gives it, note the VGIs, call the F/N and end off auditing that chain. An F/N seen as the incident is erasing is not called. The pc does not have to state that the incident has erased. Once he has given up the postulate, the erasure has occurred. The auditor will see an F/N and VGIs. NOW the F/N is called. F/Ns are not indicated until the EP of postulate off, F/N and VGIs is reached. It’s the postulate – not the F/N that we are going for in New Era Dianetics. POWER F/NS F/Ns are disregarded in Power.

Carefully examining dozens of F/Ns which occurred with the TA well above 3.0 and looking for any troubles with the case following calling the F/N an F/N, I found that there were no adverse consequences.

There are low TA cases and high TA cases and the state of the TA remains im-portant and all data regarding TA positions are valid.

The reaction of the needle may be any reaction except „nul”. An instant read may be any change of characteristic providing it occurs instantly. The absence of a read at the end of the major thought shows it to be nul. All prior reads and latent reads are ignored. These are the result of minor thoughts which may or may not be restimulated by the question. Only the instant read is used by the auditor. Only the instant read is cleared on rudi-ments, What questions, etc. The instant read may consist of any needle reaction, rise, fall, speeded rise, speeded fall, double tick (dirty needle), theta bop or any other action so long as it occurs at the exact end of the major thought being expressed by the auditor. If no reaction occurs at exactly that place (the end of the major thought) the question is nul. By „major thought” is meant the complete thought being expressed in words by the auditor. Reads which occur prior to the completion of the major thought are „prior reads”. Reads which occur later than its completion are „latent reads”. By „minor thought” is meant subsidiary thoughts expressed by words within the major thought. They are caused by the reactivity of individual words within the full words. They are ignored. Example: „Have you ever injured dirty pigs?” To the pc the words „you”, „injured” and „dirty” are all reactive. Therefore, the minor thoughts expressed by these words also read on the meter. The major thought here is the whole sentence. Within this thought are the minor thoughts „you”, „injured” and „dirty”. Therefore the E-Meter needle may respond this way: „Have you (fall) ever injured (speeded fall) dirty (fall) pigs (fall)?” Only the major thought gives the instant read and only the last fall (bold-italic type in the sentence above) indicates anything.

Paying attention to minor thought reads gives us laughable situations as in the case, written in 1960, of „getting P.D.H.ed by the cat”. By accepting these prior reads one can prove anything. Why? Because Pain and Drug and Hypnosis are minor thoughts within the major thought: „Have you ever been P.D.H.ed by a cat?” The inexpert auditor would believe such a silly thing had happened. But notice that if each minor thought is cleaned out of the major thought it no longer reacts as a whole fact. If the person on the meter had been P.D.H.ed by a cat, then only the discovery of the origin of the whole thought would clean up the whole thought. Pcs also think about other things while being asked questions and these random per-sonal restimulations also read before and after an instant read and are ignored. Very rarely, a pc’s thinks react exactly at the end of a major thought and so confuse the issue, but this is rare. We want the read that occurs instantly after the last syllable of the major thought without lag. That is the only read we regard in finding a rudiment in or out, to find if a goal reacts, etc. That is what is called an „instant read”. There is a package rudiment question in the half truth, etc. We are doing four rudi-ments in one and therefore have four major thoughts in one sentence. This packaging is the only apparent exception but is actually no exception. It’s just a fast way of doing four rudi-ments in one sentence. A clumsy question which puts „in this session” at the end of the major thought can serve the auditor badly. Such modifiers should come before the sentence, „In this session have you......?” You are giving the major thought directly to the reactive mind. Therefore any analyti-cal thought will not react instantly. The reactive mind is composed of: 1. Timelessness. 2. Unknownness. 3. Survival. The meter reacts on the reactive mind, never on the analytical mind. The meter reacts instantly on any thought restimulated in the reactive mind. If the meter reacts on anything, that datum is partly or wholly unknown to the preclear. An auditor’s questions restimulate the reactive mind. This reacts on the meter. Only reactive thoughts react instantly. You can „groove in” a major thought by saying it twice. On the second time (or third time if it is longer) you will see only the instant read at the exact end. If you do this the prior reads drop out leaving only the whole thought. If you go stumbling around in rudiments or goals trying to clean up the minor thoughts you will get lost.

In rudiments, What questions, et al, you want the instant read only. It occurs exactly at the end of the whole thought. This is your whole interest in cleaning a rudiment or a What question. You ignore all prior and latent reactions of the needle. The exceptions to this rule are: 1. „Compartmenting the question”, in which you use the prior reads occurring at the ex-act end of the minor thoughts (as above in the pigs sentence) to dig up different data not related to the whole thought. 2. „Steering the pc” is the only use of latent or random reads. You see a read the same as the instant read occurring again when you are not speaking but after you have found a whole thought reacting. You say „there” or „that” and the pc, seeing what he or she is looking at as you say it, recovers the knowledge from the reactive bank and gives the data and the whole thought clears or has to be further worked and cleared. You can easily figure-figure yourself half to death trying to grapple with meter reads unless you get a good reality on the instant read which occurs at the end of the whole ex-pressed thought and neglect all prior and latent reads except for steering the pc while he gropes for the answer to the question you asked. That’s the whole of reading an E-Meter needle. (Two Saint Hill lectures of 24 May 1962 cover this in full.) L.

I have been a bit surprised by the length of time it is taking people to do assessments on the Prehav, on Security Checks and goals. A query into this, which may reveal more, has discovered that students wait patiently for the meter to react, which Mary Sue has noticed. It dawns on me that auditors believe they are doing an analytical assessment on the Prehav, etc. This is wrong. The Prehav Scale is not a picture of analytical thought. It is in the order it is in because it is a picture of reactive thought. It is how the reactive mind is stacked up. (See Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health for the chapter on the reactive mind.) Now an E-Meter reacts only on the reactive mind. A Clear doesn’t react because he is able to be conscious. An aberree reacts because he can’t think without thought exciting the reactivity of the reactive mind. This, being composed of mass, energy, space, time and thought, responds to tiny electrical impulses. If your auditing was not aimed at reactivity it would not register on a meter. Thus, you run what reacts because it reacts and is therefore part of the reactive mind. The reactive mind responds instantly on data a billion years ago. How is this? Time in the reactive mind is out of order. So is space. So is matter, so is energy. Pin a sign on the reac-tive mind: „Out of Order.” It connects wrong connections. Hence, the E-Meter. What is wrong with the pc is not known to the pc. Therefore if a pc knows all about it, it isn’t wrong with him. That’s why you never run what the pc says. You run only what the meter says. Exam-ple: pc is sure his current general Prehav Level that should be run now is „Order or Com-mand.” „Order” rapidly vanishes. „Command” follows suit. Conquer stays in. This is an ac-tual example. I just assessed it a few minutes ago on a pc who is in pretty good shape. He didn’t like conquer. He said Order and Command were long track. Somebody running a Q and A on his assessment would have said, perhaps, the pc knows best, so we’ll run Order. Even if it doesn’t fall. But when I said it was conquer that we were going to run as only it now fell, the pc sighed and gave in. Finding the Conquer level questions produced a very re-"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"E-METER WATCHING, ARE YOU WAITING 2 HCOB 8.6.61R FOR THE METER TO PLAY DIXIE?

Order and Command were analytical responses prompted by an entirely different thing conquer. If Order or Command had been run the pc would have had a lot of auditing time wasted on him. Now, why are assessments wrong sometimes? Because the auditor is persuaded by the pc, not the meter. If the pc and the meter agree, so what. You can still run it. But only if the meter says so. for only then is it reactive. Now, what about slow assessments? Well, the auditor thinks the pc must consider things before he answers, waits for the pc to answer and waits for the question to sink in so the meter will react. This is entirely wrong. Based on a misunderstanding of assessment, the meter and the reactive mind. 1. The pc does not have to be given a chance to think before the needle responds. 2. The pc does not have to answer or say one word to make the needle respond. 3. All needle response is reactive. 4. There is no time in the reactive mind. 5. If the pc knew what was wrong with him it wouldn’t be wrong. 6. Only the meter knows. 7. The auditor has more control over the pc’s reactive mind than the pc since the pc is in-fluenced by the reactive mind responses and the auditor is not so influenced. The meter responds instantly. The reaction you will get on the needle starts to occur on the needle instantly after you utter it. There is no need to sit there afterwards waiting for the needle to respond again. for it won’t until you push that button again. The only wait is caused by letting the needle come back at the end of a fall. This may take one second. Therefore: To wait more than one second before uttering the next word on the list is a complete waste of auditing time. All the response you want will begin to occur instantly after you utter a goal, terminal, level or security question. Thus the maximum time between questions on the Prehav Level is at most a three-second interval of silence while you digest the data. Further, on an assessment for a Prehav run on the General Scale (as in Routine 2, HCOB 5 June 1961), you do not now say. „Do you...” or any other dunnage. You just say the level itself, note response, put a pencil point down on the level if it responds, say the next word, etc., etc. Takes about 5 minutes to run the Primary Scale up and down to find its level. You start at the bottom. You just say the word. If it responds you dot the sheet (using differ-ent symbols to tell them apart like dots, X’s, lines). Then go back down the scale touching only those you marked going up. Add another dot if they still fall or react. Then play off those"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"E-METER WATCHING, ARE YOU WAITING 3 HCOB 8.6.61R FOR THE METER TO PLAY DIXIE? SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 97 06.02.10 left one against the other, saying a level only once each time. The remaining level is now the only one that reacts. So you assemble your 5-way bracket and carry on with auditing. The pc doesn’t have to say a word throughout the whole assessment. You can even ask him politely not to, as breath going in and out in speech can vibrate the needle. When you assess over into the Secondary Scale of the level you found. you do exactly the same as above. You read them all off once, then only those that reacted, eliminate them and you’ve got it. (And, by the way, if you go over the Secondary Scale, you then don’t only run levels on that Secondary forever; in each new assessment you use the Primary Scale again to find a new Secondary Level to assess.) This is also true of a Joburg. If you’re going to get a reaction on the needle, it will come fast. No waiting. If you get a reaction you clear that reaction, not the pc’s whole life. The moment the needle is null, you go on to the next question. Of course, in a Joburg. the pc talks. He better! All auditing actions except the CCHs are now done in Model Session. And all auditing actions and questions are done effectively. neither frantically rushed nor slowly. So it boils down to this. Weeks can be added to Joburgs and assessments if you think you have to wait for a needle response. What are you waiting for? The whole action only requires a second. Don’t wait for the E-Meter to play Dixie. It was made in the Nawth. L.

As a Clear’s postulates read as a surge, usually fairly long (over 1”), “No” can read if the pc says it to himself as an answer to a question asked. A read, therefore, does not mean invariably “yes” or that the question is charged. All it means is that the Meter has read. The Auditor must now find out what the read was before determining he should do something about that portion of the Green Form or List. One doesn’t just assume the read was “yes”. One asks about the read as a general rule, not assuming at once the thing asked was charged. Example – Auditor: “Do you have a missed withhold?” Meter surges. Auditor: “What was that?” Pre OT: “I thought No I don’t.” Auditor: “OK. Do you have a missed withhold?” Pre OT: “No.” – Meter didn’t read. Auditor: “Anything suppressed-asserted-protested-invalidated. OK that’s clean.“ Ticks (1/8 inch) often mean something is there. A Pre OT’s postulates have greater length when they surge. It is not important how you handle this phenomena of postulate or to-oneself-comment by a high level case. It is important that the Auditor does not hang the case with a wrong ad-judication of what’s wrong by thinking every surge means “yes” or that the question is charged because it surges.

The pc is not required to comment during this action and it is better if he does not. This action is called „Assessment for Longest Read”. It is used mainly in Dianetics. There are two Scientology assessments which are differently done. These are „As-sessment by Elimination” and „Listing and Nulling”. They are not used in Dianetics. One does not mix the three types. In Dianetic Assessment by Longest Read one uses these symbols: X – didn’t read Tick – small jerk of needle SF – Small Fall (a quarter to half an inch) F – Fall (about one to 2 inches) LF – Long Fall (2 to 3 inches) LFBD – Long Fall followed by a „blow down” or TA motion downward. All falls are to the right. A „BD” is a Tone Arm motion to the left made to keep the needle on the dial. The favoured action for an item is an LFBD and if one item on the list does so, that is it without any further assessment. The reason one assesses is that if an item does not read on the meter when assessed it is beyond the pc’s level of awareness. It is very unwise and unsafe to try to run a somatic which has not read on the list. It will be beyond the pc’s reality and beyond his awareness and will result in overwhelming him. That an item reads guarantees that the pc will be able to confront and erase the chain. So that an item reads well is a guarantee that the pc can handle it and will not get in too deep for him.

A protest almost never blows down the TA. To be sure that the item is right, one usually asks the pc if he is interested in the item chosen. If the pc says no, he doesn’t want to run it, this is a protest read. One then picks the second best reading item on the assessment already done and checks that with the pc for interest. The pc will usually be interested in it. The pc can almost always be counted on to be interested in any item that gives a LFBD. One never simply asks the pc which on the list he is interested in as „an assessment” as it will be found the pc simply chooses at random and may choose a null item. The result may be a very unsuccessful session. An auditor may sometimes be astonished by what reads. The pc, let us say, obviously has a broken leg but what reads is an earache. One runs what reads, not what the auditor knows should be run. A „know best” in an auditor can be a fatal fault. On a second or third assessment, items which were at first null or reading poorly will be found to „come alive” and read well. The pc, by being audited, has had an increase of abil-ity to confront and, if the auditing is standard, an increase in confidence. The result is that items beyond his reach previously (and did not read well) are now available and can be run easily. The E-Meter measures the awareness depth of the pc. On things which do not read on assessment you would find his reality poor. Things that read well on assessment will be found to be things on which a pc has a high reality and a high interest level. Only if pushed to audit without a meter could an auditor assess by interest only. There is no real excuse for it if one has an E-Meter. Auditing without a meter is a chancy activity. Good assessment by longest read is the best entrance to a successful session. The same list will serve for the next item to be run and should be used rather than just asking the pc. L.

A downcurve at the end of an assessment question contributes to making it a state-ment. Questions should go up at the end.

There are 240 Clears moving right straight on up the line. And I’m – I have a bit of a problem. I have a bit of a problem with my own clearing. [laughter] I had 24 Clears who were screaming for their OT course and I had to put together the first part of the OT course and I slipped. And at the middle of a session and so forth, why, my TA went to 3 and the needle went loose and then of course I started moving up to check up the bank to find out if anything was there so that I could get started on the OT course and what you did with the bank and there it went. But I will try and get this condition remedied so that I can go out to Qual and go backwards and get checked out. [laughter, laughs – applause] Thank you. I lead a terrible life, actually. [laughter, laughs] I was an umpteenth stage Release with a completely floating needle one night, two or three years ago – about a Grade VI or some-thing like that, and I had time – just time to drink a Coca-Cola before Mary Sue came back and started the overrun. [laughs, laughter] I was a VI Stage Release for one Coca-Cola. [laughs, laughter] What a terrible life. [laughs] But people get to walking on your heels, you know, and you push along. Well anyway, I’m going to give you a lecture today about Releases and Clears. Be-cause the probability is, is maybe nobody’s heard it yet. You see? Because we found out that there were some people in the HGC that didn’t know that. So if there were some people in the HGC that didn’t know it, Lord forbid, why I imagine there’s a person or two on the Saint Hill course that doesn’t know it. I think that has a probability. And in view of the fact that this data is highly modern data, very, very modernized as data, it probably is to some slight degree new data. We have a very bad problem, as you know, with the subject of releasing. And it is a problem of overrun. And it has gone on for many, many, many years. It’s gone on for so long that it practically obliterated all the results of Dianetics and Scientology. And is the direct course of people walking around and saying Dianetics and Scientology doesn’t work. Do you follow? It’s that serious an error. So it just held us up endlessly. And there were certain phe-nomena which existed that one was not totally familiar with.

And I know that the Queen’s Counselor down in Mel-bourne, where they’ve just had a bad fire – don’t imagine that will be their last bad fire – the Queen’s Counselor down there said he couldn’t accept the idea of past lives because it meant he wouldn’t go to heaven. I got news for anything – any man that dishonest, just thinking about heaven is making a mistake. [laughs, laughter] So you run into such phenomena – we knew about those – but how far back did it go? What was the total extent of it? In the early days we knew nothing about things like implanta-tion. There was tremendous quantities of data that was unknown and it was very easy to make this mistake. Now we’re not in bad company in making this mistake because about 2500 years ago exactly on this same line of research, the identical mistake was made. The identical mistake was made by Gautama Siddhartha Buddha, no less. And he did not appreciate the existence of a bank at all. And that work does not take into account that there is such a thing as the mind or the bank. That’s what’s missing out of that larry of work. Now there was another blunder made 10,000 years ago along the line of philosophic research. And there was a chap called Dharma and he was a monk, legendary and so forth. And oddly enough his name today means \"fate.\" In the more esoteric Eastern philosophies and so on, they speak of somebody’s dharma. And it gets perverted into karma and so forth. But he is so legendary that his name now means something else. But I think you can still find it recorded. And the mistake there was believing that you had to – you want to know how I know so much about this, well, I’ll tell you some day. The mistake there was believing that you didn’t have to do anything but become wise. All you had to do was become wise and you would instantly become nine feet tall. Do you see? Now it’s from Dharma that you get the tradition which most philosophers follow which is that, if you became wise you would become free. Now, there’s almost – anybody there is around is grooved in to that basic philosophy. That is part of the woof and warp (rug terms, that’s how you fix up a rug, don’t want to give you any misunderstood words) – the – it’s in the woof and warp of the entire culture, that you become wise, you become free. And that’s been going on for 10,000 years on this planet. Started by Dharma. Now that work has been totally assimilated. Now that one can exteriorize and that ex-teriorization brings about freedom, is the premise of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha and that’s only 2500 years ago. They’ve got 7500 years yet to go before they assimilate that into the culture the way the philosophy of Dharma was. Which means, you poor bloke, that you’ve got about 10,000 less sixteen years to go before Scientology is totally assimilated as the basic thing called philosophy or culture, see. So don’t feel that you’re going to catch up to this very rapidly if it took Dharma 10,000 years to get the point across that if you become wise you became free. And if people still don’t know about exteriorization 2500 years after the most popular and most numerous religion on the planet, Buddhism. You’ve got 7500 years to go, so sit it out, you know?

Anyway, in other parts of the universe in the Galactic Confederation they have a psy-chotherapy which consists of a recognition of the fact that at a moment of fatal accident to a thetan a picture was made. They know that that is, but they don’t really think it is a picture. They think it is a location. And they take a picture of the location where he was injured and communicate to him in his unconscious state by snapping together a thing that looks like a movie clapboard. You see, they take this picture of the location and then they slap this movie clapboard in front of it, and the thetan is supposed to do something to – by shock or some-thing – to his concept of that location as an injurious location, and so, in some way, blow the consequences of his injury. That is a – that is a therapy, by the way, that is administered to the releases in that so-ciety which go as OTs, OT releases. And now that is their psychotherapy. And that comes as close to anything we’re doing as anything else I know of in the universe. Of course there are many things could go on in the universe that I don’t know anything about. There’s lots of things that could happen that one wouldn’t have any trace of; naturally. But knowledge has a tendency to get around and you’ll find out that if one being in one quarter of the universe is advancing along some certain premise, why, you will find out that it tends to advance in other parts of the universe. I don’t know – but I don’t think Scien-tology will be contained very long on this planet. I don’t think it will be contained on this planet even this decade, see? It’ll be that – that swift. So anyway, these were new thoughts particularly for this very backward and barbaric planet. They – if you don’t think things were barbarous you should have had something to do (and maybe you did) with India of 10,000 years ago. There was no slightest vestige of civili-zation. It was really wild and howling amongst the wogs as they leaped up and down, you know. And to get a point across that if you became wise you somehow became a bit supe-rior – that was a hard one to do. So that was a terrific advance. It’s almost like trying to teach animals or something, you know? You can’t even talk their language. So that was a big jump. And eventually, practically everybody on the planet agrees with that. We have now some fantastic percentage of the taxation of this planet (well, that’s what’s left over from military appropriations) is devoted to education. The scarcity of univer-sities here in England now is represented by the fact that one university which can accept 850 students this next term has 10,000 applications. And it is a college of which I have never heard. So you can imagine what some of the more popular ones have in terms of numbers. Well, there’s this terrific demand for education or self-improvement. Now that – you might not look at it first, you see, because it seems so banal, so commonplace to you. But the fact that man at this time is actually willing to invest time, effort and money in the subject of making people wiser so as to make them freer is a great testimony to this fellow Dharma. Took him 10,000 years to get one point across. All right. That was almost the totality of it.

He knew – you knew that you could become a free individual. In other words, there was a freedom, which was attainable. But no technology at all. Now 7500 years after that Gautama Siddhartha Buddha discovered exteriorization, and of course the term \"Buddha\" comes from the bodhi tree since it was under a bodhi tree that he first exteriorized. Now he thought you exteriorized by becoming wise, following in the pat-tern of Dharma. Now that religion has gone now into the majority of the areas of Asia and did itself really civilize three-quarters of Asia. That wasn’t much information but he introduced several ideas along with it. And one was, that you should be civilized. A shocker, nobody ever heard of that before, you see, just be polite and so forth, you know? Very novel ideas. Well, man has not yet accepted the idea that he should be polite, but he’s getting there. In some areas of the world they have overdone it a bit. So as they cut each other’s livers out they say, \"I withhold my foul breath from your face,\" you see? [laughs] So, this action of exteriorization was not in actual fact doable to any great degree. The lama – the lamaists came along afterwards and tried to develop some sort of a technology and an explanation for all of this and so forth, and you get squirrel Buddhism which is Lamaism. That’s right, that’s all it is. And what Buddha didn’t cook up they thought they could. And of course they were moving into a zone where there was plenty to be found out. But the big strike had been made by Buddha, which is that somebody can exteriorize. Now of course we are then gainers to the degree that there is some longevity to the idea of the soul, that there is such a thing as a soul. This has some longevity, a lot of people accept this. Where it goes, what it does, what it consists of, they haven’t a clue. But that there is something called a soul which goes someplace has actually dominated Greek, Roman thought for a very long period of time now, it’s about 2000 years or something like that. It also dominates various portions of Africa and the Middle East under another prophet’s name and so on. But it is the same – the same channel of thought that there is such a thing called a soul. Socrates is the primary originator of this in this – he’s the primary forwarder of the idea in our present philosophic history. He said there was such a thing as a demon, and so forth. You see, if you’re not in Greece you’d never know the story of Socrates. You only get told the story of Socrates in Greece, you don’t read it out of philosophic textbooks. Quite in-teresting because there’s a sort of a verbal tradition, vocal tradition, in Greece concerning Socrates which never gets into the philosophic textbooks. So of course the thing which I have added is that a philosopher should know something about life. That’s so novel that it has prac-tically never been done before. Now, Socrates was holding forth for the existence of a personal being, or as we would say, thetan. And the religious ah, bigots, ah, bums, ah, tramp – ah, the religious hierarchy, excuse me, I was looking for that word! Having an awful time there – they disagreed with this. And they disagreed with this so thoroughly that they slipped him the hemlock. And he was so henpecked at home that they couldn’t even get him to escape from jail. He went ahead"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 5 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 111 06.02.10 and drank the hemlock just to make them good and guilty. And he made them guilty, man, they still preserve his jail. But then some time later, sometime later the Nicene Creed was developed which we now have in the form of the Dead Sea Scrolls and which was then put forward about a hun-dred years after its original development by Jesus of Nazareth. Now he – this church is having an awful embarrassing time with that. But I don’t see why they should have an embarrassing time of it. So the guy was a powerhouse and he had a philosophy which had already [been] kicking around and so forth, that was pretty good. But they have to acknowledge the existence of the Dead Sea Scrolls, don’t you see? And they date one hundred years before Christ and they contain the New Testament. You didn’t know about that? There are some pocketbooks out on it and you should read them, it’s very funny. And the Arabs get ahold of these things, there are lots of them, they find them all over the place now if they know where to look. And the Arabs get hold of them because they can get something like five pounds for a little centimeter square scrap of one of these scrolls. They tear ‘em all up! [laughter] And then some high muckymuck, some super-sultan potentate-God-help-us, he fig-ured out he was going to make a real – real grab out of it, so he, by force and other means, managed to collect a tremendous collection of these bits. And he unfortunately let them be copied photographically and so he was never able to sell his collection. He’s still got it. But these Dead Sea Scrolls are a terrific embarrassment to the Christian church at this particular time. I don’t see why they should be. But they are. And all of this is simply the ad-vance of Buddhism as an idea into Western culture. And it’s easily traceable. There’s even the tradition of Christ having studied in the East, you know. Where did he disappear to for thirty years or whatever it was? You know, there’s a lot of these traditions. And this doesn’t make less out of some fellow who went through all that, you know? But it was pushing wisdom into the West. And the West has been very, very hard to push wisdom into. The early monks of Christianity tried to push wisdom into these areas up here. And over there in Scandahoovia – Scandinavia – I didn’t mean to use it as a verb – and into Ire-land, into these chilly northern climes. And they uniformly were spitted on stakes and chewed up and so forth. The monks would come in and they would say that they were going to cure them up with some relics and so forth. They were healers basically – and they moved in and they were going to help the community and so forth. And the answer was to skin them alive or something – or other delicate process. So, trying to push – well, the way paganism fought against the basic ideas of Christi-anity and so forth is a very gory chapter. And the way the Christians then fought against the non-Christians during the days of the Spanish Inquisition is also gory. But by that time they’d lost most of the philosophy. Man had a soul, it was over there, and it belonged to God and he was nothing. And they had things pretty well scrambled up. By the time Buddhism had been transported, in other words, from India through the Middle East to Greece, to Spain, to Scan-dinavia, to Ireland or the North Pole or something, it was almost an unrecognizable idea. Now, just giving you the scouted background history of this thing. Now the most that was ever achieved by any of these was a type of Release. And since the beginning of the uni-"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 6 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 112 06.02.10 verse, so far as we know; there has never been anything but a Release. There has never been a Clear. There has never been a cleared anything. So that these are all forms of release. Dharma is release by wisdom. Buddhism: that was release by exteriorization. Christi-anity: release by repentance and being good. And you have in actual fact then, the total back-ground history – if you want to read about these chaps and know more about these chaps, in fact it might make good fun. But it’s those things which are there to understand in the light of what we’re doing today. There are no more complexions or complexities than that to understand about these. I would be accused by any scholar of these works of considerable oversimplification but I could answer from the very interesting height of saying, yes, it took twenty years to make a bodhi but we can make one in about twenty seconds. And we can, at a far higher percentage. It is so easy to do, it is totally neglected. We don’t even do it. There’s a point on this gradation scale somewhere which should contain thetan exterior or bodhi. He could be almost anyplace. But we, in actual sober fact, let it happen. If it’s going to happen we let it happen. And it could happen at 0 , I, II, III, IV, V, VI – it could happen in any of these areas. And that it almost immediately unhappens – does not then qualify it as a stable release. It isn’t a good lasting state. As a matter of fact, after you’ve done it to somebody two or three times he becomes very anxious, he thinks you’re going to cost him his body or something of the sort. You can pop him out of his head and after you’ve done it two or three times he begins to tell you that he isn’t. And he wants nothing more really to do with this because he thinks you’re going to foul him up. And he becomes anxious about holding on to the body. People have a bad ex-perience – after you’ve made somebody a Theta Release. You’ve just banged somebody out of their head. They’re no longer in their body, that’s all. The psychiatrist looks on this with the greatest of askance because he occasionally in institutions finds as an inverse, or an inverted exteriorization: a fellow who cannot get into his body and is going frantic. And therefore he thinks anything in connection with exteriorization is insanity, but then of course he’s branding three-quarters of Asia insane. But then naturally he is insufficiently cultured to know anything about Asia, so – that would be it. Now, this state of thetan exterior occurs. And it just occurs, and it can occur almost any time and anybody processing anybody sooner or later is going to get a thetan exterior on his hands. And what you do about it is shut up. You say: \"Well, that’s it\" and you knock it off. It’s the same as a floating needle. It’s a visual manifestation which is different than what oc-curs with a floating needle. They’re not the same thing at all. But it’s something you do not go beyond. You don’t go beyond a floating needle on a pc on the meter, and you do not go beyond an exterior state. Don’t say one more command or order of that level on which you are working or whatever you are working on. Shut up! Because if you go on any distance at all you will walk him right straight back into his bank and he will be very cross and justifiably so. Because you’ve unreleased him. Now after you’ve made one of these fellows, you will find out that within the hour, three days, a week he will have tangled up with more reality than he is prepared to confront in his somewhat tremulous uncleared state. He’s just a Release, you see. And he’s been asked to"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 7 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 113 06.02.10 walk in this big broad world barefooted and he’s still got the anxiety and problem holding on to his body, he doesn’t know quite what to do about this. He’s afraid he’ll forget his body. On the past track it’s happened to him before many times. Because you see, it happens to him every time he dies and is associated in his mind with death. And he’s had unfortunate experi-ences when he could do it at will somewhere way back on the track, leaving his body in the inn to pop off and do something of the sort and then coming back and find out they’d buried the body. You see, and he’s lost his body and his possessions and so forth and he didn’t like that. It has very sour connotations with it because he is not competent to cope with the state at all. He’s way in advance of himself. He’s in actual fact on a harmonic of OT. An OT could care for it. He can’t care for it down here when he is a Dianetic Release. And maybe not even that, you know? And, I’ll give you an actual, typical experiences and so on. I’m not making nothing out of Buddha, this was a considerable advance, this was something very remarkable indeed. And, it must have been remarkable if Socrates copied it. And then it became traditional there-after, which it did. You’ll find, by the way, there are some here and there, there are some primitive races who believe man has a soul. But, scattered pieces of stuff; it’s a piece of truth that isn’t easily camouflaged. But for it to actually be worked on or admitted or something could be done about it, something like that, in a culture, was quite new. So Buddha, when he exteriorized people and when he brought about exteriorization, he brought it about through wisdom so the fellow had some kind of a philosophy at least to back him up. But as far as we’re concerned in Scientology, there is one little string of words that, you take almost any human being out here anyplace and set him down in a chair, get him in some quiet place and say this little string of words to him and it’s going to happen. In a large percentage of cases it’s going to happen. Sixty, seventy, eighty percent some such per-centage. He’s going to exteriorize, man. And a certain number of them are going to exteriorize, be total, total reality, looking around, you know? And a certain number of them are going to be totally real outside the sec-ond they come back inside they say it’s unreal and didn’t happen. Scared, see? And a certain percentage of them will go out and back in without knowing anything ever happened, except weirdly enough, a total change of personality takes place in front of your face. And you find this amongst the insane. There was so much about the insane the psychiatrist could have known about and could know about today if he’d care to listen. I have – I’ve had an insane person sitting in front of me – not a psychiatrist, necessarily – I’ve had an insane person sitting in front of me and I’ve said the magic words. Had the person go totally sane, backed out there to several feet back of their head; totally sane, able to reason, solve their problem, set it all up, all squared around, very happy to talk to me about it, totally rational. And then back in: insane. But not quite as crazy. This is remarkable. Well, there is one notable Scientologist in New York who said it over the air to several million people one time. I often wondered what really happened when he did that. That pro-gram since then has been very friendly to Scientology, it’s an all-night program, \"Long John.\""},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 8 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 114 06.02.10 But, here is a piece of technology which simply forces what is going to happen natu-rally sooner or later. And you don’t have to know trick ways to exteriorize somebody, you see. I’ll give you the magic words, you might as well put them on tape, put it on record some-place or another. It’s \"Try not to be three feet back of your head.\" Man is on such an inversion on the subject that he goes clang! Now, the road of philosophy has been very, very difficult and it has taken a long time for a basic philosophic idea to manifest itself in the society in which it has been expressed. What’s particularly notable about Buddhism is that it was such clear-cut truth that he ad-vanced, that it spread like wildfire within his lifetime. And in the few succeeding lifetimes, a very short period of time, he had almost, well he had about three-quarters of Asia right there – bang! For instance, he brought the first civil... his people brought the first civilization to Ja-pan. And those were within living memory of Buddha. And that is an awful long ways for that – modes of travel of that day from Northern India. Japan is quite a far cry. They brought the first shreds of culture to Japan. They brought writing and to this day the Japanese use Chinese writing pronounced with a Japanese vocabulary. And that was brought to them by the first Buddhist monks who came there. But those fellows were very industrious and they got it fast. But they had moved from a state of \"man is meat\" to \"he is a spiritual being\" and they had manifestations of this, and they had a rather powerful leader and there it went. Now this is and can be considered only, a sort of a state of release through wisdom, because they didn’t have any command to tell anybody to back out of his head. The fellow would simply become wise and they find out that when he became wise enough he would exteriorize, they hoped. They had a lot of failures along this line. It’s very difficult to do this because it’s booby-trapped by the bank. Now in one fell swoop with no pause for breath, we have capitalized upon the idea that a man who is improved becomes free. We have brought about a twenty-year effort to ex-teriorize down to a point where it can be done in about twenty seconds. We have found what prevented the efforts of Dharma from being perfect; we have found the totality of what barri-ered Buddhism. Here we are in a society which in actual fact is only bolstered in its culture by Dharma and Buddha, with the problem wrapped up. Now don’t be amazed that you’re having trouble carrying the word. Don’t be amazed at all because the fate of missionaries and so forth carrying the word that there is a – man is a spiritual being and that sort of thing, has been rather grim. But notice that the missionary was many vias departed from the truth. Notice this. Notice that he had some bank connected with his action, very thoroughly. It wasn’t very clean truth. It’s not a condemnation of Christianity. Anybody Clear knows what I am talking about. They went around – they went around telling people they had to do this and do that and the other thing and they were using bank words. Now these chaps didn’t have a sufficiently pure version of it to do more than take over the society. That is about the limitation of it. They have civilized it to a very, very marked extent. They’ve done a terrific job of it and so on. But to bring a society up that is no more"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 9 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 115 06.02.10 cultured than this one – and as far as man’s treatment of man is concerned, this culture is about as high as a cat fight. It is a scientific barbarism, I assure you. Now the reason they didn’t get any further than that is they were a little bit too far from the truth. There were too many vias, you see? There was the via of Buddhism to Socra-tes, to Christianity, to organized Christianity, to the various arguments of Christianity to – you see? And they were weak to that degree. Now compare this, compare this with the Bud-dhist spread within living memory, three-quarters of Asia. Very fast. But he was close to home on the subject of Dharma. You see, he was capitalizing on Dharma, that wisdom would make you free. This carries with it some interesting implications. It carries with it the implication that there is a possibility to be free. You see that itself is a terribly hard thing to teach men. But Asia knew it. Asia already had then a spiritualism and a religious background. And he capital-ized on that and three-quarters of it – zoom, bang! Three-quarters of Asia. That’s on exterior-ization, which is an incidental, but the final result of, Scientology. Now perhaps the speech in which all this was given was a little more flowery, perhaps there was wisdom, perhaps a lot of things. But the truth of the general situation is that no mat-ter how information is conveyed, if it is conveyed at all and it is truth it will take root. So I don’t look for you to go for the next 10,000 years before Scientology bites, you see, I don’t look for you to have to wait that long. I would say that the largest scope possible one could imagine for this particular society and so on, basing it on other things and not giv-ing anybody any pats on the back including me, the absolute outside will be something on the order of half a century. You see if Buddhism could go that far in that span of – short span of time, on the lim-ited result producible by Buddhism and the rather barbaric atmosphere in which Buddhism was spread – was actually a little more barbaric than the atmosphere in which we exist today. And I would say that if you take a half a century to get Scientology around, you’re really slow, man. You notice I said \"you.\" Now, what are you then attempting and what are you achieving with a being? You’re capitalizing, in the first place – as you first address this being – you’re capitalizing on the past indoctrination and belief of the being. That’s important for you to recognize. Because you will very often get a terrible shock that in your inability to communicate any part of Scientol-ogy, recognize what you’re communicating up against. It was like – it was like a Scientologist we had down in Central Africa. The govern-ment was engaging on some groundnut program or something of the sort – it was another wisdom. But they were teaching soil erosion to the African. A Scientologist went in on the project. They were in despair. They couldn’t teach the African to, you know, prevent his soil from eroding. They thought that was – terrible. And a Scientologist went in on it and he found out what they weren’t teaching him, they weren’t teaching him the basic fact that soil should be preserved. As soon as they started utilizing that as an idea, why then the program made some progress. Well, you’re going to walk into people who have not heard the teaching of Dharma."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 10 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 116 06.02.10 Now of course you’re going to walk into everybody you meet practically and they never heard of Dharma. But somehow or other, the wisdom of Dharma has not come up through the line. You run into them every once in awhile. \"Well, what do you want to teach the people for?\" There’s one zone where there’s a horrible revolution going on right at the moment, it’s not a battle, it’s just an underground cat fight going on in the middle of South America. Where the ricos in that immediate area who have been used to hiring the peasants for nothing and letting them live and die like pigs, you see, that these ricos have been walked in on sideways by the philosophy of Dharma. And it came from someplace and the peasants all of a sudden have got the idea that they ought to become educated so they could become free. And all hell is breaking loose because the ricos are trying to keep them from learning anything now and their economy is all going to pot, and they’re going through the entire con-vulsion that old Yea-and-Nay Plantagenet went through in his days and so forth when the monks would get around and make certain people into clerks and this was not really thought well of amongst the feudal barony. God knows what would happen if, and it sure as hell happened and fast, the philoso-phy of Dharma got to them and there sat King John signing his name on the Magna Carta. That is direct – direct dissemination of that information. It’s interesting, it’s – that one piece of philosophy: You become educated, you’ll become free. The church had come in here, they had educated people to read and write. They had introduced manuscripts – you couldn’t say they had introduced books – and they’d been chipping around at the edges here for some time. And all of a sudden, why, not only had people become more educated but people became free. We have an example of it, a horrible backfire of this in 1936 in the Spanish Revolu-tion. Now the Spanish Revolution was really begun by the philosophy of Dharma. You say, oh heavens, how can you possibly connect those up? Very easy. The paperback was imported into Spain in the decade previous to that revolution for the first time. And cheap literature and the translations of the works of all the great French and English writers had occurred in Spain. And up to that time there was the ricos and the pobres, the rich and the poor, and there wasn’t any other strata of society. And as soon as the poor started assimilating and were able actually to buy books out of their pay, you see before – never before could they do this, before sometime in the twen-ties. And they could actually buy books. And they started reading Balzac and they started reading Spinoza and – and where were these fellows, you know? And they said: \"We know something, we should now become free.\" They instantly: boom! And that was mostly because they had considerable resistance to their freedom. That’s the philosophy of Dharma, see? That’s a – that’s a fact. You notice that it is a fact? Well, that was Dharma’s discovery. Now, where you are going to fail is that somebody doesn’t know soil should be pre-served. They don’t know that wisdom sets anybody free and of course when you’re dealing with a somewhat fascistic governmental hierarchy, the last thing in the world they want is a free people or an educated people. And when you see education being skimped and frowned upon and so forth then you know what type of a government you’re dealing with. It’s a gov-ernment which has not yet reached the state where it has heard of Dharma. Or it’s suspicious,"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 11 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 117 06.02.10 having maybe heard of it, it’s a suspicious that the phenomenon will occur and people will become freer. They don’t want anything to do with this. They don’t want anything to do with the philosophy and they are suppressive to the philosophy of Dharma, that people should be-come wise and therefore can become free. Now, you’re just cutting in too high. Now you’re talking, in the main here in the West, to a Christian people who have heard of the soul but unfortunately it is an owned commodity that one should not play with. And when they speak of \"their soul\" they are not speaking of themselves. And therefore there’s a bit of counter-philosophy to the situation. But these are the points you have to solve. They are stunned at the idea that somebody could exteriorize, so they are really not up to Buddha. They have gone past Dharma but have not arrived at Bud-dha, and it is to those people that you are teaching Scientology. So you have to be careful not to go in over their heads. Now fortunately, fortunately they do agree with the gradation scale of Release. And when you talk to them about exterior-ization, you’re actually talking to them about something that doesn’t make any sense to them on the subject of OT. Now you mustn’t talk to them about OT. Now you can talk to them about Clear. They understand Clear, although they don’t know anything about Clear. That’s a very peculiar thing. But they understand that a fellow does not have barriers to his thinking. They understand that and they think that would be great. So all you have to do is teach them that man shouldn’t have barriers to his freedom in the form of his mind and that technology exists to move him up from that. But do you know there are so many undercuts to that that you could teach him, many undercuts. And the first one actually, it isn’t factual that Dianetics is the first undercut, the public will accept Dianetics, but it’s a relatively enlightened public that would accept Dianet-ics. Dianetic processing actually belongs below Zero. And the old Dianetic co-auditor type rating and the Hubbard Dianetic Auditor actually belong below the – what we now call a Hubbard Recognized Scientologist. And the degree is by the way, being revived just for that purpose. But you’re already talking at a very enlightened level. The levels of Scientology will be more easily assimilated by the public at large if we speak of Grade 0 as a recognition – ah, pardon me – a communication process, a communica-tion, a Communication Release. Just to put that a little more distinct. They can get the idea that it’d be perfectly all right to have somebody communicate better. Now that’s easily ex-pressed. And he’s released from an inability to communicate. Now they immediately want you to apply that to stammerers and backwards children and people who can’t talk and so forth, and this gives you some difficulty because they them-selves are standing there, about as tongue-tied with noncommunication as they can get, telling you that would be fine for backward children and stammerers or something. And you’re not quite up to that, don’t you see. A man could communicate more freely. Now our next level here, Level I, they could understand that man does better if he doesn’t have problems, perhaps they could understand that. And so you could go on up the line and there’s a high probability there of the – of making a communication or a connection with the situation. Comprehension, trying to get people to comprehend what you’re talking about. But I stress to you again the fact that wisdom brought about freedom is the basic idea"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 12 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 118 06.02.10 on this chain. Now do you see what I am getting at? Now that releases a man from imprison-ment by ignorance. And that is your first form of Release. You teach a person that if he learns something he would be freer. And when he has learned that he is then released from the idea that he can’t know. So that is really your earliest stage of release. And I would thoroughly advise your trying to argue with people on the basis of the first premise which is that of Dharma and which is the direct and immediate ancestor of Scientology. You see? There’s your fundamental. Now of course you couldn’t tell a fellow named Smitty1 that he ought to teach all of his Africans population anything because he would instantly sense something would be very wrong with all this, and he would start to feel very hunted. He would be – feel hunted in the extreme. And so we find in that country there is no free education anywhere – anywhere. It is all very expensive. There is one little school, it has two hundred and some children in it, most of them Africans and it’s taught by an American named Howitz down there and they’ve even had him up before the high court for daring to teach Africans for nothing, you see. So they dimly feel that there might be such an idea that wisdom makes one free. But if that idea exists they’re agin [against] it, do you see? They don’t want anything to do with that idea, not even the idea of it. So that is your first level of Release that is meaningful to you. Now of course there is a lower level of Release that if you’re going to work with animals or something like that, you’re going to find out that there’s a lower level of Release. It is simply getting the idea it’s a sort of a lower harmonic of a Communication Release; it is simply getting the idea that one animal could in actual fact express an idea to another animal. And I dare say you’re going to find some races at some time or another someplace who do not yet have that idea. So that would be a lower level of Release. But it isn’t common now so I’m neglecting it. Now you have to know you’re in something before you can get out of it and that is the main difficulty in communicating levels of Release. That’s – it’s very interesting, I mean you do, you have to know you’re in something before you can get out of it. And people are not aware of the mind. They see another bloke, they don’t see any mind. The psychiatrist goes scratching his ribs up to the person and cuts out a big section of his skull and sees a brain. So he says there is no such thing as a mind. He does, he says this – bang! Because all he can see is a brain. Well, the brain is just a neural shock absorber; it has very little to do with thinking. The number of maps I have seen of the various things which are found in various parts of the brain are only amusing by their numerousness, because they’re all different. The way the research was done originally was silly. They took wounded soldiers who had lost certain portions of their faculties or expressions and so on, and found out where the head wound was and then, you know, one case at a time, just one case for each thing, you see? If they were shot in the left side of the head then they would say, well, speech is con-tained in the left side of the brain, you see, because the fellow was wounded there and he couldn’t talk. I know a lot of fellows who’ve simply been kicked in the pants that can’t talk. [laughter]   1 Editor's note: reference to Ian Smith, Prime Minister of Rhodesia from 1964 to 1979"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 13 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 119 06.02.10 Now your basic sweeping agreement, then, is something the society has already ac-cepted. And that is that a person can become a Release or become more free or become re-leased from some of his travail on the idea of becoming wiser. Now that’s why you find phi-losophy is such an agreeable statement to people, when you try to – try to tell them about Sci-entology as a philosophy. Because you’re simply telling them of the philosophy of Dharma. Now your next level of Release that was acceptable to the world at large – that man is a spiritual being. Now that is in decay. That has been known and has been suppressed, and has been suppressed since 1879, Professor Wundt, Leipzig, Germany. I always like to re-member the man’s name. Man was an animal and he was nothing but an animal and therefore it was all right to kill him, maim him, shoot him, do anything you possibly could to him be-cause he was \"Nyaa, no good,\" see? Now this is something like some of the Christian phi-losophy that was advanced in the second or third century A.D., that man was conceived in evil and was evil so it was perfectly all right to kill him, maim him, harm him, do anything you wanted to. Do you see these things as justifications? Justifications for overts, no more than that. So you have the entire, what is laughingly called \"field of philosophy\" – it is a field, too, out there in the rain, man. You have what is laughingly called a field of philosophy em-bracing now uniformly, the idea that they’re dealing with rats or something. Well, they’re not going to make very much progress and they could get themselves into one awful bloody revo-lution. I’m not using that as a swear word, I mean a bleeding revolution. They could, they could be cut down in the streets, man. Because the Christian has not yet found out that the psychologist is an atheist. And there is atheism being taught right in the colleges and there’s a bunch of bigoted Christians going to find out about that someday and they’re going to get mad. Fortunately for psych... for psychology it is such an inarticulate subject that it hasn’t made itself sufficiently plain to be understood that it’s an atheistic subject. But if your psychologist were ever to succeed he would have to come closer to the truth than the brain is all that is there, and a man is dead forever. Because it’s very unpopular, very unpopular. But suppressives would like it, and so psychology, psychiatry and things like that tend to be supported by governments rather than by the populace. The populace think anything is better. They think psychology is silly. But governments employ it. So you see suppressives employ these nontruthful subjects or subjects which prevent philosophic ad-vances, or subjects which prevent releasing. So your actual – you’d be surprised how far you could go just doing this – you actu-ally could move in to the whole subject on the subject convincing somebody that man was a spiritual being. See, he’s already halfway agreed with it. \"Well, you’re a Christian, aren’t you?\" \"Oh yes, yes, yes.\" You know he knows better than to say he’s not a Christian. He gets an auto-da-fé. Well, you find even in Christianity – you know the whole subject of reincarnation was barred very recently by the Roman Catholic Church – very recently. Only in the last few hun-dred years. They carried reincarnation right along with them, pockety-pock. They said the guy who hadn’t been good enough had to come back and live it all over again. And somehow or"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 14 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 120 06.02.10 another they dropped that, they had an edict of Scrantes? Or something, I don’t know, some stupid edict by which they abolished wisdom. Now, therefore that man is a spiritual being and not an animal – you could become very involved with as an argument – but if somebody bought the idea, if somebody bought the idea that he was a spiritual being rather than an animal, you have then got a state of Release. He’s released from an untruth that could trap him. Now very possibly – very possibly, this is where you could use exteriorization, but I do not advise it. What’s useful at this point is Dianetics. Because a person goes rapidly back, but it’s a little bit ahead of itself; don’t you see? There isn’t a perfect answer to this. Ah, a guy goes back and only runs so many engrams and there he is sitting on the parapets of the castle, you know, watching the enemy march across the plain. And he says, what am I doing here, this is obviously me. And he makes it up out of his own head that he must be an immortal being because he has lived before quite obviously. Dianetics will bring people up to that point. But, this is a release from this lifetime. A person is released from the very narrow span of just one lifetime. And that is a terrific release because the death of – the terrible consequences of death fall away, he stands around and laughs as the funerals go by, you know. I mean, I remember a long time ago I was – I had to pull off the road – I had to pull off the road down in Arizona to let a funeral go by. And boy, people’s eyes were streaming so that it looked like rain falling out behind that funeral. And boy, everybody was real sad. And I sat there and watched this, you know. And I just got through gauging on some researches into the immortal nature of man, you know. But it suddenly looked so silly to me that I sat there and laughed like a fool for about ten minutes. I couldn’t get the car going again, I didn’t dare drive. It just suddenly seemed so funny. All of this action with regard to this one thing, you see, such a production. And of course it was a very big funeral and a very sad one for a banker. Of course they... I knew he’d never get to heaven. I know he would be back there stirring it up again. Anyhow, you, in that fashion would take people out of the one-lifetime idea. And that is your – a tremendous breakthrough that is available to you because it’s a release from the idea of one lifetime. There is a breakthrough for concentration which is quite acceptable to the society in which we exist. Now people do know, fortunately, there is such a thing as a mind. They’ve been told there is such a thing as a mind and they haven’t been taught well enough to know the psy-chologist is defining the \"brain\" as the mind. So you catch the philosophy which has been put forward to them that men have minds and things go wrong with their minds, that there are mental things about existence, and just redefine it before it takes root. You see? What they mean they’re putting forward this philosophy, is that people have brains which get their neu-rons crossed and you give them biochemical and electrostimuli of some kind or another or surgical stuff; why, you can do something with this brain mass, you see. Well, you move in, just move in ahead of this and you say, \"The mind, well, yes, they’re speaking of mental image pictures.\" \"What?\""},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 15 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 121 06.02.10 \"Well, have you ever had a picture?\" Now you see, A looking at B never sees B’s mind. So it doesn’t come through to him that B has a mind. See, if he’s very, very wog, why he thinks B only has a brain, see, that’s getting pretty wog. Now the only thing you have to put across is that because this fellow has a mind, that fellow has a mind. That’s just a different new observation. Now right on the heels of that will follow that he’s immortal. With a little Dianetic auditing he can’t help but find it out. Do you see? Now you’ve released him from the idea that man is matter. You’ve released him from the idea that he only has one life, and these are stages of Release. Now when you’re teaching people realize that you are working in the field of releasing people. Realize that. That you can in actual fact, by talking to people, release them. But you start crawling up the line here very far and you’re going to run into far more mass – mental mass – than you can easily talk them out of. By the time you get to here, skip it. By the time you get to VI, it would be fatal to try to talk them out of it, and if you tried to talk them out at Class – well that’s, that’s not... All you’ve got to do is pass a despatch with VII materials on it through the lines and you have, \"Where’s Janie?\" \"Oh, she’s in the hospital.\" \"What hap-pened to her?\" \"She came down with appendicitis yesterday.\" \"Well, what happened?\" That’s right, I’m not kidding. I... there’s too much – too much horsepower. Now, the funny part of it is, there’s technology up here that the Clear doesn’t notice. A lot of Clears go suddenly, \"What? What’s this?\" Interest! [laughter] But you should recognize that an ultimate in Release would be a Release from the universe. True. You say, who’s going to fool around with the things that makes the universe. Is somebody going to fool around with what’s making the universe, and so forth, somebody’s going to fool around? You’ll be glad to know that we have now got a policy letter out which forbids destructive actions – [laughter, applause] you see. So you see you can very rapidly go outside of people’s head. What they did in Mel-bourne during that inquiry down there – this guy Peter Williams just cons... insisted on spin-ning people with past lives. He just – all he would talk about was – was Grade V stuff you see, all the way up the line and he’d let them get no subjective reality on it, and it spun them. That was what upset that whole thing. He wouldn’t follow any order I gave him. He’s had himself a ball. Now, recognize then, that when we use the word \"release\" we mean freeing. Now we can free somebody of an idea which enslaves him or entraps him. And recognize that all traps are basically ideas. And if a man can be talked or per-suaded out of a certain idea you have freed him to that extent. So the word release is best un-derstood on the basis of freeing somebody from something. Now as we progress from Grade 0 up – see, I’ve already shown you there are many grades of Release below zero. We are now getting extremely sophisticated when we get to Grade 0. This is a very sophisticated level of Release. We are actually starting to free him from his self-manufactured trap called a mind. And we’re starting to free him directly and intimately as a spiritual being. And we’re working on it right at that point just as surely as though we’re digging a ditch. And we release him from ideas that he can’t communicate and we make a Communications Release."},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 16 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 122 06.02.10 Now the funny part of it is, to do that we’ve got to actually pull him out of a little bit of mass that he is in that tells him he can’t communicate. Do you see? So from here on we’re not only pulling him out of ideas but we’re also starting to pull him out of his own mental mass. Now at this level, Class VII, we don’t pull him out of any more mental mass. We turn around and eat the tiger. We eradicate mental mass. Erase it. Now that of course is again a form of Release that we call Clear; it means he’s cleared the being of his reactive mind. But we note he’s still in the universe. He’s still associated with a body, he’s still in the universe and still this and still that. In other words, there are some grades of Release above this. But in actual fact that is such a triumphant level for a man to attain that you find not many people below it look any higher. It’s quite adequate, it’s big. It’s quite absolute – very nearly absolute. Now when you see on this meter, this needle somewhere between 1.9 and 3.25, we will allow for the slight vagaries of your setting the trim knob, [laughter] and you see this needle get floppy and it’s a little bit hard to set this for a moment – SHUT UP! [laughter] Be-cause you released him from something. Now of course you probably have to know why, to get him through Qual. [laughter, applause] That is really too bad. But you would best do it from your auditing notes not from the pc. Now accidentally anywhere from the moment that the guy hears about the fact that wisdom will make him free on up to some idea that he is a spiritual being, on up through to a Grade 0 or a I or a II or somewhere up the line, the guy at any time may blow out of his skull. You may even find somebody that isn’t in one. He’s very surprised why other people are in their heads. Horrors! I’ve actually run into one or two. You’ll actually run into this thing called an exteriorization. Now that is a relatively premature manifestation which will remain very unstable. Now most states of Release have a certain degree of stability and those which we have listed and those that I’m talking to you about have stability of a sort. Of a sort. The guy’s ideas get invalidated, he gets invalidated that he’s a spiritual being, somebody chops him up somehow or another, he gets suppressed, something like that, and he gets over the idea, and so on and he ceases to manifest as a Re-lease. But wait a minute, he is actually not as bad off as he was before. A Release never unre-leases to the same degree of Stygian dark that they were in before they got released. Now this, then – this then is what we mean by Release. What we mean by Clear is an erasure of the mental mass which inhibits their thinking, postulating, and so on. You should see a Clear postulate on a meter; it’s very interesting. I’ve got a couple of Clears right now that are doing a little bit of fooling about with the first part of the OT course and they’ve skipped a couple of steps in the OT course and now they are finding various banks. It’s very interesting – it’s very interesting because they really have not discovered that they’re quite capable of postulating a bank. So after they postulated it they haven’t bothered to blow it. That’s very silly. I received, almost hilarity, a report, two reports from two of them, and I obediently checked them out. It was quite obvious what they were. They have not realized they are very skilled people, they can make a bank. [laughs]"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 17 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 123 06.02.10 Now this is what you are doing with human beings. These are the states you are at-tempting to achieve with a human being. These are the manifestations of having achieved it. The E-Meter in the early days I used: \"Ahh, no kidding! Hey!\" And that would be a Release. And in the early days this was so good that a Dianetic Clear – we’re making them now, we’re making Dianetic Clears again. I’ve gotten two or three thank-you despatches and things like that. We’re making Dianetic Clears. But of course a Dianetic Clear is actually merely a Re-lease and unfortunate, but they strangely enough have approximately the same manifestations that are described in Book One. And the way we started making them again is we stopped overauditing. Man was making his Releases too well. It’s something on the order of: you make a Release, this guy becomes – let me talk at – about it at a lower level. The guy got the idea completely, he’s got it now, \"Hey, you know, gee! That’s true! That if I knew more I would be freer. Gosh! That is right!\" you know? And you start teaching him that if he knew more he would be freer. Now at the moment he realized that and you had him on this meter his needle would have floated. And his needle would have floated quite handsomely. But if you’d continued to teach him, his needle would have ceased to float almost right away. Now what fools you is that a Release, a lower level releases – now let me get this mystery explained for you. A lower level Release is released at the level they’re released at. And there are higher levels of Release to be attained. And they don’t so much relapse as go into the sticky plaster of the next level that they are going to have to climb to get all the way out. Do you see? So they in actual fact, in auditing very rapidly – unless you just suppress them by con-tinuing to audit the same gain which they already have which is sort of an ARC break, not acknowledgment or so forth. But when they walk out of that session and come back in the next morning and they haven’t got a floating needle, realize they have simply moved up into the mass of the next strata they should be released in. They haven’t unreleased. You under-stand that? So don’t overrun them and don’t get worried that they fold up awful fast. As a matter of fact I’ve considered it sort of – sort of like the Indian, you know. He has several different types of pony. And you’ve noticed all the Indians’ horses along a hitch rack and these Indians’ horses will be tied with different knots of greater and greater complication until you finally get to a knot which is very complicated that’s tying up this one pony. Well, this one at the end – the other end, you see, he’s just a dunce because he can – he can’t even untie just dropping the reins across the hitch rack, you see? But this other one up at the other end, he’s such a clever pony that he can untie any kind of knot anybody could dream up so they have to tie the most complicated knots anybody ever heard of to get the pony to stand there, you see? And they call him an enterprising pony. Now, if you have a Release who for some reason best known to man or beast, insists on staying there with a floating needle for days and days and weeks and months and if you were to pick him up a year from then and still find his needle floating, I would tell you you had a very unenterprising pony. [laughter] He’s become smarter so he should become specu-lative at that point. Because it’s quite natural sequence – these sequences of Release. And if he was able to think or act, to look around at all of course, he would dive into the next level very promptly."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"RELEASES AND CLEAR 18 SHSBC-438 – 16.8.66 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 124 06.02.10 Now does this make the whole subject of Release seem a little clearer to you? I hope it does because the next audience I have to tell: \"When a needle floats and goes free you stop the process, and that is proper end phenomena for any conversation or any process anyplace up to Grade VI,\" I’m going to collect a dollar apiece from them. Be – watch it! Don’t be part of that audience. But that’s what barriered the way. Not knocking it off and not acknowledg-ing the fact that such states existed. Now in this lecture you could probably also find ways and means of dissemination, you could probably spot your errors of dissemination. I don’t say that there aren’t additional methods of dissemination, but I’m just pointing out those that have been startlingly successful and which in actual fact, are the dominant points of philosophy in our society today. Where they are lacking the society is barbarous and where they are present the society is advanced. Therefore you could fully expect a society to get very barbarous on psychology since it has yet to assimilate the principles of Buddhism. That tells you how backward any race is, is how far have they moved up that line. Now, the other – the other thing that is interesting to note before I close is that Re-leases seem to want other people to be released and Clears want other people to be cleared and all of this is very heartening. If that fact – which is quite accidental – did not exist, and so forth, why the whole of the race would be hopelessly lost. And if man were not basically good it would be extremely dangerous to improve him. Improve his abilities, would be very dan-gerous. But he happens to be basically good. Anybody who tells you basically – man is basi-cally evil, of course is fixing you up so that you then will be afraid to make somebody good. Now you can have a great many qualms about clearing or releasing even, somebody who is a benighted villain. Should I release him? Well, don’t – don’t worry about his activi-ties after he’s released because these will be better. His abilities will be better but so will the nature of his activities. Don’t worry about that, worry about it on the basis of, has he got a good enough statistic that I’m going to do him this much favor. And don’t release people to make them better for other people’s sake. It is something which is a reward, it is not some-thing which has to be done. And that is why I always object to Dianetics and Scientology be-ing used only on backwards children classes, because I think the geniuses in the class are really the ones who need it. Now, therefore, I hope this will be of some small use to you when you find yourself sitting there looking at somebody and he has just asked you this embarrassing question: \"What is Scientology?\" Maybe if you remember this lecture it will help you know where to chip in, at what moment and what to tell him about. Thank you very much. Thank you."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":" SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 125 06.02.10 THE ROAD TO TRUTH A lecture given on 1 November 1962 All right. Here we are, lecture two, Saint Hill Special Briefing Course, 1 Nov. AD 12. I could give you a very masterly lecture now on the subject of truth. Truth. You see, I don’t really feel up to it, but that’s one of these histrionic-type activities – giving lectures on truth. I’ve stated it much better in other times and places; I didn’t keep any notes on what I was saying. It’s very difficult. Go around remembering everything, you know, you get stuck. It’s very applicable to talk about truth. If one knows anything about missed withholds or really got the idea of what missed withholds are, why, you have to get some grip on this thing called truth. There was a fellow by the name of Pontius something-or-other; I think he went around washing his hands all the time. He had some kind of a fixation on it. Freudian complex. Be-fore Dianetics. And he asked this \"propoundous propunderance\": \"What is truth?\" And it was a very good thing that he asked that at that particular time: solved everything. But the point here is that truth is a very near ultimate. See, it’s quite close to an abso-lute in its most severe interpretation. And if you were to say that something is true and not know at the same time the Axiom that absolutes are unobtainable, why, you would fall into the error of putting positives where there existed only maybes; and that is a very, very severe error. Ah, there’s been a lot of blokes on the track of one type or another, some of them wearing kimonos and some of them wearing togas and some of them wearing sandals and some of them wearing nothing at all, and these fellows were always going around telling peo-ple what truth is. Chaps like Plato and Socrates and fellows of various moment – philoso-phers, religionists, vast numbers of people – have been peddling a commodity called truth. Well, truth is a relative commodity. And the best approach to truth is contained in a mathematics that you probably will have very little knowledge of and I have very little con-versance with – it’s almost pretentious of me to discuss this mathematics – but it happens to be the mathematics which is used to connect up your telephone switchboards in major cities. It’s how they select out subscribers and so forth; they don’t select them out with arithmetical truth. Arithmetic is a theoretical truth but only so because there’s no commodity or definite-ness connected with it. It is a truth of symbols as long as the symbols remain symbols, and the only errors turn up when people say the symbols mean something and then they get into a great deal of trouble."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 2 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 126 06.02.10 They say, \"Two minus two equals nothing.\" Now, that’s a very true statement as long as it remains totally in the abstract and is not applied to reality. As soon as we say, \"Two ap-ples minus two apples equals no apples\" – I don’t know, I think this is a pretty good magi-cian’s trick. Let’s look it over. A \"no apple\" is a relative thing. What happened to this apple? Well, the chemicals which composed the apple are still intact. I don’t care if it was eaten or boiled or baked or burned or buried, there is still something of an apple. We say, \"Well, there’s two apples on the table, so we take two apples off the table and we have no apples on the table.\" Ah, well, that’s true. That’s true, there are no apples on the table – providing time is right. Providing we can accept time as a truth, which I consider rather adventurous, too. Because there were two apples on the table. So we have to say, \"If there are two apples on the table and we took two apples off the table, there are now, at this moment of mention – which is coincident with the exact removal of and with no reference to the past or future, and with reference only to this table in this place at this time – no apples.\" Now we’re getting much more positive about this, you see? And yet again, that passes as a truth. Well, it probably is, relatively speaking. But the idea of saying, \"Two apples minus two apples equals no apples\" is very, very adventurous indeed, because nobody – no thetan since the beginning of the world – if an ap-ple existed, ever totally as-ised an apple. It presupposes the total as-isness of something. See, it presupposes the perfect duplication of a somethingness. It presupposes all kinds of magic. And yet in the course of fact digestion, study, all that sort of thing, over the trillennia, we have become accustomed to accepting such things as true. Now, the figure two minus the figure two equals the goose egg, nothing. Well, as long as that is an abstract \"think,\" we can say it’s true, but then it’s only true because we have set it up to be true. And the second we write it on the blackboard, we have pieces of chalk now which are representing the symbols. We have the symbols represented by a symbol. There’s a commodity has entered into it and a somethingness has entered into it and it doesn’t go some-place. You ever erase a blackboard? You have to wash it pretty darn hard to get rid of the last problem in arithmetic that was written on it. See, you get all these relative facts, relative truths. Now, the person who adventures out on the road to truth adventures with great desper-ateness. And I wish to pull a long, gray beard at that particular statement because no state-ment about truth was ever relatively truer than that one. A person who would adventure on the road to truth is taking a terribly adventurous step, very adventurous. A philosopher who seeks to teach – discover and teach truth, is taking his life in his hands. And that wouldn’t be very important, that he is taking his life in his hands. What is far, far, far more important than that is he is taking in his hands the lives of a great many other people. Therein lies his responsibil-ity. I’m not speaking about me. I’m just speaking about philosophers. Now, what do I mean by \"It’s a very adventurous thing\"? What do I mean by that? It’s because that is the only track you have to go the whole way on. There is no short stop on the road to truth. That is the only track that you have to go all the way on. Once you have put"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 3 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 127 06.02.10 your feet upon that road, you have to walk to its end. Otherwise, all manner of difficulties and upsets will beset you. There is no such thing as a relative philosophical truth which is safe if it does not ap-proach the actual composition of the subject matter it addresses. Now, to be just a little less pedantic about it, you address the subject of this universe in the subject of the physical sciences – the sciences, and you’re going to find that there are many weird things in your path if you are going to simply address it through the savants of the various (quote) sciences (unquote). Heh! The insouciance of these people, you see, to ac-tually use the word \"exact science.\" It’s an incredible impudence. You walk into the chemistry department, you find one construction of an atom. There it is; it’ll be sitting up there someplace around the department or the laboratory, and it’ll show you the exact relations of molecules, one to another, in any given element. And there it is; it’s all in model form; it’s put together with wires – and students can go and look at that, and they’re all very fine. And that student will be perfectly all right unless he goes over to the physics department. Because in the physics department they have an entirely different model and that is the same molecule of exactly the same element. This is marvelous to behold because these two departments are, each one, departments of \"exact science.\" And yet they are very often across the hall from each other. The student gets very confused. He goes into the chemistry department and if he doesn’t say, \"The atoms are composed this way, that way and the other way,\" he’s gonna flunk, man! And he goes across the hall and here’s an entirely different model, has no relationship to the first model, and that is the atom of the same element that he’s just been studying. And he’s going to get flunked in physics if he doesn’t say it’s that way! I think that’s very fascinating. These are exact sciences, are they? In the Encyclopaedia Britannica at the turn of the century, there’s an article there about time and space which is highly informative. A very wise man wrote that article. And he said he didn’t think many people will ever find out very much about time and space until they studied in the field of the mind and got the conceptual basis which preceded time and space. Now, that’s in the Encyclopaedia Britannica at the turn of the century. With that much wisdom confronting them, you would have thought that the exact sci-ences then would have pursued some interest in where all this came from. But their mud the-ory got in their road; they got all stuck up with it, you know? And there was that mud theory. And, oddly enough, it isn’t even a new theory. It is found – oh, I think, about three thousand years ago in India, is the origin of our modern, \"exact science\" mud theory. And I think it originally was described \"and it was mud from there on down.\" They got tired of explaining all this. Now, there are the boys with their exact sciences and their exact truths, and they’re playing with fire. Actually, it may be called \"exact science\" to them, but when they start tell-ing people that these are truths, that these are absolutes, and then make a model of the atom one way in the chemistry department, and make it the other way in the physics department, I think it’s time for somebody to decide they didn’t know what they were doing."},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 4 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 128 06.02.10 The world right now is in most of its trouble because of the (quote) advances (un-quote) in the field of physics. In the field of physics they know how to blow something up but not how to keep it from blowing up or retard its blowing up at a distance. See, they have all the overt weapons but none of the preventions for those weapons. I consider this very fasci-nating because before you build an atom bomb, you should have built a sane man. A sane man precedes the structure. Now, you have a subject known as workable truth. If you put glue on one piece of pa-per, you can make it stick to itself or another piece of paper; and that’s a workable truth. You can use that. Post Office Department uses it to keep stamps on envelopes and – all kinds of uses for this, you see? If you dig a hole through a mountain, you can pave the bottom of the hole and cars don’t have to drive over the top of the mountain. Don’t you see? And a whole series of workable truths go into the construction of this tunnel and this roadway. Those are workable truths. And this gives the \"exact sciences\" (quote) (unquote) a very bloated notion of themselves, because they deal with workable truths. Now, in the field of man, the first workable truth that anybody will try to give you is that \"Nobody can do nothing about him nohow,\" see? \"Nothing can be done about it.\" No truth exists in this field. \"Man is an animal based on chemistry.\" Where the hell did that come from? It’s an animism2 of some kind or another. It’s some kind of an odd theory or philoso-phy that grew up in a revulsion against the control by religion of men’s faith. Psychology – psyche-ology – is a study which is peculiarly religious and is entirely and completely so up to 1879 when a fellow by the name of Wundt at Leipzig, Germany, con-cluded that men were animals and had no psyches. And he has taken off from the point of no psyche as a theory – but just mud – and has gone forward and you have your modern psy-chology. Don’t let anybody tell you that modern psychology is a product of the physical sci-ences. Psychology, in general, is totally a product of man’s religion of yesteryear; the only place it’s been taught has been in seminaries. You get 1515, faculty psychology is taught in religious universities. You get Saint Thomas Aquinas, 1200 and something, writing textbooks on the subject and so forth. This was entirely a religious affair. Well, nobody moved in on it sensibly; somebody moved in on it in a spirit of revolt, just like religion has been blown up here and there down the track, as the years have rolled on, by the advances of the exact sciences, so-called. There had been an awful war in these two things. So the exact sciences have now entrenched themselves in a total falsehood in the field of the mind, at the same time developing a totally unworkable psychology to back up the ex-act science of blowing up the planet. Isn’t that an interesting area to dead-end? Well, that gives you some of the liabilities of embarking on the track to truth and not going toward truth. Now, Buddha – Gautama Siddhartha – nobody should say any hard words about this man, because he told everybody he was just a man, he was trying to set men free and he was   2 Editor's note: Maybe a pronunciation error and LRH wanted to say \"animalism\"."},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 5 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 129 06.02.10 trying to help people out and so forth. And all that was perfectly true. And he discovered how to exteriorize without being able to stably exteriorize, without discovering any of the rules or laws of exteriorization, without making it possible for anybody else to exteriorize at will. How many hundred million people, since twenty-five hundred years ago until now, did Gautama Siddhartha totally condemn to utter and complete slavery by not walking down that road all the way? Because that – those half-truths have been used and used and misused and abused and booby-trapped and monkeyed up and so forth. That’s merely because he didn’t go all the way down the road, don’t you see? Now, knowing this sort of thing, it takes a rather brave man to walk in the direction of truth because he knows very definitely that he must go on down the road. If he knows any-thing at all, he realizes that the traps of existence and the upsets of existence are composed of half-truths, and that all work to amuse or enlighten or something is susceptible to being em-ployed in the field of enslavement. The slave makers always use it; it serves as the mechanism to trap by the two-way flow, don’t you see? Somebody comes along and want to set everybody free and naturally the reverse flow on it is to trap everybody. One has to recognize this as an action. Well, we take this fellow, Aesop. You’ve heard all about Aesop; you’ve read about the fox and the grapes, and you read about all kinds of Aesop’s fables of one kind or another. Now, I’m sure that you are today a much more moral person, and much better for it. The only trouble is that the original manuscripts of Aesop were recently located and there’s not a moral in the lot. They are just amusing stories about animals. There is no final lesson in any one of the stories. Every one of those lessons has been added to Aesop’s fables. And we today are accustomed to think of the moral as a sort of an Aesop’s fable thing, you see: he tells a parable and that teaches us to be good. And that wasn’t what Aesop’s fables were; they were simply something to amuse people and lighten the tedious hour. I think it’s quite wonderful. It even enters the field of fairy tales. Now, all of this is extremely – not apparently very pertinent to what you are doing, but in actuality it is, because in the microcosm of a single human being, of the single person, you have the pattern of the macrocosm of the universe. And one could deduce that the universe exists from a series of basic postulates and proceeds on down the line in development from those postulates. You could even spot the goal of gold, the goal of lead. You could even spot the methods of livelihood of quartz, serpentine schist, hornblende, to name some combined elements – the rules of what they do. It’s not that these things are alive at all; it’s that they follow a certain dictated behavior pattern. I was sitting looking at a fly this morning while I was eating breakfast. And he washed his face in exactly the way that all flies have washed their face for a long time. And he fixed up his wings in exactly the way flies fix up their wings. And I thought, \"I wonder how many hundred trillion scrillion quadrillion flies have washed their face that way.\" And I thought to myself, \"By golly, it’s wonderful the way some postulates stick.\" [laughter]"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 6 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 130 06.02.10 You get dead matter, the world of insects, lichen, moss, man – it doesn’t matter; you’re actually looking at the same cumulative structure based on certain intentions and dedi-cations. The whole world of chemistry could be reanalyzed on the subject of postulates and intentions. The world of physics could be similarly analyzed. Instead of sitting there wondering how many \"microjilts\" are supposed to be imposed into the ohm, an electronics man would much better spend his time, if he really wanted to make some progress, in an effort to analyze the pattern of intention which goes up and con-structs a certain power behavior. What is this? And if he could grasp that, then he would grasp electricity. But he shirks his duty by the simple reason that the first statement made to him, as he walks into his polytechnic school or as he joined his Boy Scout troop – doesn’t matter where he connects with this stuff called electricity, he always connects with it – and his first postulate on it is \"Nobody knows what electricity is.\" And this is said to him as though it means something. I think that’s wonderful. In fact, everybody knows this statement, but exactly what have they said? Analyze what they’ve said. They’ve made a remark. They haven’t said anything. They’ve just remarked something. They haven’t even given anybody any reason why nobody should; they haven’t told you nobody could. They just say nobody knows anything about it. Of course, everybody is willing to agree that everybody is stupid, so they let it ride. That’s the craziest thing I ever ran into: \"Nobody knows what electricity is.\" I imagine that’s taught that way in Japanese today; I imagine it’s taught that way in Swedish, German, French, Italian, to say nothing of English. It’ll be soon taught that way in Africanese, Ghana-ese, or whatever they talk down there. I can hear it now: \"Now, this stuff that goes snap, crackle and pop – you see it here, you know; goes snap, crackle and pop. Well, now, the first thing you should know about this\" – they always say this, you see – \"the first thing you should know about this, is that nobody knows what it is.\" Well, that effectively keeps one from entering any road of truth; that just puts one in a bracket where he can be shocked, blown up, exploded, fried, where he can run out of batter-ies, where he can go out in the cold morning and start to start his car and not have one start. The direct and immediate results of this statement are everywhere around us today. Well, that isn’t a road that has not been walked down; that is a road that is effectively barred. Everybody said by inference that you can’t walk down that road. That’s the wildest thing I ever heard of! And yet people have been telling people they couldn’t find out about truth for a long time. And the only reason I really make fun of Immanuel Kant is the outrageousness of his premise. I’ve even used some section of it – to my shame, but I’ve really used it – but it’s nice stuff to explain with. You say to somebody, \"You don’t have to know – to begin this subject and to look it over and get some result in it – you don’t have to know the totality of every-thing before you can begin on it.\" You know, in other words, you don’t have to have walked the whole path before you start to walk the whole path. Well, to that degree, \"the unknow-able\" has some use."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 7 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 131 06.02.10 But Immanuel Kant didn’t use it that way; he used it entirely differently. He said there was the knowable and there was the unknowable; and he said the unknowable ain’t never gonna be known by nobody. And what I want to know is how did he find out about it? [laugh-ter] And yet people at this minute are sitting in universities in the world listening with rev-erence and awe to those outrageous words: that there’s an unknowable that nobody will ever know anything about. That’s one to really tangle with, man. It’s outrageous even by philoso-phic examination. If you can’t ever sense it or experience it or be in time with it or have any clue of its existence, then how do you know it exists to not be known about? Now, I think you will find that there is a considerable effort on the part of man, wit-tingly or unwittingly – aberratedly, certainly – to say that certain roads are closed and that those roads must never be opened. \"It is very bad to know about the human mind.\" Well, let me tell you something: if you’re alive, you know something about the human mind. And I’ll tell you what’s dangerous: is never to find out any more about it. That’s dangerous! And man today faces that danger. And in just the last few days – just the last few days – the cobalt 60 was very close to spreading its fallout far and near over the steppes of Russia, and \"made in Moscow\" (or its suburbs) was about to be scattered, trademarked on scrap iron, all over America.3 Because of what? Because it is so dangerous to begin to know anything about the human mind. Now, people recognize that it is dangerous to some degree, but don’t really realize what really is dangerous. Because they know of the existence of something, not to know all about that thing is dangerous. And they are conceiving that they don’t know anything at all about it. And let me propose that to you as the most idiotic premise in the field of the human mind. There’s little Joe Blow down here. And you say, \"Do you understand women?\" He says, \"Hell, no. No man’d ever understand women.\" He says, \"You can’t figure them out. One day they’re this way; one day they’re that way.\" You ask his wife, and you say, \"You understand anything about men?\" She said, \"Yes, they’re a pipe. You know what they’re doing. You know what it’s all about. Except you never get your way.\" What are they talking about? What are they talking about? They’re talking about knowing something about somebody’s mind, aren’t they? Somebody’s behavior pattern, aren’t they? In other words, they’re aware of the existence of think, figure, calculate, in other beings. Well, that has already started on the road to research and knowledge in the human mind; and it is very dangerous to go no further. So where do we get this thing if you embark upon a line of truth as a special action only proposed or done by a few select individuals. No, it’s the shopkeeper and the bus driver and everything else. They’ve all started to know something about it. But it would be very   3 Editor's note: This refers to the Cuba Crisis which reached its climax in the late October of 1962."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 8 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 132 06.02.10 dangerous indeed. In fact, it will cause their deaths not to know any more about it than they do. I mean, that’s such an acceptable fact to you, it doesn’t even seem to be a startling fact. Not knowing any more about the mind than they do will bring about their demise. They will die from this! Everybody says, \"Yes, of course.\" You see how accepted it is? And yet it’s quite a startling fact. They’re going to get an ultimate extinction through starting upon this stupid line. But let’s take a specialized case where a group of individuals decide to go for broke on the subject of knowing about the human mind. They’re going to make a clean break; they’re going to go through this, and they’re going to go down the line, and they’re going to know all about this, and somebody amongst them is going to tear the answers up left and right, and dig them out from underneath this and that and the other thing, and they’re really going to make some progress along that line. Listen, the more they know, the less dangerous it is. The really dangerous entrance point is to suppose that people think, and know nothing more about it than that. That’s dangerous! Not to walk off that point further in the direction of truth, is a dangerous action. But any philosopher who singles himself out, or any engineer or any research person who singles himself out as the person who is going to be spotted as the person who is walking that track – now, that becomes very, very dangerous if this person doesn’t walk the whole track. See, that’s selectively dangerous. You share in some of that dangerousness. It’s been so booby-trapped that everything is very suspicious of anything being known, because people who have jumped up and said something is known, have very often lied. Now, if they have pretended to know more than other people on this subject, they have then committed overts. And if they have then turned up some little piece of bric-a-brac and have never gotten any further than that, but spread this bric-a-brac in all directions as \"the true wisdom,\" they have committed the overt of committing perhaps millions or billions of human beings to slavery. And I think that’s a considerable overt. So there’s no substitute for walking the track. You’ve got to go on down that road, particularly in a spot such as mine. You got to bring this off, man. Now, there’s never been any doubt in my mind about bringing off this particular study. This is not something I have engaged in any doubts about. I’ve sometimes wondered whether or not the time factor wouldn’t upset things, be-cause we also have another time factor involved over here called a \"world situation\" and I’ve needed a few clear years, and that has sometimes worried me a little bit. But the fait accompli was pretty easy to envision, because we’d already made the seven-league boot strides necessary to put us way on down the track toward the end of track anyway. But now, if you have a reputation for knowing, you enter into a mechanism known as the missed withhold. And as you go down this track, separate from and distinct from your fellows, as being one specially gifted in the subject of knowing about the mind, you have en-"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 9 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 133 06.02.10 tered into, now, a peculiar liability that has nothing to do with the reaction or liability for simply treading the track of truth. That has nothing to do with that. This is a reputational ac-tion. People think that you know the truth and to them the only truth that exists is themselves. It’s a first dynamic truth; their conception of truth is their own aberrations, misdeeds and ideas of right or wrong conduct. Now, every philosopher has more or less been engaged upon a selection of ideas of rightness of conduct and wrongness of conduct. Particularly the Oriental philosopher has been engaged upon this point. It is totally missing and totally absent from the Western philosopher. He doesn’t much talk about the rightness of conduct. He talks about behavior patterns and he talks about social sciences, and he talks about other things. He doesn’t even talk about eth-nology; this is an almost unknown commodity to him except as he applies this, maybe, to some savage race down on the banks of the Bongo-Bungo. He doesn’t realize that ethnology is equally applicable to a savage race living on the banks of Forty-second Street. He actually doesn’t approach this subject very closely. He talks about behaviors and he wants to get away from this. Well, one of the reasons he wants to get away from this is he’s totally blind to the pos-sibility that there could be an exact right conduct. See, he speaks of a behavior pattern, not a rightness of conduct, whereas the Oriental philosopher, wishing to lead people in the direction of better ways and that sort of thing – Lao-tse, Confucius, particularly – these chaps are fix-ated on the idea of right conduct: the right conduct and the wrong conduct. And it’s to a point where, in Japan, if you drink out of the wrong side of the tea bowl, you know, you’ve practically had it; you’re socially ostracized. There’s another island coun-try where if you don’t cross your knife and fork in an exact way in the middle of your plate, nobody ever invites you to dinner again. These are rightness and wrongness of conduct, and it’s adjudicated in those particular ways. The crux of the situation is that all behavior is built – all considerations of behavior, all considerations of the O/W mechanism, are primarily based on ideas of right and wrong conduct. Back of the O/W mechanism is the idea that right conduct can exist. This is the only saving grace of the human race or of any race of beings. It’s a rather touching thing if you get down and think about it: the idea that right conduct can exist. It’s quite remarkable. Of course, right conduct according to whom? It’s the group mores, your survival fac-tors are put together on this. Your Polynesian with his taboos was trying to maintain a very compact population in an area that raised very little food and therefore was incapable of sup-porting overpopulations and so forth, so he invented a taboo system, and he made a whole series of rightnesses of conduct. Actually, survival is your monitoring factor of rightness of conduct. But it is not that an individual acts for his self-preservation and commits overts be-cause of his self-preservation. That is too direct a look. He commits overts because of sur-vival. It is his rightness of conduct, see? It’s a slightly split-hair difference, if you follow the thing. The behaviorist would try to tell you that it was – he is a – there is a school of activity known as behaviorism; I didn’t refer to that. They try to say that it is totally and only and al-"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 10 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 134 06.02.10 ways a first dynamic existence, and therefore it isn’t survival, it’s self-preservation. And by this, they miss the whole boat. They don’t even put their foot on the gangplank. They hardly even walk up to the right dock, you know, and they go right on off into the river. No boat there. Never intended to be one there, either. I mean, that’s really missing the boat. Because right conduct is always a group activity and is never an individual activity. No matter how much the individual speaks about integrity to himself, it breaks down eventually into a group activity because his ideas of his own rightness of conduct are based on the group to which he belongs. So we get the third dynamic aberration of right conduct as underlying all O/W, under-lying even missed withholds. The only thing senior to it is the pure, pure mechanics of exis-tence: There is a thetan and a thetan does these things, you see? Your very early Axioms are quite unrelative as truths. They’re just about as close to truths as anybody will ever be able to push it, see? They’re right up there pushing the Axiom \"absolutes are unobtainable\" so close that there is hardly any distinguishing it at all. But the aberrations which he then engages upon are his efforts to discover right con-duct: What is right conduct in self? What is right conduct in others? What is wrong conduct in self? What is wrong conduct in others? And, of course, from lifetime to lifetime he lives in different groups and his sets of mores change and change and change and change. So there is no road to truth on the subject of right conduct. You just study nothing but what is right conduct and then take what the group says is right conduct and you’re not going to wind up with truth. Now, if you realize that it’s a search for right conduct and an effort to adhere to codes of right conduct and breaking of codes of right conduct, which then bring about the aberrated condition, then you are walking a road to truth. Now, let’s get this subtle difference; it’s quite important to thee and me. Borrowing liberally from the Book of the Winds and Book of Changes and so forth: Confucius, he say, \"Young man who support elderly parents, he good man,\" see? Well, that’s perfectly all right, right up to the moment when somebody says, \"This is truth,\" because this is not truth! This is only a species of right conduct; it’s only a belief of right conduct. In other words, it’s actually an entrance of arbitraries into conduct. And therefore, if the entrance of arbitraries can be considered truth, I think we’ve all had it. That would make all the laws passed by the US government, the English government, the Chinese government, true. Particularly today, the US government is always trying to legislate truth into existence. I think it’s the most marvelous activity; highly complimentary. I mean, fellows trying to lift elephants with their little finger should always be patted on the back and so forth. But I think it should also be pointed out to them that those elephants are a little heavier than the stress-analysis structure of the small finger. They’re always trying to say their laws are true. They no longer consult the customs of the people in order to pass their cotton-picking laws. And man, how crazy can you get? Where are you going to go for law? Because any law professor I ever had that was worth his"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 11 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 135 06.02.10 salt and was a good Joe always made this practically his first point: Laws are evolved from customs of the people and are eventually solidified in the form of Legislation and become a law of the land. A law which does not so progress either operates as a total tyranny or is to-tally unenforceable. You want to know what’s a tyrannical law or a law you can’t enforce? It’s a law that doesn’t evolve from the customs and mores of the people. That’s unenforceable. Can give you numerous examples of this sort of thing. Prohibition: Somebody came along and said, \"It’s evil to drink.\" I don’t know what the population of the United States was at that time; must have been upwards to a hundred million people. And there were only a few of them who agreed with that. They waited till some ten million men were in uniform, or something like that – or maybe it wasn’t that many – and couldn’t vote at that particular time, and then they passed this law into existence. And these fellows came home and found out that it was illegal to drink and they didn’t agree with this. So Prohibition was a mockery. I don’t know how many lives it cost, how much reve-nue it cost, how much property it destroyed and so forth, and finally even the great and mighty government threw in its sponge – said, \"Lap it up; we can’t do a thing about it.\" In other words, not the whole Army, Navy, Coast Guard and everything else – nobody could enforce this thing. Nobody. It wasn’t borne out of the customs of the people. In other words, it went straight in the teeth of what people considered as right conduct. In those days, if a man was a man he held his liquor. What if there was no liquor to hold? He had no defini-tion for a man. [laughter] In other words, you just pull the rug out, man. Pull the rug out. Well, this concerns you very vitally. At a very – I very seldom talk to you at a high level of theory – but actually does concern you considerably. It does, because all around you, people are determining truth from what people say right conduct is. See, they say, \"Well, you’re supposed to do this and supposed to do that and supposed-to’s, supposed-to’s, sup-posed-to’s, and these things are true.\" I’ll give you one of these data – one of these data that’s very, very interesting – a da-tum concerning kleptomaniacs, developed in the field of psychoanalysis. \"When a kleptoma-niac can’t steal anything, he always burns down the house.\" That’s a scientific datum in psy-choanalysis. You think I’m joking, you know. I never actually throw a total punch in this par-ticular line till I can get these textbooks and open them up and start actually reading them at random. You want to really have a ball sometime, get somebody like Karen Horney, textbook, and sit down with four or five – well, fairly sensible blokes of some kind or another, and just start reading them, with a straight face, from any point in the book forward. Anything I’ve ever said in the field just turns pale. You see, I’m a moderate in this line; I don’t like to exag-gerate. But they won’t believe you. If you sit there with your face toward them, the back of the book toward them, and actually just read out of the textbook, they will not believe that you are reading the latest and best school of psychoanalysis. They’ll think you’re pulling jokes. They’ll think it’s just nothing but solid gag from one paragraph to the next. I finally one day saw an engineer – to a group of engineers that were being treated in this fashion – actually, just in a rage, get up and go around back of the fellow who was read-"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 12 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 136 06.02.10 ing it aloud, and jerk the book out of his hands. And he didn’t even want to read it! And that engineer that pulled the book out of his hands had to actually be forcefully held up against the wall and the book had to be shown to him, and that the person in that chair was actually read-ing exactly what was in that textbook on the subject of psychoanalysis. And when he did, at that moment the engineer, for the first time in his life, realized there wasn’t a science of the human mind extant on the planet. Up to that time the reason he paid no attention to Dianetics and Scientology: he thought there was a science of the mind. Now, that’s one of the primary things that you run into. People have a whole bunch of data over here which are what they’re supposed to do, and these are right conduct – and that to them is truth – and what you’re not supposed to do. For instance, the law defines sanity as the ability to tell right from wrong. I consider this marvelous. In what land? Well, don’t ever try a Zulu in an English court. And don’t ever try to try an Englishman in a Zulu court. Because there’s going to be some things messed up, going to be some withholds missed. Now, here’s your peril (your period of peril is past, to be alliterative): It was over a pe-riod of time as to whether or not – taking you as a unit of truth – you, individually, could have your state of understanding of yourself and those around you materially improved by study and processing. Now, if anybody will sit still long enough and if the auditor will do the right things at the right time, why, this is going to happen today; this is going to happen. You could also carry it out to very nearly an ultimate, very close to it. You can get the fellow back to a point of his total realization and recognition of exactly what he has done and where he has gone – in other words, clearing – and exactly how he’s done it, and how it formed up, and so forth. And if you were to take raw meat and push them up to a three- or four-goal Clear, why, they might not tell you for other people, they might not be able to ar-ticulate it (which is the main trick, after all), but you hand them a book of Axioms and they say at that time, \"Of course. What are you showing me these for?\" Or \"Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, yes, of course, of course. That. Oh, yes, yes. That, right. Of course, naturally. Yeah, that’s right, that’s right, that’s right, that’s – of course. Yeah, that’s pretty good.\" And mostly what they’re saying is \"pretty good\" is \"That’s fairly well stated. Yes, I’d say the same myself if I could.\" All they’re doing really is expressing some kind of an agreement. You’re not teaching them anything, because they now have a subjective reality on it. We’ve got a reverse-end look on this thing and we’re starting at the point which is hardest to start, as everybody is stupid as hell on the subject, see? And originally and basi-cally that included me, see? So you see where we have went to. Now, we are essentially in the business of individuals and you must never forget that. On the road to truth, you are in the business of individuals. I could give you a long and tiradi-ous lecture on the subject of the third dynamic and how it gets loused up, but I don’t think it’d serve anybody’s purpose. Just let me say en passant that most organizations, as they exist on Earth today, exist, in their first instant of genus, on the fact that they could not handle an indi-vidual, one individual. The failure to handle that one individual then brought about, not their demise, but their construction."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 13 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 137 06.02.10 All organizations on this planet today can be evolved from the first moment of failure to handle one individual. They couldn’t handle him, they couldn’t understand him, they couldn’t reach him, they couldn’t help him, they couldn’t solve his problems, and so they set up an organization to do it. That organization directly and immediately evolves from the fail-ure to handle that individual. Now, this doesn’t tell you that this is true of all third dynamic activities. This only says \"Earth,\" and this only says \"aberrated third dynamic activities.\" But it’s an inversion. You’re on the lower scale. You’re way below the first dynamic. They couldn’t handle the first dynamic, so they developed an organization not to do it. Oh, I’ll give you an idea. An organization tends to grow up even around me, to this degree. Yet we’re the one organization or the one activity on this planet at this time that doesn’t follow this. But it gets pulled in toward it every now and then, as you – every one of you – know, to your experience. At some time or another, an organization in Scientology has not given you an answer or sent you a book or done something or served your needs at that particular moment or purpose. See? Well, it’s all based on this thing. It’s just not enough MEST or time or space or speed or something of the sort, in order to have delivered that ser-vice. But we are the only group that would be capable of doing it and that do succeed in it. We are handling the individual. And you will never, in your whole history, handle more than an individual. I don’t care what you’re trying to handle or if you’ve set up a government for the planet. You will only be handling one individual; not one individual multiplied many times. Russia shoots in-dividual and loves the masses. I think that’s quite marvelous. How did they get that way? Well, it’s a total aberration on the subject. You follow what I’m saying now? Now, you can do this if everything you do do, does serve the individual, individually and peculiarly tailored to his needs so that he is not overlooked in the process. But you set up an eddy and an upset every time you have failed to handle one individual. You handle one individual and everything is fine; and you handle – you fail to handle an individual and you will set up an organization to try to do it. You’ll set up all kinds of things to try to do it! You’ll set up all kinds of brutal laws and jurisprudence and everything else to try to do it! Where you have failed to handle an individual, you will set up all sorts of O/W. In Scientology, we’re probably the only organization that has any capability at all of going in the direction of a clear third dynamic, and we’re going in that direction. We use O/W today to park somebody till we can handle him. We never forget we’re handling an individ-ual. And I never forget I’m handling an individual. I’m not handling \"people,\" ever. I’m han-dling you and you and you and you. Because you are truth. I don’t care what you look at as truth to begin with or what you will look at as truth at the end of the line; if there’s any truth to be found, you’re it. If there’s any truth to be known, it’ll be you who will know it. And beyond that and outside of it, there isn’t any truth. Now, you see what I’m talking about as the road to truth?

Don’t worry about that. You won’t suffer from it. People won’t do bad things to you because you don’t know all about them instantly. As somebody just said to me, your confront is very high. A Scientologist’s confront is way up and very often when you look at somebody you almost cave him in, because he says, \"What-what-what does he know about me?\" Well, your only mistake at that point is not to reach him as truth. You are confronting, that moment, a road to truth and you’ve got to travel it because you’ve already started to! You have looked down it! There is many a pc you’ll start to process, or many a human being you will try to tell about Scientology, that you will say, \"Why did I get up this morning! It must have been – I knew something was going to happen, because when I put on my left shoe I found it was de-signed for the right foot. And from that moment on, I could have taken warning and simply gone back to bed. And I didn’t. And here I am arguing with this person in this PE Course. And he’s saying, ‘I understand Ron doesn’t believe – doesn’t believe in God.’\" And you’re trying to make some kind of heavy weather out of it or make conversation out of it or trying to fend off this accusation or trying to straighten it up or handle it – you’re going to find your-self at that moment on the road to truth. Well, I’ll tell you the wrong thing to do, is unload – jump in the ditch. That’s the wrong thing to do. Your success in the future totally depends upon your ability to walk that road and not to jump off of it because all of your disasters anyplace will stem from that exact instant when you failed to walk that road and turned around and did something else and set up an organization to handle this jerk. You see that? Audience: Yes. There’s this guy. He’s saying, \"Well, Ron doesn’t believe in God. And I understand this. I heard this every place. So how can – you can say he’s a truthful man?\" See, this guy knows what truth is. You have faith in the big thetan, see? It’s kind of a 1984 in... with a cross above it, you know? And that’s truth! He’s been taught all his life you must have faith in this thing. He’s been taught that as right conduct. He sees somebody isn’t instantly following down this, and snapping and popping and making the sign of his particular cross. I know of several crosses and how to make several signs of the cross, but we’re not making his sign of the cross. So therefore we are not truth. See, he’s got \"right conduct\" mixed up with \"rightness of conduct is the source of ab-erration,\" and these are entirely different remarks. He doesn’t realize he’s nuts! That’s one of the first things he has to find out. Well, you’re going to find there are many ways to teach him this initial step, and you will fail and you will succeed and you will do this and you will do that. And listen, you will only be wrong – and I’m not now talking about right conduct of a Scientologist; I happen to be talking about survival in the early Axioms at that level – you will only fail if you don’t try, if you don’t make some stab at it. Because if you make some kind of a stab at it, you’ll be surprised; he won’t go away even though if you didn’t handle him in that first fifteen seconds and you put him on the shelf to pick him up somewhere on the track."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"THE ROAD TO TRUTH 15 SHSBC-236 – 1.11.62 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 139 06.02.10 You’ll be surprised. This happens to me every once in a while. I processed somebody one day; he was lying in a sickbed. I thought he was going to die. I thought I flipped the whole thing; I thought it was gone, sunk, that was it. Never processed such a lousy session in my life. You know? I couldn’t even get the pc practically to answer the auditing command. I got him to say it a few times, you know? And I finally patted him on the shoulder and said, \"Well, I hope you’ll be all right,\" and so forth. Tried to put in a little hope factor before I walked out of the room. The man was dying, see? I actually felt bad about it for – you know – a little bit bad about it for several days. I couldn’t get through to the guy. I couldn’t do anything for him, you know, and so forth, and there it was, and his whole life all busted up, and that sort of thing. I almost fell off the top of the HASI steps at Notting Hill Gate – and that was a long flight of steps, if you remember. There was this guy, hale and hearty, just having finished another intensive. He’d been alive and well for two years, and he all dated it from that moment of being processed by me. You’ll many times think you fail when you haven’t. The only mistake you can make is to try to go backwards on this road to truth. It’s not possible without completely caving in. A very, very dangerous thing to do. So this fellow stands up in the PE class, and he says, \"How can you people know any-thing about truth? I understand Ron doesn’t believe in God.\" What are you going to say? What are you going to say? What are you going to say at that moment? Took you by surprise. You didn’t even think he was going to talk! Well, at least be inventive enough to say, \"Well, you know, I think you ought to write him about that. Post box out there in the hall. Next ques-tion.\" [laughter] Well, at least you’ve made a start. At least you’ve done something. The wrong thing to do is to back up and construct an organization which handles masses and never handles an individual. Because it is very certain that if you fail to handle this guy who stands up in the PE Course, if you fail to push home your confront on your friend who says he hates you be-cause you might have missed a withhold on him, if you don’t say to him, \"Well now, just count off the number of times I’ve nearly found out something about you, Joe. Count them off\" – you’re not even asking him what you nearly found out, see? – and press it home. The guy finally says, \"Well, aziziz-da-da-da-umm,\" you know? Shatters him! You say, \"Well, I failed!\" and you probably didn’t. You only fail if you didn’t try. So don’t worry about the fact that you know more about them than they know them-selves. They only stand up to be handled. The only way you’re going to build up some kind of a clumsy, stupid mess of a nonfunctional Scientology administrative system will be totally and completely based on the one guy you didn’t handle; the one case you didn’t solve. Your retreats are all based on that. Now, I can only tell you from this point of view that every once in a while somebody kicks the bucket and goes totally beyond reach. That doesn’t make me feel good but I know very well we’ll pick him up later. That’s all part of the road to truth. Various things happen, various catastrophes occur, people get mad at ...

Truth isn’t to be found there; only agreements. But in the final analysis, there is truth to be found and there is a road to truth. You have that within you and every time you look at a human be-ing you see it in him. And as you know what it is about, the more you know about it, the more you understand it, the less these factors will trouble you. But even the little fellow in the bakery shop who’s doing nothing but wrap up bread has already started on the road to truth. And his only stupidity is he hasn’t got enough sense to keep going. So don’t worry about you being on the road to truth and that it’s a very adventurous line or me being on the road to truth; shucks, we’re almost there. Behind us lies the most thorny, messed-up track you ever saw in your life. Wouldn’t navigate it again for a – for a box of biscuits. But the truth of the matter is, well, we’re there; that road’s behind us. Possibly take us quite a while to sit down and find out where we are, now that we’re there. [laughter] But that’s allowable, too. But we’ll only retreat from our position to the degree that we don’t realize this fact: that you can’t start a case, you can’t embark upon clearing a planet or an individual diffi-dently without to some degree seeing it through to a final conclusion.

Cognition’s are the milestones of case gain. Rough TRs, rough metering, Out Code and a distractive auditor then make no case gain. When an auditor has smooth, usual TRs, does his metering expertly and without at-tracting the pc’s attention, when he follows the Auditor’s Code (particularly regarding Evaluation and Invalidation) and when he is interested, not interesting as an auditor, the pc cognites and makes case gains. Further, according to the axioms, a bank straightens out by as-ising its content. If the pc’s attention is distracted to the auditor and meter his attention is not on his bank so As-Ising cannot occur. The definition of In Session is interested in own case and willing to talk to the auditor. When this definition describes the session in progress, then of course the pc will be able to as-is and will cognite. By THE ORIGINAL THESIS, the auditor plus the pc is greater than the pc’s bank. When the auditor plus the bank are both overwhelming the pc then the bank seems greater than the pc. It is this situation which gives a pc a low Tone Arm. An auditor who can’t be heard, doesn’t ack, doesn’t give the pc the next command, fails to handle origins simply has out-TRs. The auditor who is trying to be interesting to the pc, who over-acks, who laughs loudly, is putting the pc’s attention onto himself. So the pc’s attention, not being on his bank, doesn’t as-is or cognite. The auditor whose metering by-passes F/Ns or calls F/Ns at wrong points, or who tells the pc „That reads” „That blew down” etc., or who any other way uses the meter distractingly (the pc knows when he is being under or over run and knows when he is being mismetered), is of course violating the definition of In-Session. The pc’s attention goes to the meter, not his bank, so he doesn’t as-is or cognite."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"TRS AND COGNITION’S 2 HCOB 26.4.71 I SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 142 06.02.10 Auditor Invalidation and Evaluation is just plain villainy.

A PERFECT SESSION If you understand the exact definition of In-Session, if you understand the pc’s neces-sity to have his attention on his bank so as to as-is it and work out what is really going on in a session that brings about a cognition (as-ising aberration with a realization about life), you will then be able to spot all the things in TRs, metering and the Code that would prevent case gain. Once you see that out-TRs, mis-metering and Code breaks would prevent the In-Session definition you will see what would impede a pc from As-Ising and Cogniting When you have this figured out you will then be able to see clearly what are in-TRs, correct metering and correct code application.

Fine. Good. Well, this is what? Audience: 6th of August. Six August, AD 13. We have three new Instructors today – three new Instructors. No other vast changes are envisaged beyond the curriculum. Now that you’ve caught up all of your checksheets, you see, it’s time to change the checksheets. [laughter] This is inevitable – inevitable. \"That mix-ture which is not shaken stagnates.\" This is was probably the earliest Greek utterance, so we don’t want you to get stagnated. The only changes which you get in curriculum and so forth is the change in W, which has been in a state of flux anyway. And the definition of an auditor is being used in W – and I have found some new ways of milking down a tone arm, getting the bestest and mostest out of that tone arm; getting that tone arm to really wiggle and wobble. That’s very important. And this piece of technology is hand in glove and it all goes back to very basic simplicities. Every once in a while somebody says... And this lecture does concern this definition of an auditor; I’m not going to talk to you too much about the auditing cycle in this. Well, I am going to talk to you about its particular aspects and how an auditor handles it. Every once in a while somebody says, \"Well, why don’t you...\" something or other, something or other, something or other – that’s the crux of the situation – \"Why don’t you change all administrative actions? Why don’t you alter all Central Organizational lines?\" \"Why don’t you...\" so forth. \"Why don’t we change everything in the course?\" and so on. What they’re dealing with is a problem they actually don’t see the breadth and depth of. And that problem is this: The character of this planet and the population hereon makes it practically impossible to do anything with this planet. Now, I’m not taking off from a fail-ure point. The stress and thought and prevention and cure and this and that which you have to go into on this planet to get anything done and running is absolutely fantastic. Now, you want to ask why this is? Well, we can go into that in a moment. But those of you who have on the backtrack an experience of you just get some guys together and you do something – you see? Well, that’s been a common experience, and you still tend to operate in"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 2 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 144 06.02.10 that zone and sphere of influence. In other words, you said, \"Well, it was very easy. We just whistle up Joe, Bill and Pete, and the four of us will go down there and fix up the signboards, and that’ll take care of that,\" see? And you’re all set, see? But that was yesteryear and elsewhere. And you apply that basic feeling to this planet and you’re in trouble at once. Why? This planet is part of a larger federation – was part of an earlier federation and passed out of its control due to losses in war and other such things. Now, this larger confederacy – this isn’t its right name, but we have often called it and re-ferred to it in the past as the Marcab Confederacy. And it has been wrongly or rightly pointed to as one of the tail stars of the Big Dipper, which is the capital planet of which this planet is. Now, all this sounds very space operaish and that sort of thing, and I’m sorry for it, but I am not one to quibble about the truth. This gets in people’s hair every now and then, and I don’t see any point in lying in order to be acceptable. It just doesn’t seem to be a right way to go about things, particularly in the realm of science. I don’t think a scientist should tell a bunch of scientific (quote, unquote) lies in order to be an acceptable scientist. It doesn’t seem to me to be a sensible proceeding. However, be that as it may, these various planets united into a very vast civilization which has come forward up through the last two hundred thousand years, is formed out of the fragments of earlier civilizations. Now, I can’t tell you accurately, exactly what these blokes are up to or where they’re from, but this isn’t quite germane to this galaxy. That’s the first thing you should know about it; it isn’t quite native to your track. You find a type of mental implanting and that sort of thing going on here in the last couple of hundred thousand years which are not native to your earlier track. Now, this is all very important; it’s very important, because they have a terrible prob-lem. They have the problem of people who are native to this galaxy and aren’t used to this kind of thing, and they have the basic problem of \"How do you kill a thetan?\" And that’s a terrible problem to men who have very, very guilty consciences and blood on their hands – great problem. Probably the best way to hide your overts is to give somebody amnesia, you see (then they don’t know what you’ve done to them), and then tell them something else has happened. Well, this is a dramatization of a very craven intelligence, and that is what is going on here. Now, the fellow who conforms to that society is in no vast trouble. Perhaps some bloke who has a military record against them, and that sort of thing, might possibly (no matter what he did) find himself unable to satisfactorily conform. But the point is that their ideal is the conformist. Now, these conformists are pretty weird, and the personnel of that particular society is pretty scummy, to say the least. Let’s supposing you were in the last shambling wreckages of a red-light district: you’d have high-toned personnel, compared to the personnel which makes up the other planets I’m talking to you about. High-toned personnel, much higher toned than their average run. They practice cannibalism. The stuff you get on race tracks – once in a while some pc will run into race tracks and race-track drivers – this Roman-circus-type enter-tainment, don’t you see? All that kind of stuff – that’s all out of this zone and area. We’re still with that planetary system."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 3 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 145 06.02.10 So, they specialize in the fellow who will conform. Now, he ordinarily is a \"worker\" who is content to draw wages and not do another single, blessed thing – you know, never really get up, improve his lot, you see, and keep on plugging along somehow, or even slump into indigence. He’s still their choice of personnel. So this leaves, this leaves the brilliant art-ist, the brilliant engineer, the manager, the genius, the criminal, the pervert, non persona grata. And they sentence these people – the upper class (that is to say, the brighter gent) be-cause they can’t control him and they’re afraid of him, and the lower class because it’s too vicious even for them – and they condemn these people to perpetual amnesia. \"Dead forever,\" they call it – the problem of killing a thetan – and wrap them up in mothballs and ship them down here, and here we are. And that is the population of this planet. All right. Here’s a population, then, of minimal workers, maximal managers, artists, geniuses, criminals and perverts. What you going to make out of this lot, huh? Now, those are the blokes you’re talking to when you say \"Add up the left-hand col-umn of the ledger.\" Well, of course, the artist says he could add it up much more prettily. The guy who actually, in his own right, was a very skilled manager, he says he could devise a much better system – it’s true, too; he probably could. If the bird is a criminal, he’s just sitting there trying to figure out how he can add it up so he can short you. And there’s your zone of operation; there is your response to 8-C in trying to get an organization running. It’s all alter-is, because the basic crime was nonconforming. The basic crime wasn’t being a criminal; the basic crime was not conforming. Well, actually, this group has gone ahead and made up, up until recent times, a totally different civilization than the civilization which planted it here. In the last ten thousand years, they have gone on with a sort of a decadent, kicked-in-the-head civilization that contains automobiles, business suits, fedora hats, telephones, spaceships – quite interesting, but a civi-lization which looks an almost exact duplicate, but is worse off than the current US civiliza-tion. Therefore, you find the current US and Western civilization rather restimulative, be-cause it has moved up to look like the Marcabian civilization. It’s been moving up here rather rapidly. And now we’re at a point, a very high level of restimulation, because the automobile design, the train design, ship design (why, they’ve got ships in those areas, look just like the Queen Mary, you see?), and the fire engines and the stuff you do with men’s clothes particularly – all of these things are the same image. So you’re going into a highly restimulative era, because we’ve not had this before. See? We’ve been moving up through strata of civilization, but we hadn’t matched this one. And remember that this society at the present time looks dangerous; it looks very dangerous. One of the highest crimes you could pull in that Marcabian society, probably even to-day, is income tax; you make one comma wrong and it’s \"dead forever.\" Sounds weird, doesn’t it? So, they got everybody paying income tax – awful restimulative. Probably nothing much wrong with income tax if it were administered as a tax, but it isn’t; it’s administered as a punishment, even on this planet today. Well, it’s one of their prime punishments in the Mar-cabian civilization."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 4 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 146 06.02.10 All of this adds up to what? An era, going on right now, of highly restimulative asso-ciations in the civilization, and therefore a high-felt level of danger. People feel like they are in danger. Scientologists, every once in a while, hearing me talk like this, feel even more in danger. They say, \"Boy, those guys are liable to land here tomorrow,\" you know? Of course, I pull this every once in a while. Diana suddenly appeared on my right side last night while eating dinner (and I didn’t even know she was in the room, you see?), and just out of the corner of my eye, I saw a pair of white spots that looked like the spats a spaceman uses, you know? And for a split second I said, \"Well, here they are,\" you know? [laughs, laughter] But anyway, you should realize that the material on the between-lives area has been much more broadly circulated than any of our material is now, because it was laid down the line in all directions, to the most unlikely places (including Russia), and was contained in the book What to Audit and other materials, and that was 1951 and 52. I consider that’s interest-ing, because let me point out to you, that’s eleven or twelve years ago and there hasn’t been a ripple. I just want to point that out to you as an interesting point. No, gents of this character who have a system worked out this way would – the last thing in the world they’d do would be blow their own game, see? All they’d have to do is land one spaceship, and they feel like everybody would go into a convulsion of suddenly remem-bering everything. And they do, do you know? Any rumor of the men from Mars or some-thing like that and this planet goes into a total convulsion. They produced Orson Welles’s broadcast down in Quito (I think it was), Ecuador, and – the radio station there, I think a seventeen-story building or large building, or whatever the figures were on it – and mobs tore that building to pieces and killed seventeen people in the process. They practically slaughtered the staff of that radio station. In other words, they went mad. So they know that great riots are attended by this, but a landing in force without any equivocation that it had been a landing of some type, or like this, would be liable to restore everybody’s memory. I think that’s what they feel. Whether this is true or not, we couldn’t worry less. But here you are; that is the point. Here you are; that is this planet. Every once in a while you get mad at government on this planet, when in actual fact you’re mad at the Marcabian government. And there’s a great deal of confusion. Every once in a while somebody will get awfully furious with an organization, very furious with an or-ganization here on this planet, when they have actually identified the organization with the Marcabian civilization. Now, you start hitting people here with restimulative materials of this particular type, and it restimulates a terrific unreality; it restimulates amnesia. I have to ask you this: How hard do you have to hit somebody to bring about amnesia? Let’s take Joe out here and let’s just see how hard do we have to hit Joe in order to bring about amnesia on his part so he doesn’t know who he is, where he is, or anything else. How hard would we have to hit him? Boy, that’s pretty hard. It’s almost unbelievable force is used"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 5 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 147 06.02.10 to handle a thetan and put him into this kind of condition. I’ve been hit with some awful heavy force in this universe without losing my mind or forgetting who I am, see? So it’s pretty heavy duress. And you restimulate that very easily by telling people things. It gets aw-ful unreal. But you would find, if you gave them the actual dope, that they would be far more in agreement with you than if you gave them just a touch of the dope, do you see? You won’t find the citizens of this planet very far in disagreement with what you’re doing. So, therefore, you’ve got some kind of an explosion going. Well, these guys are not going to blow their own show. See? They’re not going to do anything peculiar about it. They’ve probably got us all sized up, if they know anything about us at all. They probably have some dim idea of what we’re doing, and saying, \"Oh, yes. Ho-hum.\" And give the devil his due: They might even say, \"Well, hey, what do you know? Those guys might be producing a type of technology which we ourselves desperately need.\" Look at that. See, now, they know the problems exist. They couldn’t have had any decent solution, or they wouldn’t have taken the route to solution which they have. They are beings, too; re-member that. So when we look at all this: you are (1) organizationally handling people who are revolutionaries. They are nonconformists. Probably the common denominator of this planet is revolution. Probably the one thing you could always start on this planet would be a revolu-tion, because it’s a state of perpetual revolution. Trying to hold any organization together of any kind whatsoever becomes almost impossible, because everybody you’re dealing with is a nonconformist. All right. So far goes the civilization. There are just those few statements on the thing I thought you might find of interest. We’re dealing now with \"What is an auditor?\" You are handling, therefore, the roughest case that you could find in the universe, be-cause the rehabilitation of the individual demands that you rehabilitate his knowingness. If his knowingness does not increase independently, he himself does not get well. You see, electri-cal charge on the case is simply a symptom that measures his knowingness. If he’s got too much charge, his knowingness is way down. See, that’s an indirect measure of the amount of knowingness of the individual. And as the case moves along up the line, you get an odd factor. You get an odd factor: This case continues progressively to remember more. Now, one of the things the case recov-ers is picture memory, remembering by pictures. \"I have a picture of, so therefore I was.\" See, you can call that a picture memory and that goes from a terrific unreality on it down to a pretty good certainty on it. So a person at that stage of the game – an advanced stage of the game in inspecting his own pictures – can tell the difference between a false picture and an actual picture that has something to do, really, with him on his track. And as his knowingness increases, he can tell you where it belongs and what date it has and so on. In other words, he"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 6 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 148 06.02.10 can spot it, bang! That’s an increased knowingness. It’s knowingness that is increasing all the way along the line. Now, from picture memory, the individual graduates up to simply knowing. Now, right now, you don’t have to get a picture of where you are living to know where you live. You see that? You don’t have to get a picture of your name to know what your name is. In other words, you know this. Well, so does knowingness increase as the case improves, and that knowingness increases up the line to a point where you know who you have been and where you have been, independent of any created evidence or cross-proof. You simply know. And that factor is a very slow factor to rise; it’s not a rapid factor. Under present auditing, yes, it is rapid, but that is all within a framework of hundreds of hours, don’t you see? Now, I’ll give you an idea – an idea of this. For instance, I know – I know where I was and who I was – I know dimly – pardon me, I know with good certainty, who I was and where I was in the last eighty trillion years. See, I know that; that’s not much of an argument with me. But the small details of that are liable to go fritter-fritter here and there. You know, what did I have for breakfast two trillion years ago? No. Nix, man. Nah. Did I even eat, you see? That sort of thing is getting pretty dim. But now, over the top of that, which is an identity knowingness – which comes before a detail knowingness, you see; between your picture knowingness and your total knowingness is this stage of just knowing your identity – why, then, this detail knowingness starts to come up and follow in on this smaller basis. And one of your gains on it: you’ll know why you were here. You’ll have tangled with it in session and that sort of thing, and you’ll have picked data out of pictures. And all at once, it will just get – more and more you know why you were here. You know how you got here. You know what you were doing ten thousand years ago, do you see? You know what was happening 11,025 years ago, don’t you see? You – no pic-tures involved; you just know it. And that is the restoration of the beingness of the person, and I have given you (in a very crude way here) a cycle of that restoration of beingness. His beingness returns to him gradually, bit by bit. Perhaps the lowest edge of it is something on the idea of \"Maybe I pos-sibly could know who I was,\" you know? \"Possibly I could know what I am doing here, or I might even be able to know who I am.\" Just some sort of a feeling like one might be able to know. And that crawls up forward to a picture knowingness, and the unreality of those pic-tures at first is fabulous. So that anybody shows you any kind of a picture, man, any kind of a picture, that is – must be yours, and therefore you must have been there. They could show you a picture of an airplane falling apart and you at once say, \"Well, I must have been in that airplane falling apart.\" And later on you suddenly realize, \"Hell, I’m looking at that airplane from two miles away. What am I doing looking at it from two miles away?\" This dawns on you after a while. Your valence problem all of a sudden comes up; it hits you in the face, whether you’re coaxed to do it by the auditor or not. \"I’m in that airplane, see, over there, two miles away,\" see? \"So, therefore, I must have had an awful fall.\" And it turns out, eventually – you’d begin to see this thing – you say, \"Hey, wait a minute. I couldn’t have been in that airplane. It was somebody I shot down; maybe it’s some-body I did this with.\" And then you’ll finally say, \"Well, shucks. That thing is just a false pic-"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 7 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 149 06.02.10 ture. That isn’t my picture at all.\" And then whatever picture of yours is holding it in sus-pense, that picture suddenly peels off the front of it like a badly painted chromo, and pshew! and your own picture is right behind it. And you say, \"Oh, yerp! there I was,\" and you’re in valence. That various cycle of recognition takes place in this picture line. But what does it take, then, to bring about such a total amnesia? Let’s look at that: What does it take to bring about such a total amnesia? I was riding a spaceship down one day. Side gaskets of the tubes blew out on one side and wiped out the engine-room crew. I went in to drag them out just at the moment when the whole backblast of the rockets moved front-wards through the engine room, and got hit square in the face and managed to crawl out of the place. The ship went into the atmosphere, melted and crashed. And a couple of minutes or, oh, a couple of seconds after it hit, all of its fuel went up and hit me in the face. And I lost my memory; I lost my memory. It took me quite a while, sitting down very quietly, to remember where base was. And I sat there and figured and figured and figured. Actually, I’d sent some people back to come and pick up the wreckage and so forth, and I was pretty foggy. And very shortly, I snapped out of it. You know, \"Of course!\" you know? But just – how much force is force? Well, this is the type of scout craft which has the engines of a battle cruiser all packed into a very tight spot, you see, and all of it red-hot fuel. Cape Canaveral has got nothing like the amount of force one of those things can deliver, don’t you see? And to get all of that square in your thetan puss twice, and get confused about where base was. Got the idea? And how much force has it taken to destroy somebody’s memory? It’s interesting. An interesting point, isn’t it? Well, that’s how much force you’ve been subjected to. Otherwise you wouldn’t have a case. I’m not trying to make you afraid of force. You get up to a point after a while as a thetan – force-smorce, who cares? I had a funny feeling the other day. I didn’t quite feel up to diving into the sun. I just didn’t feel up to it; I didn’t feel it would be a healthy thing for me to do just now. I felt weak. And I felt the interactive forces of the sun, and I felt sort of drawn a little bit toward the sun, and I said, \"No.\" I sort of did a suppress and looked the other way. I just didn’t feel like tak-ing a sun bath today. You get the idea, you know? You feel queasy. Too much force – too much force. Well now, that force, of course, has to be combined with trickery, and the trickery is mostly scrambling somebody’s dates and giving them opposite, opposing items that can sus-pend in time, so that the scrambled dates will suspend in time. You get the combinations; you know them in our various technologies. But let’s not move away from the point into the trickery of it; it does require the force. Force. How much force does it take to destroy the memory of a being? Well, that’s how much force an auditor is getting off a case. And of course you’d much rather get off unknowingness and oddities and oddball things; you’d much rather, because they’re easier to confront than raw force. And they’re easier for the pc to confront, too. Therefore, you say, \"What have you done?\""},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 8 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 150 06.02.10 And your pc said, \"Well, I had a hostile thought about you the other day. I thought you really should do your hair up in back.\" Oh, good – we’ve got a big withhold off. You get the gentle pat-a-cake that you will sometimes see in auditing sessions. The proper auditing response, of course, is \"Well, thank you very much,\" and so forth. And O/W is a bit different than other brands of auditing. You say, \"What have you done, done, done?\" And if you work very, very hard, you can get a done in all these thinks. You see, behind all these critical thinks is a done, is an actual action. And you can listen to critical thinks till the cow comes home, and you will never get anybody raised up the line, until you’ve found an actual action. That is the secret of all Sec Checking, and that is where people fall down in Sec Checking. Now, why do they fall down? Well, it’s much easier to confront this random little think than it is the energy contained in a done. Do you see that? Therefore, the mission of an auditor is the restoration of a person’s awareness, which includes his memory, his knowingness of himself and so forth. Restoration of awareness. What is holding down that awareness? What is holding down this knowingness? What is sit-ting on this knowingness? Well, you can say trickery and force, but it is force used with trick-ery, so that an individual will get an ARC break with force and then become the effect of force. So you’re handling, in actual fact, somebody who has lots of ARC breaks with other beings, matter, energy, space, time and location and form. That is in direct definition: this person is out of comm, out of affinity and out of reality with matter, energy, space, time, loca-tion, other beings and form. Now, that’s the pc. So what’s an auditor? So what’s an auditor? Well, an auditor has to be somebody who can release this tremendously involved force, somebody who can release this force from the pc. Obviously, if it’s a deranged force which is bringing about the amnesia of the pc, then the auditor, to get a return of memory of the pc, has to be capable of alleviating and removing that force. I mean, that’s simple. Simple. Elementary, my dear Watson. On your E-Meter you have a tone arm. Force is removing itself from the case as long as that tone arm is in motion. And the wiggle-waggle of the tone arm as the pc is being au-dited tells you that force is being relieved from the case. When you start to remove force that is aberrated by some trickery, your tone arm hangs up until the trickery is resolved, you know, wrong date or something like that – and your tone arm action is restored. All of these things are all cared for in the processes and technologies of auditing. But if that TA isn’t moving, you will never make an OT. That’s just it. Now, you oddly enough do not have to run a process, sometimes, to get the TA mov-ing. Providing the TA is moving – providing the TA is moving and you get good motion out of your tone arm – a person will eventually go Operating Thetan. Providing you can keep the tone arm moving, the person will eventually go Operating Thetan. If the tone arm is not mov-ing, the person will not go Operating Thetan and the case may even deteriorate."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 9 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 151 06.02.10 Let’s just run this case on and on. The case can run an engram, and so you keep run-ning engrams, engrams, engrams, engrams, and the tone arm is stuck right up here at some-where in the vicinity of 5. And there it sticks at 5, and you go on and audit and audit and au-dit; and there it is at 5, and there it is at 5, and there it is at 5, and there it is at 5. Uh-hah – you’re never going to make an Operating Thetan. Now, if you run the right significances off the case and produce tone arm action, you make an OT much quicker. But you can get tone arm action without running the right signifi-cances. Get this syllogism here? And you can run the right significances without getting tone arm action. Oh, well, you can run R3R on somebody who can't handle R3R, and you can run all the right significances and not get into tone arm action; you’re not going to make an OT. Now, let me go over this again now and you’ll see where you sit with regard to a tone arm. If you just keep a tone arm moving on the pc long enough, regardless of how and what you’re auditing on the case, the case will eventually make OT. But if you run the right signifi-cances – if you run the right significances – and don’t get any tone arm action, you’re not going to make an OT. You got that now? This is terribly important. Now, it might take thousands and thousands of hours just to randomly keep this tone arm moving on the pc. And lots of pcs can talk forever, you know, without getting any tone arm action. But if you could keep that TA moving, you’d eventually get OT. So you say, then, that a moving tone arm is slightly senior to the right significance. Now, this is right down to bedrock on the subject of auditing. Your job is to keep the TA moving. Now, what’s this TA doing? The TA is indicating the blowing off of force. That is a measure of the amount of encysted force which is leaving the case – the amount of encysted force leaving the case. You’ve got a measure of it right there. It goes up and down, and it measures the amount of force which is going. Now, of course, you don’t do this arithmetically or mathematically. I imagine some-day, one of these days, why, we will. We’ll set up a project that measures some guy from scratch, right straight through to the end, shows the exact number of motions of the TA on every process or type of process that is run on the person, and these are all added together. And we say there’s this many hundred million ergs of energy were released, and at the end of that line we had an OT. But that is in essence what you’re doing; you’re blowing the force, because the more force is blown off the case the less amnesia the case has. Does it make sense to you now? Audience: Yes. Force created the amnesia and you got to blow it to get rid of the amnesia. Now, there’s an interesting one-for-one. Now, the amount of time in processing, the amount of time in processing is enor-mously speeded up if you run the right significances, because you’re running the force off early track, and you start to get force release which you don’t see on the meter. Now, let’s not"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 10 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 152 06.02.10 say that if the tone arm isn’t moving, it’s all okay; the tone arm is also moving when this hap-pens. I was sitting down in session one day, and I could feel – I could feel energy masses disintegrating clear out to Arcturus. It sure wasn’t registering on the meter. If it had, there wouldn’t have been any more of an E-Meter here; there’d have just been charred wire. You get the idea? It was blowing off all over the place. Every once in a while we’ll get a blowdown phenomenon. Well, when you see that blowdown, pshew, pshew, pshew, pshew, pshew – I’m talking about a repetitive down, see? You can see that needle go pshew, pshew, pshew, pshew, pshew; it just keeps doing it, and your tone arm is drifting lower and lower and lower. You’re watching a remote force area blow up. Now, if all this force blew up against the pc’s face and the pc’s body, he wouldn’t have any more body than a rabbit. It’s pretty hard to do research auditing and keep a body over you. It is, because you make one little mistake here and another mistake there and chew into a GPM someplace else, the next thing you know, there goes this and there goes that, and your right ear looks like a pretzel. Anyhow, the point I’m making here is that your force measured through the E-Meter is only a part of the force which is blowing off the case. But if any force is blowing off the case, you have an additional movement of the tone arm. So if a tone arm is moving you’re blowing force, and if a tone arm is not moving you’re not blowing force. And that’s all you have to know about it. Now, there are several significances that can keep a tone arm from moving, such as wrong time and an ARC break situation where the pc is out of comm and a few things like this. But we’re not now discussing the no-motion tone arm; we’re discussing a motion tone arm. Therefore it is of great interest to an auditor, then, to make that tone arm move. And to make it move all he can make it move. And your most fundamental method of making a tone arm move is not running a process. It is the basic definition of an auditor: a listener. The basic way to let a tone arm – get a tone arm move is to listen, and that is the fundamental of audit-ing. Now, somebody could probably talk for a thousand years and never say the right things, and you wouldn’t get any tone arm motion. But, similarly, how many pcs talk and get tone arm motion from doing so and are shut up or cut off by the auditor? Ha-ha-ho-ho-ho. Now, there is an inhibition of blowing clear. The auditor is not then doing his job; an auditor is setting up a barrier to blowing mass. And you’ll find out the pc winds up at the end of the session stupider. At the end of session, he can remember less than he could remember at the beginning of session. Why? Well, you’ve done something with the force. You have moved it out of the bank and dumped it on the thetan’s head. Oh, it’ll destimulate; it’ll go out of restimulation and all that sort of thing. The basic definition of an auditor is: to listen. He’s a listener. His basic job is to listen, not to restimulate."},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 11 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 153 06.02.10 All right. Now, we stand around and we say, \"Well, the Marcabians are gonna get you tomorrow, man, and the size of the between-lives-area screen is 180 feet by 9 feet,\" and so forth. And people sit there and they go dzzzz. That’s doing what? That’s charging them up, isn’t it? That’s charging them up. Well, actually, they talk it over, one with another, and usu-ally blow the charge. It’s not a grave matter; it’s not a difficult matter at all. Their knowingness increases, and they feel all right about it and so forth. Well, we get away with that. Why? Because we can talk to one another about it, that’s why. The only method of blowing reactive charge is by a communication line – there is no other method – by a com-munication line. I think that’s very interesting. Here’s the auditor, and he’s supposed to listen. And the only way the pc can possibly get rid of the charge is blow it by the communication line. Now, this doesn’t mean, oddly enough, that he’s blowing it at the auditor. He isn’t blowing it at the auditor. But that he can communicate it does cause it to dissipate, and it doesn’t hit either the auditor or the pc. If the auditor wants to get hit by the charge, he should put up a barrier to prevent it from blowing, and the pc has an ARC break; and the next thing you know, the auditor is hit by the charge. You can set up a situation whereby the auditor is hit by the charge, but only if he stops the charge. How do you get rid of charge? Now, get what I just said. How do you get rid of charge? I didn’t say how do you handle charge, restimulate charge or anything like that: just how do you get rid of it? Listen. That’s how you get rid of it. Listen. Elementary, my dear Watson. Now, all therapies since time immemorial have consisted of listening – one way or the other. He is a sympathetic person, and people tell their troubles to him and very often feel a lot better. Well, all of that is very well, and you can add that up to a short-circuited look at auditing, but remember, this factor entered in: was the pc, or was the patient, talking with tone arm action? Oh, that’s the difference. Or was the pc just nattering or was the pc lying or something? You let a pc sit there and lie, or a patient sit there and lie for a while, and you’re going to have one of the stuckest tone arms you ever wanted to see. So that is the essence of the thing. An auditor is somebody who listens with tone arm action. That’s the difference. But remember, the fundamental of all mental activities was lis-tening. Prayer is based on \"God will hear me.\" And if there’s no OTs around, who is going to hear him? Actually, the lama got so disgusted with this that he put all of his praying on auto-matic; he puts them on a little wheel. He can turn the wheel and it goes brrrrrrp and a thou-sand prayers go up, and he’s got that cared for. And I’ll bet you his tone arm, it didn’t move a bit. [laughter] So an auditor has the job, and auditing consists, of restimulating a charge (that’s the auditing command received by the pc) and then letting the pc blow the charge that is restimu-lated on the return communication line. Simple, isn’t it? I’ll draw you a picture of this thing. You needn’t take a very accurate copy of this because this is an HCOB (I think 4 August),"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 12 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 154 06.02.10 and I’m having it squared around. But I’ll draw you this thing. Here’s cause-distance-effect. That is a communication cycle. And here is the auditor and here is the pc. The auditor utters an auditing command, and it goes across this distance and hits something. What’s it hit? The pc? No, it hits the reactive bank, that accumulated mass of force which the pc is packing around that is always kicking his head in. And we get what is known as restimulation at this point. There we are; we get a restim. There’s the living lightning. Pow! goes the auditing command. We know this guy is very sensitive to snakes, so the auditor says, \"Recall a snake.\" Pow! See? Bang! Well, now, of course if we’re in some kind of a weird situation whereby we’re fighting the pc, why, we’re not restimulating the bank. We’re just trying to get the pc to fight us or something like that; we’re not – it hasn’t anything to do with auditing. Just forget that. The auditor’s address actually is to the reactive bank, and he says, \"Recall a snake.\" Bow! Now we get a communication line: bank-distance-effect. And here we have the pc – thetan. And the pc says, \"Hey, what do you know! There is a snake in there.\" And he goes: cause-distance-effect, and that’s the end of that. This line must follow in, to take care of the charge restimulated in your first line. Cause-distance-effect: that’s the auditing command. Bow! There’s the charge. He re-calls the snake. Boom! It starts to hit the thetan and the thetan recognizes it, knows what it is and imparts that information on his cause-distance-effect line, back to the auditor. And there goes auditing. Your cycle then occurs, and the charge is blown. And you see it reacting on the E-Meter as blown. These are not all the communication cycles there are in an auditing cycle, but this doesn’t happen to be a lecture on that. I’m showing the principal action of these basic lines. Now, remember that life is always giving him commands that restimulates things – here at E, on the pc. This is our old PTP and other things of that character. If you don’t be-lieve that, put in your \"since\" mid ruds on the pc and see how superior your tone arm action is. Usually get marvelous tone arm action on \"since\" mid ruds unless the pc is protesting them and wants to get on with the session. And you get marvelous tone arm action. Well, that’s just the restimulated charge that’s been slapped at him out of this mucked-up bank that he is gratuitously handed, in full restimulation with much added force, in every between-lives session he’s had with the little boys elsewhere. He’s trying to blow that charge. So he comes into session, and he sometimes will sit there and talk to you for quite a while; and the tone arm would just move and move and move and move. He’s getting rid of the be-tween-sessions charges. Interesting, isn’t it? You notice, after he’s talked for fifteen, twenty minutes sometime – even somebody who has had a big upset on the thing, you’ve got in your \"since\" mid ruds (or you haven’t gotten in your \"since\" mid ruds), you notice that your tone arm action dies down. And then suddenly, mysteriously, the pc is in-session. What’s happened? You’ve emptied this reservoir of restimulation which life has handed him, restimulated in him during the session – between sessions, you see? And you’ve"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 13 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 155 06.02.10 emptied that thing out. Now, you want to know why your pc doesn’t go into session some-times. Well, he’s just – he’s got a lot of restimulated charge that is all ready to fall back. Now, you’ve got \"Is it kinder to audit somebody one hour a week or twenty-five hours a week?\" Well, of course there is no comparison, because in the one hour you can’t even get rid of life’s restimulative action in this reservoir here at all, so you spend that one hour indif-ferently getting rid of three days of the week which you’re trying to cover, don’t you see? And it’s a losing proposition. There’s a make-break point in auditing where a person has to be audited enough to get rid of this charge which is being consistently and continually restimu-lated. Got that? Well now, this line here then – this lower line with the pc at cause answering this question back to the auditor, who in this case is at effect: then that line must have some sen-iority to the upper line. The auditor cause-distance-effect, then, is not quite as important as – they’re both terribly important – but is not quite as important as the line, cause-distant-effect, to the pc. In other words, between the seniority of the two lines (both in the same order of magnitude), you’ll find that the pc’s line to the auditor is slightly more important than the auditor’s line to the pc. And in this line of cause-distance-effect to the pc – in that line and an inspection of that line – you will find all auditing failures, providing any process at all that we have has been run. In other words, if a case was loused up by auditing, we don’t inspect the process run as the first consideration. We inspect the tone arm as the consideration, because if you got good tone arm motion running that process, then that bottom line – the C-distance-E of the pc – was in. Now, we’ve had processes for years. It’s true, our processes have to be very neat. They have to be very important. And they restimulate the exact amount of charge that then blows the outer bank charge and so forth, and it’s all figured out very neatly. And on some pcs it’s almost impossible to get tone arm action; and you have to know what stops tone arm action; you have to know all of these various things. But I’m now just talking about the fundamentals of auditing; and we inspect on a failed case the C–E (the C-distance-E) of the pc, not the process run. That’s the first thing we’d inspect: Was the auditor auditing? Now, anybody could sit there and say, \"Recall a snake, recall a snake, recall a snake, recall a snake, recall a snake, recall a snake.\" And the pc says, \"Well, I...\" \"Well, that’s all right. Just don’t bother with that. Recall a snake, recall a snake,\" and all of a sudden the pc is da-da, da-da-da, you know? And he’s swamped. All right. What happens in a case like that? Well, this is very, very easy. This restimu-lation, when the pc puts it on this line, goes bang! straight back at the pc. Got it? When that line goes out, where else can it go? It’s only got one place to go, and that’s the pc. So what-ever you restimulate in a pc comes home on the pc, unless it is picked up on the reverse com-munication line."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 14 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 156 06.02.10 Now, the penalties of this: the first symptom of the pc’s cause-distance-effect line – the first symptom of its disappearance is a dirty needle. You can go down any line of auditors who are busy auditing, right down any line of auditors, and watch their meters. You don’t even have to listen to them. You just see a dirty needle, bang! this line’s out: the auditor isn’t listening. The first definition of auditor is missing. Pc is saying, \"Well, that’s a snake. I – snake – well, there was one in a zoo urm-uh-uh-urm. I think it was a zoo – there was one in a zoo...\" The auditor said, \"Okay! Thank you! Good! Good! Thank you! Thank you! Good! Re-call a snake.\" And the pc said, \"Well, um-sfla-sflassle hum. Yes, yes.\" \"Good! Good! Thank you!\" Got this nonsense? He’s just backing up all the charge of the process on the pc. Ah, I see some of you have seen this happen. What occurs then? Well, frankly – frankly, in time, the C with the pc at cause-distance-effect line, in terms of time (the one here from the pc over to the auditor) may take upwards to a hundred times as much time in the session as the line C–E from the auditor. Oh! It only took three seconds to ask that question \"Recall a snake.\" And the pc says, \"Mmm\" and \"Mmm.\" He finally says, \"Was it in a zoo? I don’t know. Zoo?\" and so on. What you’re seeing is identification turning into differentiation. You’re seeing force and charge blow off. The pc is inspecting this thing. And the tone arm moves, and it keeps moving, it keeps moving; and the pc says, well, he doesn’t know and so on. Was it a green snake or a blue snake? He’s not quite sure if it was a green snake or a blue snake and so on. He can't recall a snake and so forth and so on. \"Snakes – nightmare about a snake – but was that recalling a snake? – if – I’m not quite sure on it. There was one down at the zoo when I was a little – yeah, yeah, I got one. Yeah. Yeah, it was a green snake. Oh, yeah. Yeah. There was one. Yeah. Houston Zoo. Yeah. Got it. Got one: a green snake at Houston Zoo, when I was eight. Ha-ha.\" And you will see the cycle of the blowing force on your meter (tone arm) accompany returning knowingness on the part of the pc. And the more you get that thing wobbling, the more positive the pc sounds. You just watch that, because that in itself is a little tiny proof of what I’m saying, is as you get the force off, the pc’s knowingness comes back. And you can see it in one cycle. One auditing cycle: the pc says, \"Snake? My God. I’d never – oh, a snake, what snake? Where? What? Why? I’ll – oh, so-sss – I’m – I guess there was. See, where do they keep – now, I just, why, yeah I was in a zoo at one time. Yeah, there are zoos. Let’s see, now... so on and so on. Zoos, and I must have been in a zoo sometime or another. Zoos – when I was a little bo – well, they used to take me to a zoo when I was a little boy. The zoo – the snake house. Oh, yeah. There must have been one in the snake house and so forth. That – yeah, they had a glass, and so forth, see. Yeah. Yeah, I used to be fascinated by some cage in"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 15 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 157 06.02.10 there. Let’s see, I can – I got – yeah. They – it was a glass-fronted ca – they had a green snake in there. Oh, I remember now. Yeah, I was eight. Yeah.\" Bing, bang! He knows! You’ve pulled him up all the way through the force that tells him he doesn’t know, up to a point where he knows. And you think it winds up with his simply seeing the picture clearly. No, no, he goes all the way through the picture stage which I have just given you. You understand? Audience: Yes. Yeah. Now, these two lines have names, regardless of what they will be called on your – the comm cycles of your auditing cycles; they have numbers on the auditing cycle – but they have nice, colloquial names that you can remember very easily. And this is the whatsit line, and this is the itsa line. Now, the whatsit line is from the auditor to the pc, and the auditor is saying, \"What’s it?\" He says, \"Recall a snake,\" you know? \"What’s it?\" And the pc says fumble, fumble, fumble, fumble. He’s looking for an itsa, see? \"It's a green snake, Houston Zoo.\" That’s the itsa. And you’ll see the tone arm blow down when he hits it, too. So your tone arm, then, follows this pattern; your tone arm follows this pattern. Here is your tone arm here – two tone arms. And here is (this is already in HCOB August 4) – here’s your regular tone arm positions, and here is a nice solid arm, and here is a dotted arm; and here’s an arrow showing the motion as up from 3 to 4, and that’s a whatsit. You got that? We haven’t quite determined the low-tone-arm case, but I think they run in reverse. But that’s a whatsit; that’s the upward throw of the tone arm. That’s whatsit. The pc says, \"Let’s see, snake, snake, wha-what-what-whatsa. Recall a snake. It’s a – let’s see – wha – .\" He’s saying whatsa, whatsa, whatsa, whatsa, whatsa, whatsa, see? And you’ll see that tone arm go up. And then he’ll get a little bit of an itsa, and you will see the tone arm go down. And your tone arm, dotted at 4, falling to solid at 3, and that’s itsa. And you, frankly, can monitor a pc’s tone arm on one question like mad. He has an ARC break with somebody, and he sees that there’s some difference... some similarity, or he thinks maybe he knows somebody who looked like the person he had an ARC break with. This would be a research test. See, he sees – he knows now already that there’s some similar incident earlier, that he’s got this person associated with somebody he shouldn’t have it asso-ciated with – got an identification going. And you say, \"Well, what reminded you\" – well, you don’t even know who that earlier person is, see? but \"What reminded you (in the person you had the ARC break with), now, what reminded you of the person in the past?\" See? Whatsa. And you See that pc’s tone arm go right up. You say, \"Whatsa?\" Tone arm goes up. The pc says figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure, figure \"Was it his – was it his tie, his shirt? His – it’s a – tie, shirt. Yup. Or is it – there some way he held – I think it was the way he must’ve held his head.\" Then you’ll get an itsa. And it’ll go right down: \"Yes, just think it was the way he held his head.\" And you say, \"Well, was there anything else?\" Whatsa? And it’ll go right up.

And down comes the tone arm. And you actually can sit there as an auditor and control the motion of the tone arm. You can control it. You can say \"Whatsa?\" and every time you give him a whatsa, you’ll see it goes up. And make sure he gives you a full itsa. And then feed back in again another frag-ment of the whatsa, see? And up, up goes the tone arm again. And he gives you the itsa, and down comes the tone arm again. And you can just sit there and call your shots. (That’s a re-search project; you normally wouldn’t handle comm like that.) But you’ll see it in running almost any process. When you say whatsa, up she goes. And you – he says itsa, and down she comes. So, you say \"What’s it?\" to the pc, and you get the up arm. That charge is restimulated and unresolved, and that high tone arm shows you restimulated but unresolved charge. It’s sitting there in the bullpen; it’s sitting there in the reservoir, and it’s going to hit somebody or something. And the pc plows through this charge that's been restimulated here, and he puts it over on this line and he says itsa. And if he’s permitted to give you the itsa line, then the charge channels right – doesn’t hit the auditor; it just disintegrates, see? And there it goes. Boom! It’s gone. You see that? So auditing is a repetitive... the crudest auditing cycle is the whatsit – itsa; whatsit – itsa; whatsit – itsa. And of course it doesn’t take any time to say whatsit, and sometimes takes quite a while to say itsa. So, consequently, this line is much more prone to be out than the upper line – than the whatsa line. Definition of an auditor: to listen. Now, you’re handling a case: if you knew Scientology in the Galactic Confederation at this particular moment, man, they’d practically put you on a throne, see? Cases! Well, boo. You take some of the old Route 1, and you say, \"All right. Be three feet back of your doll. All right. Be on planet A, planet B, planet A, planet E, planet A, planet B. Got it? You’re getting along fine. Planet A, planet B. Good. OT. Thank you.\" Guy would say, \"Gosh. You know, this is terrific\" – provided you listened. Guy’d say, \"This is terrific. I feel much better now. I don’t see why I have to be pinned in that doll’s head. I’m going around getting my sergeant’s stripes as an OT.\" The situation would be very different from what you’re operating with. The character of the pc you’re operating with is operating under an enforced and continuously each life rein-forced amnesia. And if the course of the case upward is to knowingness, think of what stands in your road auditing an Earth case. And if you were up around in some other locales, it would be about the same difference as right now auditing an Earth case; you would sort of feel odd as – how the hell do you audit an ant? Do you see? Well, it’d be that same gap be-tween an Earth case and an ant, as a case of more or less a free thetan out there in space (who doesn’t have your technology) and an Earth case. Do you see that? So I can feel for you, trying to get wins on the cases you’re trying to get wins on, but you should recognize what type of case you’re trying to get wins on and should recognize where your line is breaking down.

I myself wasn’t making much of this mistake; it didn’t call too much to my attention what it is, but it must have been there if the original word which identifies you, auditor, means listen – must have been there all the time, well understood. Now, what’s the course of having that line out? What’s the source – course of it? Here’s, first, (1) dirty needle; (2) stuck TA; (3) ARC break. One, two, three – as inevitable as nonsense from Washington. One, two, three – just like that. If your pc has a dirty needle, a stuck tone arm is incipient on that case. It’s liable to happen any minute. Man, you’re already three-quarters of the way over the cliff! In fact, the beginning of the piercing, dwindling scream is about to sound. And your ARC break will follow immediately afterwards: bypassed charge. The most fruitful source of bypassed charge, then, is the itsa line – just it. And that’s all – that line. That is the most fruitful source of bypassed charge, then: Restimulate an engram, don’t let the pc tell you about it; restimulate an engram, don’t let the pc tell you about it; res-timulate an engram, don’t let the pc tell you about it; restimulate an engram, don’t let the pc tell you about it; restimulate an engram, don’t let the pc tell you about it. If you haven’t got an ARC break by that time, the pc must have been dead to begin with! Do you see that simply by filling up this reservoir full of charge and then not putting in the itsa line – not letting the pc tell you all about it – you’re bypassing charge? This is ele-mentary. That gives you a change in your auditing training program at Level W. At Level W we’re going to teach an auditor to be an auditor. We’re going to teach them to listen before they restimulate anything. Life restimulates quite a bit of charge. The auditor should at least be able to handle that. Level I – Scientology I auditing – will consist, then, mainly of listening. You see his TA stop moving, you must have seen earlier a DN and not noticed it. So therefore, if you see a DN, you know that your TA motion soon is going to cease. It may not be the exact next ses-sion; it may take two sessions for it to really stop. Two sessions of the same kind of treatment, see? And you know, that’s going to wind up in an ARC break. These people who are ARC breaky pcs are not ARC breaky pcs; there is no such thing. There are only auditors who don’t listen. It’s very simple. It’s very elementary. I don’t wish to give you too much stress on this, because you’re liable to go com-pletely overboard and just sit there and let your pc do nothing but talk. But the only crime that you can commit on letting the pc talk – the only crime you can commit – is if the pc doesn’t move his tone arm by talking. Pc is talking for a while, and you see that the tone arm isn’t moving: Well, you go on letting him talk forever, you’re foolish, because the case is getting no-place. And this question will come up: The pc is motivatoring, motivatoring, motivatoring, nattering, nattering, nattering. First question that was thrown at me. We had a student here one time that only talked in motivators – didn’t talk English, talked motivators. [laughter] And the question – question was asked of me, \"Well, what if we just let that person talk?\""},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"AUDITING COMM CYCLES 18 SHSBC-320 – 6.8.63 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 160 06.02.10 Well, in the first place, she never would have gotten any TA as a result of all this talk. And the other thing – she was already in an ARC break! Do you follow that? You don’t let people talk when they’re in an ARC break: you find what the bypassed charge is. Because your itsa line has already gone so far out that it won't put itself back in. So you say \"When shouldn’t you let a pc talk?\" No TA action or the pc already in an ARC break. The time to do, then, is act. And the no TA action: Well, let’s give them another auditing command or something like that, but that normally isn’t what’s wrong when you get stuck TA in that particular fash-ion. Normally the pc is – you’re doing ARC breaks of some kind or another like \"Recall ARC breaks,\" and the pc has had an ARC break in present time having recalled – with themselves having [re]called an ARC break in the past, that sort of thing can happen, see? Or they’ve suddenly bypassed and haven’t answered fifteen or twenty ARC breaks. They haven’t given them to you; they threw them all away, suppressed them. That sort of thing is happening. Something weird has gone on in the session, and you suddenly cease to get tone arm action. Now, the pc could sit there and talk forever, and – wouldn’t get him out of it. No, it requires the auditor to locate what bypassed charge, what has happened here? He has two remedies for this: he has the ARC break assessments and he has his big mid ruds. He has ways of getting people out of this mess. But that is your basic problem. We’re not talking about the ramifications of it. Let the pc talk and let him talk with tone arm action. And let them talk as long as they want to talk and let them talk as long as you can get tone arm action by their talking. Where did you get so industrious? If I could sit there for two and a half hours with the pc telling me all about early track engrams and it’s this way and that way, and I’ve got a TA that is banging here from 2.5 to 4.25, back and forth and back and forth, I’m afraid I would just sit there. And I know some of you sit and acknowledge. Oh, no. I wouldn’t shut that off. I’d just sit there and look intelligent. [laughter] I wouldn’t ac-knowledge a thing – no interim acknowledgments. Once in a while they look up and they seem brighter about it, so I look brighter and nod. [laughter] What do you want to work so hard for? You realize that we’re talking now about case level II auditing, because that is case level II auditing. But all you’d have to do is let the pc start talking about his backtrack and get tone arm action and never give an auditing command. Start and end sessions; that’d be all there was to the auditing session. See, it’d get that elementary. Well, of course, it can get that elementary all the way down. But the worse off they are, the more their attention has to be directed, the more particularized the process has to be. The way to bypass charge is not let the pc tell you. Now, there’s the basic anatomy of what you’re doing, and it should make an awful lot of sense. And if you were to teach somebody just to listen (Scientology I, see) – you say, \"Well, you should go listen to people’s problems\" they’ll have some weird little wins. You’re not even teaching them to run an E-Meter, see; just to let somebody talk to you. Then eventu-ally, he’ll find out that there’s talk and talk. There’s the talk that moves E-Meters and the talk that doesn’t. By that time they’d be a pro. Learn to listen, and you’ve got it made.

An auditor runs the session. He gives the pc the session action without pulling the pc’s attention heavily on the auditor. He does not leave the pc inactive or floundering without any-thing to do. He does not leave the pc to make a session out of it. The auditor makes the ses-sion. He doesn’t wait for the pc to run down like a clock or just sit there while the TA soars after an F/N. The auditor runs the session. He knows what to do for everything that can happen. And this is the Auditing Comm cycle that is always in use. 1. Is the pc ready to receive the command? (appearance, presence) 2. Auditor gives command/question to pc (cause, distance, effect). 3. Pc looks to bank for answer (Itsa maker line). 4. Pc receives answer from bank. 5. Pc gives answer to auditor (cause, distance, effect). 6. Auditor acknowledges pc. 7. Auditor sees that pc received ack (attention). 8. New cycle beginning with (1).

One does not have to be skilled in Auditor’s TRs 0-IV in order to be a good Solo auditor. A Solo auditor’s skills are covered in HCOB 26 APR 71 II, SOLO COGNITION’S. TRs 0-IV and the Auditing Comm Cycle apply to regular auditing where the auditor and pc are two separate people. The idea that a Solo auditor would have to mock himself up as ”the auditor” and mock himself up as ”the pc” is erroneous. Nor does the Solo auditor have to try to be two different people, nor does Solo auditing consists of ”talking to oneself”. In order to understand Solo auditing better, read and demonstrate each of the follow-ing definitions until you understand each of them: Auditing Comm Cycle: ”This is the auditing comm cycle that is always in use: 1) is the pc ready to receive the command? (appearance, presence); 2) auditor gives com-mand/question to pc (cause, distance, effect), 3) pc looks to bank for answer (itsa maker line, 4) pc receives answer from bank, 5) pc gives answer to auditor (cause, distance, effect), 6) auditor acknowledges pc, 7) auditor sees that pc received ack (attention), 8) new cycle begin-ning with (1)” (HCOB 30 APR 71 AUDITING COMM CYCLE) Auditing Cycle: The basic of auditing is an auditing cycle which operates as an atten-tion director. Call it restimulator if you want, but it’s an attention director, eliciting a response from the pc to as-is that area and who knows he has done so when he receives from the practi-tioner an acknowledgment that it has occurred. That is the auditing cycle.” (SH Spec 189, 6209C18) 2. ”There are basically two communication cycles between the auditor and the pc that make up the auditing cycle.

These are completely distinct one from the other. ” (HCOB 23 MAY 71R IV, REV. 4.12.74 BASIC AU-DITING SERIES 4R COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN THE AUDITING CYCLE) Communication Cycle: 1. ”A cycle of communication and two-way communication are actually two different things. A cycle of communication is not a two-way communication in its entirety. In a cycle of communication we have Joe as the originator of a communication addressed to Bill. We find Bill receiving it and then Bill originating an answer or acknowl-edgment back to Joe and thus ends the cycle.” (DIANETICS 55! page 82) . ”A communication cycle consists of just cause, distance, effect with intention, attention, duplication and understanding. ” (HCOB 23 MAY 71R IV, REV. 4 .12.74 BASIC AUDITING SERIES 4R COMMUNICATION CYCLES WITHIN THE AUDITING CYCLE) Cycle of Action: l. ”The sequence that an action goes through, where in the action is started, is continued for as long as is required and then is completed as planned.” (Scientology Abridged Dictionary ) (The definitions above are taken from the Technical Dictionary.) In Solo auditing the Auditing Question or Auditing Command is provided in the mate-rials. The Solo auditor has to ensure that he understands the Auditing Question or Auditing Command, gets the answer to the question or carries out the command, and recognizes that he has done so and completes that cycle. Solo auditing mainly consists of carrying out cycles of action. This is easy to do as these are given in the materials, and it consists of doing what the materials say to do. VERBALIZATION The Solo auditor does not verbalize questions or commands in solo auditing. It is done on a thought or intention level. There is a solo auditing action in which the Solo auditor calls items verbally, but otherwise solo auditing is not verbalized. METER ERROR In Solo auditing the meter, worksheets and materials must be arranged so that the solo auditor can read the meter at the same time as he reads the question or item in the materials. This is because the question or item will read on the meter when the solo auditor reads the question or item in the materials. One should not ignore the meter read when first reading the question or item in the materials. This is especially true when checking reads on Ruds, or do-ing a BPC Assessment, as the read might not repeat. The initial read when the question or item is first read and understood by the Solo auditor is taken. This is because the read occurs when the Solo auditor thinks the question or concept of the item. Another meter error could occur if the Solo auditor didn’t understand the question or item. You could get a reaction because the question or item was misunderstood. And if the question or item is misunderstood, then you wouldn’t be able to audit it. Therefore it is very"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMM CYCLE3 HCOB 5.12.79 IN REGULAR AUDITING AND CYCLES OF ACTION IN SOLO AUDITING SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 167 06.02.10 important that the Solo auditor knows to clear the meanings of words in auditing commands and items.

This C/Sing for himself his own next session violates the „continued session rule” wherein an auditor does not „finish” a session by telling the pc „the process will be continued in the next session”. This puts the pc into continued sessions and in Solo can put the PreOT from Solo au-diting to self auditing. There is a vast difference between the two. Solo auditing occurs in ses-sion with a meter. Self auditing is out of session wondering and chewing on bank. A Solo PreOT must NOT self audit. He ends the session he has done when he ends session on his worksheet. He then goes to Examiner and gets his exam. The Examiner sends the completed Exam form to Solo Admin who puts it in the folder. The Solo C/S, then, from his study of the folder, does the next C/S for the PreOT in proper C/S form.

In rare instances when the PreOT is going really well, the C/S permits him to do sev-eral sessions. The C/S can tell from Exam forms that all is well. This MUST carry a notice „Come in at once to the D of P if you cease to audit or run into trouble. Do this C/S in the next several sessions.

A PreOT can „rabbit” (run away from the bank) by proposing a C/S that does not make him confront it. 4.

Two gross goofs I have noticed since case supervising folders on the RSM is that Auditors have not been turning in Ethics cases to the MAA. In one instance, a Pc was audited by 2 auditors in 2 different sessions, got a R/S on crimes against Scientologists and M/W/Hs and neither auditor turned the Pc in to Ethics. This is not the only instance. The second thing is that Auditors are very evaluative of the Pc’s case as indicated by their comments on the Summary Report. This is incorrect; this report is used simply as an exact record of what hap-pened during the session. It is not up to the auditor to evaluate the Pc’s Case, this is the Case Supervisor’s job. The auditor may suggest what is to be run, at which time the Case Supervi-sor will review the session, what was run, how the Pc went in relation to what was being run and then give his directions. ____________________"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"SUMMARY OF HOW TO WRITE AN AUDITOR’S REPORT, 3    HCOB    7.5.69    WORKSHEETS AND SUMMARY REPORT, WITH SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 175 06.02.10 Auditor Report Forms or W/sheets are never recopied.

The basic trouble with a single-hand electrode is that it gives a falsely higher TA which can be very alarming. The Tone Arm range on the Meter should be between 2.0 and 3.0 for a floating needle to be valid. This is when two regulation electrodes (steel soup cans) are employed. When you use only one electrode, holding it in the left hand if you are right-handed, the TA can read as high as 4.0 when it is actually 3.0. Also a TA at 1.7 can read as 2.5! Single-hand electrodes are almost as old as the modern meter. An aluminum tea ball with an insulator between the screw threads served in the earliest models, an electrode leading to each half. Two stainless steel pipe sections about an inch in diameter, separated in the middle by a rubber ring, with an electrode to each end was a single-hand electrode version which came down to modern times. There were no further developments of any lasting value on this problem of single-hand electrodes until a few months ago. The problem in Solo Auditing is of course that if you held electrodes in both hands you couldn’t write or work the meter at the same time. BUT a single-hand electrode gives the wrong TA even if it does give the right needle reads (which it does). To get the right TA then one must unplug the single-hand electrode and plug in the two-hand electrode. In this opera-tion the TA can change and the wires get tangled. This commotion is of course distracting. What I worked out was a two-can electrode that became a single-hand electrode at once. You take 2 small juice or vegetable steel cans with their tops neatly removed. They must be the paper label, not the painted kind of course. The size required is 2 1/8 inches diameter at the rim (that is about 54 millimeters). The length is 3 ¾ inches (which is about 95 millimeters)."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"SOLO CANS 2 HCOB 14.7.70 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 192 06.02.10 You then take a piece of soft sponge or foam rubber about 3/8 inches thick (about 10 mm). You cut a circular piece of sponge rubber about 2 3/8 inches (about 60 mm). It is just slightly larger than the can diameter. You glue this sponge or foam rubber circle to the closed end of one can but not to the other. Snap the electrode wires into the open ends of the cans. You now have to all require-ments a two-can electrode setup, with the difference that one can’s base has a rubber pad on it. Holding these one in each hand gives you the 2-can more correct TA read. By putting the closed base of one can against the rubber pad on the other can, taking them in one hand (two fingers on each can as you hold them) you have a single-hand elec-trode. In an instant you can take them in two hands and get the correct TA (adjusting the Tone Arm with a knuckle or finger tip). Taking them back in one hand and resetting the TA you again have your single-hand read. In using this system you should change your notation to an indication of whether it is a one-hand or two-can read (to save your Case Supervisor from heart failure). The new notation is as follows: 3.75 (1) 2.9 (2). It doesn’t mean you always use both reads. You add the brackets and a 2 or 1 to show whether it’s a double or single (2) or (1) read. At session start and at end you always give both, i.e. 3.5 (1) 2.5 (2). And at the end you give a trim check like 1.9 = 2.0 (done by unplugging the electrodes from the meter for an in-stant and putting the needle at set and reading what the TA is). It should be 2.0 but often has drifted to 1.9 or 2.1. That verifies all reads. STANDARD ELECTRODES A standard can is about 2 ¾ inches (69 mm) diameter by about 4 ½ or 5 inches (114 mm or 127 mm) long. Steel soup or vegetable cans, unpainted, tops cleanly removed, label and glue washed off, tin plated or not, have been standard for many years. It is with these that calibration has been done. It is amusing that I had to work hard on electrodes to get the first meters to work at all. Everything got tried. Steel rods, aluminum (aluminium) tea balls, metal pads, metal straps, you name it. The only one that works consistently is the good old common kitchen variety soup can. It’s amusing to see efforts to „improve our electrodes”. Other versions have all been tried and failed and every few years we have to have a soup can revival campaign to get peo-ple back to standard reads. The smaller juice can as described for the single-hand electrode does not give the ex-act read as the standard cans when used as a two-can electrode. So the smaller can shouldn’t be used by Examiners. You can check the difference if you like between these two can sizes. But the standard cans are too big as a one-hand to be held comfortably in most peo-ple’s left hand. The difference is not great enough to worry anyone in normal auditing."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"SOLO CANS 3 HCOB 14.7.70 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 193 06.02.10 SMALL HANDS People with small hands or children can’t cope at all with a standard can. The size given for the single-hand (2 1/8” x 3 ¾”) is more suitable for them. For very little children, two Kodak 35 mm unpainted casette cans from any photo shop will serve admirably. These two 35 mm cassettes fixed with a rubber pad on the bottom of one as described for the single-hand electrode above will serve a child as a one-hand electrode. SHORTING The whole trick in preparing two separate cans to be held as a single-hand is to make sure that when you put the bottoms together they don’t short. They can cause a „rock slam” or a sudden fall if the metal of the cans touch. Thus the glued-on rubber pad must be a bit bigger than the can diameter and thick enough so it doesn’t press through. Old setups were bolted together and couldn’t be separated easily for two-can reads. These two cans are loose from each other. A drawing of the setup done by Richard Gorman is illustrative. Important note: The smaller cans can give a falsely low TA read being small. If you get such a read, have two large standard cans handy to snap onto the leads and check. Will save heart failure at seeing 1.7 for two-can read! L.

The coach is seated beside the student where the coach can also see the meter and worksheet. TRAINING STRESS: The student Solo auditor sets up the meter and Solo can and keeps a worksheet as in Solo Drill 1. Then turns to one of the Prepared Assessment Lists in the back of the Book of E-Meter Drills. He then places the list where he can see the list and the needle. He places a blank piece of paper over the list covering everything but the first item on the list. The Solo auditor then reads the first item on the list and notices if the meter reads on the item. He continues down the list moving the blank piece of paper as he goes. When a read occurs, the Solo auditor informs the coach of the item that read and what the read was. He then writes the item and it’s read on the worksheet. He also notes the time and TA position. The coach verifies that the student has done all of this correctly. Then the coach has the student continue doing the drill. Various assessment lists are used in this manner until the student can perform the actions of reading written material and noting if it reads and recording this on a work-sheet. The coach’s job is to encourage the student and keep him at it until he can do it easily. SOLO AUDITOR DRILL 4 NAME: CLEARING WORDS PURPOSE: To train the Solo auditor to clear the meanings of words in auditing questions or commands. POSITION: The student Solo auditor seated at a Solo auditing session set-up (per Solo Drill 2), and the coach seated beside the student so that the coach can also see the meter and work-sheets. A copy of HCOB 13 Oct 79 CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING is placed on the table where the student Solo auditor can read it, and see the meter needle."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"SOLO AUDITOR DRILLS 3 HCOB 6.12.79R SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 203 06.02.10 TRAINING STRESS: The student Solo auditor is to read the HCOB and note when the meter reads, find and clear the misunderstood word to F/N and keep worksheets. The Solo can and Solo session set-up is used. The coach ensures that the student Solo auditor does all of these actions. After this HCOB is word cleared, another bulletin is used (it doesn’t matter which bulletin). This drill is done until the Solo auditor can do it easily, and keep worksheets and operate the meter. (Although the student may be fumbly at first, the coach helps the student and encourages him until the student has mastered it.) SOLO AUDITOR DRILL 5 NAME: SOLO CYCLE OF ACTION PURPOSE: To train a Solo auditor in carrying out cycles of action in Solo auditing to com-pletion of that cycle, and to end cycle on it. POSITION: The Solo auditor seated at a table set up for a Solo session with the coach seated beside him. The student has a copy of the Book of E-Meter Drills opened to E~-20. TRAINING STRESS: The student Solo auditor uses the list of questions given in EM-20. (The word „your” in the questions is changed to „my”, and the word „you” is changed to „I”.) The student Solo auditor writes the question down on the worksheet, changing the wording as above, and notes whether the question read on the meter. Then he silently answers the ques-tion and writes down the answer. Then he acknowledges that that cycle is complete. The coach then verifies that the student did each step and whether the student is satisfied that he has done so. This drill is passed when the student can carry out this cycle without being dis-tracted or Q & Aing, does complete the cycle started and ends the cycle. (The questions, an-swers and acknowledgments are done silently and conceptually, not verbalized.) _____________ The student Solo auditor now does the following Solo E-Meter drills. The Solo session set-up, Solo cans are all used as in preceding drills, and the student writes on a worksheet. This is to keep familiarizing the Solo auditor with the tools he will be using in Solo auditing. The stu-dent must have completed the regular drills per the Book of E-Meter Drills before attempting these drills. If the student Solo auditor has difficulty with a drill done Solo, he should return to the appropriate Solo Auditor drill, or to the regular meter drill until he can do it easily. The numbers within the drills are the numbers from the Book of E-Meter Drills. The Solo E-Meter Drills are done silently. Drills 1 to 7 are exactly as given in the Book of E-Meter Drills and are not repeated here as a Solo action. Also use HCOB 14 Jul 70 SOLO CANS for proper use of Solo cans. SOLO E-METER DRILL 8: As for EM-8 except that student has the bulletin on the table beside the meter. He holds the electrodes (Solo cans) himself and observes the meter while reading the bulletin. SOLO E-METER DRILL 9: As for EM-9 except that student auditor holds Solo cans and reads bulletin. Considerable emphasis is on correct positioning of the meter, worksheets, and"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"SOLO AUDITOR DRILLS 4 HCOB 6.12.79R SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 204 06.02.10 reading material early in this drill. The student should experiment with these positions for optimum placement so as to see the meter at the same time as reading and to avoid session distractions. SOLO E-METER DRILL 10: As for EM-10. Additional notes as for previous drill. SOLO E-METER DRILL 11: As for EM-11 with student holding Solo cans and reading silently from origination sheet. E-METER DRILL 12: Omitted as a Solo drill. E-METER DRILL 13: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E-METER DRILL 14: As for EM-14 but with student holding Solo cans and reading bulletin. SOLO E-METER DRILL 15: As for EM-15 but the student holding the Solo cans and read-ing origination’s to himself and thinking the meaning of the origination conceptually. Coach asks: „What did the needle do while reading the line?” etc., as in the basic drill. In this drill the student learns that the meter read will occur when he reads the line and gets the concept, and trains the student to be able to read a line and note the meter reaction or lack of it, at the same time. Not read the line and then look at the meter later. It also trains the stu-dent that if he has his attention locked on the meter and doesn’t actually think the meaning of the line, the meter won’t read. SOLO E-METER DRILL 16: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E-METER DRILL 17: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E-METER DRILL 18: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E-METER DRILL 19: As for EM-19, but with the student Solo auditor holding the solo cans and the coach seated beside him, observing. The drill is done silently. The coach is to keep the student at it and asks commands as per EM-19 until the student can do it easily and with certainty. SOLO E-METER DRILL 20: Omitted as a Solo drill. SOLO E-METER DRILL 21: As for EM-21 but student auditor holding Solo cans. In this drill done Solo the student auditor will of course already know what he was thinking when the meter read. However, the drill is done as given to show the Solo student auditor that his thought will again produce the same read when he again thinks the same thought. It also illustrates the necessity for the Solo auditor to keep his attention on the reading item or subject in order to keep that item reading and further, when the thought is repeated it shows how the read on that thought will diminish and vanish as the charge is reduced by re-spotting the original thought. Therefore in the Solo drill there is a second step where the student is required to repeatedly think the same thought until the read no longer occurs and to note the reads on a worksheet as they occur. As this is an auditing technique used in certain Solo levels when discharging items the drill must be well done and continued to a high level of competence."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"SOLO AUDITOR DRILLS 5 HCOB 6.12.79R SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 205 06.02.10 SOLO E-METER DRILL 22: Omitted as a Solo drill.

We call this a “dangerous auditor”. There are certain exact specific actions or omissions that make such an auditor dan-gerous. These are: 1. Breaks the Auditor’s Code or ignores it as “only applying in certain cases”. 2. Audits past floating needles or directs additional auditing on that process when a float-ing needle has occurred. 3. Ceases to audit a process before the needle has gone free. 4. Starts a new grade of release without rehabilitation or making sure at least by record that an earlier grade has been rehabbed and was not overrun. 5. Does not locate the right SP on S & D but over or under lists or misses while assess-ing. 6. Goes on auditing the pc after an ARC Break without caring for the ARC Break (and believes it possible or usual to continue past one). 7. Consistently has hostile and derogatory opinions about his pcs. These are the really dangerous points that make an auditor who does them dangerous. (This list is composed by tracing back upset cases to the errors which made the upset.) An auditor who merely makes the five Gross Auditing Errors is just a bad auditor. (See HCO B 21 Sept 65 “Out Tech”.) A dangerous auditor often seems to be quite accomplished, but does the above. On some pcs he seems to get away with it and so will argue the virtue of his approach or viola-tions. But on the next pc he doesn’t and has a mess on his hands. A “careful” auditor is not necessarily not dangerous. One doesn’t audit carefully. One audits with a relaxed competence that follows the rules and avoids the errors listed above. There is no compromise for knowing one’s business. Most auditors, when they are trained and no longer make the 5 Gross Auditing Errors, become very excellent auditors and do a fine job and I am proud of them."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":" SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 208 06.02.10 L.

Cancels earlier issue of HCOB 14 Sept 71 Issue V, same title.) AUDITOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR C/SES The responsibility of a Solo Auditor who receives a Case Supervisor direction (C/S) of what to audit is not discharged of his responsibility as an Auditor. The solo auditor has a series of responsibilities that are part of every C/S he gets to audit. ACCEPTING A C/S When the Solo Auditor gets a C/S to do and he thinks it is not the correct thing to do, he has the right to return it to the C/S with the reason why and require another one he can agree to. The Auditor does not have the right to start doing a C/S and change it during the ses-sion except as noted below. STALE DATED C/S A C/S that is a week or two old can be dynamite. This is called a “Stale Dated C/S” meaning it is too old to be valid. It should have been done sooner. The pc of last week when the C/S was written may have been well and happily employed but a week later may have headaches and reprimand from the boss. The Solo Auditor who sees his C/S is old and sees the pc has Bad Indicators is justi-fied in demanding a fresh C/S giving his reasons why."},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"SOLO AUDITORS RIGHTS 2 HCOB 14.9.71R V SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 210 06.02.10 Use fresh C/Ses. ENDING THE SESSION When the C/S he has is proving unworkable during the session, the Solo Auditor has a right to end the session and send the folder to the C/S. Ending the session is totally up to the Auditor. If the Auditor just doesn’t complete an action that was producing TA and could be completes it is of course a flunk. Such a case is just not running a basic incident the one more time through that would bring the TA down and give a proper end phenomena. This and simi-lar actions would be an Auditor error. The judgment here is whether or not the Auditor’s action is justified in ending the ses-sion. Even though he may have made an error, the Auditor cannot be blamed for the ending off of the session as that is totally up to him. He can be given a flunk for the error. AUDITING OVER OUT RUDS Auditing a pc or pre- on something else whose ruds are out is a Major Auditing Er-ror. Even if the C/S omits “Fly a Rud” or “Fly Ruds” this does not justify the Auditor from auditing the pc over out ruds. The Solo Auditor can do one of two things: He can fly all ruds or he can return the folder and request ruds be flown. INABILITY TO FLY RUDS If an Auditor cannot get a rud to F/N, cannot get any rud to F/N, he is to end the ses-sion and send the folder to the C/S. This is an expected action. It is understood the Auditor would use Suppress and False in trying to fly ruds. SESSIONS FAR APART When a pc has not had a session for some time, or when a pc gets sessions days apart ruds must be flown. Otherwise the pc will get audited over out-ruds. This can develop men-tal mass."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"SOLO AUDITORS RIGHTS 3 HCOB 14.9.71R V SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 211 06.02.10 Optimum session scheduling is a whole Advanced Course done in a block of sessions close together. This prevents the world from throwing the pc’s ruds out between sessions. Giving sessions far apart barely keeps up with life. The auditing time is absorbed in patching life up. Rapid gain gets above life’s annoyances and keeps the pc there. UNREADING ITEMS When an item the Solo Auditor has been told to run doesn’t read on the meter, even when the Auditor puts in Suppress and Invalidate on it, the Auditor MUST NOT do anything with the item no matter what the C/S said. It is expected he will see if it reads and use Suppress and Invalidate on it. And if it still doesn’t read he will be expected not to run it. HIGH TA When the Auditor sees the TA is high on 2 cans (out of normal range) at session start yet the C/S says to “Fly a Rud” the auditor must not try to fly a rud. Trying to bring a TA down with ARC brks or ruds is very hard on a pc as ARC Breaks aren’t the reason TAs go up. Seeing a high TA at start the Solo Auditor does not start the session but sends the folder back to the C/S. THINGS DONE TWICE By carelessness the same process can be called for twice and done twice or even more. A Folder Summary inside the front cover must exist and must be kept up. Never neglect entering a session and what was run on the Folder Summary (FS). COPY Don’t copy worksheets from notes. Keep all admin neat and in the original form. Copying makes errors possible."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"SOLO AUDITORS RIGHTS 4 HCOB 14.9.71R V SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 212 06.02.10 RUDS GOING OUT When the ruds go out during the session the Solo Auditor recognizes the following: Pc Critical= W/H from Auditor Pc Antagonistic= BPC in Session No TA= Problem Tired= Failed Purpose or No Sleep Sad= ARC Break Soaring TA= Overrun or Protest Dope Off= By-Passed F/N or Not Enough Sleep No Interest= Out ruds or No Interest in the First Place A Solo Auditor who isn’t sure what it is but runs into trouble with the pc is smart to end off the session quickly, writs down the full observation and get it to the C/S. The Solo Auditor who is an old hand and knows what he is looking at as per above scale (and the C/S the C/S would give) handles it promptly. Pc Critical = W/H = pull the W/H. Pc antagonistic = BPC = assess proper list (such as L1C) and handle. No TA (or case gain) = Problem = locate the problem. Tired = no sleep or failed purpose = check which it is and handle.Sad = ARC Brk = locate and handle, Itsa ear-lier Itsa. Soaring TA = O/R or Protest = find which and handle. Such an O/R is usually by rehab. Dope off = Lack of sleep or BP F/N = check on sleep, or Rehab F/N. No Interest = no interest in first place or out ruds = check for interest or put in ruds. Ruds won’t fly = some other error = send to C/S. The Solo Auditor has no business trying to do the C/S given when it collides with and isn’t designed to handle any of the above."},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"SOLO AUDITORS RIGHTS 5 HCOB 14.9.71R V SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 213 06.02.10 FALSE REPORTS The vilest trick that can be played on his pc is for a Solo Auditor to falsify an auditing report. It may be thought to be “good Public Relations” (good PR) for the auditor with the C/S. Actually it buries an error and puts the pc at risk. Integrity is a hallmark of Dianetics and Scientology. Just because psychiatrists were dishonest is no reason for Auditors to be. The results are there to be gotten. False reports like false attests recoil and badly on both the Auditor and pc. “WHAT HE DID WRONG” A Solo Auditor has a right to know what he did wrong in the session that went wrong. Most often a sour session occurs only when the rules and data in this HCOB have been violated. But an Auditor’s TRs can go out or his handling of the process is in error. Not only does an Auditor have the right to be told what was wrong but he must be given the exact HCOB, date and title, that he violated. Never take a verbal or written correction that is not in an HCOB or tape. Don’t be party to a “hidden data line” that doesn’t exist . “You ruined the pc!” is not a valid statement. “You violated HCOB ______ page _____” is the charge. No Auditor may be disciplined for asking “May I please have the tape or HCOB that was violated so I can read it or go to Cramming.” If it isn’t on a tape, a book or an HCOB it is not true and no Auditor has to accept any criticism that is not based on the actual source data. “If it isn’t written it isn’t true” is the best defense and the best way to improve your tech. These are the rights of the Solo Auditor with relation to a C/S. They are all technical rights based on sound principles. A Solo Auditor should know them and use them. If a Solo Auditor stands on these rights and gets beaten down he should put all the facts before his nearest OTL or SO ship as something would be very wrong somewhere.

The drill enhances a Pre-OT’s ability to solo audit. It follows the basic format outlined in TR 8-Q in HCOB 22 APR 80 ASSESSMENT DRILLS, but contains additional steps specifically developed to increase a PreOT’s ability. NUMBER: TR 8-Q (for Solo Auditor Training) NAME: TONE 40 ASSESSMENT POSITION: Same as TR 8 where the student is in one chair facing another chair on which sits an ashtray, the coach sitting beside the student in a third chair. A square four-cornered ashtray is used. PURPOSE: To deliver the thought of a question into an exact position, wide or narrow at decision, that is a question, with or without words. COMMANDS: For the first part of the drill: Are you an ashtray? Are you made of glass? Are you sitting there? Second part of drill: Same questions silently. Third part of drill: Are you a corner? to each corner of the ashtray, verbal and with intention at the same time. Fourth part of drill: Any applicable question, verbal and with intention at the same time put broad and narrow at choice into the ashtray, exact parts of it and the surroundings. Fifth part of drill: Any applicable question put silently and with intention in exact spots around the student’s body, as indicated by the coach. TRAINING STRESS: The coach uses usual TR coaching commands. There are five stages to the drill. FIRST STAGE: The first stage is to land a verbal command into the ashtray. The coach has the student ask the ashtray: „Are you an ashtray?“ „Are you made of glass?“ „Are you sitting there?“ This is done until the student can do the drill easily. SECOND STAGE: The second stage is to put the question with full intention silently into the ashtray.

This is done until the student can do it easily. FOURTH STAGE: The coach has the student put any applicable question both with verbal command and with silent intention at the same time Into any narrow or any broad portion of the ashtray or its surrounds, at choice and at will. This is done until the student can do the drill easily and can put a question into an exact position, wide or narrow, at decision. FIFTH STAGE: The coach has the student put thoughts precisely in exact spots around the student’s body. (Note: Make sure the student can think in a concept rather than words and that he can put that concept in exact points around him at will.) (a) The coach has the student put thoughts in exact spots in front of the student’s body. The coach indicates the spot by putting his finger in the spot into which the student is to place a thought. The spots would be in areas in front of the student’s body, but not touching the stu-dent’s body. This is done until the student is proficient at it. (b) The coach has the student put a thought in exact spots above the student’s head, and be-hind the student’s body. The coach indicates the spot by putting his finger in the spot into which the student is to place a thought. The coach does not touch the student’s body. The drill is done until the student is quite expert at exactly placing a thought exactly where he wants it. CONCLUSION: At the conclusion of the whole drill, the coach has the student imagine the ashtray saying „Yes, yes, yes, yes“ in an avalanche of yeses to balance the flow (in actual life, people, pcs and meters do respond and return the flow.)

There is a wealth of technology and data on these subjects contained throughout the Technical Volumes and in Scientology books which the student auditor will need as he pro-gresses up the levels.) A rudiment is that which is used to get the pc in shape to be audited in that session. For auditing to take place at all the pc must be in session which means: 1. Willing to talk to the auditor 2. Interested in own case. That is all you want to accomplish with rudiments. You want to set up the case to run by getting the rudiments in, not use the rudiments to run the case. ARC breaks, present time problems and withholds all keep a session from occurring. It is elementary auditing knowledge that auditing over the top of an ARC break can reduce a graph, hang the pc up in sessions or worsen his case, and that in the presence of PTPs, overts and missed withholds (a restimulated undisclosed overt) no gains can occur. Thus these are the rudiments we are most concerned with getting in at the beginning of a session so that au-diting with gains can occur. GETTING THE F/N If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if some-thing does not release. If a rud doesn’t F/N then there is an earlier (or an earlier or an earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/Ning. Thus we have the procedure and the rule:"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"RUDIMENTS, DEFINITIONS AND PATTER 2 HCOB 11.8.78 I SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 220 06.02.10 If a rud reads you always take it earlier similar until it F/Ns. The question used is: “Is there an earlier similar (ARC break) or (problem) or (missed withhold)?” If at the beginning of a session the rudiments are in (the needle is floating and the pc is VGIs), the auditor goes directly into the major actions of the session. If not, the auditor must fly a rud or ruds, as ordered by the C/S. ARC BREAKS ARC: A word from the initial letters of Affinity, Reality and Communication which together equate to Understanding. ARC Break: A sudden drop or cutting of one’s affinity, reality or communication with someone or something. Upsets with people or things come about because of a lessening or sundering of affinity, reality, communication or understanding. While the earlier similar rule fully applies to ARC breaks, there is an additional action taken in handling ARC breaks that enables the pc to spot precisely what happened that re-sulted in the upset. An ARC break is called that – an “A-R-C break” – instead of an upset because, if one discovers which of the three points of understanding have been cut, one can bring about a rapid recovery in the person’s state of mind. You never audit over the top of an ARC break, and you never audit an ARC break it-self; they cannot be audited. But they can be assessed to locate which of the basic elements of ARC the charge is on. Thus to handle an ARC break you assess affinity, reality, communication and under-standing to find which of these points the break occurred on. Having determined that, you assess the item found (A or R or C or U) against the Ex-panded CDEI Scale (curious, desired, enforced, inhibited, no and refused). Ref: HCOB 13 OCT 59, DEI EXPANDED SCALE, SCIENTOLOGY 0-8. THE BOOK OF BASICS, and HCOB 18 SEP 67, CORRECTED 4.4.74, SCALES. With this assessment the actual bypassed charge can be located and indicated even more accurately, thus enabling the pc to blow it. The assessment is done on every ARC break as you go earlier similar until the rudi-ment is in with F/N and VGIs. The first rudiment question is: 1. “Do you have an ARC break?” 2. If there is an ARC break, get the data on it briefly. 3. Find out by assessment which point the ARC break occurred on: “Was that a break in Affinity? Reality? Communication? Understanding?”"},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"RUDIMENTS, DEFINITIONS AND PATTER 3 HCOB 11.8.78 I SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 221 06.02.10 You assess it once and get the read (or the largest read) on, say, communication. 4. Check it with the pc: “Was that a break in (communication)? If he says no, rehandle. If yes, let him tell you about it if he wishes. Then give it to him by indicating it, i.e. “I’d like to indicate that was a break in communication.” Provided the right item has been gotten, the pc will brighten up, even if ever so slightly, on the very first assessment. Note: On Step 4 the pc may originate: “Yes, I guess it was communication but to me it’s really more like a break in reality,” for example. The wise auditor then acknowledges and indicates it was a break in “reality.” 5. Taking the item found in Step 4 above, assess it against the CDEI Scale: “Was it: Curious about (communication)? Desired (communication)? Enforced (communication)? Inhibited (communication)? No (communication)? Refused (communication)?” 6. As in Steps 3 and 4 above, assess it once, get the item and check it with the pc: “Was it (desired) communication?” If no, rehandle. If yes, indicate it. 7. If no F/N at this point you follow it earlier with the question: “Is there an earlier similar ARC break?” 8. Get the earlier similar ARC break, get in ARCU, CDEINR, indicate. If no F/N, repeat Step 7, continuing to go earlier, always using ARCU, CDEINR until you get an F/N. When you get the F/N and VGIs you have it. PRESENT TIME PROBLEM Problem: A conflict arising from two opposing intentions. It’s one thing versus an-other thing; an intention-counter-intention that worries the preclear. Present Time Problem: . . . A special problem that exists in the physical universe now, on which the pc has his attention fixed. . . . Any set of circumstances that so engages the attention of the preclear that he feels he should be doing something about it instead of being audited.

If the auditor overlooks and doesn’t handle the PTP then the pc is never in session, grows agitated, ARC breaks. And no gains are made because he is not in session. The second rudiment question is: 1. “Do you have a present time problem?” 2. If there is a PTP, have the pc tell you about it. 3. If no F/N take it earlier with the question: “Is there an earlier similar problem?” 4. Get the earlier problem and if no F/N, follow it earlier similar, earlier similar, earlier similar to F/N. MISSED WITHHOLDS Overt Act: An intentionally committed harmful act committed in an effort to solve a problem. . . . an act of omission or commission which does the least good for the least number of dynamics or the most harm to the greatest number of dynamics. That thing which you do which you aren’t willing to have happen to you. Withhold: An undisclosed harmful (contra-survival) act. Something the pc did that he isn’t talking about. Missed Withhold: An undisclosed contra-survival act which has been restimulated by another but not disclosed. This is a withhold which another person nearly found out about, leaving the person with the withhold in a state of wondering whether his hidden deed is known or not. The pc with a missed withhold will not be honestly “willing to talk to the auditor” and, therefore, not in session until the missed withhold is pulled. Missing a withhold or not getting all of it is the sole source of an ARC break. A missed withhold is observable by any of the following: pc not making progress, pc critical of, nattery or angry at the auditor, refusing to talk to the auditor, not desirous of being audited, boiling off, exhausted, foggy at session end, dropped havingness, telling others the auditor is no good, demanding redress of wrongs, critical of Scientology or organizations or people of Scientology, lack of auditing results, dissemination failures. (Ref: HCOB 3 MAY 62, ARC BREAKS, MISSED WITHHOLDS.) The auditor must not overlook any manifestations of a missed withhold. Thus, if the pc has a missed withhold you get it, get all of it using the system described below, and use the same system on each earlier similar missed withhold until you get the F/N.

Never prepcheck an item that doesn’t read. These rules hold good for all lists, all items, even Dianetics. A „tick” or a „stop” is not a read. Reads are small falls or falls or long falls or long fall blowdown (of TA). A preclear’s case can be gotten into serious trouble by listing a list that doesn’t read or prepchecking or running an item that doesn’t read. On a list, this is the sort of thing that happens: The List is „Who or what would fly kites?” The C/S has said to „List this to a BD F/N Item”. So the auditor does list it without checking the read at all. The list can go on 99 pages with the pc protesting, getting upset. This is called a „Dead horse list” because it gave no item. The reason it didn’t was that the list question itself didn’t read. One does an L4 on the pc to correct the situation and gets „Unnecessary action”. On a list that is getting no item you don’t extend. You correctly use L4 or any subse-quent issue of it. If you extend a „dead horse list” you just make things worse. Use an L4 and it will set it right. This weird thing can also happen. C/S says to list „Who or what would kill buffa-loes?” The auditor does, gets a BD F/N Item „A Hunter”. The C/S also says to list as a second action „Who or what would feel tough?” The auditor fails to test the Question for read and lists it. Had he tested it, the list would not have read. But the list comes up with an item, „A mean hunter”. It has stirred up charge from the first question and the item „A mean hunter” is a wrong item as it is a misworded variation of the first list’s item! Now we have an unneces-sary action and a wrong item. We do an L4 and the pc is still upset as maybe only one or the other of the two errors read. ____________"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"UNREADING QUESTIONS AND ITEMS 2 HCOB 27.5.70 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 228 06.02.10 In a Dianetic „list” one is not doing a listing action. One is only trying to find a so-matic or sensation, etc. that will run. The item must read well. Or it won’t produce a chain to run. In actual fact the Dn list Q does usually read but one doesn’t bother to test it. But an item that doesn’t read will produce no chain, no basic and the pc will jump around the track trying but just jamming up his bank. The moral of this story is: Always test a Listing Question before letting the pc list. Always mark the read it gave (SF, F, LF, LFBD) on the worksheet. Always test an item for read before prepchecking or running recall or engrams. Always mark the read an item gave (SF, F, LF, LFBD) on the worksheet. CHARGE The whole subject of „charge” is based on this. „Charge” is the electrical impulse on the case that activates the meter. „Charge” shows not only that an area has something in it. It also shows that the pc has possible reality on it. A pc can have a broken leg, yet it might not read on a meter. It would be charged but below the pc’s reality. So it won’t read. THINGS THAT DON’T READ WON’T RUN. The Case Supervisor always counts on the Auditor to test Questions and Items for read before running them. The auditor, when a Question or Item doesn’t read, can and should always put in „Suppress” and „Invalidate”. „On this (Question) (Item), has anything been Suppressed?” „On this (Question) (Item), has anything been Invalidated?” If either one read, the question or item will also read. The Case Supervisor also counts on the Auditor to use Suppress and In-validate on a Question or Item. If after this there is still no read on the Question or Item, that’s it. Don’t use it, don’t list it. Go to the next action on the C/S or end off. L.

Remimeo All Levels F/N EVERYTHING Whenever an auditor gets a read on an item from Ruds or a prepared list (L1B, L3A, L4B, etc., etc.) it must be carried to an F/N. To fail to do so is to leave the pc with by-passed charge. When a pc has had several reads on various lists which were none of them carried to F/N, it can occur that he will become upset or depressed without any other apparent reason. As one has done the lists without F/Ning each item, one now has the mystery of what is wrong? The error is reading items from Ruds or prepared lists cleaned to no read but not car-ried to F/N. This action (amongst many such refinements) is what makes Flag auditing so smooth and indeed makes it Flag Auditing. When an auditor first tries this he may well think it is impossible. Yet it is simplicity itself. If you know bank structure you know it is necessary to find an earlier item if something does not release. What has been found as a read on a prepared list would F/N if it were the basic lock. So if it doesn’t F/N, then there is an earlier (or an earlier or an earlier) lock which is preventing it from F/Ning. So the rule: Never walk off from a reading item on a rudiment or a prepared repair list be-fore you carry it down (earlier similar) to an F/N. Example: ARC Brk reads. Pc says what it is, Auditor does ARCU CDEI. If no F/N, Auditor asks for an earlier similar ARC Brk, gets it, ARCU CDEI, etc. until he gets an F/N. Example: PTP reads. Carry it E/S (earlier similar) until a PTP F/Ns. Example: L4B: Has an item been denied you? Reads. Answered. No F/N. Is there an earlier similar denied item? Answered. F/N. Go on to next reading item on the list. Example: GF assessed once through for reads. The next C/S must take every item on it that read, by 2WC or other process, to an F/N. So there is a much more general rule: Every item that reads must F/N. In Dianetics you get the F/N when you run E/S secondaries or engrams to an erasure, F/N, Cog, VGIs."},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"F/N EVERYTHING 2 HCOB 14.3.71R SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 230 06.02.10 In Rudiments, every out rud you get a read on is run E/S to F/N. On a prepared list you take each read to an F/N or E/S to F/N. On an LX list you run each flow chain to an F/N. On GF you get by whatever process an F/N. On Listing by the Laws of Listing and Nulling, your eventual item listed must F/N. So another rule: Every major and minor action must be carried to an F/N. There are no exceptions. Any exception leaves by-passed charge on the pc. Also, every F/N is indicated at the conclusion of the action when cog is obtained. You take too soon an F/N (first twitch) you cut the cognition and leave by-passed charge (a withheld cognition). __________________ I could take any folder and simply write out the ruds and prepared list reading items and then audit the pc and carry each one to F/N and correct every list so disclosed and wind up with a very shining, cool calm pc. So „Have reading items been left charged?” would be a key question on a case. __________________ Using lists or ruds on high or low TAs that are not meant for high or low TAs will get you reading items that won’t F/N. So, another rule: Never try to fly ruds or do lib on a high or low TA. One can talk the TA down (see HCO B on Talking the TA Down). Or one can assess L4B. About the only prepared lists one can assess are the new Hi-Lo TA HCO B 13 Mar 71 and possibly a GF+40 once through for biggest read. The biggest read will have a blowdown on it and can possibly be brought to F/N. If this occurs then one also handles all other items that read. __________________ The most frequent errors in all this are: Not taking a read earlier similar but just checking it and leaving it as „clean”.

AUDITOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR C/SES The responsibility of a Solo Auditor who receives a Case Supervisor direction (C/S) of what to audit is not discharged of his responsibility as an Auditor. The solo auditor has a series of responsibilities that are part of every C/S he gets to audit. ACCEPTING A C/S When the Solo Auditor gets a C/S to do and he thinks it is not the correct thing to do, he has the right to return it to the C/S with the reason why and require another one he can agree to. The Auditor does not have the right to start doing a C/S and change it during the ses-sion except as noted below. STALE DATED C/S A C/S that is a week or two old can be dynamite. This is called a “Stale Dated C/S” meaning it is too old to be valid. It should have been done sooner. The pc of last week when the C/S was written may have been well and happily employed but a week later may have headaches and reprimand from the boss. The Solo Auditor who sees his C/S is old and sees the pc has Bad Indicators is justi-fied in demanding a fresh C/S giving his reasons why."},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"SOLO AUDITORS RIGHTS 2 HCOB 14.9.71R V SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 234 06.02.10 Use fresh C/Ses. ENDING THE SESSION When the C/S he has is proving unworkable during the session, the Solo Auditor has a right to end the session and send the folder to the C/S. Ending the session is totally up to the Auditor. If the Auditor just doesn’t complete an action that was producing TA and could be completes it is of course a flunk. Such a case is just not running a basic incident the one more time through that would bring the TA down and give a proper end phenomena. This and simi-lar actions would be an Auditor error. The judgment here is whether or not the Auditor’s action is justified in ending the ses-sion. Even though he may have made an error, the Auditor cannot be blamed for the ending off of the session as that is totally up to him. He can be given a flunk for the error. AUDITING OVER OUT RUDS Auditing a pc or pre- on something else whose ruds are out is a Major Auditing Er-ror. Even if the C/S omits “Fly a Rud” or “Fly Ruds” this does not justify the Auditor from auditing the pc over out ruds. The Solo Auditor can do one of two things: He can fly all ruds or he can return the folder and request ruds be flown. INABILITY TO FLY RUDS If an Auditor cannot get a rud to F/N, cannot get any rud to F/N, he is to end the ses-sion and send the folder to the C/S. This is an expected action. It is understood the Auditor would use Suppress and False in trying to fly ruds.

This prevents the world from throwing the pc’s ruds out between sessions. Giving sessions far apart barely keeps up with life. The auditing time is absorbed in patching life up. Rapid gain gets above life’s annoyances and keeps the pc there. UNREADING ITEMS When an item the Solo Auditor has been told to run doesn’t read on the meter, even when the Auditor puts in Suppress and Invalidate on it, the Auditor MUST NOT do anything with the item no matter what the C/S said. It is expected he will see if it reads and use Suppress and Invalidate on it. And if it still doesn’t read he will be expected not to run it. HIGH TA When the Auditor sees the TA is high on 2 cans (out of normal range) at session start yet the C/S says to “Fly a Rud” the auditor must not try to fly a rud. Trying to bring a TA down with ARC brks or ruds is very hard on a pc as ARC Breaks aren’t the reason TAs go up. Seeing a high TA at start the Solo Auditor does not start the session but sends the folder back to the C/S. THINGS DONE TWICE By carelessness the same process can be called for twice and done twice or even more. A Folder Summary inside the front cover must exist and must be kept up.

Tired = no sleep or failed purpose = check which it is and handle.Sad = ARC Brk = locate and handle, Itsa ear-lier Itsa. Soaring TA = O/R or Protest = find which and handle. Such an O/R is usually by rehab. Dope off = Lack of sleep or BP F/N = check on sleep, or Rehab F/N. No Interest = no interest in first place or out ruds = check for interest or put in ruds.

It may be thought to be “good Public Relations” (good PR) for the auditor with the C/S. Actually it buries an error and puts the pc at risk. Integrity is a hallmark of Dianetics and Scientology. Just because psychiatrists were dishonest is no reason for Auditors to be. The results are there to be gotten. False reports like false attests recoil and badly on both the Auditor and pc. “WHAT HE DID WRONG” A Solo Auditor has a right to know what he did wrong in the session that went wrong. Most often a sour session occurs only when the rules and data in this HCOB have been violated. But an Auditor’s TRs can go out or his handling of the process is in error. Not only does an Auditor have the right to be told what was wrong but he must be given the exact HCOB, date and title, that he violated. Never take a verbal or written correction that is not in an HCOB or tape. Don’t be party to a “hidden data line” that doesn’t exist . “You ruined the pc!” is not a valid statement. “You violated HCOB ______ page _____” is the charge. No Auditor may be disciplined for asking “May I please have the tape or HCOB that was violated so I can read it or go to Cramming.” If it isn’t on a tape, a book or an HCOB it is not true and no Auditor has to accept any criticism that is not based on the actual source data. “If it isn’t written it isn’t true” is the best defense and the best way to improve your tech. These are the rights of the Solo Auditor with relation to a C/S. They are all technical rights based on sound principles. A Solo Auditor should know them and use them. If a Solo Auditor stands on these rights and gets beaten down he should put all the facts before his nearest OTL or SO ship as something would be very wrong somewhere.

The Prepared List provides the auditor with a stable action when a session or case is confusing and can bring things under control. The idea of such lists and their development are original to Dianetics and Scientology. They are made possible because these subjects embrace the full extent of thought, the spirit and actual and potential aberration. Thousands of hours of research and development have gone into these lists. Thousands of case histories have been reviewed and condensed to make the lists possible. They are, in themselves, a considerable tour de force. They have often meant the difference between a failed case and a spectacular result. Just as they are important, a knowledge of them and skill in their use is vital to auditing suc-cess. HISTORY Probably the oldest „prepared list“ is the White Form, (now called THE ORIGINAL AS-SESSMENT SHEET – HCOB 24 JUN 78R). This provided a series of questions which would give one the background of the preclear. It dates from 1950. By it one can get the probable this life areas of the preclear’s heaviest charge. SELF ANALYSIS was written in 1951. It contains processing lists a preclear could run on himself. Group Auditing materials of the middle 50s contained lists of commands which were run on groups. Done on a meter, it provides a case entrance. The „Joburg“ of 1961 is probably the next historical point. It was a list of the possible withholds a preclear might have. It was called the „Joburg“ because it was developed in Jo-hannesburg, South Africa. The „L1“ was probably next. The original gave a list of session rudiments which might have gone out and enabled the auditor to get the session rudiments back in. It is still in use as „L1C“ or „List One C“. The „Green Form“ was developed in the early 60s so that Qual Review at Saint Hill would have a tool to analyze a case."},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND 2 HCOB 29.4.80 PURPOSE SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 240 06.02.10 Correction lists for various auditing actions began to appear. These corrected an action in progress that had gone awry. In 1973, the famous „C/S 53“ (meaning „Case Supervisor Series 53“) was devised and continued to be improved and reissued. Today there are dozens of Prepared Lists. There is even a prepared list to repair re-paired lists in general. THEORY OF PREPARED LISTS A Prepared List is an assembly of the majority of things which can be wrong in a case, an auditing action or a session. Such lists are quite remarkable, actually. Only a thorough knowledge of aberration makes such a list possible. When you look over the extent of Prepared Lists, you will see that they contain a grasp of the subject of aberration never before available. USE While an auditor is expected to have studied and mastered all this theory, it is a bit much to expect that in the confusion of a case or session gone wrong he will be able to spot instantly, without help, exactly what has gone wrong. Prepared Lists, where they exist, and his E-Meter will sort this out for him. All the auditor has to have is a general insight that something is going wrong, know in general what is being handled in the case, knows what list to use and then, with good TRs and metering, do an assessment of the Prepared List. Usually the trouble will come right, since the exact point will have been located. It is sometimes enough to merely indicate the point found to discharge it somewhat. One can F/N what is found or one can go into very wide, extensive handling. The point is, the use of the Prepared List has spotted the trouble. What is demanded of the auditor or C/S is which Prepared List to use, but this is determined by what has been going on. TYPES OF PREPARED LISTS There are four general types of Prepared Lists. These are: A. An Analysis list. This is a type of Prepared List which analyzes a case broadly or ana-lyzes a session. The purpose of it is to find out what to address in the case in order to program it. The White Form, the Green Form and the C/S 53 can all be used for this purpose. There are other such lists and there is even a Prepared List to debug produc-tion. B. A direct Auditing list. Prepared Lists exist which deliver direct auditing commands or questions which, run on the Pc, produce an auditing result. The lists of SELF ANALYSIS and the various Confessional Lists form this type of Prepared List."},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND 3 HCOB 29.4.80 PURPOSE SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 241 06.02.10 C.

There is a bit of a grey area in this type of list as one can also use some of them for analysis as in the case of a Course Supervisor Correction List or a Student Correc-tion List. The C/S 53 can also serve as a correction list. The real difference is what the list is being used for – to analyze to find out what to program or start or to correct something already in progress. D. Drill lists. These are used in training as dummy lists to get an auditor used to handling the meter and Prepared Lists. Such lists are contained in the Book of E-Meter Drills. METHOD OF HANDLING There are three methods of handling Prepared Lists, depending on the type of list. There is simply the method of asking the questions in sequence and getting the answer from the preclear. This would apply to a White Form or to auditing Prepared Lists as in Self Analysis or in Group Auditing. Very few lists are handled in this way. The second way is called „Method 3“ wherein the list is assessed on a meter and when a read is noted, the meter-reading question is taken up with the preclear and F/Ned. Method 3 is covered in HCOB 3 JUL 71 AUDITING BY LISTS. The third way is called „Method 5“. This type of assessment assesses the whole Pre-pared List rapidly without getting the preclear to talk and the reads are then noted. The largest read or reads are then taken up and F/Ned. Method 5 is covered in HCOB 3 JUL 71 AUDITING BY LISTS. TRS AND METERING Whether or not a Prepared List reads depends upon the auditor’s TRs and Metering. At one time or another Case Supervisors have had a great deal of trouble with this. Accuracy as to what really read was greatly in question. This came to view on Flag in the early 70s when Prepared Lists that had been assessed by Class IV trainees were then reassessed, same list, sane pc shortly after the first list assessment, by Class XIIs. Totally different results were found – lists on which few or no reads were obtained by the Class IV trainees were found to be very live by the Class XIIs. The difference of quality of TRs and metering were what made the difference with the prepared list response. HCOB 22 April 1980 contains the drills which remedy this. It is the TRs and metering of the auditor that makes a prepared list reliable, not the list itself. The champion list of all time is the C/S 53. On one page, any general thing that can be aberrated in a thetan has been assembled. There are two forms of it – Short Form for preclears who know the terms and Long Form for preclears who are unindoctrinated (they are the same lists but the Short Form is in single word and the Long Form is a full question)."},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND 4 HCOB 29.4.80 PURPOSE SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 242 06.02.10 A Director of Processing giving a D of P Interview can use one of these and obtain enough material to enormously help a Case Supervisor. It is not the only D of P Interview action but it is very helpful when used. An auditor can debug a program or a session with it. It can analyze a case for programming and it can also be used to correct a program or to correct a session. Originally it was developed to handle high and low Tone Arm cases and although it still says this, it also says it can „correct case outnesses“. And today, this is its greatest use. Priority of handling outnesses is a vital part of C/S 53. The first three groups of items – (Interiorization outnesses), B (List errors) and C (rudiments) – give the necessary or-der of handling. If Int is reading, nothing else can be handled until it is. List errors take the next priority. Then rudiments. If one were to try to repair a case out of sequence, a mess could occur. So this Prepared List also gives the sequence in which outnesses must be handled. The main fault in using a C/S 53 is overuse – an auditor reaching for it when he gets in trouble instead of improving the auditor’s own TRs, metering or knowledge of programming in the first place. But the C/S 53 is one of the most valuable tools an Auditor or a Case Supervisor has. GENERAL CASE HANDLING The Prepared Lists of all types place in the hands of the Case Supervisor and the audi-tor a procedure by which a case can be analyzed and programmed. Some auditing can be done direct from Prepared Lists. WORD CLEARING PREPARED LISTS It can happen that a Prepared List gets stalled on misunderstood words. For many Prepared Lists there are also full word clearing lists which can be done on the pc. At one time it was thought that before one did a list one should always word clear it. However, this has the liability that a pc who is in one kind of trouble can’t sit still until a full word clearing action is done. The amount of trouble which came from Prepared Lists came more from assessing and metering errors than it did from misunderstood words. When one is using a prepared list on a pc who has never had it word cleared, it is usu-ally enough to check that the read isn’t coming from a Mis U. Early in a pc’s auditing, about the time he gets a CS-1, the more critical prepared lists should be word cleared and the fact noted in his folder. But when one is doing this word"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"PREPARED LISTS, THEIR VALUE AND 5 HCOB 29.4.80 PURPOSE SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 243 06.02.10 clearing, tone arm action or significant reads should also be noted. One is liable to think he is word clearing whereas he is actually assessing. True, there are a lot of tech words on a prepared list that the pc isn’t likely to know. Unfortunately, the discoveries of Scientology exceed common language and require terms of their own. But a pc catches on to this quite rapidly. They are new ideas to him (even though he was been living with them all the eons of his existence). When the word is cleared, the idea is also thrown into action. So it is important to note meter reads and tone arm actions when clearing the words of prepared lists. No hard and fast rules can be drawn on this point of word clearing Prepared Lists. If you have already word cleared the key words of a key Prepared List before you need it, thank your stars. Otherwise, carry on and hope. SUMMARY A Case Supervisor and an auditor owe it to themselves to have a good command of this subject of Prepared Lists. There are many issues on the subject. There are dozens of Pre-pared Lists. Knowing what Prepared Lists exist is a vital step for a Case Supervisor and auditor. Knowing what each is used for is equally important. Knowing which lists have word clearing lists already prepared is of assistance. One has to know enough general tech in order to select what Prepared List to use. The ability to assess, as it applies to TRs and metering is extremely important in using Prepared Lists. When it comes to analyzing, auditing and correcting cases and actions, the Prepared Lists are a jewel box that glitters with potential success. L.

It can occasionally happen that an auditor misses a read on an item or question and does not run it as it “has not read”. This can hang up a pc badly if the item was in fact a read-ing item or question. It does not get handled and exists in records as “No read” when in fact it did read. Therefore all Dianetic auditors whose items occasionally “don’t read” and all Scientology auditors who get list questions that don’t read must be checked out on this HCOB in Qual or by the C/S or Supervisor. These errors come under the heading of Gross Auditing Errors as they affect metering. 1. An Item or Question is said to “Read” when the needle falls. Not when it stops or slows on a rise. A tick is always noted and in some cases becomes a wide read. 2. The read is taken when the pc first says it or when the question is cleared. This is the valid time of read. It is duly marked (plus any blow down). THIS reading defines what is a reading item or question. calling it back to see if it read is not a valid test as the surface charge may be gone but the item or question will still run or list. 3. Regardless of any earlier statements or material on Reading Items, an item does not have to read when the auditor calls it to be a valid item for running engrams or listing. The test is did it read when the pc first said it on originating it or in Clearing it? 4. That an item or question is marked as having read is sufficient reason to run it or use it or list it. Pc Interest, in Dianetics, is also necessary to run it, but that it did not read again is no reason to not use it. 5. When listing items the auditor must have an eye on the meter not necessarily the pc and must note on the list he is making the extent of read and any BD and how much. This is enough to make it a “reading item” or “reading question”."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"METER READING ITEMS 2 HCOB 28.2.71 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 246 06.02.10 6. In Clearing a listing Question the auditor watches the meter, not necessarily the pc and notes any read while clearing the question. 7. An additional calling of the item or question to see if it read is unnecessary and not a valid action if the item or question read on origination or Clearing. 8. That an item is marked as having read on an earlier Dianetic list is enough (also checking interest) to run it with no further read test. 9. To miss seeing a read on an origin or clearing is a Gross Auditing Error. 10. Failing to mark on the list or worksheet the read and any BD seen during pc origina-tion or clearing the question is a Gross Auditing Error. EYESIGHT Auditors who miss reads or have poor eyesight should be tested and should wear the proper glasses while auditing. GLASSES The rims of some glasses could obstruct seeing the meter while the auditor is looking at the worksheet or pc. If this is the case the glasses should be changed to another type with broader vision. WIDE VISION A good auditor is expected to see his meter, pc and worksheet all at one time. No mat-ter what he is doing he should always notice any meter movement if the meter needle moves. If he cannot do this he should use an Azimuth Meter and not put paper over its glass but should do his worksheet looking through the glass at his pen and the paper—the original design purpose of the Azimuth Meter. Then even while writing he sees the meter needle move as it is in his line of vision. CONFUSIONS Any and all confusions as to what is a “reading item” or “reading question” should be fully cleaned up on any auditor as such omissions or confusions can be responsible for case hang-ups and needless repairs. NO READ Any comment that an item or question “did not read” should be at once suspected by a C/S and checked with this HCO B on the auditor."},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"METER READING ITEMS 3 HCOB 28.2.71 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 247 06.02.10 Actually non-Reads, a non-reading item or question means one that did not read when originated or cleared and also did not read when called. One can still call an item or question to get a read. That it now reads is fine. But if it has never read at all, the item will not run and such a list will produce no item on it. It is not forbidden to call an item or question to test it for read. But it is a useless ac-tion if the item or question read on origination by the pc or clearing it with him.

(Green Form for general review, L1C for ARC Brks, L4B for listed items list errors.) METHOD 3 Use meter at a sensitivity so meter needle is loose but it is easy to keep needle at „Set”. If sensitivity is too high the needle will be in constant motion as one tries to set the TA. If too low, the instant read will not be visible. 5 is usual for upper grade cases. 16 is usual for lower grade or Dianetic cases. Have your meter in a position (line of sight) so you can see the list and the needle or you can see the needle and the pc. The meter position is important. Hold the mimeoed list close beside the meter. Have your worksheet more to the right. Keep record on your worksheet. Mark the pc’s name and date on it. Mark what list it is on the W/S with Time. It remains in the folder stapled to the W/S. Read the question on the list, note if it reads. Do not read it while looking at the pc, do not read it to yourself and then say it while looking at the pc. These are the L10 actions and"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"AUDITING BY LISTS 2 HCOB 3.7.71 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 250 06.02.10 are called Method 6, not Method 3. It is more important to see the pc’s cans than his face as can fiddle can fake or upset reads. TR 1 must be good so the pc clearly hears it. You are looking for an Instant Read that occurs at the end of the exact last syllable of the question. If it does not read, mark the list X. If the list is being done through an F/N and the F/N just continues, mark the Question F/N. If the question reads, do not say „That reads”. Mark the read at once (tick, SF, F, LF, LFBD, R/S), transfer the number of the Q to the W/S and look expectantly at the pc. You can repeat the Q by just saying it again if pc doesn’t begin to talk. He has probably already begun to answer as the Q was live in his bank as noted by the meter. Take down the pc’s remarks in shortened form on the W/S. Note any TA changes on the W/S. If the pc’s answer results in an F/N (Cog VGIs sometimes follow, GIs always accom-pany a real F/N), mark it rapidly on the W/S and say, „Thank you. I would like to indicate your needle is floating.” Do not wait endlessly for the pc to say more. If you do he will go into doubt and find more, also do not chop what he is saying. Both are TR errors that are very bad. If there is no F/N, at the first pause that looks like the pc thinks he has said it, ask for an Earlier Similar _____ whatever the question concerned. Do not change the Q. Do not fail to repeat what the Question is. „Was there an Earlier Similar Restimulation of ‘rejected affin-ity’?” This is the „E/S” part of it. You do not leave such a Question merely „clean”. It does not matter now if you look at the pc when you say it or not. But you can look at the pc when you say it. The pc will answer. If he comes to a „looks like he thinks he said it” and no F/N, you ask the same Q as above. You ask this Q „Was there an earlier similar ______” until you finally get an F/N and GIs. You indicate the F/N. That is the last of that particular question. You mark „F/N” on the list and call the next question on the list. You call this and other questions without looking at the pc. Those that do not read, you X as out. The next question that reads, you mark it on the list, transfer the question number to the W/S. Take the pc’s answer."},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"AUDITING BY LISTS 3 HCOB 3.7.71 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 251 06.02.10 Follow the above E/S procedure as needed until you get an F/N and GIs for the ques-tion. Ack. Indicate and return to the mimeoed list. You keep this up until you have done the whole list in this fashion. If you got no read on the list Question but the pc volunteers some answer to an unread-ing question, do not take it up. Just ack and carry on with your mimeoed list. Believe your meter. Do not take up things that don’t read. Don’t get „hunches”. Don’t let the pc run his own case by answering non-reading items and then the auditor taking them up. Also don’t let a pc „fiddle the cans” to get a false read or to obscure a real one. (Very rare but these two actions have happened.) BIG WIN If half way down a prepared list (the last part not yet done) the pc on some question gets a wide F/N, big Cog, VGIs, the auditor is justified in calling the list complete and going to the next C/S action or ending the session. There are two reasons for this – one, the F/N will usually just persist and can’t be read through and further action will tend to invalidate the win. The auditor can also carry on to the end of the prepared list if he thinks there may be something else on it. GF AND METHOD 3 When a GF is taken up Method 3 (item by item, one at a time and F/Ned) it can occur that the TA will go suddenly high. The pc feels he is being repaired, that the clearing up of the first item on the GF handled it and protests. It is the protest that sends the TA up. This is not true of any other list. Thus a GF is best done by Method 5 (once through for reads, then the reads handled). L1C and L4B, L7 and other such lists are best done by Method 3. The above steps and actions are exactly how you do Auditing by List today. Any ear-lier data contrary to this is cancelled. Only 2 points change – we F/N everything that reads by E/S or a process to handle (L3B requires processes, not E/S to get an F/N) and we never tell the pc that it read or didn’t read, thus putting his attention on the meter. We still indicate F/Ns to the pc as a form of completion. L1C and Method 3 are not used on high or very low TAs to get them down or up.

There are some other points. For some reason C/Ses are being inventive instead of fol-lowing the C/S Series and doing standard repairs and grades. Probably the failure to use Prepared Correction Lists derails the use of standard ac-tions. There are very few actions which do not have their own Correction Lists. There is nothing in Dianetics and Scientology as miraculously workable as cor-rection lists. The only things which prevent the list from working are (a) Auditor’s Metering (b) Auditor’s TRs.

It is a Standard Cramming action to look into these points whenever a correction list is said to be blank. For example a GF is done by Auditor A on Monday. It is done again by Auditor B on Tuesday.

NUMBERS OF LISTS The number of Correction Lists is large. It is unthinkable to do Word Clearing without ever using a WC Corr List. Yet we find folders with bogged Word Clearing sessions where the list was never used. There is the Green Form for general case upset, the Green Green Form for Solo, L 1 C for ARC Brks over a period, L3B for Dianetic bogs, L4B for listing and nulling goofs, Int RD Corr List for Int-Ext corrections, a Power Corr List for Power, GF 40R for resistive cases, C/S 53 and Hi Low TA for TA misbehavior, L7 for Clearing Course, and others. C/Ses trying to „solve cases” without using Correction Lists is like trying to repair flat tires without puncture patches – it just can’t be done. The primary tool of a C/S is prepared correction lists. It is not inventive ways of „solving cases”. METHOD OF USE Where you have inexpert auditors you always order Method 5, which is just a full rapid assessment. Then the C/S sorts out the reads and C/Ses what to do as very well covered on the lists themselves and the C/S Series. Then the auditor does the C/S. A Green Form is always done this way. It will bog on any other method like 3. There are different methods of handling lists. L1C is always done Method 3, carrying each read as it is found Earlier Similar to F/N. A GF 40R is done Method 3 and then the engrams are run for each read where en-grams are indicated. It’s up to a C/S to use Correction Lists, to coach his auditors into proper list use and to get corrected any misuse. A C/S who can’t or doesn’t use Prepared Correction Lists isn’t a C/S at all but a „per-son puzzled about cases”.

The reason the Method is needed is because the person often does not know that he does not know. Therefore Method 4 has its limitations as the meter does not always read. The actions are very precise. The word clearer asks „What is the definition of _____?” The person gives it. If there is any doubt whatever of it, or if the person is the least bit hesitant, the word is looked up in a proper dictionary.

While there is considerably more data on these subjects in the Technical Volumes and on the Class VIII tapes, this issue sets forth the key data and presents the methods for rehab-bing in one consolidated issue for the first time. DEFINITIONS „Rehab“ is a shortened version of „rehabilitate“, which means: to restore to a former capacity or condition. „Release“ is the term for what occurs when a person separates from his reactive mind or some part of it or when he separates from some mass. In Scientology we use the term „rehabilitate“ most commonly to mean: restoring a state of release previously attained by the pc. RELEASES Scientology processes can be categorized as follows:"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 2 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 264 06.02.10 1. Those processes which direct the preclear's attention to the mental masses in his reac-tive mind in order to enable him to separate out from them. 2. Those processes which are aimed at increasing the preclear's abilities. Both types of processes lead to release Both types of processes are necessary to bring a person up the levels of awareness and up each step of the Grade Chart to OT. When you take a thetan out of a mass, that's a release. When you erase the mass and leave the thetan there, that's an erasure. Erasure is a dif-ferent phenomenon from release. In auditing, when the pc spots something in the bank he disconnects from the bank to a greater or lesser degree. That is a release. Or, when the pc becomes free of a difficulty or per-sonal „block“ or inability stemming from the mind, that is a release. A person can and does go release many times in the course of his auditing. He may go release many times while being run on the processes of a Grade before he attains the ability of that Grade. The Grades Releases are covered fully in HCOB 22 SEP 65, RELEASE GRADATION, NEW LEVELS OP RELEASE, in HCOB 27 SEP 65, RELEASE GRADATION, ADDITIONAL DATA, and on the Grade Chart itself. Further data can be found in HCO PL 23 OCT 80 II, CHART OF ABILITIES GAINED FOR LOWER LEVELS AND EXPANDED LOWER GRADES. Oddly enough, the idea of release can translate through to the pc to include releases in life, too. For example, a person was in prison and they let him out. This might well read as a release on a pc being asked about former releases, and it would be okay. One sees how this can be in view of the basic concept of release, e.g. when you take a person out of a mass - any mass - that is a release. So „release“ points in life such as the above are valid, and, though one doesn't ask for them specifically, should they come up during a former release rehab on a pc, they are to be handled. However, the auditor must understand that such a release in no way means that a per-son is a release on a process or on one of the Grades! Prison might be a problem to someone but getting out doesn't make him a Problems Release! Don't misconstrue one for the other and declare someone a Grades Release at some Level because he had a release in life. Actually one can go release on any subject and theoretically one could rehab any re-lease a pc had. The exact subjects a pc must be released on in order to make it up the Bridge are those listed on the Grade Chart. Occasionally it is necessary to rehab a win or state at-tained by the pc which is not specifically mentioned on the Grade Chart. But, again, one would not mistake it for a Grade Chart Release. (Ref: HCOB 30 AUG 80, KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING SERIES 24, WINS, „STATES“, AND GRADE CHART DECLARES.) "},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 3 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 265 06.02.10 OVERRUN Overrun occurs when the thetan considers that something has gone on too long or happened too often. When the person begins to feel this way about something, he begins to protest it and try to stop it. This tends to make things more solid and builds up mass in the mind. People who are very intent on stopping things in life appear solid and massy. In auditing, an overrun means the preclear came out of the bank and then went back into it again. For instance, the pc released on the process „From where could you communi-cate to your dog?“ but the auditor continued the process after he should have indicated the F/N and gone on to something else. By continuing, the auditor throws the pc back into the bank again and wrecks the release state. An overrun in auditing can also mean that the pc gained an ability to do something and the auditor continued the process or grade past the point where the ability had been regained. By pushing on, the ability can get invalidated. In both cases the person’s attention goes back onto his case and hangs up. The person can feel the mass of it again. In life when something is overrun, the person begins to accumulate protests and upsets about the thing or activity he feels overrun on. His attention tends to stick on it. This also builds up mass. An overrun, whether it occurred in auditing or in life, is handled in auditing using the tech of rehabbing. THEORY OF REHABBING The theory of rehabs is based on the following stable datum: This particular universe is built by twos. One cannot know a datum unless there is another datum to compare it to. This fact can also be seen to operate in the field of the mind. (Ref: Logic 8, SCIENTOLOGY 0-8, THE BOOK OF BASICS.) Thus, in rehabbing a release point one is getting the pc to view one datum (a time of release from a mass) as compared to another datum (a time he was stuck in the mass) and when this is done the pc moves out of the mass once again. That is the simplicity of what oc-curs. To expand on the mechanics involved, it can be described as follows: When a person has been overrun, he is trying to stop the mass or thing he has gone back into. The other side to that is the time or times he was released from it. These are oppo-sites: the „plus“ of the mass and the „minus“ of the time the mass wasn't there. This idea of opposites tends to hang things up. The idea then behind handling an overrun is to unstabilize this plus-minus pair by get-ting the pc to clearly spot the „minus“ side of it. When this happens, the „plus“ side goes."},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 4 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 266 06.02.10 When the pc's attention is directed to the points when he was released from the mass he ceases to try and stop the mass and it goes. The release state then rehabilitates. So the mechanism being worked with here is that the mass connected with an overrun can be knocked out by spotting the release connected with it. It is a very simple principle which has important uses in auditing. TYPES OF REHABS There are three types of rehab procedures for use in rehabbing releases or states. The earliest is Rehab 1965 Style. This is followed by Rehab by Counting which I de-veloped in 1968. Later on, in 1971, I developed the Date/Locate procedure. Each of the three has its uses depending on what it is one is trying to rehab. One does a Rehab '65 Style when one is rehabbing a specific point, such as the point a specific former release was attained. A Rehab by Counting is done when, for instance, a process appears overrun in session, or when one is rehabbing „releases“ such as on drugs on the Scientology Drug Rundown, or at any time something is likely to have a number of releases connected with it. A Date/Locate is used when one wants to directly spot the exact time and location of a specific incident and thus blow the mass connected with it. (Date/Locate is used on the last step of the Dianetic Clear Special Intensive to determine the exact point a person went Clear. The Date/Locate procedure has many other uses in other types of auditing as well, but in re-habbing its most frequent use is on the DCSI, per the above.) INDOCTRINATING THE PC The procedure for doing a rehab is quite simple when one understands the theory of it and makes sure the pc does, too. Before doing any rehab or Date/Locate, clear the terms and procedure with the pc so that he understands. Use the data in this issue to clear the theory of release and rehabs, and to clear the procedure to be used – Rehab ‘65 Style or Rehab by Counting. Use data in HCOB 15 NOV 78, DATING AND LOCATING, in indoctrinating the pc to the Date/Locate theory and procedure. All the terms and steps of the procedure are covered in that issue. The better the pc understands what is going on the smoother it will go. Do not skimp this indoctrination step. Any auditing efforts can go up in smoke if one tries to audit the pc over misunderstoods. 1. Clear the terms below with the pc, using demos and consulting the pc’s understanding. A. Release: 1. A person who has been able to back out of his bank. The bank is still there but the person isn’t sunk into it with all its somatics and depressions. 2. When the pc disconnects from the mass in his bank, that is a release. When"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 5 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 267 06.02.10 this happens, the pc disconnects from the bank to a greater or lesser degree. 3. A person who has become free of a difficulty or personal „block“ stemming from the mind. 4. When you take a thetan out of a mass, that is a release. B. Rehabilitate: to restore to a former capacity or condition. In auditing, this means to do the series of actions in session which result in regaining a state of release for the pc. Abbreviated „Rehab“. C. Key-In: the action of some part of the reactive mind moving in on the person. A Key-in occurs when the environment around the awake but fatigued or dis-tressed individual is similar to some part of the reactive mind. Since the reac-tive mind operates on the equation A=A=A, the present time environment be-comes identified with the contents of a particular portion of the bank and so it activates and exerts its influence on the person. D. Key-Out: the action of the reactive mind or some portion of it dropping out of restimulation on the pc. E. Grade: a series of processes culminating in an exact ability attained, examined and attested to by the pc. (See the Classification Gradation and Awareness Chart for the complete explanation of the different grades.) Auditing processes result in a release. The auditing processes of a Grade, when done, result in the pc attaining the specific ability of that Grade. 2. Clear „overrun“ with the pc, using the section „Overrun“ in this issue. Have the pc demo an overrun in auditing and in life. 3. Clear with the pc the stable datum on which rehabbing is based (under „Theory of Re-habbing“ in this issue). Have him demo each (using a demo kit) as needed to ensure he's got it. 4. Using a demo kit, clear with the pc the simple mechanics of rehabbing (spotting the release connected with a mass). Ref: Section on „Theory of Rehabbing“ in this issue. 5. Go over with the pc each step of the procedure to be used (Rehab '65 Style or Rehab by Counting or Date/Locate, if needed). Clear any words regarding these procedures, which have not previously been cleared in the pc's auditing. Use a demo kit as needed. 6. Cover meter dating with the pc so he understands its purpose and how it is done. Use E-Meter Drill 22 to explain it. Ensure the pc understands you don't want him depend-ent on the meter but that you will help him, using the meter, if necessary. (Ref: HCOB 4 AUG 63, ALL ROUTINES, E-METER ERRORS, COMMUNICATION CYCLE ERROR.) Be sure the pc understands the simple basics of rehabbing with no questions or confu-sions or misunderstood terms, before you begin any rehab. Additionally, when doing any type of rehab session it is important to ensure the pc's ruds are in before starting."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 6 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 268 06.02.10 REHAB PROCEDURES PROCEDURE FOR REHAB '65 STYLE I. Determine what is going to be rehabbed. This might be a release on a process, some other type of former release, the ability of a Grade attained or some other state achieved by the pc. A. For a process, use the question: „Were you released on _____ (Process)?“. a. Clear the question on the pc first, omitting the name of the actual process. b. Then check the question (including the name of the actual process) on the meter. c. If no read on the question, check Suppress and Invalidate. d. If the pc says he was released but no read on the question, check Suppress or In-validate. If pc is assertive or protesty about having been released, check Asserted and/or Protest. B. For rehabbing a state: One would simply orient the pc to the state (having already verified that it is a valid state and having C/S instructions to do so) and proceed with the rehab steps. (Ref: HCOB 30 AUG 80, KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING SERIES 24, WINS, „STATES“, AND GRADE CHART DECLARES.) (Exception: The State of Clear would only be handled on a full Dianetic Clear Special Intensive. Any other states which might come up on that Intensive would, if valid, be handled routinely by the trained DCSI auditor, per DCSI procedure.) C. Rehabbing Grades: Data on using '65 Style to rehab Grades is covered in the „Rehab-bing Grades“ section of this issue. D. Rehabbing Former Releases: Data on using '65 Style to rehab former releases is cov-ered in the „Rehabbing Former Releases“ section of this issue. II. When it has been determined that the pc was released on the process, the Ability Gained for a Grade had been attained or the state being rehabbed has been established, one pro-ceeds by first finding out when this occurred, per Step 1 below, and then continues with remainder of the rehab steps: 1. Loosely locate the session or time in which it occurred. (Note: This may have to be meter dated if the pc is unable to locate when it happened. For this reason, any auditor doing rehabs must be adept at E-Meter Drill 22, „E-Meter Hidden Date, This Life“. Also, see HCOB 2 AUG 65, RELEASE GOOFS, Point 4, Meter Mis-use.) You simply want to determine when. The pc may give you the year, month and day of the release, he may describe it by significance („The moment I thought to myself,"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 7 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 269 06.02.10 'That's why I wrecked the car!“'), or he may spot when it occurred by location („It oc-curred when I was in session for the first time with Joe in his new auditing room.“). The reference for this is: HCOB 8 JUN AD13, THE TIME TRACK AND ENGRAM RUN-NING BY CHAINS, BULLETIN 2, HANDLING THE TIME TRACK. Note: The indicators which tell you that the release or state is rehabilitated are an F/N on the meter and VGIs on the pc. If this occurs on any step of the rehab procedure, simply indi-cate the F/N and gently end off on that rehab action. 2. Get in Suppress, Invalidate buttons on the session or time. 3. Get in „unacknowledged“ or „what was unacknowledged“. 4. Indicate anything found to the pc as By-Passed Charge. 5. Find the Key-in that was Keyed-out in that time or session. (The person went release because something keyed out in that time or session.) 6. When this is found and recognized by the pc, the pc will recover the release and the process, Grade, state, etc. will be rehabilitated. 7. If this does not happen, find out what keyed in (at some point after the release) that ended the release state and get it loosely located as in Step 1. 8. Repeat Steps 2 to 6 on it.* 9. Conditional: If, when the above is done, the release still has not rehabbed, get the pc to Itsa alternately the point of key-out when the pc released and the point of key-in af-terwards, one after the other. (Use the meter to guide the pc, if necessary, by asking „What's that?“ when you see a fall on the needle.) This isn't an alternate/repetitive question - „What was keyed out then?“/“What was keyed in then?“ - but a use of these and any such wording, one after the other, as Itsa invitations until the release is re-gained and F/N, VGIs obtained. CHECKING FOR EPs If one wants to check if the pc has reached the EP of a process, or if one suspects that the EP may have been reached out of session, one can check „Did anything occur?“ per HCOB 5 DEC 71 IMPORTANT END PHENOMENAS and if the EP has been reached it can be re-habbed using the Rehab '65 Style. One would never ask leading questions or feed the EP to the pc in such situations. Simply check if anything occurred. PROCEDURE FOR REHAB BY COUNTING 1. Establish there is something to be rehabbed. (Naturally, you can't rehab a release if there isn't one. You couldn't rehab a process if the pc had never run it.)   * Editor’s note: Obviously a mistake. Steps 2 to 4 are meant."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 8 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 270 06.02.10 The question would vary depending on the situation being rehabbed. a. If it looks (due to overrun phenomena) as though a process has been overrun in session, one could ask, „Have we by-passed a release point on this process?“. b. For rehabbing releases on drugs on the Scientology Drug Rundown, one would check, „Did you go release on ______ (drug)?“ 2. If there is a release the question should read. If no read, check Suppress and Invali-date. There must be a read either on checking the question or on the pc's origination that there is a release there, before proceeding with the rehab. 3. If no read but the pc says he was released, check if the release has been Suppressed or Invalidated. If the pc is asserting release or being protesty about it, check Asserted and/or Protest. 4. Sometimes the pc will F/N simply on spotting he was released. This can be quite common especially when the pc's ruds are in and the auditor's TRs are smooth. An F/N with good indicators tells you that the rehab is complete and the mass has keyed out or the state has been rehabilitated. 5. If no F/N on spotting there was a release, ask the pc how many times he was released. Get him to count the number of times and when he gets it he will F/N. 6. Sometimes the pc can’t get the number and the auditor can then use the meter to count how many times and get it that way. He can ask the pc if he has some idea of ap-proximate number of times and then use „More than ______?“/“Less than _____?“. He uses the tech of E-Meter Drill 22 to establish the general range of number of times. He would then count to the pc. („Were you released on (______) 10 times? 11, 12?“, etc.) The correct number of times will read and, when indicated, will F/N. Rehab by counting is a simple procedure but it can get messed up by an uncertain atti-tude on the part of the auditor or by rough auditor TRs, so be sure you are confident and well drilled. BRIDGING FROM REHAB BY COUNTING TO '65 STYLE If, even with the ruds in, doing a Rehab by Counting doesn't F/N, one can bridge over into a Rehab '65 Style and rehab it that way. Doing a Rehab '65 Style will clean up any by-passed charge on the release and allow it to rehab. If on the Rehab by Counting the pc had said he was released several times, one would have to find the primary release point (the one „that is most real to him,“ or when he „had the biggest win,“ etc.) in order to do the Rehab '65 Style steps on that release point. Handled smoothly in this way, you will be able to rehabilitate the release, with F/N, VGIs."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 9 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 271 06.02.10 DATE/LOCATE/ PROCEDURE The Date/Locate procedure is very thoroughly covered in HCOB 15 November 1978, DATING AND LOCATING, and thus is not repeated here. It is based upon the fundamentals principles of rehab tech, but the additional theory and full Date/Locate procedure contained in HCOB 15 Nov 78 must be understood and drilled well before it is done on any pc. ADDITIONAL DATA ON SPECIFIC USES OF REHAB PROCEDURES If one is to handle rehabs he must know the fine differences involved in the applica-tion of rehab tech to each type of thing to be rehabbed. For example, the rehabbing of Grades and the rehabbing of former releases differ from each other and they also differ slightly in some of their steps from the rehabbing of specific processes or states as covered earlier in this issue. For this reason each is taken up separately here in its own section. REHABBING GRADES The rehabilitation of any Grade is done on the basis of actual auditing having been done to the end product of the specific Ability Gained for the Grade on all flows. (Note: Pc’s should be Quaded up by the time they receive their Grades.) One does not rehab a Grade by checking „Did anything occur?“ or „Were you released on Grade ______?“ Of course something would have occurred on the Grade and the pc would released each time a process or a flow on a process of the Grade F/Ned. This is not what you're looking for. The End Phenomena of a Grade is the attainment of an ability by the pc which he did not previously have. Each level of the Grade Chart results in a specific ability gained by the pc when he does that particular Grade. These are expressed on the Grade Chart in the „Ability Gained“ column. The specific ability for each of the four flows of a Grade is listed in HCOB/HCO PL 23 OCTOBER 1980 ISSUE II, CHART OF ABILITIES GAINED FOR LOWER LEVELS AND EXPANDED GRADES. These are what you are interested in finding out and rehabbing, if they have been attained. You want to determine that the pc has gained the ability for each flow of the Grade when you are rehabbing. It's not: Did he get his Grade 0 ability? It's: Is he willing for others to communicate to him on any subject? Does he no longer resist communication from others on unpleasant or unwanted subjects? Yes? Good, he's made it on Flow 1 of Grade 0."},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 10 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 272 06.02.10 Does he have the ability to communicate freely with anyone on any subject? Is he free from or no longer bothered by communication difficulties, and no longer withdrawn or reti-cent? Does he like to outflow? If so, he's attained the ability on Flow 2 of Grade 0. One checks each flow of a Grade for the ability of that flow in this way. If the pc says he can't, or if he reads on the meter as being unable to communicate freely to others, for ex-ample, then you know he is not complete on that Grade. He would need to have an FES done at least as far back as the beginning of that Grade and any errors found corrected, and then more processes for that Grade run on all flows until the Ability Gained had been genuinely attained. Further data about handling the pc who hasn't made a Grade is contained in C/S Se-ries 4. A Dianetic pc who couldn't honestly say he was a well and happy human being would need more somatic items run out R3RA. One would never try to rehab a Grade the pc had never really been run on, or for in-stance, Q and A with a pc who asserted he was a Grade 2 Release because he went to confes-sion as a youth. The Abilities Gained of the Grades are attained only by auditing on the vari-ous processes of each Grade. The results of well-run Grades are light years above anything that other fields or practices can offer, so don't sell them short by omitting or quickying them. The procedure, then, for rehabbing a Grade is as follows: 1. Establish from folder study that the pc has run the processes of the Grade on all flows in the first place. There should be some evidence in the folder that the pc has attained the Grade, whether previously declared or not. He should have run enough processes for this to be evident. 2. Show the pc (with pc on the meter) the written statement of the Ability Gained for Flow 1 of the Grade, and have him read it. (Ref: HCOB/HCO PL 23 OCTOBER 1980 II, CHART OF ABILITIES GAINED FOR LOWER LEVELS AND EXPANDED LOWER GRADES.) 3. Then check with the pc as to whether he has attained (or „can do“) the ability for that flow of the Grade, as stated in HCOB/HCO PL 23 October 1980 II. 4. If he has attained it, rehab it by Rehab '65 Style. 5. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 on the Ability Gained for each of the remaining flows (Flows 2, 3 and 0) of the Grade. 6. If the pc has attained the ability on each flow of the Grade, he is a valid release on that Grade. 7. If the pc doesn't have the Ability Gained for one or more of the flows of the Grade, he doesn't have the abilities of the Grade. The processes (and the flows) he ran on it would have to be FES'd to locate any errors. The errors found would have to be cor-rected and any unflat process flattened. Then additional processes for that Grade would need to be run until the pc really had the Ability Gained for each flow of the Grade."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 11 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 273 06.02.10 REHABBING FORMER RELEASES Rehabbing former releases came into being in 1965 and was done most frequently in that year and the years immediately following it, after the Grades had been established. At that time it was necessary to clear up and get acknowledged the former releases a pc may have had during his processing in the previous years, and to determine that he had been re-leased on each Grade before he went onto Power and Clearing. It is still a very valid tech that is used when needed. It may in some instances be done, at the adjudication of the C/S, where a case is hav-ing trouble or is bogged and the C/S suspects from folder study that the case may be hung up on former release points. In genning the pc in to this action ensure he understands what is being looked for. Al-though one uses Rehab '65 Style, the action is not the same as rehabbing a Grade or even ex-actly the same as rehabbing a process. Here you are looking for times in the pc’s auditing his-tory, recent or distant, when he felt good in sessions. This would not necessarily have to be a specific EP of a process the pc ran or the EP of a particular Grade. Rehabbing former releases is not limited by reference to any specific process or Grade. Also, when the pc is asked about an earlier release he may offer up a time he felt released from something in life. If so, this would be checked and handled just as any other release point, as in this action you are going to rehab any and all validly reading release points the pc may offer. When a former release is found it is rehabbed by the '65 Style. The procedure for rehabbing former releases is: 1. Ensure the pc's ruds are in and that he has been through steps 1-6 of the section „In-doctrinating the pc“, in this issue. 2. Have the pc demo the idea of former releases as it applies to auditing and to life until he's got it. 3. R-Factor the pc that you are going to rehab any former releases he may have had. 4. Clear the question: „Have you been released earlier?“ Then check the question. 5. If you get a read on Clearing or checking the question, find out what the release was on. a. If no read on the question when cleared or checked, check Suppress and Invali-date. b. If pc says he was released earlier but no read on the question when cleared or checked, check Suppress or Invalidate. If the pc is assertive or protesty about hav-ing been released, check Asserted and/or Protest. 6. When it has been determined that the pc has been released earlier, one then proceeds per Step 1 of Rehab '65 Style instructions until one gets an F/N and rehabilitation of the former release."},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 12 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 274 06.02.10 7. One then checks for any other former releases by checking, „Is there another time you were released earlier?“ and handles per Steps 5 and 6 above. 8. Repeat Step 7 as long as the pc has former releases to rehab 9. Conditional: If on Steps 5 a or b the meter doesn't read or ceases reading even after Suppress, Invalidate, Asserted and/or Protest are checked, or if an ARC Break needle turns on while doing the rehabs, one checks for and handles any ARC Breaks which may be present in the session or connected with the thing you are trying to rehab. After handling any ARC Breaks, recheck for former releases and handle until the Auditor, pc and meter are in agreement that any former releases have been rehabbed and that there are no ARC Breaks preventing any former release from reading. It may be necessary to also check and handle the other rudiments (PTP and Missed With-holds) to ensure there is nothing preventing any former release from reading. 10. Conditional: If the pc has a big win in rehabbing former releases, one would let him have his win and end the session. When sessions are resumed, one would then check for and handle any remaining former releases. When all the pc's former releases have been rehabbed, the action is complete. ADVICE TO AUDITORS AND C/SES ON REHABS Meter Dependence In using the meter on a rehab of any sort, one does not want to get into a situation where the pc is made dependent on the meter for obtaining data. One uses the meter in a rehab only when the pc is unable to come up with the data needed. In getting the number of times released on a process, for instance, the auditor would get the pc to establish the number of times released and only if the pc could not get it would the auditor use the meter to find the number of times released. This all comes under increasing the pc’s certainty of his data and is best expressed in HCOB 4 AUGUST 1963 ALL ROUTINES, E-METER ERRORS, COMMUNICATION CYCLE ERROR. Out Ruds When a rehab is not going to an F/N, one usually finds that there is an out rud over which the rehab is being done. This can be: a. An out rud on the subject being rehabbed; b. An out rud on something before the release occurred; c. An out rud in the rehab session itself. One has to find out what the out rud is, handle it and then the rehab should go easily to F/N."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"REHAB TECH 13 HCOB 19.12.80 SOLO AUDITOR COURSE 275 06.02.10 If at any time an ARC Break needle turns on during a rehab, immediately find what the ARC Break is on and handle fully. Then take the rehab to F/N. An ARC Break, particularly, may obscure a release and prevent it from reading. The remedy is to handle the ARC Break and then recheck for the release. Note: That one has F/Ned the ruds or handled session outnesses to F/N does not mean the rehab is finished, so complete the rehab if needed once the ruds are in. ____________________ Rehabs are very simple to do provided the auditor's comm cycle is not rough or dis-tracting and both he and the pc understand what is being done on a rehab and how the proce-dures go. The action is one of de-stimulation not re-stimulation. It is done with a light touch and is a smooth action. One doesn't get into forcing the pc on a rehab. Drilling the different rehab procedures must be a part of any High Crime checkout on this bulletin so that the auditor can confidently handle any situation that might arise during a rehab. The best way to run a session is to be so sharp as an auditor that you never let the pc overrun in the first place. But should this occur or should you inherit a pc that another auditor has overrun, or should life and livingness knock out a release state, this issue lays out the steps for restoring any type of release.
