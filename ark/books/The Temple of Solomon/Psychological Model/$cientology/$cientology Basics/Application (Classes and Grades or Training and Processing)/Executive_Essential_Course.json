COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE Saint Hill Manor, East Grinstead, Sussex HCO POLICY LETTER OF 7 FEBRUARY 1965 Reissued 15 June 1970 Remimeo Sthil Students Assn/Org Sec Hat Case Sup Hat Ds of P Hat Ds of T Hat Staff Member Hat Franchise (issued May 1965) Note. Neglect of this Pol Ltr has caused great hardship on staffs, has cost countless millions and made it necessary in 1970 to engage in an all out Inter-national effort to restore basic Scientology over the world. Within 5 years after the issue of this PL with me off the lines, violation had almost destroyed orgs. \"Quickie grades\" entered in and denied gain to tens of thousands of cases. Therefore actions which neglect or violate this Policy Letter are High Crimes resulting in Comm Evs on administrators and executives. It is not \"entirely a tech matter\" as its neglect destroys orgs and caused a two-year slump. It is the business of every staff member to enforce it. ALL LEVELS KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING HCO Sec or Communicator Hat Check on all personnel and new personnel as taken on. We have some time since passed the point of achieving uniformly workable technol-ogy. The only thing now is getting the technology applied. If you can't get the technology applied then you can't deliver what's promised. It's as simple as that. If you can get the technology applied, you can deliver what's promised. The only thing you can be upbraided for by students or pcs is \"no results\". Trouble spots occur only where there are \"no results\". Attacks from governments or monopolies occur only where there are \"no results\" or \"bad results\". Therefore the road before Scientology is clear and its ultimate success is assured if the technology is applied."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 2 HCO PL 7.2.65 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 2 17.11.12 So it is the task of the Assn or Org Sec, the HCO Sec, the Case Supervisor, the D of P, the D of T and all staff members to get the correct technology applied. Getting the correct technology applied consists of: One: Having the correct technology. Two: Knowing the technology. Three: Knowing it is correct. Four: Teaching correctly the correct technology. Five: Applying the technology. Six: Seeing that the technology is correctly applied. Seven: Hammering out of existence incorrect technology. Eight: Knocking out incorrect applications. Nine: Closing the door on any possibility of incorrect technology. Ten: Closing the door on incorrect application. One above has been done. Two has been achieved by many. Three is achieved by the individual applying the correct technology in a proper man-ner and observing that it works that way. Four is being done daily successfully in most parts of the world. Five is consistently accomplished daily. Six is achieved by instructors and supervisors consistently. Seven is done by a few but is a weak point. Eight is not worked on hard enough. Nine is impeded by the \"reasonable\" attitude of the not quite bright. Ten is seldom done with enough ferocity. Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are the only places Scientology can bog down in any area. The reasons for this are not hard to find. (a) A weak certainty that it works in Three above can lead to weakness in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. (b) Further, the not-too- bright have a bad point on the button Self-Importance. (c) The lower the IQ, the more the individual is shut off from the fruits of observation. (d) The service facs of people make them defend themselves against anything they confront, good or bad, and seek to make it wrong. (e) The bank seeks to knock out the good and perpetuate the bad. Thus, we as Scientologists and as an organization must be very alert to Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 3 HCO PL 7.2.65 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 3 17.11.12 In all the years I have been engaged in research I have kept my comm lines wide open for research data. I once had the idea that a group could evolve truth. A third of a century has thoroughly disabused me of that idea. Willing as I was to accept suggestions and data, only a handful of suggestions (less than twenty) had long-run value and none were major or basic; and when I did accept major or basic suggestions and used them, we went astray and I re-pented and eventually had to \"eat crow\". On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writ-ings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work as well as the sanity of pcs. So I know what a group of people will do and how in-sane they will go in accepting unworkable \"technology\". By actual record the percentages are about twenty to 100,000 that a group of human beings will dream up bad technology to de-stroy good technology. As we could have gotten along without suggestions, then, we had bet-ter steel ourselves to continue to do so now that we have made it. This point will, of course, be attacked as \"unpopular\", \"egotistical\" and \"undemocratic\". It very well may be. But it is also a survival point. And I don't see that popular measures, self-abnegation and democracy have done anything for Man but push him further into the mud. Currently, popularity endorses degraded novels, self-abnegation has filled the South East Asian jungles with stone idols and corpses, and democracy has given us inflation and income tax. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not sup-ported me in many ways I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its for-mative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future. I can only say this now that it is done. There remains, of course, group tabulation or co-ordination of what has been done, which will be valuable – only so long as it does not seek to alter basic principles and successful applica-tions. The contributions that were worthwhile in this period of forming the technology were help in the form of friendship, of defence, of organization, of dissemination, of application, of advices on results and of finance. These were great contributions and were, and are, appreci-ated. Many thousands contributed in this way and made us what we are. Discovery contribu-tion was not however part of the broad picture. We will not speculate here on why this was so or how I came to rise above the bank. We are dealing only in facts and the above is a fact – the group left to its own devices would not have evolved Scientology but with wild dramatization of the bank called \"new ideas\" would have wiped it out. Supporting this is the fact that Man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve – psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc, ad infini-tum. So realize that we have climbed out of the mud by whatever good luck and good sense, and refuse to sink back into it again. See that Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten above are ruthlessly followed and we will never be stopped. Relax them, get reasonable about it and we will perish."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 4 HCO PL 7.2.65 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 4 17.11.12 So far, while keeping myself in complete communication with all suggestions, I have not failed on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten in areas I could supervise closely. But it's not good enough for just myself and a few others to work at this. Whenever this control as per Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten has been relaxed the whole organizational area has failed. Witness Elizabeth, N.J., Wichita, the early organizations and groups. They crashed only because I no longer did Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. Then, when they were all messed up, you saw the obvious \"reasons\" for failure. But ahead of that they ceased to deliver and that involved them in other reasons. The common denominator of a group is the reactive bank. Thetans without banks have different responses. They only have their banks in common. They agree then only on bank principles. Person to person the bank is identical. So constructive ideas are individual and seldom get broad agreement in a human group. An individual must rise above an avid craving for agreement from a humanoid group to get anything decent done. The bank-agreement has been what has made Earth a Hell – and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve. War, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man. Right now the great governments of Earth have developed the means of frying every Man, Woman and Child on the planet. That is Bank. That is the result of Collective Thought Agreement. The decent, pleasant things on this planet come from individual actions and ideas that have somehow got-ten by the Group Idea. For that matter, look how we ourselves are attacked by \"public opin-ion\" media. Yet there is no more ethical group on this planet than ourselves. Thus each one of us can rise above the domination of the bank and then, as a group of freed beings, achieve freedom and reason. It is only the aberrated group, the mob, that is de-structive. When you don't do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten actively, you are working for the Bank dominated mob. For it will surely, surely (a) introduce incorrect technology and swear by it, (b) apply technology as incorrectly as possible, (c) open the door to any destructive idea, and (d) encourage incorrect application. It's the Bank that says the group is all and the individual nothing. It's the Bank that says we must fail. So just don't play that game. Do Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten and you will knock out of your road all the future thorns. Here's an actual example in which a senior executive had to interfere because of a pc spin: A Case Supervisor told Instructor A to have Auditor B run Process X on Preclear C. Auditor B afterwards told Instructor A that \"It didn't work.\" Instructor A was weak on Three above and didn't really believe in Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. So Instructor A told the Case Supervisor \"Process X didn't work on Preclear C.\" Now this strikes directly at each of One to Six above in Preclear C, Auditor B, Instructor A and the Case Supervisor. It opens the door to the introduction of \"new technology\" and to failure. What happened here? Instructor A didn't jump down Auditor B's throat, that's all that happened. This is what he should have done: grabbed the auditor's report and looked it over. When a higher executive on this case did so she found what the Case Supervisor and the rest missed: that Process X increased Preclear C's TA to 25 TA divisions for the session but that near session end Auditor B Qed and Aed with a cognition and abandoned Process X while it"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 5 HCO PL 7.2.65 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 5 17.11.12 still gave high TA and went off running one of Auditor B's own manufacture, which nearly spun Preclear C. Auditor B's IQ on examination turned out to be about 75. Instructor A was found to have huge ideas of how you must never invalidate anyone, even a lunatic. The Case Supervisor was found to be \"too busy with admin to have any time for actual cases\". All right, there's an all too typical example. The Instructor should have done Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten. This would have begun this way. Auditor B: \"That Process X didn't work.\" Instructor A: \"What exactly did you do wrong?\" Instant attack. \"Where's your auditor's report for the session? Good. Look here, you were getting a lot of TA when you stopped Process X. What did you do?\" Then the Pc wouldn't have come close to a spin and all four of these would have retained certainty. In a year, I had four instances in one small group where the correct process recom-mended was reported not to have worked. But on review found that each one (a) had in-creased the TA, (b) had been abandoned, and (c) had been falsely reported as unworkable. Also, despite this abuse, in each of these four cases the recommended, correct process cracked the case. Yet they were reported as not having worked! Similar examples exist in instruction and these are all the more deadly as every time instruction in correct technology is flubbed, then the resulting error, uncorrected in the audi-tor, is perpetuated on every pc that auditor audits thereafter. So Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten are even more important in a course than in supervision of cases. Here's an example: A rave recommendation is given a graduating student \"because he gets more TA on pcs than any other student on the course!\" Figures of 435 TA divisions a session are reported. \"Of course his model session is poor but it's just a knack he has\" is also included in the recommendation. A careful review is undertaken because nobody at Levels 0 to IV is going to get that much TA on pcs. It is found that this student was never taught to read an E-Meter TA dial! And no instructor observed his handling of a meter and it was not discovered that he \"overcompensated\" nervously, swinging the TA 2 or 3 divisions beyond where it needed to go to place the needle at \"set\". So everyone was about to throw away stan-dard processes and model session because this one student \"got such remarkable TA\". They only read the reports and listened to the brags and never looked at this student. The pcs in actual fact were making slightly less than average gain, impeded by a rough model session and misworded processes. Thus, what was making the pcs win (actual Scientology) was hid-den under a lot of departures and errors. I recall one student who was squirreling on an Academy course and running a lot of off-beat whole track on other students after course hours. The Academy students were in a state of electrification on all these new experiences and weren't quickly brought under control and the student himself never was given the works on Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten so they stuck. Subsequently, this student prevented another squirrel from being straightened out and his wife died of cancer resulting from physical abuse. A hard, tough Instructor at that moment could have salvaged two squirrels and saved the life of a girl. But no, students had a right to do whatever they pleased."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 6 HCO PL 7.2.65 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 6 17.11.12 Squirreling (going off into weird practices or altering Scientology) only comes about from non-comprehension. Usually the non-comprehension is not of Scientology but some earlier contact with an off-beat humanoid practice which in its turn was not understood. When people can't get results from what they think is standard practice, they can be counted upon to squirrel to some degree. The most trouble in the past two years came from orgs where an executive in each could not assimilate straight Scientology. Under instruction in Scientology they were unable to define terms or demonstrate examples of principles. And the orgs where they were got into plenty of trouble. And worse, it could not be straightened out easily because neither one of these people could or would duplicate instructions. Hence, a debacle resulted in two places, directly traced to failures of instruction earlier. So proper in-struction is vital. The D of T and his Instructors and all Scientology Instructors must be mer-ciless in getting Four, Seven, Eight, Nine and Ten into effective action. That one student, dumb and impossible though he may seem and of no use to anyone, may yet some day be the cause of untold upset because nobody was interested enough to make sure Scientology got home to him. With what we know now, there is no student we enroll who cannot be properly trained. As an Instructor, one should be very alert to slow progress and should turn the slug-gards inside out personally. No system will do it, only you or me with our sleeves rolled up can crack the back of bad studenting and we can only do it on an individual student, never on a whole class only. He's slow = something is awful wrong. Take fast action to correct it. Don't wait until next week. By then he's got other messes stuck to him. If you can't graduate them with their good sense appealed to and wisdom shining, graduate them in such a state of shock they'll have nightmares if they contemplate squirreling. Then experience will gradually bring about Three in them and they'll know better than to chase butterflies when they should be au-diting. When somebody enrolls, consider he or she has joined up for the duration of the uni-verse – never permit an \"open-minded\" approach. If they're going to quit let them quit fast. If they enrolled, they're aboard, and if they're aboard, they're here on the same terms as the rest of us – win or die in the attempt. Never let them be half-minded about being Scientologists. The finest organizations in history have been tough, dedicated organizations. Not one namby-pamby bunch of panty-waist dilettantes have ever made anything. It's a tough universe. The social veneer makes it seem mild. But only the tigers survive – and even they have a hard time. We'll survive because we are tough and are dedicated. When we do instruct somebody properly he becomes more and more tiger. When we instruct half-mindedly and are afraid to offend, scared to enforce, we don't make students into good Scientologists and that lets every-body down. When Mrs. Pattycake comes to us to be taught, turn that wandering doubt in her eye into a fixed, dedicated glare and she'll win and we'll all win. Humour her and we all die a little. The proper instruction attitude is, \"You're here so you're a Scientologist. Now we're going to make you into an expert auditor no matter what happens. We'd rather have you dead than incapable.\" Fit that into the economics of the situation and lack of adequate time and you see the cross we have to bear."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"KEEPING SCIENTOLOGY WORKING 7 HCO PL 7.2.65 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 7 17.11.12 But we won't have to bear it forever.

Keep those in mind and we'll be able to grow. Fast. And as we grow our shackles will be less and less. Failing to keep One to Ten, will make us grow less. So the ogre which might eat us up is not the government or the High Priests. It's our possible failure to retain and practise our technology. An Instructor or Supervisor or Executive must challenge with ferocity instances of \"unworkability\". They must uncover what did happen, what was run and what was done or not done. If you have One and Two, you can only acquire Three for all by making sure of all the rest. We're not playing some minor game in Scientology. It isn't cute or something to do for lack of something better. The whole agonized future of this planet, every Man, Woman and Child on it, and your own destiny for the next endless trillions of years depend on what you do here and now with and in Scientology. This is a deadly serious activity. And if we miss getting out of the trap now, we may never again have another chance.

When I see an Organization staff panting after newspaper publicity or going mad on the subject of dissemination, and at the same time turning in to me bad results and poor stu-dent quality, I know somebody has their targets mixed up. Quality is the only thing that counts. If quality in training and processing is not given first rank and constant priority by Secretaries or Executive Secretaries, then all the admini-stration in the world will not make the grade for any Central Org. Deliver the goods. That's a crude way to put it. But if you want a new and better civili-zation you won't get it by advertising or worrying what people think of you. You will get it only by releasing and clearing people and sending them out into the society to get the show on the road in all branches of human activity, including Scientology. I know we have been a long time without clearing people. But we're clearing them now. What does it take to clear people? It takes highly skilled and tightly supervised auditing. It takes good technology. It takes good technical application. If you'll forget about how easy it is to mob students all up in a class and actually con-front each student as an individual, make sure he knows every essential step he has to know, make sure all his questions get answered, you'll have auditors that can audit. Will you please put attention on raising technical skill in the HGC, releasing people, clearing people, and on the quality of training in the Academy to the end of getting every stu-dent capable of all the steps necessary to release people. I have made the grade technically in the field of research. Now it's time to drop all the booboo's and nonsense.

Primarily intended for Scientology Organization Executives, its policy letters are slanted toward a Scientology Org (short for organization). However, it covers any organiza-tion and contains fundamentals vital to any successful or profitable activity. This course also applies to the individual. Any individual has his 7 (or 9) Divisions and his 21 (or 27) Departments. Where one or more of these is missing in his conduct of life he will be to that degree an unsuccessful individual. No matter how organized any company, society or political entity will be as unsuc-cessful as it has these functions missing. Thus this is not just the Scientology idea of how an org should run-most of it is vital basic discovery. Man did not really know the principles of organization any more than he knew what made his mind work before Dianetics was published. A very small amount of the material on this course has crept into general use, just as a very few of the principles of Dianetics and Scientology are now an \"Everybody knows---\". Survival is now conceded as the basic principle of existence. Universities now know Man can change IQ and Personality. As time goes on more and more of the technology \"leaks\" into general knowledge. But it takes a long time for all Mankind to know a whole tech in this fash-ion. To date the Scientology discoveries in organization are known to a very few. But some of the more general principles are already creeping into business practice. Not long ago, for instance, a close friend of the president of the U.S. Was given the Policy Letter about \"Don't reward a down statistic\". A few days later the president used it in his new relief programme policy. Of course there are hundreds of other \"Pol Ltrs\" that haven't been shown to the friend of the president. It takes years for new ideas to \"leak\" into public consciousness.

In 18 years, only a handful of medical doctors accepted that mental image pictures caused aberration. In 19 years only a few medical doctors could also audit. Therefore, if one were fully conversant with the full subject and all its principles he would appear to be a magician, a miracle worker. If anyone knew the Org Exec Course fully and could practise it, he could completely reverse any down trending company or country. Indeed, here and there at this writing men have done so. It could be argued or pleaded that this huge body of data should be made into texts ca-pable of general application by businesses and countries. The one effort to republish these policies in other terms so badly altered the material that it became a hopeless bog even though attempted by a very successful business man. He himself was applying the originals direct to his company and it soaringly became rich. Then he decided to rewrite it all, greatly altered and edited, for his employees and his business went on a toboggan slide. His correct action would have been to send his employees to take the same course he took-this very Org Exec Course. And let them adapt what they now knew to fit their own posts and activities. Instead, he cut them off from source and what he wrote for them was only as much as he had gotten out of the course from his own viewpoint. At least there are Scientology Orgs around which are successful living models of these policies and org form. The only real trouble these orgs ever have is not a failure to apply policy but a failure of the whole staff to know policy. Wherever a portion of a Scientology org is in confusion you will find that the staff members in that portion have not done the Org Exec Course. They may know a few policies. But outside that anyone can come along and say \"this is the policy\" or \"what you're doing is against policy\" and being ignorant of policy they develop the idea of some vast unknown area and go downhill. The name Org Exec Course is probably a misnomer. Certainly the executives of the org should know it well. But the staff member who doesn't know it is at effect. If he knew his OEC data he would be able to defend himself and get his own \"show on the road\" in his por-tion of the org. Any failure of these basics and policies is ignorance of them. When you know them all, not just a few, it makes a whole intelligent picture. It is rather exciting to be able to cut through the superstition of yesterday's organiza-tions and deal in basic down to earth fundamentals. When you understand all the policies on this course, you will understand organization itself, no matter to what you apply it. You will also be able to recognize mis-organization when you see it.

In very large orgs the title is extended to heads of large sections. To these listed persons especially this data on Executives applies.) Before one can adequately perform the duties of an executive in an organization one would have to know what an executive is. Executive: One who holds a position of administrative or managerial responsibility in an organization. To give one some idea of the power associated with the word, Daniel Webster, in 1826, defined it as \"The officer, whether king, president or other chief magistrate, who super-intends the execution of the laws; the person who administers the government, executive power or authority in government. Men most desirous of places in the executive gift, will not expect to be gratified, except by their support of the executive. John Quincy\" Executive is used in distinction from legislative and judicial. The body that deliberates and enacts laws is legislative; the body that judges or applies the laws to particular cases is judicial; the body or person who carries the laws into effect or superintends the enforcement of them is executive, according to its 19th Century governmental meaning according to Web-ster. The word comes from the Latin \"Ex(s)equi (past participle ex(s)ecutus), execute, fol-low to the end: ex-, completely + sequi, to follow.\" In other words, he follows things to the end and gets something done. Taking up the definition part by part we can achieve a considerable understanding of the nature and beingness of an executive. \"One who holds a position...\" A position is a place or location. It is social standing or status; rank. It is a post of employment; job. The sense of this is that an executive is a Stable Terminal for his staff and assistants. He is not continuously elsewhere or missing. He actu-ally holds his position, social standing, status, rank and performs his duties from that position. He is known and visible and in one way or another reachable or himself reaches those areas which need to be handled."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"THE EXECUTIVE 2 HCO PL 29.10.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 16 17.11.12 \"...of administrative...\" in the definition would refer to his actions in administering his area. Administer means \"to have charge of; direct; manage\". It is taken from the Latin ad-ministrate, to be an aid to: ad-, to + ministrare, to serve. From minister, servant. By this we see that he has charge of, directs, manages and serves his area. \"...or managerial...\" refers to management, which is the act, manner or practice of managing, handling or controlling something. Skill in managing, executive ability, which means that the activity is handled or controlled by the executive. \"... Responsibility...\" means the state, quality or fact of being responsible, and re-sponsible means legally or ethically accountable for the care or welfare of another. Involving personal accountability or ability to act without guidance or superior authority. Being the source or cause of something. Capable of making moral or rational decisions on one's own and therefore answerable for one's behavior. Able to be trusted or depended upon; reliable. Based upon or characterized by good judgment or sound thinking. This means essentially that an executive does not wait for orders to act. He is the one who, guided by policy, acts on his own initiative to handle and supervise his area and others and does not himself require super-vision. \"...in an organization.\" An organization means the act of organizing or the process of being organized. The state or manner of being organized: \"a high degree of organization\". Something that has been organized or made into an ordered whole. A number of persons or groups having specific responsibilities and united for some purpose or work. Thus an organi-zation is an activity or area that is being organized or has been organized or made into an \"or-dered whole\". Thus from the words and definitions taken from the language itself and the tradition of the culture, we can see what an executive is, what he does and what he eventually has-an or-ganization. It is very interesting that one can examine the above definition and subdefinitions and analyze an executive's general competence. Where any of these things are missing in his char-acter or duty or general conduct, there is very likely to be a flaw in the activity he has under his authority. One could go over these items one by one, for himself or for another, and he would see at once what had to be improved and what was satisfactory in his or others' execu-tive beingness. In order to competently achieve the beingness of an executive, one would have to have the technology of how to organize and would have to have as well a concept of the ideal scene of an organization in order to compare it to any existing scene and would have to be familiar with the technology required in that specific organization by which it produces the products necessary for its survival. In that every organization has value only to the degree it produces, one can see that an executive should be able to achieve production long before his organization is perfected and to be able to perfect the organization while producing. Otherwise the organization would not be sufficiently viable to survive and his status as an executive would cease."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE EXECUTIVE 3 HCO PL 29.10.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 17 17.11.12 Good executives are very valuable and the value consists of their ability to obtain pro-duction and form the necessary and adequate organization in order to do so.

The first test any follower of a leader requires the leader to meet is competence. Does the leader know what he is doing. This is already covered in the definitions of an executive. For if an executive meets these definitions, those to whom he must give orders are very likely to receive them in confidence. There is a great deal of mystique (qualifications or skills that set a person or thing apart and beyond the understanding of an outsider) connected with leadership. Most of this mystique is nonsense; however, it is necessary that one who leads can attract attention and that he can enthuse and interest others. Simply knowing more about the subject than others or knowing more about organization than others can cause an executive to be regarded respect-fully or even with awe. A common denominator to all good executives is the ability to communicate, to have affinity for their area and their people, and to be able to achieve a reality on existing circum-stances. All this adds up to understanding. An executive who lacks these qualities or abilities is not likely to be very successful. Understanding, added to competence, is probably the most ideal character of an execu-tive. The ability to lead can also be compounded of forcefulness and demandingness, and these two qualities are often seen to stand alone in leadership without regard to competence and, though acceptable to juniors to the degree that they will obey, are no long-term guarantee of an executive's supremacy. While they are often part of a successful executive's personality, they are not a substitute for other qualities and will not see him through. He must truly under-stand what he is doing and demonstrate competence on a long-term basis in order to achieve distinction and respect. In all great leaders there is a purpose and intensity which is unmistakable. Plus there is a certain amount of courage required in a leader. A man who merely wants to be liked will never be a leader. Others follow those who have the courage to get things done even though they say they follow those they like.

But it is based almost solely on the ability to give and enforce orders. An order or directive is necessary to bring about co-ordination of function and activity without which there could be disagreement and confusion. In an organisation there is more than one person functioning. Being of comparable rank and having different purposes (hats) they can come into conflict and disagreement in the absence of a plan or order or directive. So, without orders, plans, programmes, one does not have an organisation. One has a group of individuals. We see in earlier policy letters that a group composed only of individuals cannot expand and will remain small. Oddly enough, such a group will also remain unhappy. It will have a low affinity with the public and each other and if you know the Affinity-Reality-Communication triangle, you will realise that all three points drop if one does. Agreement being the basis of Reality, you will find a group of individuals will disagree with each other and have a low Reality on what they are doing or what to propose and even what to do. Most people confuse a \"taut ship\" with a harshly led ship. Actually harshness has nothing to do with it. The right word is positiveness. If a group is led by someone whose programmes and orders are very positive, then the group has a chance of going into agreement with one another and so their Affinity improves and so does their Communication and Reality. So if one issues no orders, a group will remain a group of individuals, out of agree-ment with each other, will do little and will remain small or at least non-expanding. Bill, of equal rank to Joe, cannot give an order to Joe nor vice versa. Thus no orders exist between them. Occasional agreements do occur but as their jobs are different, they rather tend to disagree on what is important. A person with a senior standing to both Bill and Joe can give the two an order and this becomes the basis of an agreement. The order doesn't even have to be liked by Bill and Joe. If they follow it, they thus \"agree\" to it and being in agreement on this they get Reality and Communication on it as well."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"LEADERSHIP 2 HCO PL 3.11.66 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 22 17.11.12 Even poorly thought out orders angrily given, if issued and enforced, are better for a group than no orders at all. But such orders are the low end of the scale. Positive, enforced orders, given with no misemotion and toward visible accom-plishment are the need of a group if it is to prosper and expand. The group is full of \"good fellows\". This does not give it success. The group is full of plans. These do not give it success. What it needs are positive orders leading to a known accomplishment. Many obstacles can exist to that accomplishment but the group will function. We call it \"leadership\" and other nebulous things, this ability to handle a group, make it prosper and expand. All leadership is, in the final analysis, is giving the orders to implement the pro-gramme and seeing that they are followed. One can build this up higher by obtaining general agreement on the how, why and what of programmes. But to maintain it there have to be orders and directives and acceptance or enforcement thereof – else the group will fall apart, sooner or later. Positive orders and directions on positive programmes inevitably cause expansion. Being wise or a good fellow or being liked, does not accomplish the expansion. People in the group may be cheerful-but are they going anywhere as a group? So the whole thing boils down to: Positive directions and their acceptance or enforcement on known programmes bring about prosperity and expansion. No or weak orders bring about stagnation and collapse. The ideal is to have programmes with which the whole group or a majority agrees fully. Then to forward these with positive orders and obtain compliance by acceptance or en-forcement. But regardless of the enthusiasm for a programme, it will eventually fail if there is no person or governing body there to issue and enforce orders to carry on the programme. Thus we have the indicators of a very bad executive whose group will disintegrate and fail no matter how cheerful they are with the executive. Bad leaders: 1. Issue no or weak orders, 2. Do not obtain or enforce compliance. Bad leadership isn't \"grouchy\" or \"sadistic\" or the many other things man advertises it to be. It is simply a leadership that gives no or weak orders and does not enforce compliance. Good leadership: 1.

These facts are as true of a governing body as they are of an individual. A typical example of a bad governing body, at the present stage of its formation at least, is the United Nations. It has great ideas about how better Man should be perhaps, but 1. It issues a confused babble of orders when it issues any and 2. It issues orders for which it can obtain little or no compliance. Note that it is also insolvent, at war within itself and that it has not made a dent in its prime programme, the prevention of war. However these things come about, they are nevertheless true. It is a very poor govern-ing body and far more likely to vanish than expand. You can count completely on the fact that an executive or a governing body that does not adhere to not unpopular programmes, that does not issue positive orders and does not ob-tain or enforce compliance will have down statistics. And you can be sure that an executive or governing body that formulates or adheres to not unpopular programmes, that issues positive orders and that obtains or vigorously enforces compliance will have up statistics. Wisdom? Popularity? These unfortunately have little or nothing to do with it. The way to have up statistics, a prosperous and happy group is far more simple than complex Man has ever realized. L.

Russia cannot even feed herself but depends on conquest to eke out an existence – and don't think they don't strip the conquered! They have to. Oddly enough one of the best ways to detect a Suppressive Person is that he or she stamps on up statistics and condones or rewards down statistics. It makes an SP very happy for everyone to starve to death, for the good worker to be shattered and the bad worker patted on the back. Draw your own conclusions as to whether or not Western Governments (or Welfare States) became at last Suppressives. For they used the law used by suppressives: If you re-ward non-production you get non-production.

This is about 3/100ths of an organization. A 20th Century government was just these 3 functions gone mad. Yet they made the whole population wear the hat of government. We must learn and profit from what they did wrong. And what they mainly did wrong was reward the down statistic and penalize the up statistic. The hardworker-earner was heavily taxed and the money was used to support the indi-gent. This was not humanitarian. It was only given \"humanitarian\" reasons. The robbed person was investigated exclusively, rarely the robber. The head of government who got into the most debt became a hero. War rulers were deified and peacetime rulers forgotten no matter how many wars they prevented. Thus went Ancient Greece, Rome, France, the British Empire and the US. This was the decline and fall of every great civilization on this planet: they eventually rewarded the down statistic and penalized the up statistic. That's all that caused their decline. They came at last into the hands of Suppressives and had no technology to detect them or escape their inevi-table disasters. Thus, when you think of \"processing Joe to make a good D of P out of him and get him over his mistakes\" forget it. That rewards a down statistic. Instead, find an auditor with an up statistic, reward it with processing and make him the D of P. Never promote a down statistic or demote an up statistic. Never even hold a hearing on someone with an up statistic. Never accept an Ethics chit on one – just stamp it \"Sorry, Up Statistic\" and send it back. But someone with a steadily down statistic, investigate. Accept and convert any Ethics chit to a hearing. Look for an early replacement. Gruesomely, in my experience I have only seldom raised a chronically down statistic with orders or persuasion or new plans. I have only raised them with changes of personnel. So don't even consider someone with a steadily down statistic as part of the team. In-vestigate, yes. Try, yes. But if it stays down, don't fool about. The person is drawing pay and position and privilege for not doing his job and that's too much reward even there. Don't get reasonable about down statistics. They are down because they are down. If someone was on the post they would be up. And act on that basis. Any duress levelled by Ethics should be reserved for down statistics."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"REWARDS AND PENALTIES – HOW TO 3 HCO PL 6.3.66 HANDLE PERSONNEL AND ETHICS MATTERS EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 27 17.11.12 Even Section 51 investigates social areas of down statistic. Psychiatry's cures are zero. The negative statistic of more insane is all that is \"up\". So investigate and hang. If we reverse the conduct of declining governments and businesses we will of course grow. And that makes for coffee and cakes, promotion, higher pay, better working quarters and tools for all those who earned them. And who else should have them? If you do it any other way, everyone starves. We are peculiar in believing there is a virtue in prosperity. You cannot give more to the indigent than the society produces. When the society, by penalizing production, at last produces very little and yet has to feed very many, revolutions, confusion, political unrest and Dark Ages ensue. In a very prosperous society where production is amply rewarded, there is always more left over than is needed. I well recall in prosperous farm communities that charity was ample and people didn't die in the ditch. That only happens where production is already low and commodity or commerce already scarce (scarcity of commercial means of distribution is also a factor in depressions). The cause of the great depression of the 1920s and 1930s in the US and England has never been pointed out by Welfare \"statesmen\". The cause was Income Tax and government interference with companies and, all during the 1800s, a gradual rise of nationalism and size of governments and their budgets, and no commercial development to distribute goods to the common people, catering to royal governments or only a leisure class still being the focus of production. Income tax so penalized management, making it unrewarded, and company law so hampered financing that it ceased to be really worthwhile to run companies and management quit. In Russia management went into politics in desperation. Kings were always decreeing the commoner couldn't have this or that (it put the commoner's statistic up!) and not until 1930 did anyone really begin to sell to the people with heavy advertising. It was Madison Avenue, radio, TV and Bing Crosby not the Gre-e-eat Roosevelt who got the US out of the depression. England, not permitting wide radio coverage, never has come out of it and her empire is dust. England still too firmly held the \"aristocratic\" tradition that the commoner mustn't possess to truly use her population as a market. But the reason they let it go this way and the reason the great depression occurred and the reason for the decline of the West is this one simple truth: If you reward non-production you get it. It is not humanitarian to let a whole population go to pieces just because a few refuse to work. And some people just won't. And when work no longer has reward none will. It is far more humane to have enough so everyone can eat. So specialize in production and everybody wins. Reward it.   1 See \"Section 5\" in the Modern Management Technology Defined"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"REWARDS AND PENALTIES – HOW TO 4 HCO PL 6.3.66 HANDLE PERSONNEL AND ETHICS MATTERS EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 28 17.11.12 There is nothing really wrong with socialism helping the needy. Sometimes it is vital. But the reasons for that are more or less over. It is a temporary solution, easily overdone and like Communism is simply old-fashioned today. If carried to extremes like drinking coffee or absinthe or even eating it becomes quite uncomfortable and oppressive. And today Socialism and Communism have been carried far too far and now only oppress up statistics and reward down ones. _________________ By the way the natural law in this Pol Ltr is the reason Scientology goes poorly when credit is extended by orgs and when auditors won't charge properly. With credit and no charge we are rewarding down statistics with attention and betterment as much as we reward up sta-tistics in the society. A preclear who can work and produces as a member of society deserves of course priority. He naturally is the one who can pay. When we give the one who can't pay just as much attention we are rewarding a down social statistic with Scientology and of course we don't expand because we don't expand the ability of the able. In proof, the most expensive thing you can do is process the insane and these have the lowest statistic in the society. The more you help those in the society with low statistics the more tangled affairs will get. The orgs require fantastic attention to keep them there at all when we reward low society statistics with training and processing. The worker pays his way. He has a high statistic. So give him the best in training and processing – not competition with people who don't work and don't have any money. Always give the best service to the person in society who does his job. By not extend-ing credit you tend to guarantee the best service to those with the best statistics and so every-one wins again. None is owed processing or training. We are not an Earthwide amends pro-ject. No good worker owes his work. That's slavery. We don't owe because we do better. One would owe only if one did worse. Not everyone realizes how Socialism penalizes an up statistic. Take health taxes. If an average man adds up what he pays the government he will find his visits to medicos are very expensive. The one who benefits is only the chronically ill, whose way is paid by the healthy. So the chronically ill (down statistic) are rewarded with care paid for by penalties on the healthy (up statistic). In income tax, the more a worker makes the more hours of his work week are taxed away from him. Eventually he is no longer working for his reward. He is working for no pay. If he got up to £50 a week the proportion of his pay (penalty) might go as high as half. There-fore people tend to refuse higher pay (up statistics) as it has a penalty that is too great. On the other hand a totally indigent non-working person is paid well just to loaf. The up statistic per-son cannot hire any small services to help his own prosperity as he is already paying it via the government to somebody who doesn't work. Socialisms pay people not to grow crops no matter how many are starving.

Charity is charity. It benefits the donor, giving him a sense of superiority and status. It is a liability to the receiver but he accepts it as he must and vows (if he has any pride) to cease being poor and get to work. Charity cannot be enforced by law and arrest for then it is extortion and not charity. And get no idea that I beat any drum for capitalism. That too is old-old-old hat. Capitalism is the economics of living by non-production. It by exact definition is the economics of living off interest from loans. Which is an extreme of rewarding non-production. Imperialism and Colonialism are also bad as they exist by enslaving the population of less strong countries like Russia does, and that too is getting a reward for non-production like they did in Victorian England from all the colonies. Parasitism is Parasitism. Whether high or low it is unlovely. All these isms are almost equally nutty and their inheritors, if not their originators, were all of a stamp – suppressive. All I beat the drum for is that the working worker deserves a break and the working manager deserves his pay and the successful company deserves the fruits of its success. Only when success is bought by enslavement or rewards are given to bums or thieves will you find me objecting. This is a new look. It is an honest look.

There is no money. When you have an organization that has no valuable production you know that the people there go 'round and 'round and 'round and get nowhere. They are squirrel administrators. STANDARD ADMIN There are right ways to handle a group. This is the single fact which most often es-capes people attempting to handle groups. Also, for every correct solution there can be an infinity of wrong solutions. The right way is a narrow trail but strong. The wrong ways are broad but all lead into a bog. You could \"fix\" a radio by hitting it with a sledge hammer, putting a hand grenade in it or throwing it out of a 155th story window. The number of wrong ways you could \"fix\" it would be infinite. Or you could find out what was wrong with it and replace the part or properly correct it. The difference between the wrong way and the right way is that the radio, wrongly \"solved,\" doesn't work. The radio correctly solved works. So the test of the wrong way or the right way is whether or not the radio then worked. This is the basic test of all administrative solutions. Did they work?"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"SQUIRREL ADMIN 2 HCO PL 25.1.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 34 17.11.12 When experienced persons, working from basic theory, have evolved a technique for handling a situation which routinely now handles that situation, we have now a Standard Administrative Action. When that situation appears, we apply that solution and the matter gets handled. The test is, did the solution work? Solutions that work and are therefore routinely used to handle the situation to which they apply are then called Standard Admin. A multitude of these correct solutions are used in Standard Organizing. The org board, the hats, comm lines, comm centers, comm baskets, despatch forms, routing forms, inspection actions, promotion actions, central filing, customer or visitor handling, selling, collecting income, paying bills, inventorying, doing finance reports, handling raw materials, training persons to handle and properly change materials, correcting or improving staff com-petence, correcting organizational form, inspecting reviewing and handling failed products, handling contacting and converting the publics, establishing and using field distributors and salesmen, providing public services, maintaining contact with the original and basic technol-ogy, handling rivals and opposition, and running the organization in general all have standard actions. Now, glancing over the above rough list, you see we have hit the high spots of a 21 department, 7 division org bd. Each is a standard solution to continuing and recurring problems. Each contains numerous standard solutions to the recurring problems associated with them. Underneath all this is basic theory and around it is survival and potential success. USE OF STANDARD ACTIONS The difference between a successfully viable organization with cheerful and cared for staff and a limping scene is standard and squirrel administration. If standard admin is successful then why is it sometimes not used? First the data has to exist, be available and known. Next the data has to be used. At first glance this may seem so clear-cut that it cannot go wrong. But one must look a bit further. One is dealing with a variable called Man. One is working in a world full of noise and conflict. Certain personalities do not want the group or the organization to succeed (see HCOB 28 Nov 1970 Psychosis). This problem has been so great amongst men that every historical"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"SQUIRREL ADMIN 3 HCO PL 25.1.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 35 17.11.12 culture-each one an organization-has died. About ten to twenty percent of mankind, at a broad guess, fit into this category. In this universe it is easier to destroy than to construct. Yet the survival of life forms depends on construction. To overcome this Man has developed technology and the cooperative effort known as organization. The forces of the physical universe can be channeled and used only with technology. The forces inherent in life forms can succeed only when channeled and aligned with one another. Therefore, to succeed, a group must have the technology it uses available and known to it. And then use it. From this one obtains the agreement and alignment necessary to generate the group action and production which brings about success. NONCONFRONT When a group member has the data, the bar to his using it would be his own disagree-ment with the group succeeding or, more frequently, his inability to confront things. Example: Two group members are quarreling. A third group member seeks to handle it. Even though he knows the technique (third party law), his own inability to confront people makes him fail to use the correct solution and he backs off. In backing off he thinks of some nonconfront nonstandard \"solution\" such as firing them. He has become a squirrel administrator. Example: The plant machinery is in bad shape. It is deteriorating to such an extent that it soon will cease to run. The mechanics plead for money to repair. The plant manager unfortunately cannot confront machinery-he not only \"doesn't know about it\" but it frightens him. He does not financially plan its full repair on a gradient back to an ideal scene. He sim-ply dreams up the vague hope a new type will be invented. He does nothing. The machinery now costs more to run than it produces. The plant fails. The plant manager was a squirrel ad-ministrator. So we have various causes of failure: 1 . A secret desire to destroy. 2. The nonexistence of technology. 3. Nonavailability of the technology. 4. Ignorance of the technology even when available."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"SQUIRREL ADMIN 4 HCO PL 25.1.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 36 17.11.12 5. Failure to apply the technology even when available and known because the being cannot or does not confront the people or the portions of the physical universe con-cerned. The existence of any of these things brings a group toward squirrel administration. Natural cataclysms or political or social catastrophes or upheavals are the other two points which can bring about a failure but even these can be planned for and to some degree handled. The future possibility of these must also be confronted in order to be circumvented. Any successful organization will be fought by the society's fancied rulers or enemies. This is something which should be taken in stride. The ability to confront these discloses that standard administrative actions exist for these two. DRILLS Thus an administrator or staff member, even when the group's tech is available and known, must be able to confront and handle the confusions which can occur and which invite a turn away and a squirrel solution. Even this situation of the inabilities to confront and handle can be solved by third dy-namic (group) drills and drills on the sixth dynamic (physical universe). The drills would be practices in achieving general awareness-and confronting and handling the noise and confusions which make one oblivious of or which drive one off and away from taking standard actions. COMPETENCE Competence is increased in the individual and the group by successes. Successes come from anticipating the situation and handling it. Standard admin is the key to competence and successes in an organization. L.

FEBRUARY 1966 Issue II Gen Non-Remimeo Exec Sec Hats LRH Comm Hat Exec Div DANGER CONDITIONS INSPECTIONS BY EXECUTIVE SECRETARIES, HOW TO DO THEM An Executive Secretary who does not get around his or her divisions now and then and see what is going on can make a lot of mistakes. Inspections are desirable. But when an Executive Secretary makes one he or she commonly issues an order or two, and if this is done without that division's secretary being present it is a by-pass and willy-nilly begins the formula of the Danger Condition and can unmock a section or department or even that Division. A senior can inspect, chat, advise, but must never issue an order on a by-pass unless he or she means to handle a dangerous situation and start the formula. For the formula will run, regardless, if a by-pass begins. The way to inspect, then, is to collect the seniors and go around, and issue orders only to the next senior on the command channel, never to his or her staff. Example: HCO Exec Sec wants to see if books are stored safely. The HCO Exec Sec can nip out and look on his or her lonesome providing no orders are issued. Or the HCO Exec Sec grabs the Dissem Sec and the Dir Pubs and the head of the books section and goes out and looks. And if the HCO Exec Sec wants a change in it all, the order is issued to the Dissem Sec only. It is a great temptation to tell Books-in-Charge how and where to put what, for an HCO Exec Sec is one normally because he or she is smarter and more knowledgeable about orgs. But if one is to advise Books-in-Charge, one had better have the rest of the command chain right there and talk to the next senior below HCO Exec Sec. You would be surprised how many random currents a senior type senior like an Exec Sec can set up with a few comments that skip the command channels and what a mess it can make for a Secretary or Director, no matter how wise the comments. Secretaries who order a Director's officers in the absence of the Director or, much worse, section staff without Director or Section Officer thereby court and make trouble."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"DANGER CONDITIONS INSPECTIONS BY 2 HCO PL 1.2.66 II EXECUTIVE SECRETARIES, HOW TO DO THEM EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 40 17.11.12 You can unmock a section or a whole department by sloppy command lines. It is not merely the \"correct\" thing. It's the vital thing to follow command channels as nobody can hold his job if he is being by-passed by a senior. He feels unmocked, and the Danger Condition formula begins to unroll. The correct way to route an order to a person two or three steps down the command channel is to tell the next one below you to order the next, and so on. If you have to tell the Director of Tech Services to have his Housing Officer post a list of houses on the bulletin board, you really don't have a Director of Tech Services anyway as he would have done it as the natural thing. So an order in such an obvious case is not the right comm. The right comm is an Ethics chit on the Dir of Tech Services for not posting the avail-able houses on the bulletin board. A smart senior is a senior because he is smarter. But when this is not true and the jun-ior is smarter, you get an intolerable situation where the senior interferes. If a dull senior in-terferes continually on a by-pass, it's a sure way to start a mutiny. And a senior who doesn't inspect or get inspections done does not know and so looks dull to his juniors who have looked. The safe way in all cases is to issue orders that are very standard on-policy and obvi-ous and to issue them to the next one on the command channel and then in the future inspect or get an inspection. If on the inspection one finds non-compliance with a standard on-policy order, one promptly calls for a hearing on the next one down the line who received the order. Here's a terribly simple example: Org Exec Sec sees statistic for Tech Div down. Is-sues order to Tech Sec. \"Get the gross divisional statistic up at once.\" Now nothing could be plainer or more standard. In two weeks the Org Exec Sec looks at the statistic, sees it is even further down and calls for a hearing on the Tech Sec for non-compliance or a Comm Ev to get all the evidence in about the matter. This is about as basic as you can get with an inspection, an order and a further action all by a senior, the inspection being done by OIC and reported by graph. Life in actual fact is very simple and an org is today a very elementary mechanism. It is easy to run an organization providing one makes it run and handles things in it that refuse to run. Where an Exec Sec is baffled on occasion is the apparent unwillingness of a section to function. Now this is so far down the command channel that info on it does not easily arrive back at the top. The thing to do where possible is personally inspect. Or get it inspected. One often finds the silliest things. Example: Book Shipping statistic is really down, man, down. One orders and ha-rangues and argues trying to get books shipped. One gets the quantity of books looked into. it's okay. One gets shipping materials looked into. They're okay. A Shipping clerk is on the Org Board. But orders to the Dissem Sec just never get books shipped. So finally one gathers up the Dissem Sec. Dir Pubs and Books-in-Charge and goes down to Book Shipping–Lo!"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"DANGER CONDITIONS INSPECTIONS BY 3 HCO PL 1.2.66 II EXECUTIVE SECRETARIES, HOW TO DO THEM EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 41 17.11.12 They have been building a machine that wraps books tightly when a rock is rolled off a bench! (This actually happened in DC in about 1958.) It has taken a month to build it and will require another to finish it and one and all in that Division are convinced this is the answer. The order? \"Break that machine up and start wrapping books by hand and I want that backlog gone in one week.\" To the Dissem Sec. of course, in front of everyone for his soul's sake. And publish the order in writing as soon as possible. So you see, you have to inspect because what seems logical and okay to juniors may be completely silly. Remember, that is why they are juniors and have seniors. Frankly you can never guess at what holds some things up. You have to look. Often you can solve it for them. But solve it with their agreement and on command channel if you want it done. You can't always sit in an ivory tower and issue orders. You have to know the ground and the business. Over a period of fifteen years of active management of these organizations I have a pretty good idea of what can happen in one. And to one. I try to be right more often than wrong. I don't try to be perfect as one's best plans are often goofed. I try to get done what can be gotten done. And I carry a little more pressure on the org that it can really accomplish. I inspect. You would be surprised at how often I do and what I find out. It sometimes looks to people that I use a crystal ball in taking the actions I take be-cause they see no possible route by which the data could have reached me. They forget how many lines I keep in operation. And also, I do operate on a \"sixth sense\". For instance all accounting summaries today are done for governments, not for man-agement. A manager has to develop a sixth sense concerning financial status of the org. One has to be able to know when the bills are up, the income inadequate and to know when to promote hard and stall creditors even with no data from accounts or contrary data that proved false. Today with OIC this is easy. But I ran orgs successfully with no OIC for years just by sensing the financial situation. In theory accounts keeps one fully posted. In actual fact they often goof in filing bills owed and even in depositing money. There are many things one can sense, OIC or no OIC. The thing to do is to inspect or to get the area you sense is wrong inspected. I have today LRH Communicators. They are pushing projects home. They also can tell me why projects won't push home because they have looked. An Exec Sec or a Secretary has HCO's Inspection and Reports and a Time Machine to check compliance.

If you haven't got it, you won't. When you issue orders you are using power and force. If you are also right in what you get compliance with and your programmes are clear, correct and beneficial-boy do you win. But it is not the rightness of a programme that gets compliance. It is Ethics Presence. Rightness does not get compliance because there are always counter intentions in the way. If you go on the assumption that one and all want things to go right you are going to make a dog's breakfast out of it. There are only a few with a good forward look and who are relatively unaberrated. Men will keep the accounts straight only because you can muster bayonets to enforce that they do. Ethics presence is an X quality made up partly of symbology, partly of force, some \"now we're supposed to's\" and Endurance. One of the reasons the press now print what we say is that we have endured the big-gest shellackings anybody could muster up. We've gained Ethics presence publicly by it. Endurance asserts the truth of unkillability. We're still here, can't be unmocked. This drives the SP wild. Because of the Sea Org we appear to have unlimited reach and in some mysterious way, unlimited resources. The ability to appear and disappear mysteriously is a part of Ethics presence. As an Executive you get compliance because you have Ethics presence and persis-tence and can get mad. The way you continue to have Ethics presence is to be maximally right in your ac-tions, decisions and dictates. Because if you're wrong the other fellow gets wrapped around a pole for complying.

When I say terminatedly handle I mean finishedly handle. That it is handled and that's all, boy! The fault of an organization's woffle, woffle, woffle, Joe won't take responsibility for it, It's got to go some place else, and all that sort of thing, is that it continues a situation. It just goes on and on and on until it finally gets somewhere, goes snap, and that would be the end of that situation. So what you ought to do is complete action now, in the first place. The other day I was looking at why I used to have a high stat businesswise and cinewise and otherwise, and I suddenly realized I was peculiar in the vicinity in which I oper-ated. I ended cycles, I could end more cycles in less time than any organization could dream up. In other words I was concluding actions. Ending cycles doesn't consist of shooting people. It consists of seeing that it stays handled. One of the things that has happened in the past is that I have had to rehandle. Situa-tions I had handled became unhandled some place and I had to rehandle them again. What you should specialize in is terminating the end of a situation, not refer it to somebody else. If the situation comes up in your vicinity well, handle it – that is finish it off so that is the end of it. Somebody comes along saying (natter, natter, natter). I've caught too many of these guys. Finally I handle the situation, if it hadn't been handled up to that point. He hadn't been handled up to that point. When you have got this guy, handle him. Handle him, so that the fellow is handled from here on to the end of time. Don't try to patch it up so that it won't cause any trouble. You have to be on the ball to do this, very much on the ball. An example was a dissat-isfied steward. The guy was going around serving up spanners in the soup. He's going around, and he's going around and he's going around.

He is given an off-policy order. He may know it is off-policy. However, if he says so or protests, he can be subjected to harassment and can be forced to obey the off-policy order. In short, he is in a tough position. So smooth ways to handle this are quite valuable. In the first place, one must know what an illegal order really is: It is an order that is contrary to HCO Policy Letters as issued in the Org Exec Course Volumes or subsequent to them or to LRH Executive Directives or the programs in LRH evaluations or LRH direct or-ders in writing. These orders and policies, in the course of decades of experience, have been proven to improve the condition of the individual and orgs. Orgs which are \"on-policy\" prosper. Periods of depression provenly follow off-policy actions. Therefore it is good sense to follow policy. When people who are ignorant or destructive get into an org, issuing orders or \"setting pol-icy,\" it is quite certain that trouble will follow. But aside from sensible considerations based purely on reason, there is safety for the junior in following policy. There is a prime policy as follows: You can only be given a court or comm-eved for things that violate policy. You cannot be comm-eved or given a court or disciplined for not following Board Pol-icy Letters, Board Technical Bulletins, or targets or orders that violate HCO Policy Letters. The same applies for technical terminals. They can only be disciplined or given courts or comm evs for violations of HCO Bulletins, LRH tapes or issues. Technical terminals cannot be given courts or Comm Evs or discipline for not follow-ing Board Technical Bulletins, local technical issues or verbal tech or Board Policy Let-ters."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"ORDERS, ILLEGAL AND CROSS 2 HCO PL 13.1.79 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 48 17.11.12 It is very unsafe indeed to follow off-policy issues or orders as one then can be comm-eved or given a court or disciplined for it. It is a total defense to plead one followed correctly interpreted HCO Policy Let-ters, HCO Bulletins, Executive Directives or LRH issues or tapes. All one has to do is produce the evidence. A junior should beware of being told it is \"on-policy\" or \"an LRH order\" or \"in bulle-tins\" or \"on LRH tapes.\" The trick is very common. It is often used to get agreement to do an order or plan. The person actually issuing the order has found that he himself has inadequate authority or popularity to get cooperation and so pretends he has \"an LRH order.\" Even peo-ple off the street try this trick. The answer to this is require to see it in writing. If it isn't writ-ten it isn't true. That is the safe maxim. One can be disciplined or given a court or Comm Ev for following an order he was told was valid as above only to find out it is not in policy or bulletins or actual. By taking somebody's word for it and doing it, he is guilty of following off-policy orders. Now you may think this is all very extraordinary. But it isn't. It is almost common-place for some junior to get totally tangled up in off-policy orders, fall on his head, have his stats crash and wind up in a mess. So he needs protection from this sort of thing. This does not mean to say all seniors are bad. Far from it. But sometimes seniors go in for unworkable solutions born out of desperation and, not too well trained, resort to unusual, off-policy solutions. Also there are people around who don't have the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics at heart and for insane reasons try to get people in trouble and wreck the show. It is quite common when some suppressive type gets found and disciplined that three or four actually innocent people get roped into the same scene. They didn't realize how off-policy or destructive the SP was and were stupid enough not to know his orders were off-policy and destructive. And they took them. And there they are in the same Comm Ev. It is, as I say, common. Now, if any one of those otherwise innocent people had simply said \"No, I won't fol-low the order\" to the SP or even \"Let's see the policy letter\" or \"Let's see the bulletin\" or \"Let's see it in writing first,\" the SP never could have carried decent people down with him. Cross orders come under the same heading. It sometimes happens that there is an LRH evaluation or policy covering some definite situation and some senior will cross-order it. Evaluations which, if done, would salvage the whole scene get cross-ordered. This causes them not to be done. And the scene worsens. This has happened often. A junior who follows a cross order is in the same position as a junior who fails to fol-low HCO Policy Letters or HCO Bulletins. He lays himself open to discipline. If, as often happens, an investigator arrives and finds an undone program that has been cross-ordered, he disciplines both the person who issued the cross order and anyone who followed it. So it is not safe to follow a cross order."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"ORDERS, ILLEGAL AND CROSS 3 HCO PL 13.1.79 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 49 17.11.12 It is also not safe to fail to comply with a perfectly legal order or target or, worse, to falsely infer or report it is done when it isn't. But how about the situation of this junior who stands up and says \"I can't do it. It's against policy.\" Or \"I won't use that verbal tech as it's contrary to HCOBs.\" In his timid way, he could feel this was very adventurous. He could get personally harassed. The first thing he might hear is \"You are using policy to stop!\" Well, if the order he is receiving is off-policy or out-tech, he very well better stop it! Otherwise, sooner or later, his own neck and those of the group will be in the noose from the pure pressure of the give and take of life. But if one is too timid to outright refuse to comply, there are other ways. The easiest is to say \"yessir\" and then just don't do it. One can't be hit for not doing it. He can only be hit for doing it. It doesn't matter if he is told he will be hit for not doing it. He can request a Committee of Evidence and of course no one is likely to convene it because he can't be pro-nounced guilty of noncomplying with an off-policy order. But let us say it really gets rough. He doesn't do it and the pressure comes on. He still has recourse. He can report it as an off-policy or out-tech order, complete with references, to the LRH Communicator of the org or the LRH Comm Continental at the Flag Operations Li-aison Office. Meanwhile he must not comply or it puts him at risk. If this channel produces no results, the junior has a petition line. He should look up pe-tition policy. If he gets hit in the meanwhile, even if he got comm-eved, he can demand an HCO Board of Review which in this case would have to cancel the whole thing. The dangerous thing to do is to comply with an off-policy or out-tech order. But how would one, who has not studied policy or is not very far advanced in his tech training know when he was being given an off-policy or out-tech order? 1. If it seems kind of stupid it is probably off-policy or out-tech. Both tech and policy are anything but stupid. Most off-policy and out-tech orders are stupid because they are, at a glance, contrasurvival. 2. Require that one be shown in the exact issue or book what the policy or tech actually is. 3. Read it for yourself and don't listen to any interpretation that seems far-fetched. 4. Be sure the policy or tech you are being shown applies in the matter under discussion. 5. Ignore anyone who, with no written material or tape, chants at you the dates of poli-cies or bulletins and claims they exist. See it for yourself. 6. Be sure to complete Volume Zero of the OEC Volumes as an early action. 7. Become an OEC grad yourself. 8.

HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE WASHINGTON, D.C. HCO BULLETIN OF AUGUST 27, 1958 – EXECUTIVES OF SCIENTOLOGY ORGANIZATIONS – By definition an executive is one who obtains execution of duties, programs and ac-tions in an organization to further the aims and purposes of that organization. To forward dissemination of Scientology, to increase the income of Scientology or-ganizations, and to accomplish what we are trying to do, it is vital that we have good execu-tives who know what they are doing and who do it. Basically, the work of the organization does not depend upon the executive. It depends upon his supervision. The work of the organization depends upon its staff personnel and their performance of duties in exact compliance with their hat folders to accomplish the purposes of their posts. However, it is very difficult for staff personnel to accomplish their duties when they do not have good executives to provide overall supervision and liaison amongst posts. Therefore, it is only necessary to have a bad executive who has a poor understanding of what his work is all about to reduce morale, cause turnover of personnel, to impede dissemination and to lower the income of organizations. Understanding this I have completed a considerable study of the subject of being an executive. There is more to it than one would ordinarily suppose. In the first place, an executive should be able to perform better every single job in the organization than the personnel performing it. In this way the executive will be effective, since he will know what these posts are doing. Thus, an executive is selected primarily for his knowledge of the organization. Another attribute of the executive is an ability to get along with people and to aid them to understand their duties, the whys and wherefores of their posts, and their relationships to other posts and the communication lines which connect them. An-other attribute is the ability to get something done via another person. These three attributes are easily the most important. They are followed by the other side of an executive's activities"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"EXECUTIVES OF SCIENTOLOGY 2 HCO PL 4.11.70 ORGANIZATIONS EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 54 17.11.12 which consist of planning, organizing and promotion, as well as either setting up or gaining compliance with organizational policy. The stable data on which most people operate in a Scientology organization is \"Get the work done\". This is as it should be. However, this as a stable datum in an executive is fatal. His stable datum cannot be otherwise than \"Get people to get the work done\". Let us take a contrary view of this situation. Let us suppose we have an \"executive\" who can himself work hard and who has the datum \"get the work done\". This is what he does. He pulls off some odds and ends of organizational duties into his lap, sits at his desk and in a state of exasperation tries to do everything that comes his way. Under such an executive in-come will decline, morale will turn sour, and there will be a large staff turnover. This \"execu-tive\" simply regards himself as a workhorse who is too overburdened to pay attention to de-tails. He makes mistakes, he does not execute policy, and no matter how hard and how well he works at these jobs he has cut out for himself he never heads up or runs an organization and he never builds anything of any size. At length, he will begin to discourage business and activity on the part of the organization, since the work is already too burdensome for him to handle. Now he was chosen as an executive because he could do the job better on any post in the organization given that post, than the people present. He takes this as a license to \"show people up\" or to \"show them how it really ought to be done\". Let us look at this closely. He would not be an executive unless he could work better than each and every person on staff. He would not be there if he did not know these posts better. But let us add up for him the fol-lowing activities: Director of Training, Director of Processing, auditing all preclears, keeping all accounts, writing all of the dissemination materials, running the mimeograph machine and the printing company, building and painting all of the quarters, personally writing on a type-writer all of the letters received by the organization, and a long time before we get down to typewriting we see that one person on a Mest Universe time span could not perform all of these duties. Therefore, we draw the conclusion that we need many people to perform these actions. An executive who tries to perform many actions himself and does not \"get people to get the work done\" creates a leaderless organization. He is overworked, he cannot cope, he eventually goes out the bottom. Even more importantly, the personnel around him go out the bottom, a thing he commonly fails to observe. We see, then, that an executive makes a mistake every time he takes into his own hands any portion of any job in the organization. There are two ways a \"bad executive\" can do this. The first way is quite obvious. He simply tries to do several posts, thus leaving many posts unsupervised and leaving many details uncoordinated and depriving staff of necessary liaison and supervision amongst the various posts. The other way is less obvious. He takes the juicy tidbits which require \"command decision\" away from the posts and leaves each post a naked drudgery of petty detail; in other words, he scoops off the cream and does, to a slight degree, each one of the jobs around and thus brings about a state of irresponsibility on the various terminals. Furthermore, an executive who is not doing a real job of executing, \"get people to get the work done\", will not be in sufficient contact with the various posts in the organization and know which ones are underburdened and which ones are overburdened. Posts which are un-derburdened and do not have enough to do, who roam around inside the organization like bil-"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"EXECUTIVES OF SCIENTOLOGY 3 HCO PL 4.11.70 ORGANIZATIONS EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 55 17.11.12 liard balls against the banks break up other work. Posts which are overburdened confront the personnel occupying them with such a tremendous pyramid of work that they go into apathy trying to regard their job at all, and so cease to function, and quite ordinarily leave the organi-zation (this is the primary reason people do leave an organization: They cannot do their work well and become convinced that they are badly placed). Chaos and confusion are the result of an executive's (1) inability or unwillingness to simply supervise a post and do none of their work, and (2) inability to grant beingness or con-front the good sense of other people. Now let us see what a good executive really does and we will find that he is busy enough if he actually does his job. He does not call people into his office and have them stand in front of his desk while he explains their job to them. In fact, he spends very little time at his desk. In the first place, such a procedure has the earmarks of \"being called on the carpet\" and makes for ARC breaks. Further, outside of the familiarity of the staff personnel's surroundings the executive is not in effect running 8C. To know anything about the post he would have to see the actual equipment, materials, files, etc. connected with that post. And thus, any good executive spends much less time at his desk than he does in various parts of the organization. A good executive actually goes to the post and looks it over. He does not work with the post with the aim in mind of showing the post how much faster and how much more expertly the post can be done. Admittedly he is an executive and the person occupying the post is occupy-ing that post because the executive can do the post better than the person occupying it. Thus, an impatience and an intolerance is too easy to demonstrate. The executive looks over the post on the site of the post by going through the individ-ual's hat and finding out whether or not it really matches up to the exact duties of the post. He will find if he is patient and a good auditor, that the post is quite routinely confused about his duties and this confusion makes the duties look too big or too hard to do, or he will discover that the post is not covering all of its duties, that it is specializing in some of them. This last is particularly true in an overburdened post. The answer to an overburdened post which is actu-ally overburdened is, of course, not for the executive to take on some of the duties or to try to whip up the person doing the job but to split the hat along some natural division and put an-other personnel on the post in addition to the one already there. Just as any Director of Processing is always being bombarded by the auditors to give them a new, fast, wonderful technique which will solve all of their own goofs, so an executive is always being asked by some staff personnel to do something new, wonderful and strange with the post hat. The hat, of course, containing all of the duties of the post was usually writ-ten up with great care and any real re-arrangement of it or derangement of it will discover that some of the functions or liaisons of the organization will be lost. Therefore, a good executive does not succumb to the idea that something new, wonderful and strange must be done with the post simply because the personnel handling the post do not understand the procedure con-nected with it. It is quite interesting to study the amount of explanation and the frequency of explana-tion necessary to put some personnel on post and to get them to understand and execute the exact duties as stated in the hat. Personnel usually try to run a more complicated post than is"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"EXECUTIVES OF SCIENTOLOGY 4 HCO PL 4.11.70 ORGANIZATIONS EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 56 17.11.12 necessary. It is a natural instinct to complicate something which is simple. Therefore, the simplicities of the post, its purposes and goals, must be observed at all times in any smoothing or re-arrangement of the post. For example, it took three full days in one instance to put the Membership hat on a personnel. The personnel was willing – and you will discover that nearly all personnel are – wanted to get the job done, and was perfectly happy with the rou-tine of the job. But-for three full days this personnel attempted to complicate the job of Mem-bership, rearrange it or twist it about in some fashion so that it was more or less unworkable. This personnel could not understand the simplicity of the Membership routine until an execu-tive had spent three full working days with him. At the end of that time it was possible to have good membership response and good membership handling. This condition continued from there on. If the executive in this case had simply said \"Well, this fellow is stupid\" and if the executive had become impatient, the Membership job never would have gotten done. It required good ARC, it required good patience. If an executive doesn't have three full days to spend putting on such a hat or if he cannot have in the next four or five weeks the equivalent time of those three full days, then he is never going to have a Membership hat worn promptly and properly for the simple reason that the personnel available to him is the personnel avail-able to him. He should not think that he is going to get out of the brow of Jove, springing fully armed, perfect personnel. It is amazing, the confusion of many personnel on their post, particularly on a new job. They are being asked to understand the whole working principle of the organization at one gulp, as far as they are concerned. They cannot see their role, they cannot see how they fit into the scheme of things, they cannot see where their communication lines are going or what they are supposed to do. The executive, of course, being able to un-derstand this, nevertheless has no license to do anything whatsoever but straighten up the post and get the hat worn straight, and get the work done. In working around and about the organization it will be discovered that there are cer-tain holes in the organization or there are missing communication lines or there are needful liaisons. But at this time Scientology organizations have been worked out to such a fine point that an executive would be much safer taking the posts as primarily put together on the origi-nal organization board and putting that structure back together again than in attempting to patch up some new and strange organizational pattern which has had no prior test. The pat-terns of Scientology organizations have been worked out over a period of many, many years. It is highly probable that we have made almost every mistake possible. We are a very compli-cated organization in that we have many posts. We have many communication lines. We have many functions. We have worked these out over a period of time and have come up with something closely approaching a perfect answer. Thus, it is only at this time that I can tell executives to follow that answer and to keep the organization running as it was planned to run. There is really not much reason for an executive to dream up something new, wonderful and strange to take care of some particular activity. However, a word of caution. All person-nel on all posts will attempt to drive him into something new, wonderful and strange in the way they complicate their jobs and in their failure to understand those jobs. Giving the inspection of a post a lick and a promise and passing on, with some impa-tience, to another post, is not being a good executive. One should view the organization or his department as a whole. He should see what it is trying to do. Then he should try to get it to do"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"EXECUTIVES OF SCIENTOLOGY 5 HCO PL 4.11.70 ORGANIZATIONS EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 57 17.11.12 what it is supposed to do. To accomplish this, hats have already been written up for these various posts. If they are lacking in some respect, then he should have, in the case of a de-partment head, consultation with his superiors and in the case of an Association Secretary correspondence or consultation with myself. He should then get the department running on some minimum acceptable basis by spending a short time with each one of the personnel and giving them that part of their job which they can understand to do and accomplish. Having done this, he at least has a partially going concern. Now he should go back through his de-partment or organization and make sure that each set of duties is fully understood and appre-ciated by the personnel holding each post. He should not be impatient, he should not look for the same level of understanding which he himself has for the post and he should not look for the same level of performance with which he could execute the post. The primary mistake an auditor can make is failing to estimate the case he is trying to process. The only thing which can give an auditor errors is to fail to estimate the case he is trying to process. The only way an auditor can be wrong is to fail to estimate the case he is trying to process. Therefore, the only way an executive can be wrong is to fail to estimate the personnel he is trying to get to get the work done. With patience, with good ARC, with good understanding, he should re-peatedly go round and around and around these posts and instead of making the decisions (and thus skimming the cream off the post), he should show how the decisions to be made stem from the actual activities of the job. He should make the personnel occupying the post make the decisions relating to that post. These decisions in the main are minor to the execu-tive, but they may appear very major to a personnel occupying the post. Only by getting the person to make his own decisions will he ever have a responsible occupation of the post. By seizing little pieces of the post to do himself, by running the whole show, decisions and all, the executive will wind up doing all the work himself because he has gradually forced the person for whom he is making the decisions off post. Little by little that personnel has been pushed off into an irresponsibility for his post. This is exactly contrary to the actual function of an executive. For instance, the Dir of Processing, given a well-trained auditor should not go on forever and ever and ever dreaming new tricks and gimmicks which will \"solve the pre-clear's case\". In the first place, the auditor probably is not starting sessions, resolving pt prob-lems, patching up ARC breaks and running a smooth session – that is why the case isn't run-ning. The Dir of Processing should just go on putting the hat – that general hat known as staff auditor – back on the staff auditor's head. Auditors' conferences are actually totally unneces-sary if auditors have been placed on post and if they are supervised on post and if they are given some feeling of responsibility and understanding of their post. If an executive finds himself doing some particular job, he must realize that this job is either missing out of a hat or that he doesn't have a hat to cover that job. Where the idea of policy-making or enforcement becomes making all the decisions for the personnel, the execu-tive has erred. Policy-making and enforcement is definitely his job, just as promotion and planning in general is his job. But if he finds himself doing some routine task, if he finds him-self pinned down hour after hour, day after day, by some concern, then he is missing some-where in putting hats on people's heads. Occasionally an executive is called upon to put a hat on the head of some outside firm, as in legal work. With what glee an organization's attorney will try to pass the hat back to the head of the organization. This is a task just as a staff post is a task of putting the hat on somebody's head. The attorneys of the organization, even occupy-"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"EXECUTIVES OF SCIENTOLOGY 6 HCO PL 4.11.70 ORGANIZATIONS EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 58 17.11.12 ing an outside office, should have their hat put on with regard to the organization so that all legal matters are simply referred and routed to them. If they do not act on this basis, then he either puts the hat more firmly on their head or, as in any case, despairing of this, one finds some new attorneys just as he would find new staff personnel if, after an investment of 7 or 8 days of patient work he still cannot get somebody to go through the routine of the job. There are certain approvals an executive has to give, as Advisory Council minutes. There are personnel changes which an executive has to make, and therefore there are person-nel files which he has to keep. If he is the head of a department he still keeps personnel files for that particular department and he still handles the personnel for that department. If he is a higher level executive he certainly cannot do otherwise than handle personnel as a hat for the entire organization. But the personnel for an entire organization hat is actually not as big a hat as personnel for a single department since it doesn't include procurement. Any department head has the right to do personnel procurement; this has to be okay'd by the executive, of course, and to be posted on the Org Bd actually requires my okay. Now, in a small organization it will be found that three or four or five people working together can get quite a bit accomplished. The moment this goes up to 8 or 10 people, you have need of an executive. That executive, if he does not know his job as it is set down here, and if he thinks his job is something else than getting people to get the work done, will actu-ally restrict and impoverish the organization. He will not permit it to grow, since he is still trying to run an organization the size of that which can be handled by four or five people, while in actuality he has a much larger area. An executive doing good promotion and planning will, of course, drive in a great deal of business. All he has to do is to make sure that his shipping department gets books out; that his PR places ads; that his organizational services are of a quality to invite public confidence. He doesn't really need any bigger tricks of promotion than this. The big trick of promotion is to get everybody to do his job. If this is done, then you will see all manner of promotion being accomplished. Promotion dreamed of is not promotion accomplished. An executive dreaming up promotion and working hard himself is not nearly as effective as an executive getting pro-motion accomplished and getting people to take care of the resulting traffic. In a large Scien-tology organization, he cannot get business up to speed while trying to do all the work him-self. Naturally, there are executives who, by their personal presence, giving lectures, talk-ing to people, can accomplish a great deal of promotion, just as I accomplish a great deal of promotion by writing a book. But my book-writing hat is not my executing hat and I do not get them confused. An executive can wear other hats than being an executive. But being an executive is an express and an explicit hat and its duties consist only and entirely of getting people to get the job done. If other hats are being worn along with the executive hats, then those duties should not be permitted to slop over and occupy and wipe out the executive hat since it's the more important of the two. An example of this in a central organization of Scientology on another continent shows us that some organizations insist on learning always by their own experience, not by already won experience. This organization presents the picture of Scientology organizations"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"EXECUTIVES OF SCIENTOLOGY 7 HCO PL 4.11.70 ORGANIZATIONS EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 59 17.11.12 in the United States in 1952 – everybody was wearing all the hats, nobody was trying to put on any hats other than his own, but his own was all the hats. The resulting confusion, the lack of coordination, the failure to understand that an organizational pattern, orderly terminals and communication lines are vitally necessary to good progress of an organization, resulted in very low income and very hard work on the part of everyone. Contrast this with the 1958 or-derliness and income of Scientology United States and we find the only great difference is that we have learned the proper pattern of organization necessary to carry on our job and that we are executing that proper pattern. You can toss all this aside and work yourself to death and compliment yourself on be-lieving you are getting the job done, but don't wonder why the staff doesn't give you a pat on the back or why I don't give you a pat on the back, because I'm not interested in how many hours you put in. I am not interested in how many documents you handle. I am only interested in the executives who get people to get the work done. On a staff level I am perfectly content with people who take the easier course of simply getting work done. That is the simpler thing to do. These posts are interesting. To handle administration for an Academy is quite a job. Being a Receptionist in the front office is an interesting post – look at all the people you meet. These jobs which go many hours of the day and occasionally late into the night are interesting jobs, they are interesting and necessary terminals. Remember that they are the easier ones to do. Being an executive requires one to get the work done on a via, and that is one of the more difficult tricks demanded of a thetan in this universe. Let's see if we can do it. L.

[See footnote at Bulletin end.] A MODEL HAT FOR AN EXECUTIVE — Primary — To accomplish the purposes of the organization and/or his department on a continuing basis by the use of adequate organization and personnel. To get people in his or her department or organization to get the work done. To understand the jobs of staff members and to get them to ably wear all of their hats. — Secondary — To gain compliance with old or create new standard policy as necessary and to gain compliance in particular with the policy laid down by the board and the policy already exist-ing in standard hats. Planning of campaigns and activities to create new or fulfill old demands and to util-ize thereby personnel. Personnel: Improving his personnel's understanding of their posts and duties and im-proving their interest and activity on that post. Acquiring new personnel as needed and reducing personnel when not needed. Adjusting work burden. * * * An executive must realize that this is his whole hat as an executive and that any other activity in which he is engaged than the above is another hat and should be written up as such and is no part of his executive hat. He must also be certain that an adequate amount of his time is spent filling his executive post, not another post he holds as a staff terminal. "},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"A MODEL HAT FOR EXECUTIVES 2 HCOB 19.9.58 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 64 17.11.12 * * * See HCO Bulletin of August 27, 1958, entitled \"Executives of Scientology Organiza-tions\" * * * An executive keeps a complete duplicate of all hats in his Organization (Department) Hat Book. When a clarification is made in any comm channel the executive makes up a change sheet for each hat affected and sends it to the Org Sec's Secretary (Hat Changes Post) who will type up proper hat copies-she (or he) retains original for Master Org Hat Book, sends one to London, sends back to executive for distribution copies for the hats in that department so affected; executive keeps a copy in the department Org Hat Book. All hat changes must pass through the hands of the Org Sec's Secretary to be typed on blue paper before they are recog-nized as true hat changes. The executive does not leave verbal changes unwritten and unrecorded. If he did so he would mess up all hats. The task of an executive is to put hats on people. Therefore, he should be very careful not to violate hats by introducing emergency programs which pull off hats or by \"temporarily\" pulling people off post to do jobs not covered by their hats. If he has such jobs not covered by hats, he should make provisions for their accomplishment in existing hats or create new hats. ____________________ Executives should not write critical or confusing dispatches to terminals having to do with their performance of duty. Such matters as conduct or rearrangement of post should be taken up with the terminal directly. The only writing is done after the fact of arrangements and then only for the hat, the Org Book and the department Org Book. Wide open comm lines such as we have cannot tolerate critical, confusing or distem-pered dispatches. There is no reason here to learn by experience what is already known-entheta on free comm lines can disturb an organization's comm system beyond belief. This applies equally to despatches from terminals to executives. In the case of an executive in one part of the world having difficulty with the conduct of a terminal in another part of the world, do not dispatch the terminal. Dispatch instead the executive in that part of the world closest to the terminal-explain the situation to that execu-tive and have him take it up personally with the terminal. Even in a local operation, if you cannot interview the terminal in question, do not send a critical dispatch to him. Have the"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"A MODEL HAT FOR EXECUTIVES 3 HCOB 19.9.58 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 65 17.11.12 nearest executive to the terminal take it up with that terminal. No dispatch goes directly to such a distant terminal. (The above is fact; the following is my opinion and may be considered controversial:) Anyone will discover, in actually dealing with people, that these factors dominate: 1. People are willing to do their best and will until hammered about it. 2. Most causes for complaint are based not on misconduct but on misunderstanding. 3. Only personal contact can restore understanding. 4. Written criticism or anger is rarely repaired by more writing. A breach opened by writ-ing is usually susceptible to being healed only by personal contact. The moral is, therefore, don't open the breach with a distempered dispatch. 5. Don't let a detected error drift. Take it up and correct it when found. 6. Don't accumulate \"bad marks\" against a terminal before acting. Forget old \"bad marks\" when they have been corrected. 7. A terminal has his side of the story. As the person on the job he has more valid data than the executive. Listen and question before you decide you're outraged. 8. The only capital an executive has is the willingness to work. Preserve it. No person can be driven to labor-as every slave society has found out. They always lose. When a man is whipped, that work he then does still stems from his willingness alone. Anger made it smaller. Terminals that are confused and have gone wrong are patched up just as an auditor patches up an ARC break. The terminal is also conscious of his own overt acts and thoughts. The only persons an executive cannot handle are those who continually say or drama-tize: \"It can't be done\". These persons are already spoiled by bad 8-C in life. No matter if the person is the attorney or the accountant or the head sweeper, if his response to all solutions offered is \"It can't be done\" (either stated or acted out) the executive has only two answers: order him to intensive intensives or fire him. Short of this action, the executive has no other course to take. Threats, penalties, scoldings, all accomplish nothing. We have then three classes of possible personnel: 1. The Willing 2. The defiant negative 3. The wholly shiftless. To handle these we have three classes of action only and none in between. (An authen-tic case of white is white and black is black.) Class One (above): Handle them as outlined here with understanding, intelligence, helpfulness, courage and compassion. Class Two (above): Process only or fire. Class Three (above): Process only or fire."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"A MODEL HAT FOR EXECUTIVES 4 HCOB 19.9.58 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 66 17.11.12 Classes two and three are non-employable. Why burden the staff or economics of the organization with them. The Willing include the overbearing, the meek, the swift, the slow, the efficient, the worried. Threats and punishing regulations do not help them-only hurt the innocent with the guilty. Tight scheduling, insistence, reason, crispness and ARC help them. The Unwilling are bait only for auditors or the unemployment bureau. Leave a post vacant rather than hire them. You'll wish you had. Don't confuse a clash of personalities, independence and lack of subservience with unwillingness to do. The military does this and look at it! If you only want a staff that won't talk back, join the army-they punish people for communicating or deserting. Some very high class bastards can do some high class jobs. The Unwilling only do or say \"can't\" no matter what solution or task is offered. Usu-ally they don't talk. Sometimes they are models of meekness. But like a hunting dog that won't kill chickens, they're no good to you. If they're out of your organization or department, you have only the willing left-so why look further in executing than being decent. The man who doesn't appreciate it isn't with you anyway. So that leaves only one code of conduct for an executive to follow, the one outlined here. His personnel hat excludes the Mr. No and the Miss Can't and the Master Flop. An executive needs as much discipline and anger as he lets the Unwilling in. The first principle of an executive is to accomplish the goals of the organi-zation and department. He must employ the Willing and maintain ARC. And remember that there's an R in it. A quarter of a century of leadership in this life has taught me that the only underprivi-leged posts there are, are posts of leadership. As one rises on the scale of authority his flaws magnify and so does his power to hurt and destroy. It would take an archangel to be a perfect executive. Despite the trying nature of an executive post it yet must be filled-and filled with understanding, intelligence, helpfulness, courage and compassion. When a lack of these enters upon an organization's comm lines, the organization sickens and is gone-just as our world at large is doing. Our staff are willing. I believe in them and trust them. Nobody could ever do the job we're all doing-but we're doing it. A hundred thousand years of future are looking at us-we can only measure up by do-ing our jobs as best we can today-with understanding, intelligence, helpfulness, courage and compassion-to the greatest good of the greatest number of dynamics. It is a large order-but the first to fill it must be our executives. ____________________ HOW TO ISSUE INSTRUCTIONS TO PERSONNEL 1. Have a definite clear-cut and correct estimate of situation. 2.

An Executive also has to know neighboring org board arrangements in the same org, the org board of allies and of enemies. An Executive has to know what users need and want and furnish it. When normal and routine posts fail under him, the Executive is of course forced into Non Existence as an ex-ecutive, has to find what is needed and wanted and produce it.

The Executive has inherited from a competent former ex-ecutive or has himself built (and has prevented transfers and lack of apprenticeship from de-stroying) his unit, department, division, org or orgs. Now to continue to single-hand will destroy anything that has been built. The other policy letter (HCO P/L 19 July 1963) now applies and is so re-issued. When an Executive in charge of a working activity continues to retain the idea \"Do all I can\" chaos then results. An already formed activity will collapse. The only possible datum on which an executive could work effectively in a formed ac-tivity is \"Get people to get the work done\". Otherwise the executive does as much as he can and leaves the willing personnel standing around unhelped and unguided. If we all did this, Scientology would go nowhere. One auditor can't audit the world. One personnel cannot do all the work of a Scientology or-ganization.

Supervision means helping people to understand their jobs. Supervi-sion means giving them the responsibility and wherewithal to do their jobs. Supervision in-cludes the granting of beingness. Supervision does not mean doing the job supervised. Thus you have two phases and shades of grey in between. At a slight sag or a mess – up or failure to hire and hat and apprentice properly, a PHASE Il situation can drop back into a single-handing Phase I. An executive who again doesn't see that he has dropped out of comfortable Phase II and gotten into a Phase I must at once again single-hand if only for a day. But now the Executive must get in ethics, hire, hat and apprentice people and build once more to Phase II. In short, an Executive has to know how to change gears!

The Executive's actions are as follows: 1. Issue orders of a remedying or preventive nature instantly by directive, to remain in ef-fect until all data is in. This is called an Urgent Directive. 2. Appoint a Board of Investigation to investigate the matter, with orders to investigate fully and couch findings in terms of a directive or policy for issue. 3. Pass or modify the Board's findings as orders to supplant the Urgent Directive issued as 1 above. This is called the Final Directive or Policy. THE URGENT DIRECTIVE To do 1 – issue a sweeping order to handle the situation. This is vital as there isn't time to get all the facts. The order may be fair or unfair, correct or incorrect, but at least it does something to arrest a deteriorating situation. This Urgent Directive may, however, be in fact wide of the mark but it is only going to remain in force until superseded by orders based on all the data obtained at leisure. Dictatorships are somewhat successful as proven in the past and they run only on ur-gent directives. So the system is not all bad. However, for such a directive to remain law for-ever is obviously wrong as it may be wholly arbitrary and may eventually get in somebody's hair. But not to issue it just because one has little data is to ask for disaster. So in the face of disaster issue an Urgent Directive as best you can and hope you are right in your directed action."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"ADMIN KNOW-HOW II ACTIONS, EXECUTIVE, 2 HCO PL 31.10.66 I FOR HANDLING DISASTROUS OCCURRENCES EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 80 17.11.12 THE BOARD Convene now a Board of Investigation composed of impartial members who will in-vestigate thoroughly. Order them to turn in their findings in the form of law that can be issued exactly as they wrote it. Trouble with such Boards, they \"recommend\" in an often rambling way and as they aren't really writing law they tend to overlook things. Democracies have a terrible habit of only appointing committees to investigate with-out issuing any urgent directive first. This leaves a vacuum of direction and courts disaster. Such bodies may take a long time to bring in their findings. This is a great weakness – to let an abuse go on while one investigates. THE FINAL DIRECTIVE When the convening authority has the Board's findings to hand, he studies the pro-ceedings and findings to make certain that the disaster is fully handled by the findings and that further disasters of like nature are inhibited by these findings from occurring. If he is satisfied on this score (that the findings are adequate), he must now see that they do not violate the fast flow system of management to any great degree and that they are as adequate as the Urgent Directive in arresting the disaster. If so, the executive sends the findings through regular channels with all papers to make them into law. Until actually law, the Urgent Directive is still in force. If he is not satisfied or doubtful that the findings are adequate he can convene another Board to do a better job. If he does convene another Board, the Urgent Directive remains in force. The findings actually become law only when – : (a) The convening authority has passed them as they are or modified by himself or an-other Board; (b) The findings have gone through all steps necessary to become law; (c) The findings are finally the law. Then the Urgent Directive is cancelled. It must be cancelled when the findings become law and may not remain as a possible arbitrary. ____________________ The above is good administration. Some governing bodies use only urgent directives. Some use only committees or boards or senates."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"ADMIN KNOW-HOW II ACTIONS, EXECUTIVE, 3 HCO PL 31.10.66 I FOR HANDLING DISASTROUS OCCURRENCES EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 81 17.11.12 To use less than all three in the face of a disastrous situation is poor admin. Example: Income goes down like a shot. 1. Issue an Urgent Directive calculated to get income up like a shot. 2. Convene a Board to find out why it went down and to discover what was dropped out and find how to get it back up. 3. Supplant the Urgent Directive with the findings. ____________________ Where policy is concerned, the channel is longer as more people must pass on it. But directives are also law. So one should not issue a directive in the face of disaster and just hope. One should do all three steps above. By disaster is meant a circumstance or situation that is crippling and may adversely af-fect a whole or a part of an org. Low income is a heavy risk that may result in disaster. A heavy continual expenditure may result in a disaster. Any gross divisional statistic going down and staying down is courting disaster. And such should be handled with the three steps as above. Then the org form and duties, if bent out of shape by the Urgent Directive won't stay out of shape forever. As a comment, statistics when they change suddenly and go down mean that some-thing has been dropped or some arbitrary order has been given. Stats going steeply up also mean a change has occurred and it can be very disastrous not to find what it was that was so good. So one can also use the three steps to handle a sudden soaring statistic to maintain it rather than stay in the dark. Example: Letters out soars to an all time high. Issue an Urgent Directive, \"No person or line may be changed in the Dissem Division on peril of a Comm Ev.\" Then convene a Board and find why and get some law on it. Then supplant the Urgent Directive with the new directive resulting. ____________________ This in no way alters the need of a directive to be passed by the LRH Comm or a pol-icy letter to be passed by all specified terminals before it becomes policy. PERSONNEL Steps 1, 2 and 3 can also be used on personnel where the executive thinks a staff member is the reason. Suspension from post pending investigation would be the Urgent Di-rective in this case. However, the staff member so suspended may not be deprived of wages and must be given an apology if found not to be the reason. And no real action may be taken unless there is an Ethics action recommended by the Board and only if the person is found guilty in that Ethics action."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"ADMIN KNOW-HOW II ACTIONS, EXECUTIVE, 4 HCO PL 31.10.66 I FOR HANDLING DISASTROUS OCCURRENCES EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 82 17.11.12 In this case there are four steps: 1.

Final Directive either (a) restoring the personnel and stating the real causes in the form of a separate directive with long range actions to handle the situation, or (b) appoint-ing a new personnel and recommending in a separate directive long range actions to handle the situation.

In 4th para, 1st line, the word \"flow\" is corrected to \"flaw\".) Remimeo Important STANDARD ADMIN This is the first Policy Letter on Standard Administration. Standard Tech came in with a crash just by teaching the most basic of basics as the most important actions. Cases which hadn't moved for years when handled by Case Supervisors and auditors who skipped all the airy fairy nonsense and just did the usual ordinary basic actions suddenly flew. There is also Standard Training Procedure. This again is the ordinary down-to- earth basic actions. A class that hadn't moved at all suddenly took off and all graduated when the Usual was done. Thus we find the flaw in all our actions to be the failure to separate out the truly basic important actions and instead engaging upon trivial complexities. It is a characteristic of a thetan that the least complex actions are the most powerful. When his confront lessens he tries to do things by vias that add complexities and he then fails and becomes weak. So, just as we blasted our way to 100% results with Standard Tech so we can thunder straight through to victory using Standard Admin. DEFINITIONS Standard means \"A definite level or degree of quality that is proper and adequate for a specific purpose\". (Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged. Standard 3 b page 2223.) Administration means \"The principles, practices and rationalized techniques employed in achieving the objectives or aims of an organization.\" (Webster's Third New In-ternational Dictionary Unabridged, 5 (a). Administration, page 28.) We commonly call this \"Admin\" as a shortening of it and to designate the work of doing it. Organization means \"A group of people that has more or less constant membership, a body of officers, a purpose and usually a set of regulations.\" (Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged, 2 b page 1590.) Basics means \"basic-s something that is basic: Fundamental\"."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"STANDARD ADMIN 2 HCO PL 9.11.68 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 84 17.11.12 Base means \"the bottom of something considered its support\". Fundamental means \"serving as an original or generating force: being the one from which others are derived\". Derived means \"formed or developed out of something else\", which is to say something formed or made from a basic. Thus if we have the Basic or base or starting point, and know it well, then from it we can develop more complex actions. We had to have the fundamental or basic laws of organization in order to develop the full structure of organization. Administration becomes Standard when we have the most important points or laws or actions and when we always use these and use them in just the same way. For example, some people look at a factory as a big complex structure, they consider it very complicated or hard to understand or are in awe of it. Or get confused trying to study it. Well, the moment they know that the basic action of the place is to make silk cloth, they have a fundamental on which to understand what is going on. When we then know that raw fiber goes in one side, gets processed and comes out the other as satin, we can begin to sketch in what its flow lines must be. At last we have that, we can assume somebody runs it and that people work there and taken all in one piece it's an organization. To run the factory we would have to know the most important duties of every person in the place, the functions of the machines and the lines of flow. And to run it successfully we would have to know where its raw fiber came from and its cost and who would buy it and its price and how much the various expenses were to keep it going and to make it make more than it spent and we'd have its economics and accounting. These would be the Basics of the place: who did what, what the lines were, where the raw materials came from and where the finished product went, and keeping the cost and expense in ratio, how to stimulate more demand for satin and how to get raw materials in quantity at a reasonable price. While some might be upset at making a similarity between a factory and an organization in general, all organizations have the same basic problems and similar solutions. An Army delivers blows to the enemy and gets recruits, material and pay from the government. It has a supposed product too, since few armies exist after losing too often in a war. THE BEST ORGANIZATION The best organization is one which has a thetan over it, methods of working out its problems, basic actions and a good desirable product. It adapts itself to its"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"STANDARD ADMIN 3 HCO PL 9.11.68 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 85 17.11.12 environment or surroundings or conditions of operation so as to expand to greater or lesser degree. Such as organizations must have a clear-cut purpose and fill a definite need in order to survive. Its services must be more valuable than what it costs to produce or furnish those services. It must, to remain healthy, obtain more potential than it spends. For \"potential\" can be ready money or power or even strength. Where an organization violates these very fundamental things it sickens and will eventually perish. For example, a government of a country can violate one or more of the above simple ideas and eventually cease to exist. Some governments are really dead for a very long time before the fact is discovered. Such is the persistence and power of a once strong organization that it can continue for a very long while, feeding inward on itself. It gradually contracts and eventually becomes a memory only. Thus when you see an organization begin to contract, if it is to be salvaged, it must be stripped back to basics quickly, its form simplified, its purpose clarified and the important services it can render greatly intensified and the cost of rendering them greatly reduced. This formula, intelligently applied even to a dead government, could revive it. Lest we go too quickly, in the single sentence above and the earlier basics mentioned we have the whole \"secret\" of either reviving an old or forming a new organization. If you know the purpose and how to make a desirable service known and know how to handle its fundamentals expertly you can found, increase, or revive any organization. Putting together or handling an organization requires very certain, positive knowledge of (a) The basics of organizations (b) The purpose of the organization (c) The basic actions necessary in the organization (d) The potentials of the area in which the organization exists (e) The needs and desires of the area or people the organization serves (f) The economics on which the organization will operate."},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"STANDARD ADMIN 4 HCO PL 9.11.68 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 86 17.11.12 Handling or serving in an organization successfully, one has to know the actions and activities of the organization and its area so well that one does not have to think about it. One just does it or one indicates or works with what or who does it. You don't think \"clutch, gear shift, accelerator, steering wheel,\" when you drive a car. You should, to drive it successfully, know where these things are and what they do so well that you simply drive a car. But learning to drive a car, you learn each of these things and its function and then learn them so well that it seems like instinct to use them. It isn't instinct. It's knowing them so well you don't fumble. An organization is like that. Working in it or being one of those who run a part of it or the whole of it, one has to know the parts and actions and (a) to (0 above so well one knows them so fast that one just does them. So, in Standard Admin we are acquiring (a) A knowledge of basics (b) The basics that exist in and around a specific organization (c) The ability to handle those basics with such speed and certainty that it seems instinct. And when we have this, the organization will go, go, go with an ease and lack of effort that is astonishing. L.

They draw from a quarter to a third of a million dollars per year. They are paid far far more than professional people, far more than scientists, more than politicians who, above all people, should be excellent administrators. Why? Because they are so rare. Business schools may turn out graduates by the millions but very, very, very few of them ever become topflight executives who can really administer. Why does the civilization develop so very few of them? Because this civilization has not had much workable administrative tech and has not even known the basic natural laws which underlie administration. The subject of administration is so poorly known because there is so little data. And because there is so little, the subject itself is not understood at all by the general population of the planet. Yet there are very few on the planet who are not the direct effect of administrators. You hear an administrator talk about Production or Gross Income and possibly sup-pose this is just a peculiarity or a fixation and that these facts are distant from general living. Perhaps some people suppose that such talk and urgings is part of the capitalistic system or something for a board of directors. General public reaction to such things is usually a noth-ing-to-do-with-me. The usual attitude to law and accounting is a \"beyond me\" and an \"it's confusing\" yet the person is subject every day of his life to them. It is quite similar but even more mysterious with administration. Administration is not peculiar to capitalism. Or to any special field. It embraces all of them, even law and accounting which are, in actual fact, administrative specialties. Let us look at this abundant and glaring evidence: Russia cannot feed her people. She cannot clothe them. She has fantastic troubles in moving them about. Russia, despite her PR, is a failure. She is a failure, not because few people agree with her ideology, indeed, that ide-ology has crept reachingly over the world. And let us look at the capitalist juggling money, money bags and paper gold and look as well at the health problems and cultural unrest that ride as problems in his train. The sever-est criticism of the capitalist is that communism and socialism grew up and flourished during his reign. And look at the clanking, swanking military dictators who have replaced the weak and diseased kings who once ruled the world. They are themselves replaced by their own kind as fast as firing squads can be assembled by newly ambitious dictators."},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"PRODUCTION AND EXCHANGE 2 AKH-30 – 1.09.73 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 88 17.11.12 Why do these ideologies fail and why are they so oppressive while they last? They have too few trained and skilled administrators who can get a show on the road. The Survival of any group depends utterly upon things like Production and Ex-change. That is the way the universe runs. When these factors are not competently handled, the group is in poverty or vanishes. Civilizations have not vanished because they had the wrong ideologies or ran out of resources. First and foremost they vanished because they had no technology of the mind and could not handle people because they did not know the basic fundamentals of life. And right along following that, they did not really know the tech of administration or even what admin-istrators were or could do. Their survival was in question the moment they did things with individuals contrary to the basic laws of life: They began to believe they would get reaction A by some strange rite, but instead of that got reaction B. They not only did not have mental technology, they adopted practices contrary to basic laws. And so they were torn with revolts. And wars. And their survival fell to nothing when they did not know or practice fundamental administration and violated the basic rules through ignorance or sloth. If one is going to have a group in this universe that survives and wins through its ob-stacles, it must have and apply basic laws. It does not have to be a perfect group but it must not be an ignorant group. While the happiness of the individual may depend upon mental tech, apart from any group, he cannot survive well as a group member if he has no knowledge or understanding of administrative tech. If one goes on living in this universe, he is sooner or later the subject of administration as a member of a group. In cave days, if one had to stay in his cave starving because of a sa-ber-toothed tiger prowling, he would have had two choices: he either stayed in his cave and starved to death or he learned about saber-toothed tigers; when he knew about saber-toothed tigers he would now have new choices of how to avoid, how to kill or even how to employ saber-toothed tigers; when he had settled this he would now have a path of action he could predict. The jungle in which he lived was subject to certain rules, no matter who laid them down, God or the old, old Biological Survey. In other words, even in cave days one was the effect of an administrator. When one had solved the crude tooth and claw existence, one could rise to a small niche of administering on his own; animals could be domesticated, plants when planted would grow, wood when carved would make things, metal when formed would make things that made things. The moment one was headed in the direction of survival he was headed in the direc-tion of production. So many killed deer made so many meals; it also made so many hides which made so many beds and jackets. The exchange with the deer was quite unequal as there was nothing for the deer and the deer protested by ceasing to exist and one got into goats and"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"PRODUCTION AND EXCHANGE 3 AKH-30 – 1.09.73 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 89 17.11.12 cattle. Similarly, when the wild roots gave out, for there was no exchange for the roots, one had to plant them and tend them. Consumption any way one looked at it eventually got into production that equalized, or tended to exchange. When one could administer a small area, so many plants, so many goats, he was in his own right something of an administrator. He learned there was technical tech and he learned there was administrative tech also. And these things of all others continued to guide his sur-vival. One can of course decide not to go on living in this universe. But now he falls into two new choices: he either goes to another universe or drops into a sort of self cave. In the other universe he will probably find himself under a new administrator or a new set of rules even if he alone makes them. And if he chooses a sort of nowhere self cave, he has done so because he never solved the saber-toothed tigers. Thus one is confronted with certain incontrovertible facts. 1. He must seek the tech of survival and apply it; 2. He will survive as well as he can administer or handle administration. As a member of any group, the Production and Gross Income or Exchange he hears his executives talking about applies to him directly. What ideology or system one embraces, his well-being, his safety, his happiness, will relate to Production and Exchange and the ease with which these are attained or maintained is determined directly by his understanding of and ability to handle administration. There are thousands and thousands and thousands who might give you far far different basics for life. But watch it! They are touting for some administrator or seeking to avoid all administration in every case, one or the other! One either lone-wolfs his life or one gets through with a group. In the first place, one must think mainly of personal money or one must think of the group's survival. The regulat-ing factors in either case are Administration resulting in Production and Exchange. Bank robber or bank president, these harsh facts of life still apply. Democratic politi-cian or autocratic commissar, these are still the main determining factors of life. The welfare state seems so wonderful a dream to the socialist: why is it then that ghetto people riot because they have no jobs but are only on welfare? It is true, surveys show. The recipients of welfare, whether a Roman guttersnipe, a white Swede or a Black American become crippled as beings: they are the total effect of administration, they have no cause-factor short of a riot. They want jobs. For they instinctively realize that they are in little better position than the cave man with the saber-toothed tiger outside. They have been disen-franchised as members of the group, dwellers of the universe. They cannot exchange, a somewhat fearful thing, they do not produce and they are forbidden causative control or causative administration. They recognize, no matter how dimly, that they have been set up as zeros. And this is not only unhappy, it is dangerous. Reversely, when people offer nothing in exchange, do not produce and cannot or will not administer, they become pawns. Sometimes they think they are merely the subject of"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"PRODUCTION AND EXCHANGE 4 AKH-30 – 1.09.73 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 90 17.11.12 meanness or rancor. But if they do not produce or exchange and cannot share in administra-tion, they become zeros. Their fate is decided already, by themselves. It would not matter for a moment what some administrator did or did not do, such people have reduced their survival to a point that it is prey to the lightest wind. These facts are as inevitable as \"apples fall,\" as harshly real as a tiger's claw and as predictable as tonight's darkness. Their only possible choices are (1) to cease to exist (which is impossible for a thetan) or (2) get in a position or situation or state of mind to produce, exchange and administer. There is a third choice-to leave this universe. Life is, or can be, a pretty grim proposition. One may float along on the production of others like the recently demised \"Leisure Class\" of 19th century infamy or like a hobo being chased by every householder and cop. One can go along in the numb world of the middle class watching his public docility while he hypocritically sins behind doors and conforms with a capital C. One can creakingly labor in the world of the endlessly-being-dug ditch for some unknown pipe. Or one can simply confront the whole thing, pain, misemotion, punish-ments, rewards and all and produce and exchange and learn to handle the administrative sys-tem he is in and himself administer his life and environ. One can hear countless reasons why it is too awful or too deadly to find out about the tiger. But you hear these reasons from the cowardly dead. One can hear a million arguments against being a tiger or the administrator who orders tigers about. But one is talking to people who are not living. The stark facts are these: one knows and handles administration, one produces, one exchanges OR one dies as far as this universe is concerned. That's why you hear an administrator who means well for the group talking about Production and Exchange. That is why one never hears a politician who means ill for the group mention them. And that's why the person who can use administration to bring about production and exchange is so highly paid by status and respect or why his group is so highly paid. He is dealing in Survival. And the skills he uses are well worth knowing and using. Caves are damp. Bring on the tigers! The sun is shining. L.

A very good administrator can get things handled over a very long distance. A medi-umly skilled administrator has a shorter reach. As this scale declines, we get people who can make things happen only at arm's length. It is interesting that administrators are valued in direct proportion to the distance they can reach and get things handled over. Persons who can handle things only at arm's length are valued but not in proportion to a long-reaching administrator. The complexity of situations and things handled is also a test of the administrator. If one began at the highest level of capability of handling things thousands of miles away and at the bottom of the scale handling things at arm's length, one would also find complexity enter-ing the picture. The artisan can, by means of heavy mest communication lines and tools, make all manner of things occur but mostly within his visual sight line. The day laborer who can only handle a shovel usually can only handle the simplicity of lifting a few pounds of dirt to a definite position. One of the troubles PTS people have, as an example, is handling something over a long-distance communication line. One can tell them to handle the suppressive, but one must realize he may also be giving the order to someone to handle another person several thousand miles away. This is a high level of administrative skill and is usually no part of a PTSs ability, whatever other technical considerations may intervene. Estimating situations thousands of miles away and handling them terminatedly is actu-ally comparable to an OT ability. There is no effort here to include artists and technicians who do work with their hands, for this is another class of activity requiring enormous technical skill and ability. However, very few people understand the administrator or what he is or what he can do, yet the whole world is the effect of good or bad administrators."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"ADMINISTRATIVE SKILL 2 AKH-31 – 15.10.73 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 92 17.11.12 The administrator has technology with which to discover and handle situations and if he is a very good administrator his handling is ordinarily constructive; but whatever it is, it is firm. A skilled administrator therefore can be defined as one who can establish and main-tain communication lines and can thereby discover, handle and improve situations and conditions at a distance. When you fully grasp this and realize it is the basic simplicity that is the basic all of an administrator's further complex technology, you can estimate an administrator's efficiency or effectiveness.

The purpose of organization is to make planning become actuality. Organization is not just a fancy complex system, done for its own sake. That is bu-reaucracy at its worst. Org boards for the sake of org boards, graphs for the sake of graphs, rules for the sake of rules only add up to failures. The only virtue (not always a bad one) of a complex unwieldy meaningless bureau-cratic structure is that it provides jobs for the friends of those in control. If it does not also bring about burdensome taxation and threatened bankruptcy by reason of the expense of maintaining it and if it does not saddle a people or production employees with militant inspec-tions and needless control, organization for the sake of providing employment is not evil but beyond providing employment is useless, and only when given too much authority is it de-structive. The kings of France and other lands used to invent titles and duties to give activity to the hordes of noble hangers-on to keep them at court, under surveillance, and out of mischief out in the provinces where they might stir up their own people. \"Keeper of the Footstools\" \"Holder of the Royal Nightgown\" and other such titles were fought for, bought, sold and held with ferocity. Status seeking, the effort to become more important and have a personal reason for be-ing and for being respected gets in the road of honest efforts to effectively organize in order to get something done, in order to make something economically sound. Organization for its own sake in actual practice usually erects a monster that becomes so hard to live with that it becomes overthrown. Production losses, high taxes, irritating or fearsome interference with the people or actual producers invites and accomplishes bank-ruptcy or revolt, usually both even in commercial companies. Therefore to be meaningful, useful and lasting, an organization has to fit into the defi-nition above: To make planning become actuality."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE KEY INGREDIENTS 2 AKH-22 – HCO PL 14.9.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 94 17.11.12 In companies and countries there is no real lack of dreaming. All but the most de-praved heads of companies or states wish to see specific or general improvement. This is also true of their executives and, as it forms the basis of nearly all revolts, it is certainly true of workers. From top to bottom, then, there is, in the large majority, a desire for improvement. More food, more profit, more pay, more facilities, and, in general, more and better of whatever they believe is good or beneficial. This also includes less of what they generally consider to be bad. Programmes which obtain general support consist of more of what is beneficial and less of what is detrimental. \"More food less disease\" \"More beautiful buildings, less hovels\" \"More leisure less work\" \"More activity less unemployment\" are typical of valuable and ac-ceptable programmes. But only to have a programme is to have only a dream. In companies, in political par-ties, useful programmes are very numerous. They suffer only from a lack of execution. All sorts of variations of programme failure occur. The programme is too big. It is not generally considered desirable. It is not needed at all. It would benefit only a few. Such are surface reasons. The basic reason is lack of organization know-how. Any programme, too ambitious, partially acceptable, needed or not needed could be put into effect if properly organized. The five year plans of some nations which are currently in vogue are almost all very valuable and almost all fall short of their objectives. The reason is not that they are unreal, too ambitious or generally unacceptable. The reason for any such failure is lack of organization. It is not man's dreams that fail him. It is the lack of know-how required to bring those dreams into actuality. Good administration has two distinct targets 1. To perpetuate an existing company, culture, or society. 2. To make planning become actuality. Given a base on which to operate, which is to say land, people, equipment and a cul-ture, one needs a good administrative pattern of some sort just to maintain it. Thus 1 and 2 above become 2 only. The plan is \"to continue the existing entity\". No company or country continues unless one continues to put it there. Thus an administrative system of some sort, no matter how crude, is necessary to perpetuate any group or any subdi-vision of a group. Even a king or headman or manager who has no other supporting system to whom one can bring disputes about land or water or pay is an administrative system. The foreman of a labour gang that only loads trucks has an astonishingly complex administrative system at work. Companies and countries do not work just because they are there or because they are traditional. They are continuously put there by one or another form of administration. When a whole system of admin moves out or gets lost or forgotten, collapse occurs unless a new or substitute system is at once moved into place."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"THE KEY INGREDIENTS 3 AKH-22 – HCO PL 14.9.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 95 17.11.12 Changing the head of a department, much less a general manager and much, much less a ruler, can destroy a portion or the whole since the old system, unknown, disregarded or for-gotten, may cease and no new system which is understood is put in its place. Frequent trans-fers within a company or country can keep the entire group small, disordered and confused, since such transfers destroy what little administration there might have been. Thus, if administrative shifts or errors or lack can collapse any type of group, it is vital to know the basic subject of organization. Even if the group is at effect – which is to say originates nothing but only defends in the face of threatened disaster, it still must plan. And if it plans, somehow it must get the plan executed or done. Even a simple situation of an attacked fortress has to be defended by plan-ning and doing the plan, no matter how crude. The order, \"Repel the invader who is storming the south wall,\" is the result of observation and planning no matter how brief or unthorough. Getting the south wall defended occurs by some system of administration even if it only con-sists of sergeants hearing the order and pushing their men to the south wall. A company with heavy debts has to plan even if it is just to stall off creditors. And some administrative system has to exist even to do only that. The terrible dismay of a young leader who plans a great and powerful new era only to find himself dealing with old and weak faults, is attributable not to his \"foolish ambition\" or \"lack of reality\" but to his lack of organizational know-how. Even elected presidents or prime ministers of democracies are victims of such terrible dismay. They do not, as is routinely asserted, \"go back on their campaign promises\" or \"be-tray the people\". They, as well as their members of parliament, simply lack the rudiments of organizational know-how. They cannot put their campaign promises into effect not because they are too high flown but because they are politicians not administrators. To some men it seems enough to dream a wonderful dream. Just because they dreamed it they feel it should now take place. They become very provoked when it does not occur. Whole nations, to say nothing of commercial firms or societies or groups, have spent decades in floundering turmoil because the basic dreams and plans were never brought to fruition. Whether one is planning for the affluence of the Appalachian Mountains or a new loading shed closer to the highway, the gap between the plan and the actuality will be found to be lack of administrative know-how. Technical ignorance, finance, even lack of authority and unreal planning itself are none of them true barriers between planning and actuality. ____________________ Thus, we come to the exact most basic steps that comprise administration."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"THE KEY INGREDIENTS 4 AKH-22 – HCO PL 14.9.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 96 17.11.12 First is Observation. From beginning to end observation must serve both those in charge and any others who plan. When observation is lacking, then planning itself as well as any and all progress can become unreal and orders faulty and destructive. Observation in es-sence must be true. Nothing must muddy it or colour it as this can lead to gross errors in ac-tion and training. Next is planning itself. Planning is based on dreams but it must be fitted to what is needed and wanted and what men can do, even with stretched imaginations or misgivings. Planning has to be targeted and scheduled and laid out in steps and gradients or one will be laying railroad tracks that pass through oceans or boring tunnels in mountains that do not ex-ist or building penthouses without putting any building under them to hold them up. The essence of planning is communication and the communication must be such that it can be understood and will not be misunderstood. For unless those who oversee and those who do know what their part of the plan is, they cannot execute their share and very well may oversee and do quite some other action, leaving a monstrous gap and even a structure that ate up their time and funds but now has to be torn down. The next is supervision and supervision is dually needful. It serves as a relay point to which plans can be communicated and from which observations as reports can be received; and it serves as the terminal which communicates the plans as orders and sees that they are actually done. This gives one the genus of the Org Board as a central ordering point which has other relay ordering points taking care of their part of the whole plan or programme. These points are often also the points which care for local occurrences which must be handled and their frailty is that they become so involved with local occurrences, oddities and purely local concerns that they do not or can not give any attention to receiving, relaying and over-seeing their part of the main plan. Then there are the producers who produce the service or the structure or the product required by the plan. Many plans are marvelous in all respects but putting somebody there to actually DO the required actions that make the plan real. The primary fault is to use persons who already have projects and duties to which they are committed and, with their local knowledge, see must be continued at any cost but who are forced to abandon existing pro-grammes or duties to start on this new activity, solely because the new activity has the stress given it in orders and the old activities are seemingly ordered left alone. Old companies and old countries could be said to be \"that collection of incomplete and abandoned projects which is confused and failing\". Finally there is the user, those who will use or benefit from the programme when it is realized and completed. When planning fails to take this element into account, only then can the whole programme fail utterly for it, regardless of dreams, labor and expense, is finally seen to be of no value anyway. Thus all great programmes begin with an understanding or a survey of what is needed and wanted and a nose and value count of those who will use it and a costing action in time, labor, materials and finance, compared to the value of it, even if only aesthetic, of those who will use it in any way if only to know they have it or to be proud of it or to feel better or stronger because they have done it."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"THE KEY INGREDIENTS 5 AKH-22 – HCO PL 14.9.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 97 17.11.12 ____________________ Thus one gets the points which are the true administrative points: 1. Observation even down to discovering the users and what is needed and wanted. 2. Planning which includes imaginative conception and intelligent timing, targeting and drafting of the plans so they can be communicated and assigned. 3. Communicating which includes receiving and understanding plans and their portion and relaying them to others so that they can be understood. 4. Supervision which sees that that which is communicated is done in actuality. 5. Production which does the actions or services which are planned, communicated and supervised. 6. Users by which the product or service or completed plan is used. ______________________ Administrative Systems or organizations which lack at least the rudiments of the above system will not bring off the dream and will accumulate an enormous lot of uncom-pleted actions. Not a few failures, bankruptcies, overthrows and revolutions have occurred because one or all of the above points were awry in an existing organization. The amount of heroic executive overwork which comes from the omission of one or more of these vital essential points accounts for the ulcers which are the occupational disease of those in charge. When some or all these points are awry or gone, an executive or ruler or his minister is reduced to an anxiety which can only watch for the symptoms of bankruptcy or attack or re-volt. Even if so reduced, an executive who fends off disaster while getting in a system which satisfies the above points has an enormously bettered chance of winning at long last. ______________________ The dual nature of an administrative system or an organization now becomes plain. Let us pry apart 1 and 2 above. The effort to hold an existing organization together is really different than trying to get a plan into actuality. In practice one has an organization of some sort. It has functions and it has local concerns and problems. And it has programmes and actions from past control centrals or which were locally generated. To push in upon this plans which, no matter how well conceived or intentioned, are additional to its load will cause a great deal of confusion, incomplete projects left dangling and general upset. To place new programmes into action, two prior actions are necessary A. Put in a whole new system paralleling the old existing system."},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"THE KEY INGREDIENTS 6 AKH-22 – HCO PL 14.9.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 98 17.11.12 B. Survey the old system and its existing programmes to preserve them, eradicate them or combine them with the new plans. To leave A and B undone is to court disaster. Whether one is aware of the old pro-grammes or the old organization or not they remain and will continue even if only as a pile of undone, unsorted papers nobody knows where to file or as a pile of odd unfinished ma-sonry some future generation can't identify or will identify with scorn of administrations in general. New leaders are sometimes looked upon as a worse scourge than a foreign enemy and new patterns of rule are often subjected to overthrow simply because they did not, out of ig-norance or laziness, do A and B above. One sometimes finds a company unit or a military officer left in some unheard of place for years, at continuing expense, guarding or nibbling at some project in a bewildered or philosophic fashion. The activity remained unremembered, unhandled when a new broom and new planners entered the scene. This can get so bad that a company or a nation's resources can be broken to bits. The old plans, disorganized, not known, discredited, are superseded by new plans and new ambi-tions. The old plans are in the road of the new plans and the new plans prevent old plans from completing. The result is an impasse. And the men in charge, even at the level of junior ex-ecutives, become even more puzzled and bewildered than the workers and begin to believe no new plans can ever be done, blame the ignorance of the populace and the cruelty of fate and give up. All they had to do was put in a complete new parallel system as in the 1 to 6 outline above for their new plans and to meanwhile preserve and continue the old system while they survey for preservation, eradication or combination of it. It is sometimes even good sense to continue old projects to completion currently with new projects just to maintain stability in the company or country and somehow find new finance and new people for the new plans. It is often far less costly than to simply confuse everything. Furthermore, all new and untried plans should have Pilot Projects which by test and use must be successful before one incorporates them and their new workers into the old sys-tem as a parallel dependable activity. A \"chicken in every pot\" as a campaign promise could easily succeed if organized as in 1 to 6 above. _______________________ There is a lot to organization. It requires trained administrators who can forward the programmes. But a \"trained\" administrator who does not grasp the principles of organization itself is only a clerk. At this current writing Man has not had administrative training centers where actual organization was taught. It was learned by \"experience\" or by working in an organization that"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"THE KEY INGREDIENTS 7 AKH-22 – HCO PL 14.9.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 99 17.11.12 was already functioning. But as the principles were not the same company to company and nation to nation, the differences of background experiences of any set of administrators dif-fered to such a degree that no new corps could be assembled as a team. Thus it was said to require a quarter to a half a century to make a company. But the number of ineffective bureaucracies and national failures which existed stated clearly that there were too few skilled administrators and too few training activities. Man's happiness and the longevity of companies and states apparently depend upon organizational know-how. Hiring specialized experts to get one out of trouble is a poor substi-tute for knowing what it is all about in the first place. Organization is actually a simple subject, based on a few basic patterns which if ap-plied produce success. If one would dream and see his dreams an actuality, one must also be able to organize and to train organizational men who will make those dreams come true. L.

This sequence is often altered in orgs and even in individuals. Be is first in the physi-cal universe, Do is second, Have is third. By getting it out of sequence a considerable confusion can be generated. A lot of riddles of human behaviour can be solved by realizing this goes out of se-quence or gets omissions. The Spanish peasant and the Spanish officials go to war at the drop of a straw. Their history is jammed with revolts. The peasant knows that if he is a peasant (be) and does his work (do) he should have. The Spanish official is stuck in be. He has so he can be and he doesn't have to do anything. Also a degree or title in Spain is a be and there is no do. So there is no have unless it comes from the peasant. The two altered cycles collide. Juvenile delinquency and shattered lives in the West stem directly from corruptions of this cycle. Children in the West are commonly asked \"What are you going to be when you grow up?\" It is a silly question and can drive any child up the wall. Because it's the wrong ques-tion-hits the wrong end of the cycle. He can't work out his personal org bd easily. He is also asked \"What are you going to do in life?\" That's just as bad. It is quite diffi-cult to answer. You have to do an org bd backwards-establish the product (have), find out what to do to achieve it and only then really can you accurately discover what one has to BE to accom-plish this. A lot of people and businesses fail because they don't do this. A beingness taken first all too often winds up in a doingness without any havingness resulting. If we asked children, \"What do you want to produce in life?\" we could probably get a workable answer. From that he could figure out what he'd have to do to produce that and from that he could know what he had to be. Then, with a little cooperation he would be able to lead a happy and valuable life."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"PLANNING BY PRODUCT 2 OS-13 – HCO PL 13.11.70 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 102 17.11.12 Concentrating on be, one finds him ready to be all right but then he stands around the next 50 years waiting for his havingness to fall out of the sky or slide to him via a welfare state. The above data, missing in society, contributes to juvenile delinquency, crime, the welfare state and a dying civilization. It is a wrong personal org bd to be only. So it is with an activity or company. What is the desired product that will also be desired by others? is the first question one asks in organizing. It must be answered before one can adjust or arrange finance or any org bd. Then one asks what has to be done to produce that? And there may be a lot of dones figured out and put in sequence. Now one can work on be. Thus you would have the basic ingredients of an org bd. Here is a common altered cycle: Mr. A has a Truck – have. He tries to figure out what to do with it. He works it around to try to make money. He would usually go broke. As he supposes he already has a product-a truck, and he needs a product – \"money\", he rarely backs it up to a be. Some people's \"think\" gets all involved in altered sequences or omissions of the be – do – have cycle. An activity has several final products. All of them must be worked out and considered. Then one can work out the sequence of dos (each with a product) in order to accomplish the final products. Only then can one work out the be. By omission or fixations on one of these points a person or an org can fail or perhaps never even get started. Fixation on do without any product in view leads to bored wandering through life. Mothers even know this one. \"Mama, what shall I do?\" is a long drawn refrain. Smart mamas often say \"make a cake\" or \"make mud pies\" or \"make a house\". Dumb ones say \"go and play and stop bothering me!\" Armies, with guard or death \"products\", get obsessed with do to a point where officers and non-coms will state \"get those men busy!\" No product. Meaningless, often frantic and useless do. It could be said that any developed traffic (Dev-T) comes from people who have no product. Immense bureaucracies can build up where there are no realized or stated products. Target policies and practice are successful because they state the desired product."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"PLANNING BY PRODUCT 3 OS-13 – HCO PL 13.11.70 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 103 17.11.12 Unless one organizes from the final product the organization can get unreal and use-less. Even Russia could learn this one. Their \"workers\" are all trying to get to the university where they can be. The Russian government was recently pleading with young people to be-come workers. But of course that's just another be that implies do. Russia has yet to realize her product was and is revolution. It's no wonder their main problem is how to feed and clothe and house their people. Unless an org or a person knows exactly what the final product is for the org or a post, there'll be a lot of busyness but not very much havingness for anyone. The answer is to figure out the final product and work back through the do of sub-projects and you will then materialize a real org, a real beingness. L.

The area has never before been examined or written up as a philosophic subject.) Plans are not targets. All manner of plans can be drawn and can be okayed. But this does not authorize their execution. They are just plans. When and how they will be done and by whom has not been established, scheduled or authorized. This is why planning sometimes gets a bad name. You could plan to make a million dollars but if when, how and who were not set as targets of different types, it just wouldn't happen. A brilliant plan is drawn as to how to con-vert Boston Harbour into a fuel tanker area. It could be on drawings with everything perfectly placed. One could even have models of it. Ten years go by and it has not been started much less completed. You have seen such plans. World's Fairs are full of them. One could also have a plan which was targeted – who, when, how – and if the targets were poor or unreal, it would never be completed. One can also have a plan which had no Conditional Target ahead of it and so no one really wanted it and it served no purpose really. It is unlikely it would ever be finished. Such a thing existed in Corfu. It was a half completed Greek theatre which had just been left that way. No one had asked the inhabitants if they wanted it or if it was needed. So even though very well planned and even partially targeted and half completed, there it is – half finished. And has remained that way. A plan, by which is meant the drawing or scale modeling of some area, project or thing, is of course a vital necessity in any construction and construction fails without it. It can even be okayed as a plan. But if it was not the result of findings of a Conditional Target (a survey of what's needed or feasible) it will be useless or won't fit in. And if no funds are allocated to it and no one is ordered to do it and if no scheduling of doing it exists, then, on each separate count it won't ever be done. One can define Planning as the overall target system wherein all targets of all types are set. That would be complete planning."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"PLANNING AND TARGETS 2 HCO PL 18.1.69 II EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 106 17.11.12 COMPLETE PLANNING To get a Complete Plan okayed one would have to show it as: (a) A result of a Conditional Target (survey of what's wanted and needed). (b) The details of the thing itself, meaning a picture of it or its scope plus the ease or difficulty in doing it and with what persons or materials. (c) Classification of it as Vital or simply useful. (d) The Primary Targets of it showing the organization needed to do it. (e) The Operating Targets showing its scheduling (even if scheduled not with dates but days or weeks) and dove-tailing with other actions. (f) Its cost and whether or not it will pay for itself or can be afforded or how much money it will make. Complete Planning would have to include the Targets and the Plan of the thing. Thus, by redefining words and assigning labels to target types we can get a better grip on this. A Plan would be the design of the thing itself. Complete Planning would be all the targets plus the design. Thus we see why some things don't come off at all and why they often don't get com-pleted even when planned. The Plan is not put forward in its Target framework and so is un-real or doesn't get done. Also it's a great way to lose or waste money. Sometimes a Conditional Target fails to ask what obstacles or opposition would be en-countered or what skills are available and so can go off the rails in that fashion. ______________________ The whole subject of Plans, Targets and target types is new in the realm of analyzed thought. It is a subject to \"get the feel of\" and \"learn to think concerning\" rather than a fully \"canned\" subject. But if these points are grasped, then one sees the scope of the subject and can become quite brilliant and achieve things hitherto out of reach or never thought of before. L.

It is minor to that level but major to our operations. The reason we are fought where we are fought is contained in its major part in Pur-poses. Purposes often fail and wind up in stop. Stopped purposes can then be dramatized. In Scientology we use (quite correctly) freedom. While not the most basic purpose to be free is a common purpose to all thetans. This tends to key in (restimulate), in some persons, the stop of being free. They them-selves wanted to be free. They were stopped, they dramatize the stop of being free and try then to stop us. We restimulated (keyed in) their own purpose to be free or free others and where we are opposed the person or persons dramatizes the stop or disagreement. Also where we not only restimulate the stop but oppose and deny him as well, we get an enemy. We are then stopping stoppers. While this is necessary to save the day, it is prevent-able if begun early enough. The psychiatrist is not the only \"freedom stopper\" we will ever meet. Many people who have been in healing and mental treatment in the times before we came along had only failures. So anything offered to them (including their own) will be looked on as a failure at best or at worst a fraud. That it really can be done in Scientology is not only outside their reality but regener-ated the failed purpose they have had to be free and free others and they dramatize stop.

Establishing something that produces. (Product 1) 2. Operating that which produces in order to obtain a product. (Product 2) 3. Repairing or correcting that which produces. (Product 3) 4. Repairing or correcting that which is produced. (Product 4) Example: A typewriter is manufactured and located on a desk. This is establishing something that produces as in (1). A typist operates or runs the typewriter which thus pro-duces typed sheets, stencils, etc which are the product produced. This satisfies (2) above. The typewriter from various causes eventually requires repair in order to continue to produce. This satisfies (3). The correction of things typed would satisfy (4). These are the four basic products involved in production. Thus there are really four basic products necessary to a production activity. These are: 1. The established machine. 2. The machine's product. 3. The corrected machine. 4. The corrected product. That makes a minimum of 4 products for any production cycle. Three major factors govern every product. These are: A. Quantity B. Quality C. Viability Quantity would be an acceptable, expected or useful volume. Quality would be the degree of perfection of a product. Viability would be the longevity, usefulness and desirability of the product."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"THE ANALYSIS OF ORGANIZATION 2 OS-10 – HCO PL 29.10.70 BY PRODUCT EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 110 17.11.12 As each product in the four listed above has three factors in each product, there are then 12 major points (4 x 3) regulating production. Product I – Establishing the typewriter, contains: (i) The quantity of typewriters established. (ii) The quality of the typewriters established. (iii) The viability of the typewriters established. Product 2 – The product of the typewriter (typed things) also has three: (iv) The quantity of the typed things. (v) The quality of the typed things. (vi) The viability of the typed things. Product 3 – The repair of the typewriter itself also has three factors: (vii) The quantity (amount) of the repair. (viii) The quality of the repair. (ix) The viability of the repair. Product 4 – The correction of the thing produced. (x) The quantity (amount) of the corrected product. (xi) The quality of the corrected product. (xii) The viability of the corrected product. Thus to get a product \"typed things\" there are actually 12 separate factors. This applies to all machinery. For instance there is the generator that produces and there is the thing (electricity) produced by the generator. There is the repaired generator. And there is the corrected electricity (such as reducing its voltage or converting it). Now if you did not know that you were handling 12 factors in producing electricity the tendency would be to \"just run the generator\" and ignore the actual factors governing produc-tion. The results of this would be total operation only. The generator would soon go to pieces. The electricity furnished would vary all over the place and blow out other equipment. There would be no funds to repair or replace the generator when it broke down. By paying little attention to products (as the wog world often does) or by shifting their importances – giving total importance to running it – there would soon be no viability at all. The end result would be 2 wrong products – scrap metal that was once a generator and no electricity. Now, surprise, surprise! An organization composed of people is influenced by these same things!

Instead of the desired final product which is offered and sold and delivered, we get scrap paper and insolvency. To establish an org one has to put one there. This requires a desirable and economic product of the org envisioned, the technology of making the final product, the technology of making and handling the org, the procurement of a location, recruitment, an org bd, hats, and training and the equipment and materiel needed to produce the final product and the obtaining of the raw materiel to make the final product. Thus established, it must be done so that: (i) The amount of org is created proportionate to its final product demand. (ii) The quality of the org itself – shabby, posh, active or lazy, etc. (iii) The viability of the org (how long will it last economically, how will it expand, does income exceed out-go, etc). The Product of the org itself is regulated by: (iv) The quantity of product produced (which must be of sufficient volume to satisfy de-mand). (v) The quality of the org's product or products, (which must be adequate to satisfy those requiring and paying for the production). (vi) The viability of the org's product (how long does it last and is it adequate for its value). The Repair of the org itself must be: (vii) The quantity or amount of repair necessary to make the org functional (which may amount to simply giving it a new letterhead or rebuilding the whole place, nearly the establishing product again). (viii) The quality or expertness of the repair, (a bad one could destroy the place). (ix) The viability of the repair (if the right why is handled the repair as a product will last a long time and if a wrong reason for decline is handled the place will just cave in again). The correction of the org's product to obtain a uniformly satisfactory product: (x) The quantity (proportion) of the org's product that has to be corrected (which might require, if too high, the repair of some part of the org itself).

All these factors must be consulted."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"THE ANALYSIS OF ORGANIZATION 4 OS-10 – HCO PL 29.10.70 BY PRODUCT EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 112 17.11.12 ANALYSIS If one understands these factors and realizes they are all present in running an egg beater or the world's biggest oil company, one will not be groping around in rags. A checklist of the 12 factors influencing the 4 major products can be made up and each point as it relates to an org can be studied about a particular org. One has here the basics. From these there can arise a near infinity of lesser items. When one does not know these basics one flounders endlessly while attempting to handle a post, a portion of an org or the whole org. One gets into a frantic correct the errors and out-points or goes into apathy as he has no guidelines. However, using these basics, one can easily check them off and so see what he has to do to more closely approach the ideal. ____________________ In Dianetics and Scientology, for example, the final pc product of Flag auditors trained on the same HCOBs as field auditors, on rougher pcs, is infinitely better than the pc-product elsewhere. This is a puzzle. The clue is not in auditing at all. It lies in an earlier product – training. A Class VI or a Class VIII auditor on Flag was trained (a) more rapidly (amounting to as little as 1/6th of the time in an org) and (b) more honestly and (c) the Flag auditor is ex-pertly corrected as a product when he begins to audit until the auditing product is perfect. The training (quantity, and lasting quality) on the course is better and the training extends to train-ing on post until the auditor's product (the auditing of the pc and the pc) need little or no product correction. The equivalent used to be required HGC training – on post training – for a staff auditor to become a staff auditor. In no org did auditors go fresh from school into audit-ing with no further training. This went out in some orgs. The product \"corrected auditor\" be-came a missing product. Thus Flag auditing produces a better product as that product – cor-rected auditor – exists on Flag. This is given to show the use of the product factors. Where any of these products or factors are missing, the viability of the whole is shaken. By using them the whole becomes viable. L.

The support usually adds up to food, clothing, shelter, money, tolerance and cooperation (good will). On an individual basis this is easy to grasp. The individual produces a product or products which, flowed into the dept, div, org, company, community, state, nation or planet, then returns to him his pay and good will or at least sufficient good will to prevent his aban-donment or destruction. Long-range survival of the individual is attained in this fashion. A valuable final product (VFP) is valuable because it is potentially or factually ex-changeable. The key word in this sense is exchangeable. And exchangeability means outside, with something outside the person or activity. A valuable final product could as easily be named a valuable exchangeable product. Sanity and insanity are matters of motive, not rationality or competence. The sane are constructive, the insane are destructive. Thus insanity on the part of the potential receiver of a VFP can prevent an exchange of a final product the receiver should be able to use and for which he should be willing to give active support and good will to the producer. Example: Man starving; you try to sell him good food at reasonable price for which he has money to pay. He tries to shoot you and destroy the food. This is insanity since he is trying to destroy the product he needs and can afford. Crime is the action of the insane or the action of attempting seizure of product without support. Example: Robbers who do not support a community seek to rob from it supporting funds. Fraud is the attempt to obtain support without furnishing a product. Sanity and honesty then consist of producing a valuable final product for which one is then recompensed by support and good will, or in reverse flow, supporting and giving good will to the producer of the product."},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"VALUABLE FINAL PRODUCTS 2 OS-26 – HCO PL 25.3.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 114 17.11.12 Ethical basics, morale, social subjects, law, all are based on this principle of the valu-able final product. Previously it has been \"instinctive\" or \"common sense.\" It has not before been stated. Civilizations which facilitate production and interchange and inhibit crime and fraud are then successful. Those that do not, perish. Persons who wish to destroy civilizations promote departures from these basic rules of the game. Methods of corrupting fair interchange are numerous. The Factors are the first appearance of these principles. The theory of the valuable final product is an extension of the Factors. Parts of organizations or organizations, towns, states and countries all follow the prin-ciples which apply to the individual. The survival or value of any section, department, division or org is whether or not it follows these principles of interchange. The survival or value of any town, state or country follows these principles of inter-change. You can predict the survival of any activity by confirming its interchange regularities or can predict its downfall by irregularities in this interchange. Therefore it is vital that a person or a section, department, division or part of an org or an org figure out exactly what it is interchanging. It is producing something that is valuable to the activity or activities with which it is in communication and for that it is obtaining support. If it is actually producing valuable final products then it is entitled to support. If on the other hand it is only organizing or hoping or PRing and is not producing an interchangeable commodity or commodities in volume or quality for which support can be elicited and even demanded, it will not be viable. It doesn't matter how many orders are issued or how well org boards are drawn or beautiful the plans to produce are made. The hard fact of production remains the dominant fact. How well organized things are increases production volume and improves quality and thus can bring about viability. But it is the valuable final product there and being interchanged that determines basic survival. Lack of viability can always be traced to the volume and quality of an actual valuable final product. Hope of a product has a short-term value that permits an activity to be built. But when the hope does not materialize, then any hoped for viability also collapses. One then must organize back from the actually produced product. For instance, a technical subject is capable of producing an exact result."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"VALUABLE FINAL PRODUCTS 3 OS-26 – HCO PL 25.3.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 115 17.11.12 If persons are trained to actually produce the result and the result is produced then one can exchange the technicians with the community for support. If the result is produced (by training the technicians well) then the result can be inter-changed with an individual for support and good will. Where any of these factors suffer in volume or quality then an interchange is difficult and viability becomes uncertain. As individuals, communities and states are not necessarily sane, upsets can occur in the interchange even when production is occurring. Therefore the producer has a stake in maintaining the sanity of the scene in which he is operating, and one of his valuable final products is a scene in which production and inter-change can occur. The basics of valuable final products are true for any industrial or political, or eco-nomic system. Many systems attempt to avoid these basics and the end result would be disaster. The individual, section, department, division, org or country that is not producing something valuable enough to interchange will not be supported for long. It is as simple as that. L.

This is Name, want and get your product. Breaking this down into its parts we find that the most common failure of any Product Officer or staff member or Purchaser lies in the first item, name your product! On org boards and even for sections, one has products listed. Departments have valu-able final products. Every staff member has one or more products. If production is not occurring, the ability to name the product is probably miss-ing. Misunderstood post titles were collected once on a wide survey. Whenever it was found a staff member did not seem to be able to do his job, it was checked whether he knew the definition of the word-or words-that made up his post title. It was found, one for one, that he could not define it even though no unusual or special definition was being requested. In other words, the first thing about the post could not be defined-the post title. This may seem incredible, but only until you yourself check it out on staff that habitually goof. The ability to name the product required goes further than a mere, glib definition. Some engineers once drove a Purchaser halfway up the wall by glibly requesting \"one dozen bolts.\" The Purchaser kept bringing back all different thicknesses and lengths and types of bolts. The Purchaser was going daffy and so were the engineers. Until the engineers were forced to exactly name what they were seeking by giving it all its name. The Purchaser trying to purchase could not possibly obtain his product without being able to fully name it. Once this was done, nothing was easier. A Product Officer can ask, beg, plead, yell for his product. But maybe he isn't naming it! Maybe he isn't naming it fully. And maybe even he doesn't know the name of it.

Where no real or valuable production is occurring, one has to ask the question, does the Product Officer really want the product he is demanding? And does the staff member or members he is dealing with want the product? The reason that a psychotic or otherwise evilly intentioned person cannot achieve any-thing as a Product Officer or staff member is that he does not want the product to occur. The intentions of psychos are aimed at destruction and not at creation. Such persons may say they want the product but this is just \"PR\" and a cover for their real activities. People who are PTS (potential trouble sources by reason of connections with people antagonistic to what they are doing in life) are all too likely to slide into the valence of the antagonistic person who definitely would not want the product. Thus, in an org run by or overloaded with destructive persons or PTS persons, you see a very low level of production if you see any at all. And the production is likely to be what is called \"an overt product,\" meaning a bad one that will not be accepted or cannot be traded or exchanged and has more waste and liability connected with it than it has value. One has to actually want the product he is asking for or is trying to produce. There may be many reasons he does not, none of which are necessarily connected with being psy-cho. But if it is a creative and valuable product and assists his and the survival of others and he still does not want it, then one should look for PTSness or maybe even a bit of psychosis. And at the least, some withholds. One does not have to be in a passionate mystic daze about wanting the product.

All science and technology is built around this single point in the key phrase \"Name, want and get your product.\" Managers and scientists specialize in the how to get part of it and very often neglect the rest. There are many Product Officers who do not know enough about organization to or-ganize things so they actually get their product. These, all too often, cover up their ignorance on how to organize or their inability to do so by saying to one and all \"Don't organize, just produce!\" When you hear this you can suspect that the person saying it actually does not know the tech or know-how of organizing or how to put an organization together. He may not even know enough about organizing to shove aside other paper on his desk when he is trying to spread out and read a large chart-yet that is simple organization. A bricklayer would look awfully silly trying to lay no-bricks. He hasn't got any bricks. Yet there he is going through the motions of laying bricks. It takes a certain economic and purchasing and transport tech to get the bricks delivered-only then can you lay bricks. A manager looks pretty silly trying to order a brick wall built when he doesn't have any bricks or bricklayer and provides no means at all of obtaining either one. A Product Officer may be great at single-handing the show. How come? He doesn't realize that building a show comes before one runs it. And even though economics demand at least a small show before one builds a large show, a very bad Product Officer who can't really organize either, will, instead of making the small show bigger, make the small show smaller by trying to run a no-show. There is a how of organization. It is covered pretty well in the Org Series and else-where. Like you can't put in comm lines unless you put in terminals for them to connect with. Like you can't get particles flowing in a profitable way unless they have something for them to run on. That's simply the way things go in the universe in which you are operating.

The tech of how to produce something can be pretty vast. One doesn't have to be a to-tal expert on it to be able to manage the people doing it, but one has to have a pretty good idea of how it goes and know enough not to stop the guys who do know how to make bricks when one wants bricks. If the product is to get somebody to come in to see you, then you have to have some means of communication and some tech of persuasion to make him want to come in to see you. Brute force may seem okay to cops but in organization it seldom works. There is more tech to it than that. If a Product Officer does not know there is tech involved in getting the product, then he will never make his staff study it or teach anybody to do it. And he will wind up with no product. So beware the Product Officer who won't give time off for hatting! He doesn't know one has to know the tech of getting his product. What do you think the OEC (Org Exec Course) Volumes and the technical bulletins are all about? One has to spend some time organizing in many different ways-the organization itself, the hatting, the technical skill staff members would have to have, to get anywhere in getting a product. Sure, if you only organize and never produce you never get a product either. But if you only produce and never organize. the only brick wall you'll ever see is the one you run into. L.

Dianetics and Scientology have never suffered from lack of programmes. There have always been programmes. And there will always be better programmes and maybe for dis-semination purposes, the perfect programme. But what happens to all these programmes? Alas, I found out the facts of this some years ago, and out of it came the organizational pattern which is working so splendidly in Central Orgs. But the facts that I found out all had to do with execution of programmes. We get a wonderful idea. It's a slayer. It will tear the tops right off the skyscrapers and send them in for a book. And months later we wonder what happened to this marvellous pro-gramme. Well, I'll tell you what happened. Nobody did it. That's the swansong of almost every programme that gets thought up. It was great, but nobody did it... And before you think I'm being critical of all the Staffs, I'll give you the rest of my findings on this subject. Programmes didn't get done because everybody was so overloaded with what they were already doing that they didn't have a chance to start the new programme no matter how good it was. Programmes were already in the run. Many of these were so fundamental – such as sale of books or answering letters to incoming preclears and students – that nobody could start on the new programme. And as a result the new programme didn't get started no matter how marvellous it seemed to be. The reason Executives used to keep pulling people off post all the time was this thing programming. The Executive had, he thought, a better idea or was trying to carry out an old idea. And to get it going he would draft the whole staff to do it and the basic programmes would go begging."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"PROGRAMMING 2 HCO PL 23.10.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 124 17.11.12 Do you know that nearly every function of a Central Org was at one time a brand new wonderful programme? Well, it was. And this gradually sifting out of activities brought us to a rather final form with one more step to go and that step is programmes, a Department of Programmes. A Department which can carry through new or stunt programmes without bring-ing the whole place in ruins by tearing everybody off their standard programmes. Programming is important enough to pay a lot of attention to. And there is a lot of gen about it. And the gen all adds up to no matter how many programmes you have, each one con-sists of certain parts. And if you don't assemble those parts and run the programme in an or-derly fashion, it just won't spark off. These are some of the principles about programmes. And you had better have them because your new HAS Co-Audit Course is a programme and has to be done like a successful programme. And your preclears are a programme and have to be done like a programme. If you don't know these facts of life, here they are: Maxim One: Any idea no matter if badly executed is better than no idea at all. Maxim Two: A programme to be effective must be executed. Maxim Three: A programme put into action requires guidance. Maxim Four: A programme running without guidance will fail and is better left undone. If you haven't got the time to guide it, don't do it: put more steam behind exist-ing programmes because it will flop. Maxim Five: Any programme requires some finance. Get the finance into sight before you start to fire, or have a very solid guarantee that the programme will pro-duce finance before you execute it. Maxim Six: A programme requires attention from somebody. An untended programme that is everybody's child will become a juvenile delinquent. Maxim Seven: The best programme is the one that will reach the greatest number of dy-namics and will do the greatest good on the greatest number of dynamics. And that, my people who want to become victims by going broke, includes dynamic one as well as dynamic four. Maxim Eight: Programmes must support themselves financially. Maxim Nine: Programmes must accumulate interest and bring in other assistance by vir-tue of the programme interest alone or they will never grow. Maxim Ten: A programme is a bad programme if it detracts from programmes which are already moving successfully or distracts staff people or associates from work they are already doing. Doing that is adding up to successful execution of other programmes. Let us now take a squint at this all in one piece. Wrong example: We decide to run an ad in the Hatmakers' Weekly to attract people into the PE Course. We place the ad. We forget the time this special course is to start. We have nobody there to answer the phone on inquiries on the Course. We have nobody there to greet the people and make them feel at home when"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"PROGRAMMING 3 HCO PL 23.10.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 125 17.11.12 they arrive. We have nobody to instruct the Course. We get a bill for monies three weeks later that we can't pay. Right example: We decide to hit the hatmaker trade as a source of PE. We rule out seven other programmes in favour of this one. We have a staff meeting on it and gen every-body in on the existence of this programme. We see that we have made a lot of money from Co-Audit enrolments and we earmark this to pay for the advert, for the salary of the person who will run the programme. We appoint a special person to administer this programme. When the advert has been placed and appears, our person appointed to it goes on to it full time. Reception is genned again to send all hatmaker calls to this person and to refer to this person all hatmaker bodies. All persons who may also be acting as Reception are genned with this data. The person appointed doesn't sit back to wait for the business to come in. This per-son reaches for hatmakers with letters and phone calls. This same person that has been con-tacted by the hatmakers is then on deck the zero hour evening to greet them all and get them into their seats and make sure the instructor is there and to instruct it himself if no instructor appears. If the programme is sweepingly successful in terms of new enrollees, then we make sure we leave the person appointed for it in the first place right on duty pushing hatmakers into the PE. And we have a programme. And it was successful. And we got somewhere. A pitiful wrong example of the above was when I was running the first Am College PE as the experimental set-up some years ago. We started to get in longshoremen by the squad. And they brought in other longshoremen. The person in charge thought longshoremen were low cast and tried to get intellectuals instead, thus switching off the programme. You never saw a programme dwindle quite so fast as the longshoremen did. The correct action would have been to notice that longshoremen were responding heavily and to put somebody maybe even out of their ranks onto the payroll to pressure away at longshoremen. A million pound programme was let go up in a puff of nowhere. A wonderfully right example is the Director of Processing staff auditor set-up of a Central Organization. That was once just a programme. It prospered. It's still with us. Every field auditor looks at it with envy and snarls and tries to copy it. But he doesn't programme. He is doing everything else in the shop. He can't programme a special clinic drill with his attention everywhere at once. It's now thoroughly against the law in a Central Organization to let a Director of Processing take preclears. That's how far it goes. And we get wonderful re-sults and all is well and the only squawks you hear about HGCs are from pure green-eyed jealousy or maybe an occasional real goof that the Central Organization jumped on days be-fore anybody else did. Programming requires execution. It requires carry-through. It requires judgement enough to know a good programme and carry it on and on and to recognize a bad one and drop it like hot bricks. There's nothing wrong with the will to do amongst Scientologists. Now let's see if we can't up dissemination by adherence to good, steady programming that wins. L.

Financial Planning is a vital part of management. Good financial estimations and the ability to figure out without vast accounting the way things are in an org is an ability which is vital to good management. The manager, given a few vital facts, who then needs an accountant to tell him how things are, is of course incompetent. Management is a high skill. Socialist or worker governments are flat on their uppers because they do not comprehend the degree of insight required in a successful manager. When they harass, mess up and sometimes shoot their managers they promptly begin eras of starvation as in Russia, China and to some extent under their socialisms, in recent years, Eng-land and the US. The amount of time any manager has to spend in the US or England battling with government clerks who aren't skilled enough to run a tricycle, assisted, is easily a third of the manager's time. The essence of good management is caring what goes on. The worker-oriented fellow cares for the worker but not for the organisation. So we have a final extinction of the worker by the organisation vanishing and no longer able to employ. The consequence is the wide-spread depression just beginning. Real help for the worker is also making sure there will be work for him to do. When the organisation is gone, there is only misery, the dole, revolution and sudden death. The \"worker-oriented\" manager lacks the insight into the skill necessary to manage. So to him an organisation is something to be bled. It is a bottomless pit of money. Such a person's total \"skill\" is how to get something out of the organisation. But you can't take out more than comes in. Management is entirely beyond the ability of such people. They don't know what it is all about. They do not care what happens to the organisation. Then sud-denly the machinery all stops and everyone starves. Whole countries go this way when the mess begins. The basic difference between organisations that run and those that collapse is simply somebody caring what happens to the organisation itself. A good manager takes care of the workers. He also takes care of the organisation. A worker-oriented fellow-union leader, agitator, do-gooder-cares only for the worker and thus does the worker in. So he is actually a suppressive. For the whole bang shoot goes to pieces"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"GOOD VS BAD MANAGEMENT 2 HCO PL 10.11.66 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 130 17.11.12 and the end product is dismal unemployment, depression, malnutrition, starvation. You have to have lived through such a period to learn dread of it. And that's what caring nothing for the organisation finally results in. A worker-oriented person is deficient in pan-determinism. He or she cannot see that the health of all demands he take into account workers and the org. Therefore he or she is below the ability to determine both sides of things and so makes a very poor executive, being lop-sided, given to \"them and us\", playing favourites and unable to see two sides of a ques-tion. Such abilities are vital in an executive, so he isn't one. A worker-oriented person is not nice to individual workers-he or she may shoot them-but only about collective \"workers\". Poor source identification goes with lack of pan-determinism so a person cannot see or solve the real problems around. So such people can't even operate as executives. Thus you can know them. The org or country always fails. So you want to watch this \"poor-worker\" pitch in an executive. If he cares only for the worker and nothing for the org, if he is only interested in what he or the workers can get out of an organisation, then you are looking at somebody who in the long run will put one and all on the street. You see here and there bared teeth at the org or the idea of the org. Along with it, if you look, you will find a heavy carelessness about the org's money and property and also a heavy effort to get something for the workers. Here you have a full-bodied case. This person won't ever succeed and should never be an executive. Never. For he'll do the workers in. A good manager cares what happens, what's spent, what prosperity can occur, how the work is done, how the place looks, how the staff really fares. He is dedicated to getting the show on the road and he takes out of the line-up obstacles to the org's (and staff's) progress. Caring what goes on and not caring is the basic difference. Caring for something else while working is the mark of the labourer, not the executive. If you have to start an economy drive, look for the people who fight it. Quietly remove them from executive posts. You have a labourer, steeped privately in \"us-poor-workers\" and \"get what you can\" and \"spend the org out the window\". If you care what happens to the org and the size of the pay check as well you will be very careful to develop an insight into finance, efficiency and the state of the org. If you see bills owed soaring above cash on hand, you will also see executives who care nothing for the org. They are worker-oriented, anti-org people and you had better put a thumb down on continuing them as executives. Along with that unfavourable graph you will also find demands to borrow money, sell assets to pay bills and a near refusal to promote or make money. I have learned all this the hard way. I pass it on for what it is worth. I can say these things because no man on Earth could seriously challenge me for not caring about people or staffs. I do care. And the ultimate in caring is to make sure there is an org there."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"GOOD VS BAD MANAGEMENT 3 HCO PL 10.11.66 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 131 17.11.12 So please be alert to these points in conducting Ad Council meetings. Inevitably the hardest job is financial planning. But in that sphere you will show up the executives and the labourers. Watch and when you find you have a worker-oriented person there, realize you don't have an executive. Get one. SUMMARY Bad management is therefore detectable on these points: 1. The Bills-Cash ratio will be high in bills and low in cash. 2. There is an effort to borrow money rather than earn it. 3. There is a heavy effort to sell assets rather than make money. 4. There is more effort to collect debts, particularly from seniors, than to make new in-come. 5. There will be an effort to be supported. 6. There will be low affinity in the org for the org and its public. 7. There will be protest and flash-back at efforts to get them solvent. 8. There will be non-compliance with orders of senior management. The remedy is to: A. Find the most worker-oriented senior executive and remove him or her. B. Find the anti-org executives and staff and remove them. C. Put in the senior posts those who most care what happens to the org. D. Enjoin and conduct careful financial planning and measures. E. Remove from executive posts those who object to them or don't comply (that may have been missed in A and B). F. Resurrect neglected orders and main programmes and get them complied with. G. Be exceedingly careful not to appoint people there in the future who don't care what happens to the org. It does not much matter how one goes about this. If one wants the org and its staff to prosper, the above measures must be done and quickly when the Bills-Cash ratio of an org threatens the continuance of it and the staff their jobs. L.

Why? Because the head of a div or org or the Product Officer of the org is the one who gets other people to work. If the Product Officer is not hatted to get people to work there will be no products, the stats will be very low and that EstO could be very mystified and look bad as an EstO. For if he does not do this one thing first then whatever else he does will be wasted. An EstO who gets drawn in and given orders by a Div head or who cannot confront the Div head will wind up withdrawing from the Div or just being inactive. The first major failure of an EstO would be a failure to hat the Product Officer of the org or div. First Situation: There is no head of Div (or org). Correct Action: Get a head of Div (or org) fast and rapidly org board the Div. The number of people in the Div (or org) does not matter at this stage. First things first. Get a head of Div (or org). And rapidly org bd the place. Second Situation: You have a head of Div (or org). Correct Action: Hat him with HCO P/L 28 July 71 Admin Know-How No. 26. Tell him you will attend to the hatting if he will get them producing. He is responsible for their production. Get him to know this P/L. (Method 4 WC.) Tell him he is in Phase L So let's see some Production. Third Situation: The head of Div or org flies about, looks busy or just sits there. He is not getting out production. He will tell you all about \"not being hatted\" \"doesn't know the tech\" on and on, excuses excuses. But no production from him or staff. Correct Action: He has to be made to understand that he isn't doing his job no matter how busy he looks or how many reasons he has. He probably has not noticed and does not know that he is faking work. People with low confront don't see. If he is really doing his job and getting out his products and forcing any staff to get out theirs, you have a pearl. Cherish him, and don't consider doing this third action on him. But one is easily fooled. Only real products tell the tale. A busy exec or division is not necessarily a producing exec or div. So if no products from him or staff for whatever reason, he's below Danger. You don't have a head of div or org if you don't have products coming off and exchange occurring. Only these, not excuses or motions, tell the tale. You can get \"PR\" and glowing (but false) reports. You can get all sorts of things. But where"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"HATTING THE PRODUCT OFFICER 2 ESTO-16 – HCO PL 24.04.72 OF THE DIVISION EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 134 17.11.12 are the products? So you bait (tease) and badger (nag) the head of div (or org) to impinge on him (draw his attention) until he snarls or cries or screams and spits out an outpoint. You don't ask him like repetitive commands \"Why aren't you working?\" You ask in many ways \"Where are the products?\" And he'll eventually tell you an outpoint. Like \"But I can't get out any products because they aren't products until they are back home telling people how good we are so how can I _________.\" Or \"I just keep running around here and nothing happens.\" Or some other nonsense that is nonsense. That's his Why. So you tell him, \"Look, you don't get out products because you don't think you can!\" Or \"You are just trying to look busy so you won't be thought idle.\" And if you're smart and on the ball, that will be it. The Exec will cognite and go into smooth 2WC at once and you got him out of the EstO P/L Series 13 state into a confront. This is \"Bait and Badger\" to get him broken out of non-confronting. That's all that's wrong with him really. He doesn't look. Situation Four: The Exec won't let an EstO near him. Snaps, snarls. Don't avoid him. Correct Action: Bait and badger. He's already half way through Situation Three above. Finish it up. Situation Five: The Exec goes into shock. This is a symptom of no confront. He won't fight back. He will propitiate. But he won't do anything either. Correct Action: Get a new exec. Tame execs who won't fight and can't work will never get a staff to work. After getting a new exec, salvage the old one with processing. Do steps one to four on the new one. Situation Six: Having gotten the original or a new exec this far, you will find he is usually outpointy in his actions even if producing. Correct Action: Run Confront in his area. Run reach and withdraw in his area. Then product clear him on every section and department he has as though he's the head of it. Situation Seven: Gets out volume but quality suffers. This is a general non-confront. Correct Action: Bring him personally up through each dynamic, through the conditions per EstO Series No. 14. Get him in normal or higher on each dynamic. Now do Dynamic Ex-change, EstO Series No. 14. Situation Eight: He is active, producing but isn't forcing staff to produce. Correct Ac-tion: Recheck him on HCO P/L 28 July 71 Admin Know-How 26 and look for a Why that he can't pull himself out of Phase I into Phase 11. Get this VGIed. Tell him \"Preach to them that dones come from effective doingness. If they don't do things that are effective they will not get a done. Demand Dones.\" Situation Nine: He really doesn't know his job. Correct Action: Begin to Hat him. Don't start hatting him further than an instant hat before you have worked it up to situation eight. His confront will not be good enough to apply the material even if he knows it. So only at this stage do you start to really hat. And at this stage you hat by observing what he doesn't know that he needs to know and you look up and select P/Ls that fit his current state of unhat-tedness and check him out on only these. You keep a log of what he's checked out on so he gets credit for it. Situation Ten: The Executive skids back. He roller-coasters or gets ill. Correct Ac-tion: Recognize this as a PTS situation. Get him Interviewed by the D of P. Get the PTS situa-"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"HATTING THE PRODUCT OFFICER 3 ESTO-16 – HCO PL 24.04.72 OF THE DIVISION EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 135 17.11.12 tion handled and don't buy \"It's just the flu\" or whatever. He's PTS and that's trouble. (See HCOB 17 Apr 72 C/S Series 76.) Situation Eleven: The Exec does not seem to remember what he's been checked out on or apply what he knows. He is glib or he is foggy. Correct Action: Get him Word Cleared Method 1. Then Word Clear him Method 4 on the materials he has covered. (See Word Clear-ing Series HCOBs.) HOW MUCH TIME How much time do you spend with an Exec? Well, effective or not his time is valuable. Do not use peak load post time or he'll be going mad with the PTP of unhandled ac-tions needing to be done. So you won't get anywhere. Try to do these actions on an exec during his Study Time. Observe him on post to know what to do in his study time. If he has no study time, you must get the Study Correction List (HCOB 14 Jan 72 Study Series 7) done on him and Handled as in Situation Thirteen. An Exec who can't study can't see either. If this conflicts with your own study time, make other arrangements for that portion of yours. But get yours IN too. Situation Twelve: Has study time in addition to working hours but does not study. Correct Action: See that Study Time is run per \"What is a Course\" HCO P/L 16 Mar 71 and \"WHAT IS A COURSE – HIGH CRIME\" HCO P/L 16 Mar 72 and LRH ED 174 INT 72. Situation Thirteen: Even though Staff Course exists does not study. Correct Action: Have a Study Corr List HCOB 14 Jan 72 Study Series 7 done and properly handled. REST OF STAFF What do you do with the rest of staff? These Thirteen Situations cover as well any staff member. You could do no worse than do these things on each one as beginning actions. There are many EstO actions that can be done but if you don't get these done you won't get far. But on staff below Dept head, Situations One, Two and Eight do not apply. Situation One Staff: Major post not posted. Correct Action: Force a Dept One into ex-istence via the Exec EstO and get it producing staff and get the post posted. (Don't do an in-"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"HATTING THE PRODUCT OFFICER 4 ESTO-16 – HCO PL 24.04.72 OF THE DIVISION EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 136 17.11.12 correct action and use other parts of the org as personnel pools and dismantle working instal-lations or rob tech.) Get the org bd up and the person on it. Situation Two Staff: You have a person on the post. Correct Action: Instant Hat him. Get him programmed for training for post. Unbug his study time. See that he studies per Pgm. Situation Eight Staff: He is active and producing but isn't moving his products or is backlogging and/or gets in jams. Correct Action: Volume 0 of OEC Course, get in its Comm Sections, drill him on Org Bd and show him the other terminals he is supposed to be in Comm with. Make him follow his product physically through lines and then make him follow the routes of things that should come to him. While doing this you will find bugs in the lines or in his own lines. Smooth them out. Drill the person further. THIS P/L AS A CHECKLIST You can use this P/L as a checklist. Get a cardboard folder. Put the person's name on it. Write the person's name in at the top of this P/L. When each action is done, mark the dates it is being worked on in the margin beside the situation with your initial. When fully done mark it Done with date. Beware of Not Dones or Half Dones or Backlogs. (See Admin Know-How 29, Executive Series 5, both are HCO P/L 26 Jan 72 Issue 1.) Don't skip about on this one. The general why of inactivity or non-production is: Low Condition on one or more Dynamics making a non-alignment with other Dynamics causing an inability to confront. Most beings are not there as a being as they are below existence. As a being plus body they have social responses and can do orders or will do at something when attention is called to it. Otherwise they are blind with their eyes wide open. They are not malicious. They just don't see. If they are not there they won't have to be responsible for what they do, will they? They do not think they have lived before or will live again, which is Why the population is fixed on a one life idea. As a result the above situations do occur. And the handling has been tested and works. Do not say \"Why haven't you seen _\" this or that outness. Say \"Do you see this _\" out-ness. And they will look in that direction. But sometimes have to be shown further evidence. Then they see it. Until the above situations are handled, you are working with social machin-ery."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"HATTING THE PRODUCT OFFICER 5 ESTO-16 – HCO PL 24.04.72 OF THE DIVISION EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 137 17.11.12 When you have handled these situations as above correctly as noted, you will get to-ward full application of HCO P/L 5 May 1959 \"Policy on Sec Eds and Hats\" Page 64, Vol 0 of OEC. Call the above \"Correct Actions\" the Modern Processes plus many other EstO ac-tions and you can bring the Exec to cause so that he creates his post. Until you have handled, using his social machinery as per the Situation handlings above, he is not being bad, he just can't see. This is how you get an Exec functioning. It is no overt act to get him functioning as only until you do will he have any morale at all. Situation Fourteen: An Exec or staff member may try to use the EstO as an Org Offi-cer or to get the EstO to get involved in the division's products. Both are fatal EstO errors. Correct Action: Explain EstO functions to them briefly so they know the EstO's product is them. L.

Thus he can always do one thing very effectively: He can unjam it at the top. Old time business efficiency experts sometimes knew that the jam was at the top but considered this meant it was necessary to retrain the top man and this being infeasible and unpopular, went down into the plant to do time-motion studies. As it remained jammed at the top the firm seldom got more efficient. Many tales are told about how the top needed retraining, was old fashioned and ham-pered things and almost none of them were true. All organizations that are surviving at all are driven directly from the top or by a strata of executives immediately below the top and senior to any one else. The first action in any attempt to improve an organization is of course Observation. The first thing to observe is who at or near the top in executive capacity is driving the organi-zation. Someone, at the top or several someones just below the top are overloaded. This will be the one or several most important log jams or bundles of stopped flows. A jam or inefficiency can exist on very low stratas of an organization without greatly impeding much of anything. But when such a jam occurs high up it can reduce efficiency, revenue and threaten the whole organization. The one or more at the top are trying. They are trying hard. Otherwise nothing would be going at all. To even hint that any retraining is needed at the top is an invalidation. Further there is no time available there for retraining."},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"FUNDAMENTALS OF ADMINISTRATION NO. 2 2 HCO PL 7.10.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 140 17.11.12 What is wrong and what causes overwork and despair is that the staff type persons serving the high level people are not trained or organized to handle the abundance of action. This is well within the province of an administrative expert to handle. Here he is deal-ing with secretaries, typists, phone operators and junior executive types who are only too will-ing to learn how to expedite the action for the high level key people. All one needs to tell the key person is that he needs administrative help and that you'll see that he gets it to take the load off. Then you organize and groove in those who directly serve him. He operates actually on a 9 Div 27 Dept system as a person and as an executive. Those services are fully listed on a standard org board. The larger the organization being headed, the more numerous must be the service corps that serves the key executive. If the organization is small or he is a very junior exec he often has a secretary but really does not have a communicator. If he can't have more than one person, one would con-vert the secretary to a communicator who is trained to be aware of all the functions involved in a 7 Div 21 Dept org board. When his secretary learns all this well, in terms simply of basic duties, the load will come off. But let us go much bigger. In a million man organization, the personal staff of the up-per exec who carries the load would have to be several dozen people who comprise his per-sonal admin staff only. All the training the top man would need would come when the rest were organized and trained and would consist only of \"This is your personal staff. For these functions (divisional) here is who you call.\" You give him the personal org board like a new phone card and let him play with it until he learns it in actual use. The load would come off, the lines would speed up and the result in production or ac-complishment would be fantastic. This personal staff would be trained by the admin expert, not to run the business but simply to handle and expedite all the actions of the top exec. Overloaded execs who are near the top should also have an organized personal staff, less numerous, but still with the basic org board fully covered. Training these personal staff members is not hard. They are usually very willing and very amazed that order can exist and that there is a way to help. Unless one has sat in or near a top spot he might not have any idea of how overloaded these are. Or how this overload can delay or prevent expansion. Where every interview is personal and where every action contains minor confusions, the brilliance and competence of the most well meaning high executive is drained into minor chaos. The president of the United States usually ages twenty years for every four in office. They go in looking well, they come out of office a wreck. Look at their pictures before and after. This is the toll of a relatively efficient if poorly organized personal staff."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"FUNDAMENTALS OF ADMINISTRATION NO. 2 3 HCO PL 7.10.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 141 17.11.12 Therefore, to handle this, a real, an efficient, a fully trained personal staff that is groomed to near perfection is vital. The jammed condition is at the top. If the top is served by people who fully understand Admin (as per Key Ingredients, an org board based on natural laws instead of whim, precise duties and hats) then the observa-tions and inspections bring in the data, plans go out, get followed up, get executed, the lines fly, the users are satisfied and the load comes off. The exact adaption of the standard org board has to be worked out on a basis of what the top exec or execs have to handle. But it will contain every division and every department and will be capable of sending out observation or supervision missions and survey users or voters and doing all the other things expected of that executive. The Admin expert will find, with one look at the top execs in almost all companies and countries where this has not been done that no one man can possibly carry the loads and functions required of his post. Yet in almost all cases the job is somehow being done. What an Admin expert has to do is study and list all the functions – unobtrusively-of that post and recruit and train a personal 9 Division 27 Department type staff for it, even though it is as few as one or three or as many as hundreds, depending on the organization size. The result will be magical in its effectiveness throughout the entire organization. Plans become actuality, confusions vanish and the statistics rise. You can thereafter work out ways to unstop lower executive posts. But you begin and make your biggest increase at the top. They need help up there. L.

The org bd shows the pattern of organizing to obtain a product. A board then is a flow chart of consecutive products brought about by terminals in se-ries. We see these terminals as \"posts\" or positions. Each one of these is a hat. There is a flow along these hats. The result of the whole board is a product. The product of each hat on the board adds up to the total product. WORKING IT OUT When asked to work out an Org Bd (or when the board there is doesn't work) one might think the task very difficult. In studying this subject so as to be able to communicate it, I made several small break-throughs in the subject itself. Several questions on this can be very easily answered now. Does an org bd have any value? Yes. Without an org bd there is no group product, there is only a mob. Yes. When there is no org bd there is much greater effort involved in getting anything done. Yes. The waste of people involved in no org bd and the loss of product justify any amount of effort to work out, make known and use a proper org bd. Man instinctively uses an org bd and protests the lack of one. The rawest recruit walk-ing aboard a ship assumes the existence of an org bd, if not a posted one, at least a known"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"ORGANIZING AND HATS 2 OS-09 – HCO PL 28.10.70 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 144 17.11.12 one. He assumes there will be somebody in charge and that different activities will be under different people. When there is no known org bd he protests. He also feels insecure as he doesn't know where he fits into this organization. Almost all revolts are manned by people who have been excluded out and are not on the country's org bd. This is so true that the ridiculous circumstance recently occurred in the U.S. The president found he had \"professional relief receivers\". Certain people had assumed the status of \"government dependent\" and were giving this as their profession. It was of course a post of sorts. And because it wasn't admitted as a post by the government there were some riots. The effort to belong or to be part of is expressed by an org bd. A person with no post is quite miserable. A person with an unreal post feels like a fraud or a mistake. Morale then is also considerably affected by the quality of an org bd or its absence. The overall test for the group, however, is its viability. Viability depends on having an acceptable product. Groups which do not have an acceptable product are not likely to survive. The volume and acceptability of a product depends in no small measure on a workable known org bd. This is true even of an individual product. An individual or small group, to get anywhere at all, requires a very exact org bd. The oddity is that the smaller the group the more vital the org bd. Yet individuals and small groups are the least likely to have one. Large groups disintegrate in the absence of an org bd and go non-viable in the presence of a poor one. The quality of a product, usually blamed on individual skill only, depends to an enor-mous extent upon the org board. For example, one disorganized mob that was trying to make a certain product were worked to death, harassed, angry at one another and had a wholly un-acceptable product at about twice the usual cost; when organized to the degree of a third, still without proper schedules, still largely untrained, they began to turn out an acceptable product at about half the effort-so even some organization worked. The product volume and quality depends utterly and totally upon the org board and hats and their use. You can train individuals endlessly but unless they are operating on a workable org bd they will still have a poor or small volume product. The traditional reliance of British Intelligence on star agents instead of organization cost them (along with misused PR) their empire. Lack of a known and real org bd can spell failure. And lack of knowledge of the sub-ject of organization has to be substituted for by pure genius at every point. Thus to make anything at all, to improve any product, sustain morale and distribute work equitably and make it count, one has to have a real and a known org bd. So how do you make one?"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"ORGANIZING AND HATS 3 OS-09 – HCO PL 28.10.70 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 145 17.11.12 HATS An org bd is made up of hats. The definition of a hat is the \"beingness and doingness that attains a product\". Let us take a train: The engineer wearing his engineer hat has the title of engineer. That's the beingness. He accepts orders, watches signals and general conditions, operates levers and valves to regulate the operation of his engine and to start change and stop. That's the doingness. He safely and on schedule moves the train passengers and/or freight from one location to another. A moved train and load is the product. So how do we find out there is a hat called engineer? As people are continually accepting or viewing already existing posts, when you ask them to dream up an org bd they at first may not realize that you are asking them to invent the correct posts. They don't have to invent \"engineer\". Everybody knows \"an engineer runs a train\"- So if you didn't know this? You'd have to figure it out. One would do it this way. One would have to think along these lines. The idea comes about because of a concept that people and goods have to be moved over distances on land. Or that a new area building up has to have transport of people and goods from and to it. Ah. This will be viable in an economic framework because people will pay to be moved and pay for their goods to be moved. Trains do this. So let's use trains. Arranging finance (or by prepayment) and obtaining a franchise for a right of way, track is laid, rolling stock and stations and roundhouses are built. Now it emerges that somebody has to drive the train. So somebody had better be hired to drive the train. So there comes into view the post of Engineer. How do we know this? Because we have to have a product of moved people and goods. That was what we were trying to do in the first place. Therefore, the Engineer Hat. So supposing now we did not have any org bd at all. The engineer hat would be the only hat. So he collects fares, runs stations, fixes his engine, buys fuel, loads the cars, sells stock... Wait a minute. If the engineer did all that the following would happen:"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"ORGANIZING AND HATS 4 OS-09 – HCO PL 28.10.70 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 146 17.11.12 1 . He would be exhausted. 2. His temper would be bad. 3. He would have machinery breakdowns. 4. He might have wrecks. 5. The railroad property otherwise unhandled would disintegrate. 6. He would have a low volume of product. 7. His product would be uneven and bad as he could maintain no schedule. 8. There would shortly be no railroad. Now let's go wog and \"solve\" this. Let's appoint a person for each station and say \"There we are!\" Well, it would still be a mess. So let's hire more engineers and more station agents and more engineers and more sta-tion agents and wind up with a confused mess, a huge payroll and a lousy product. That's how governments do it. And it is notable that current governments have no product but disas-ter. No, we have to solve this in quite another way. We do not get anywhere and we will not get a sensible org bd and nothing will work or be viable unless we count the products correctly and develop hats to attain them. When we have done this we can arrange the hats on an org bd so there is a flow and command channels and communication channels and we've got an org bd. You cannot work out an org bd until you have counted products! As volume increases you estimate the products before the final product and hat those. Quality of final product depends on a real org bd and hats, both complete, real and trained in and the functions done. Let us see now how you break down a final product into the products which, put to-gether comprise it. We have the final product of a railroad-viably moved loads. How many lesser prod-ucts go into the big product? There is a matter of machinery here. Any machine has 2 products (a) the machine it-self in good operating condition (b) the product of the machine. A repairman and machine shop man and a roundhouse keeper each has a product under (a). That is just for the machine, the engine. Under (b) we have what the machine itself produces (hauled trains in the case of an engine). Here we have then 2 major products-and these break down into lesser products, earlier in sequence to the final product."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"ORGANIZING AND HATS 5 OS-09 – HCO PL 28.10.70 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 147 17.11.12 There is even an earlier product to these-bought engines. And an earlier product to that-finance for equipment. As for the load itself, a delivered load, accepted by a consignee at the end, as you back up the sequence you will find a product-stored freight. And before that unloaded freight. And before that-moved freight. And before that-loaded freight. And before that-freight assembled for shipment. And before that-freight contracts procured. And before that-advertising placed in public view. And before that-surveys of public freight requirement. And before that-survey for activities requiring freight service. Each one of these products is a hat. Surveying this again we see there's no charges or money involved so no economic vi-ability. Thus we have a product, money made. This has earlier hats of course. The bewilder-ment of some people (and a lot of executives) who gape at a no-dough situation is laughable. They aren't product-minded. They think money falls into a company's lap or out of a TV set. They can't think the product-sequence necessary to obtain money. So they go broke and starve. There are always a lot of prior products to the product money. Fixated people just fix-ate on money itself, have no product sequence and so go broke or are poor. Someone has to have a desirable product that is sold for more than it cost to produce and have to sell it and deliver it to have money. Money even makes money. And even a pool of money has to have a product sequence or it vanishes. Even in socialism or communism the how does it support itself question must be un-derstood, answered, its product sequence identified, org boarded and hatted. In such a money-less society the org boarding has to be much tighter as money adds flexibility and lack of it as a working factor makes problems that are hard to solve. ORGANIZING In order to organize something one only has to 1. Establish what is the final product. 2. Work backwards in sequence to establish the earlier products necessary to make each next product and which all in a row add up to the final product. 3. Post it in terms of vertical greater and greater completeness of product to get com-mand channels. 4. Adjust it for flows. 5. Assign its comm sequence. 6.

Organisation is the sub-division of actions and duties into specialised functions. One can organise a series of actions to be done by himself or herself. This would con-sist of seeing what has to be done, doing what one can do first and then the remainder as a feasible series of events, all to accomplish a final completion of a cycle of action which for-wards one's assigned or postulated purposes. A group is organised so as to permit flows and accomplish specialised actions which are completed in themselves and from which small actions or completions, the group purpose, assigned or specialised, is forwarded or accomplished. There is a difference between directing and doing which some people have trouble separating apart. A person in charge of an activity is sometimes found deficient in organisa-tional understanding and so tries to do all the actions himself. This if done to excess effec-tively can break up a group and render it useless since all members but one have no function, having been robbed by this one-man monopoly on action. True,' an active and competent person can do things better. But he can really never do more than he can do. Whereas a well organised group, each with specialised functions, coor-dinated by the in-charge, can accomplish many times the work only one can do. Because it is organised makes a group harder to defeat than the individual. A competent individual who has been let down too often by groups tends to take it all on himself rather than whip the group into shape and get things organised. The correct action when faced by urgent necessity arising from incompetence of a group or other causes, is to 1. Handle it 2. Organise the group to handle such things and do their jobs. One can get stuck on I and if he or she does, then will have trouble and overwork from there on out. Because he or she omits also doing 2. The major failure of any group is to fail to organise."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"ORGANISATION 2 HCO PL 7.03.69 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 150 17.11.12 Workers of the world may arise but if they are not quickly organised before or after the fact, they will promptly be put back down! The major cause of not organising is just not understanding what is meant by it. For example, an executive is told he is in charge of seeing that the X project is done. He doesn't know much about it. He has two men who do know. The incorrect action is to try to do the X project himself or issue a lot of unreal orders about it. The correct action is to call up the man who does know, give him the other as an assistant and tell them to get on with it. Then, without interfering, the executive who received the order should get more knowledge-able about the X project so he can be sure it is done, while still letting the designated people get on with it. This comprehension of organisation is as simple as this-put somebody on the job and let him get on with it. On a project, make a survey of all the things there are to do, group types of actions into simple posts, assign people to them, provide the comm lines, materiel and liaison and let the group get on with it. Any post, no matter how junior, has to be organised. Anyone in charge of people has to be able to organise functions and work. Any executive has to know his target policies and be able to write them up, particu-larly the primary targets. Failing that, one gets very little done and is badly overworked. And the rest of the group is wasted. So, high or low, get a grip on this thing called organisation. It's gruesomely simple. Honest. L.

The head of a part has the statistic of that post. Every post or part of an org has a product. If it has no product it is useless and super-numerary. An Exec See has the products of his or her portion of the org. The first product of an Exec See is of course his or her portion of the org's divisions. If the portion itself does not exist then of course the Exec See has no stat at all as an Exec See even if very busy-so he or she is not an Exec See despite the title. This is true of a department head, a section head and a unit head. One can't really be the one in charge if the thing one is in charge of doesn't exist. Also things that don't exist themselves can have no product. The whole rationale (basic idea) of the pattern of an org is a unit of 3. These are Thetan  Mind  Body  Product In Division One the HCO Sec is the thetan, Department One the Mind, Department Two the Body and Department Three the Product. The same pattern holds for every division. It also should hold for every department and lower section and unit. And above these it holds for a portion of an org. In the HCO portion of the org we have the HCO Exec See as the thetan, the Exec Div (7) as the Mind, Division One as the Body and Division Two as the Product. And so with other parts of an org.

You need data gained from inventories or counts of items or the statistic assigned and drawn. It is not enough to only follow graphs. That is a lazy lazy lazy no confront method when used alone. Graphs can be falsified, can be too fixed on one thing and can ignore others unless you read all the graphs of the part you are interested in. Graphs are a good indicator and should be used wherever possible. But you must also keep in mind that it requires all the graphs to be wholly accurate in a Conditions assignment and the most accurate Conditions assignment possible and that the graphs must be based on actual figures. So, to begin, you look at the graphs. You look for recent ups and downs. Then you look for trends (long range drifts up or down). Then you look for discrepancies. Like high enrollment-low income, high letters out, low enrollment weeks later. It is safe enough at first to simply assign moderate conditions (Emergency, Normal, Affluence) by the current ups and downs of the graphs. This should result in expansion. Expansion (product increase) is the whole reason you are assigning conditions in the first place, so you expect reasonably that if you assign conditions by graph you will get ex-pansion. Now, after a while (weeks or months) you see you are getting expansion so you go on assigning conditions by graph. An Exec Sec would also inspect the physical areas of Dangers and Affluences as a matter of course. But let us take the reverse case. You assign conditions by graph (and inspections of Danger and Affluence) and what you are assigning conditions to doesn't expand! Well, now we get to work. There is something wrong. The first thing that can be wrong is that what you are assigning conditions to really doesn't exist. The Director of Comm does not have a Department of Comm. He has only a messenger-telex operator, no way to handle his other departmental functions and answers the phone himself. So, finding no Department regardless of other reasons (\"can't get staff\" \"income too low\" \"no quarters\") you bang him with a Condition of Non-Existence. Because he obviously doesn't exist as a Dir Comm, having no Comm Dept. (Non-Existence is also assigned for no use and no function.) Now, if this assignment to the Dir Comm of Non-Existence-with no further help from you, mind-does not result in a Comm Dept in a reasonable time you assume he doesn't want one to be there and you assign a Condition of Liability. You don't explain it all away. That's what he's doing so why imitate him? You don't say, \"He's just overwhelmed-new-needs a review-natter natter figure fig-ure.\" You simply assign!"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"CONDITIONS, HOW TO ASSIGN 3 HCO PL 20.10.67 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 153 17.11.12 He still doesn't get a Comm Dept there. You inspect. You find the Ethics Officer isn't enforcing the Liability penalty (\"Pete is my pal and I...\"). So you assign the Ethics Officer a Condition of Liability as he gets, natu-rally, what he failed to enforce. Now they mutiny and you assign a Condition of Treason, shoot both of them from guns and fill the posts. The new incumbents you tell, \"The boys before you aren't here now and aren't likely to be trained or processed until we get around to the last dregs so we hope you do better. You begin in Non-Existence. I trust you will work your way out of it at least into Danger before the week is out. As you are just on post, the penalties do not apply for Non-Existence. But they will after 30 days. So let's get a Dept of Comm and an Ethics Section.\" Now of course, if the E/O had to be shot from guns, Dir I & R is at once assigned a Danger Condition complete with penalties as that section was in his/her Dept. If there's no HCO (Div 7, 1, 2) part of the Org the LRH Comm of that org yells for the next senior org to act. And if there's no LRH Comm the next senior org should see that it's gone by lack of stats or reports or expansion and act anyway. Now you say, \"But that's ruthless! No staff would ... Well, such a statement reasoning is contrary to the facts. The only time (by actual experience and data) you lose staff and have an unstaffed org is when you let low stat people in. Low stat personnel gets rid of good staff members. An org that can't be staffed has an SP in it! Orgs where Ethics is tight and savage grow in numbers! Man thrives oddly enough only in the presence of a challenging environment. That is-n't my theory. That's fact. If the org environment is not challenging there will be no org. We help beyond any help ever available anywhere. We are a near ultimate in helping. At once this loads us up with SPs who would commit suicide to prevent anyone from being helped and it lays us wide open as \"softees\" to any degraded being that comes along. They are sure we won't bite so they do anything they please. Conditions correctly assigned alone can detect and eject SPs and DBs. So if we help so greatly we must also in the same proportion be able to discipline. Near ultimate help can only be given with near ultimate discipline. Tech can only stay itself where Ethics is correctly and ruthlessly administered. Admin like ours has to be high because our orgs handle the highest commodity-life itself. So our admin only works where tech is in. And our tech works only where Ethics is in. Our target is not a few psychiatric patients but a cleared universe. So what does that take?"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"CONDITIONS, HOW TO ASSIGN 4 HCO PL 20.10.67 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 154 17.11.12 The lowest confront there is is the Confront of Evil. When a living being is out of his own valence and in the valence of a thoroughly bad even if imaginary image you get an SP. An SP is a no-confront case because, not being in his own valence, he has no viewpoint from which to erase anything. That is all an SP is. But the amount of knowing havoc an SP can cause is seen easily if only in this planet's savage cruel wars. An executive who cannot confront evil is already en route to becoming suppressive. Next door to the \"theetie-weetie\" case is the totally overwhelmed condition we call SP (suppressive person). It is so easy to live in a fairyland where nothing evil is ever done. One gets the image of a sweet old lady standing in the middle of a gangster battle with bodies and blood spatter-ing the walls saying, \"It's so nice it's only a boy's game with toy guns.\" The low statistic staff member who never gets his stats up is making low stats. He isn't idle. It's a goodie-goodie attitude to say, \"He just isn't working hard.\" The chronic low stat person is working very hard to keep the stat down. When you learn that you can assign con-ditions and make an org expand. When stats won't come up, you drop the Condition down. Sooner or later you will hit the real condition that applies. Conversely as you upgrade conditions you will also reach the condition that applies. Some staff members are in chronic power. Who ever assigns it? They take over a post-its stats soar. Well, to measure just stats of the post taken over as his condition is false since his per-sonal condition is and has been power. And if it is power, then that personal condition should be assigned. That is very easy to see. But what if you have a personnel who whenever he or she takes over a post the stat collapses! Well you better assign that one too. For just as the one in Power works to maintain up stats, the one in the lower condition, whether one cares to confront it or not, works too and is just as industriously collapsing not only his own post stats but also the stats of posts adjacent to his! So he is at least a Condition of Liability as the post if vacant would only be in Non-Existence! And as somebody next to it might do a little bit for it, it might even get up to Danger Condition, completely unmanned!

Experience will teach one that if he really looks. RECIPROCITY It is more than policy that one gets the condition he fails to correctly and promptly as-sign and enforce. It's a sort of natural law. If you let your executives goof off and stay in, let us say, a Danger Condition yet you don't assign and enforce one, they will surely put you in a Danger Condition whether it gets assigned or not. Remember that when your finger falters \"on the trigger\". That natural law stems from this appalling fact. We didn't, a long long time ago, get in Ethics. We goofed. And the whole race went into the soup where it remains to this day. And if we are to live in this universe at all at all we are going to have to get in Ethics and clean it up. Whether that's easy to confront or not is beside the point. The horrid truth is that our fate is far more unconfrontable! Now we have to have highly skilled Tech to bail us out. And I assure you that tech will never get in or be used beneficially at all unless 1. We get Ethics in, and 2. Unless Scientology orgs expand at a regular rate. Only then can we be free.

It is an empirical (observed and proven by observation) fact that nothing remains ex-actly the same forever. This condition is foreign to this universe. Things grow or they lessen. They cannot apparently maintain the same equilibrium or stability. Thus things either expand or they contract. They do not remain level in this universe. Further when something seeks to remain level and unchanged it contracts. Thus we have three actions and only three. First is expansion, second is the effort to remain level or unchanged and third is contraction or lessening. As nothing in this universe can remain exactly the same, then the second action (level) above will become the third action (lessen) if undisturbed or not acted on by an outside force. Thus actions two and three above (level and lessen) are similar in potential and both will lessen. This leaves expansion as the only positive action which tends to guarantee survival. The point of assumption in all policy letters is that we intend to survive and intend so on all dynamics. To survive, then, one must expand as the only safe condition of operation. If one remains level one tends to contract. If one contracts one's chances of survival diminish. Therefore there is only one chance left and that, for an organisation, is expansion. PRODUCT To expand any company needs a demanded product and will and skill to produce and deliver it. It can be a service or an item. If a company has a demanded product and will and skill to produce and deliver it, it must organise to expand. If it does it will survive. If it organises to stay level or seeks to grow smaller it will perish."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"EXPANSION THEORY OF POLICY 2 HCO PL 4.12.66 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 158 17.11.12 This is easily observed in nations. Whenever one seeks to remain the same or to lessen itself it usually perishes. It need not seek only to expand its borders. It can also expand its influence and service. Indeed, the effort to expand borders in a nation without increasing a demand for its influence and products is a primary cause of war. If a nation expanded the de-mand for its influence and products it would expand without war. When a nation seeks to merely expand by force of arms and does not expand the demand for its products one gets a dark age or at least a social catastrophe. Rome, early on, was in great demand for its social technology and manufacturing skill and only a cruel streak in her made her wage war to expand. Britain, for instance, was ready to welcome Roman baskets and pottery and art and had been demanding them for nearly a century when Caesar's vicious ambitions actually wrecked the smooth progress of Rome by enforced expansion by arms in excess of the demand for Roman products. This was one Ro-man product nobody wanted – Caesar and his legions. Psychiatry's product of further insanity was not in demand by the people but by the state which sought to crash people or at least hold them down. So psychiatry expanded by government regulation not by popular demand and so at this writing stands in danger of com-plete extinction, for its influence depends utterly on \"expanding\" into the legislatures and government treasuries and no expansion whatever of any demand from the public and no product except slaughter. The Roman Catholic Church once had a healing product, by actual treatment and by relies and miracles and was in great demand by the public and eventually even the barbarians. But she began to fight progress in science and knowledge and her product turned into ex-ported ignorance backed by autos-da-fé (burning heretics) and thus ceased to expand and to-day is rapidly shrinking. Buddhism, earlier than that, expanded continuously as it never sought new extension of territory other than that of learning. Buddhism failed in India alone because its monks be-came licentious, ceased to deliver true teachings and were swept up, most likely, in India alone, by the Muslim conquest of that unhappy country sometime around the seventh century. Britain of the 20th Century actively sought to contract her empire and did so to the tune of internal economic catastrophe. SINGLE PRINCIPLE Thus it should be obvious that contraction leads to death and expansion to life provid-ing that one maintains a demand for itself and the will and skill to produce and deliver a product. If as ours is, the product is very beneficial and if we continue to produce and deliver the demand is assured. In this we are fortunate. And we are also fortunate that try as they will no squirrel is ever able to duplicate our product since one variation (that of changed brand) leads to others and they promptly have neither product nor demand – that observation is itself empirical. No squirrel has lasted more than 2 or 3 years in the past sixteen years. And there"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"EXPANSION THEORY OF POLICY 3 HCO PL 4.12.66 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 159 17.11.12 have been many. That they squirrel shows enough bad faith to drive away the public the mo-ment the public hears of the original. Thus, providing we maintain the will and skill to produce and deliver we can expand and proper expansion that will continue is possible. All our policy then is built on expansion. It assumes we wish to survive. And it stresses the production and delivery of a straight non-squirrel product. It is calculated to ensure a continued and widening demand by ensuring that product remains good and beneficial. The technology itself is complete but it expands also by experience of administration of it and simplifying its presentation. But to alter the basics of the technology will stop expansion because it is what we are producing, not what we are building. We are building a better universe. It has not been a good universe to live in so far but it can be. Our punitive force is our Ethics system and it exists to ensure the quality of the prod-uct and to prevent the blunting of demand for the product. INTERPRETATION OF POLICY The organisation then has all its policy rigged to expand. It takes many things to ensure expansion. Thus when you are interpreting policy it should be interpreted only against expansion as the single factor governing it. This can serve to clarify questions about policy. The correct interpretation always leads to expansion, not holding a level or contraction. For example, policy bars the entrance of the healing field. This is solely because there is too much trouble with the occupiers of that field and only outright war (with no demand) could solve them. This seems to be a brake on expansion. It is only a brake on expanding by war in the absence of demand. Therefore the right way to expand is to gradually build up gen-eral public demand, let experience by the public see that we heal and when the demand is there and howling for us, reinterpret the policy or abolish it as a brake to expansion. As one can only expand by external demand for the product, if one seeks to expand in the absence of a specific demand for the product, one has war and war doesn't lead to expansion any more than burning heretics and other brutalities expanded the Catholic movement. So one interprets policy against Proper Expansion that is proper."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"EXPANSION THEORY OF POLICY 4 HCO PL 4.12.66 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 160 17.11.12 CORRECT EXPANSION Expansion which when expanded can hold its territory without effort is proper and correct expansion. Hitler (like Caesar) did not \"consolidate his conquered territory\". It was not possible to do so, not because he did not have troops but because he didn't have a real demand for Ger-man technology and social philosophy before conquering. Thus Hitler lost his war and fascist Germany died. It is almost impossible to consolidate territory where one was not invited in in the first place and force had to be used in order to expand. One can remove a real suppressive by force to ensure demand will then build, provid-ing he does not seek to force the product on the suppressive and all those around the suppres-sive. The suppressive, as an individual, can be removed by force because he is an anti-demand factor using falsehood and lies to prevent demand from occurring. But one, in remov-ing the suppressive, has to be sure one's own product and delivery are still correct and straight and in no way suppressive of anything but suppressives. Further one must leave~ at least a crack in the door and never close it with a crash on anyone because a demand still may develop there. The only way to start a full scale revolution is totally and thoroughly slam the door. One must always leave a crack open. The suppressive can recant and apologize. The pauper can by certain actions, no matter how improbable, secure service. Etc. In short, use force only to shut down false anti-demand factors. Yet leave the door at least a crack open in case demand without duress develops. Never finally shut off a possible demand. You can stimulate demand. You can create it. But you may only comfortably and properly expand into demand. Removal of a suppressive only brings a potential appearance of demand from the area he dominated. That potential, by some means, the best of which are good dissemination and service examples, must become demand before one can truly occupy territory. Thus areas taken purely by force of arms can never be held by force of arms in the ab-sence of demand for product and thus demand by the area for occupation and consolidation. As we have a product that frees in an ultimate sense and de-aberrates there is of course an end to the game. But it is so far ahead, embracing a whole universe, that it requires mini-mal consideration. Expansion requires area to expand into. And we are in no danger of running out of that. If we were dependent as nations often think they are on boundary expansion on one planet, or into one planet's populations as companies think they are, we would have brakes on expansions due to territorial or population limitations alone. But we are not likely to encoun-"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"EXPANSION THEORY OF POLICY 5 HCO PL 4.12.66 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 161 17.11.12 ter such barriers for a period of time so long we can consider our expansion potential as infi-nite – and are the only organisation that honestly can so consider. We are not conquering land in the government sense anyway. OVER-EXPANSION All factors, then, in policy are rigged for expansion. And this brings about a possibility one can be asked about, that of overexpansion. One can \"over-expand\" by acquiring too much territory too fast without knowing how to handle it. One can conquer new territory as fast as one wants IF he knows how to handle the situation. There are several ways one can \"over-expand\". They all boil down to over-extended administration lines in a single administrative unit. In this one must know the principle on which the org board was originally conceived. It is that of Thetan – Mind – Body – Product. If there is a thetan, a mind (organisation potential not a harmful mass) can be set up, a mind which will organise a body which will produce a product. If any one of these elements (Thetan – Mind – Body – Product) are missing then an organisation will fail. Man is so aberrated all mental actions seem to him to be reactive mind actions. But there has to be in organisations a data and problem-solution coordination unit in order to set up a body. (A thetan can do this without a lot of mass, having his memory and perception and intelligence.) We have then an Advisory Council to coordinate acquired data, recognise and resolve problems. Above it there has to be a thetan somewhat detached from it. This may be a higher mind (Ad Council) operating as a director to the lower Ad Council. The mind must operate to form a body. This body is the Mest (Matter Energy Space and Time) and staff of the organisation. This body must produce a product. This in the HGC, for instance, is resolved cases. Any smaller part of the whole organisation is also a Thetan – Mind – Body – Product. Often the executive is both thetan and mind but as soon as traffic gets too heavy, he must form a separate mind such as an administrative committee or a personal staff to compose the mind. In such a smaller unit than the whole org, there is yet a body (the staff and Mest of the unit). And there must be a specific product. The product sometimes is absent and sometimes incorrectly assigned but if so the unit won't function. Over-expansion occurs only when one tries to handle the larger volume with the same Thetan – Mind – Body – Product numbers one had before. This tells you why single practitioners can't expand their practices without overwork."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"EXPANSION THEORY OF POLICY 6 HCO PL 4.12.66 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 162 17.11.12 It also tells you why some executives are upset at the idea of expansion as they (lack-ing organisational insight) see it solely as overwork. They don't see that when you expand volume and traffic you must expand the organisation. There is a wrong way and a right way to expand an organisation. The wrong way is to add staff and facilities endlessly (like governments tend to do) without adding to the organisation itself. If you had huge affluences occurring steadily you would soon go into collapse if you did not expand also by organisational units or branches. In taking over a new field or area of operation, for instance, one errs when he adds that traffic to the basic organisation's traffic. In the presence of huge escalating affluences one must analyse what is causing them and reinforce them. But one must also see what new kind of traffic is being added. If one finds a new kind of traffic then one sets up a sub-organisation unit to handle it which is complete in itself. If we are now getting \"business men\" in quantity we set up, under the control of the original organisation: 1. a thetan to supervise it 2. a mind to coordinate it 3. a body to handle it, and 4. a new product called \"released/cleared business men\". If we then were to find the now unit, struggling to form itself into 7 divisions on its own by now, gets a lot of demand and statistics on an Org Exec Course, it must cease to gra-tuitously coach it and set up its \"Business Academy\" teaching the Org Exec Course as Dept 10, appointing a thetan, mind, body and achieving a product \"trained business men\" and see that units to support it occur in other divisions and an Ethics unit to prevent blunting of de-mand and re-aberration. This can even go backwards. One sets up in Dissem a unit called \"Business Course Project Promotion Section\" and stimulates the demand and then when it is there puts in its Department 10. Soon all seven divisions have extra units to care for this new action, each unit with a Thetan – Mind – Body – Product. The products are different but they all add up to \"trained business men\", whether they are creating demand, financing or servicing. So over-expansion is only under-organisation in the main. One can of course \"over-expand\" by attempted servicing in the absence of demand causing thus losses in finance. In such a case only concentrate on creating new demand not on servicing old demands. This by the way is the most common error in organisations of ours. They shrink because they are not creating new demand and concentrate only on creating de-mand in those already demanding (which is lazy-easy)."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"EXPANSION THEORY OF POLICY 7 HCO PL 4.12.66 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 163 17.11.12 New demand is expensive to develop. Thus you often see finance units frowning on \"new demand\" expenses and cutting down magazines in number of issue, not buying new mail lists, etc. To start a new sub organisation, one sets up on the basis of potential demand, sets up Ethics to prevent demand-blunting or bad internal service or performance, works on increas-ing the demand, introduces service, sets up external Ethics to prevent blunted demand, in-creases the demand by dissemination to new. and old areas of demand, increases service, en-sures product, increases the organisation (not just staff), increases demand in new and old areas, stiffens up Ethics, improves service facilities, etc., etc. It's continuous expansion of volume, continuous expansion of organisation, continuous expansion of demand. Where one lags behind the others one gets trouble. It is almost impossible to run a non-expanding organisation with ease. One gets into financial crises, staff troubles and overwork. Decay has set in. And fighting it is sure to over-work an executive. The easiest course is to expand. Then one has the help. Summary: In understanding policy one must understand its key and that is expansion. Only a Scientology organisation has an unlimited horizon. But any organisation must expand to survive. The only ways you can \"over-expand\" are to fail to expand with new demand and keep pace with it evenly with organisational expansion as well as numbers. It is easier to expand than to \"remain level\". Organisations and units which do not expand cannot stay level and so contract. Org executives and personnel are overworked only when they cannot afford to expand and thus cannot get the help they need to do the work, quite in addition to there being more problems made by contraction than by expansion. Scientology organisations are designed for expansion. Expansion requires an expansion of all factors involved and when something expands out of pace with the rest which is not expanding at the same rate, trouble is caused. Uniform expansion of demand, Ethics and service into new fields and areas as well as old areas of operation is needful to trouble-free activities. Each member and unit of an organisation has a product which is different, contributes to the whole product of an organisation. The ultimate product of Scientology is a universe that is decent and happy to live in, not degenerated and made miserable by suppressives as it has been. This is accomplished by the de-aberration of individuals and the prevention of blunted demand and re-aberration by suppressives and this is the method of expansion. If in these early days of Scientology we have any troubles they occurred by an earlier imbalance of expansion."},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"EXPANSION THEORY OF POLICY 8 HCO PL 4.12.66 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 164 17.11.12 Demand was created without handling suppressives which unequal expansion gave us a backlog of unhandled ethics in the society. All we need do is catch up our backlog in those organisational functions which were not expanded when they should have been and all will go smoothly. Any time you do not expand uniformly with all functions you get an appearance of over-expansion by some functions. The best answer is not to cancel the expanded functions which over-reached but to catch them up by expanding the ones one neglected in support. You will have trouble wherever you cut back an expansion as that is contraction. The answer, within reason, is to advance all else to catch up to the expanded portion while still, more calmly, expanding it. L.

The industrial idea of organization is a cog wheel type organization with each member of it totally fixed on post, doing only exact duties, with all cog wheels intending to mesh. The industrial idea does not differentiate between a machine and a human or live organization. The product laws (Products 1, 2, 3 and 4 as given in the Org Series) apply to both a live organization and a machine organization and any organization. Since a live and a ma-chine organization hold these laws in common, the industrialist confuses the live organization and the machine organization. HCO P/L 29 October 70, Org Series No. 10 \"The Analysis of Organization by Prod-uct\" also carries a mention of this difference between a live and a machine organization. As the industrial idea has already been mentioned in this Org Series, and as this Org Series mainly applies to live (not machine) organizations, and as people tend to fall into a machine organization pattern (and also to use a live organization to not know their own speci-ality best) this earlier issue on live organization is published in full: HUBBARD COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE LONDON (Issued at Washington) HCO BULLETIN OF SEPTEMBER 21, 1958 For All Staff Member Hats THEORY OF SCIENTOLOGY ORGANIZATIONS An organization is a number of terminals and communication lines united with a common purpose."},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"THEORY OF SCIENTOLOGY ORGANIZATIONS 2 OS-12 – HCO PL 2.11.70 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 166 17.11.12 The actions of an organization can all be classified under the heading of particle mo-tion and change. To analyze a post or a department or an organization, make a list of each particle it handles (whether types of bodies, types of comm or any other item) and follow each item from the point it enters the post or department or organization to the point it exits. If a particle isn't handled properly and passed along properly there is a confusion or a dead-end. To organize an organization requires more than theory. One has to inspect and list the parti-cles and get their routes and desired changes of character enroute. Then he has to see that terminals and comm lines exist to receive, change and forward the particle. All types of parti-cles belong to somebody, are handled some way, come from somewhere and go somewhere. There are no confusions when lines, terminals and actions exist for each type of particle. Judgment and decision are needed in every staff post. If the handling of items are just \"petty details\" then so is your fellow man a \"petty detail\". There are no labourers in a Scientology organization. We are all managers of these particles. Routes of handling are not orders to handle but directions to go. A route is not neces-sarily correct for all cases. It is only correct for most cases. Robots can't handle livingness. Robot organizations and robot civilizations fail. They only seem to work – like the commie empire seems to work until you find out everyone is starving to death in it. A perfect organi-zation is not a machine but a pattern of agreements. A route is only the agreed upon proce-dure. It is not only occasionally broken, it now and then should be. The terminals involved make the agreement or the route doesn't work. A route along terminals that never agreed is no route but a labyrinth. People agree to postulates they can understand and appreciate. Hence, a route and handling begins with a particle, develops with a theory, comes to life with an agreement and continues to work because of judgment and decision. The routing, the comm lines, the pattern of an organization do not do the work. The work is done by living beings using good sense and skill. The organizational pattern only makes their work easier and lessens confusion and overburden. Governments, armies, big research bureaus reduce themselves down to routes and titles. They don't work. They don't do work. They allow for no human equation. Therefore, slave societies (composed only of routes and unthinking terminals) are always beaten eventually by free peoples. There is a point where routes and exact procedures become unworkable, just as there is a point, facing a vol-ume of work, that individuality and no teamwork becomes unworkable. An optimum organi-zation is never severely either one. Total individuality and total mechanization alike are im-possible. So if you or your department or your organization seem to be too heavily inclined to either one, yell don't talk. A bad organization will fire you and you can do something more profitable. A good organization will listen. But – always have a better idea than the one in use. Grumbling, refusing to work don't work. A better idea, talked over with the terminals on either side of you, put down in concise writing, submitted, will be put into action in a good organization. Of course, there's always a chance that the new proposed handling throws some-thing out of gear elsewhere. If it does, you have the right to know about it."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"THEORY OF SCIENTOLOGY ORGANIZATIONS 3 OS-12 – HCO PL 2.11.70 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 167 17.11.12 An \"organization\" doesn't get the work done. As an orderly plan it helps its terminals get the work done. The staff as individuals do the work. An organization can help or hinder getting the work done. If it helps, it's good. If it hinders, it should be examined thoroughly. An organization can work wholly at \"taking in its own laundry\". All the work that gets done is the work generated inside the shop by unreal routes and weird changes of particles. This is a government circa mid-20th Century. Its highest skill is murder which in its profun-dity it makes legal. A totally democratic organization has a bad name in Dianetics and Scientology despite all this talk of agreement. It has been found by actual experiment (LA 1950) that groups of people called on to select a leader from among them by nomination and vote routinely select only those who would kill them. They select the talkers of big deals and ignore the doers. They seem to select unerringly the men of average skill. That is never good enough in a leader and the people suffer from his lack of understanding. If you ever have occasion to elect a leader for your group, don't be \"democratic\" about it. Compare records as follows: Take the person who is a good auditor, not just says he is. Take the person who has a good, not neces-sarily the highest, profile and IQ. Take the person who can grant beingness to others. And look at the relative serenity and efficiency of any past command he may have had. And even then you're taking a chance. So always elect temporarily and reserve the right of recall. If his first action is to fire people, recall him at once and find another leader. If the organization promptly prospers, keep him and confirm the election by a second one. If the abundance of the organization sags in a month or so, recall and find another. Popularity is some criterion – but it can be created for an election only, as in the U.S. Select in an election or by selection as an executive the person who can get the work done. And once he's confirmed, obey him or keep him. He's rare. But beware these parliamentary procedure boys and girls who know all the legal and time wasting processes but who somehow never accomplish anything except chaos. A skilled, successful leader is worth a million impressive hayseeds. Democracies hate brains and skill. Don't get in that rut. In the U.S. War between the States militia companies elected their officers with great lack of success in battle. They finally learned after tens of thousands of casualties that it was skill not popularity that counted. Why be a casualty – learn first. Democracy is only possible in a nation of clears – and even they can make mistakes. When the majority rules the minority suffers. The best are always a minority. WHAT IS YOUR JOB? Anything in an organization is your job if it lessens the confusion if you do it Your being exactly on post and using your exact comm lines lessens confusion. But failure to wear another hat that isn't yours now and then may cause more confusion than being exactly on post. The question when you see you will have to handle something not yours is this: \"Will it cause less confusion to handle it or to slam it back onto its proper lines?\" Example: A preclear wandering around looking for somebody to sell him a book. You see him. The book sales clerk isn't there. The books are. Now what's the answer? You'll create"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"THEORY OF SCIENTOLOGY ORGANIZATIONS 4 OS-12 – HCO PL 2.11.70 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 168 17.11.12 a little confusion if you hand him a book, take his money and give it to the book sales later. You'll create confusion for your own post and the organization if you go chasing around try-ing to find \"book sales terminal\". You'll create a feeling of unfriendliness if you don't help the preclear get his book. Answer it by deciding which is less confusing. You'll find out by ex-perience that you can create confusion by handling another's particles but you will also dis-cover that you can create confusion by not handling another's particles on occasion. The only real error you can make in handling another's particles is to fail to tell him by verbal or written comm exactly what you did. You stole his hat for a moment. Well, always give it back. Remember, in a Scientology organization every Scientologist on staff potentially wears not just his own but every hat in the organization. He has to know more jobs than his own. Particularly jobs adjacent to his post. He often has to do more jobs than his own because those jobs have to be done and he sees it. A non-Scientology member of an organization is only limited in what he can do in the organization by lack of know-how. But the limitation is applicable only to instruction and auditing. But a Scientologist: he may find himself wearing any hat in the place including mine. And others may now and then wear his hat. A staff member gets the job done of (1) his own post, (2) his department, and (3) the whole organization. People who are always off line and off post aren't doing their own jobs. When we find somebody always off post and in our hair we know if we look at his post we'll find a rat's nest. So there are extremes here as well. HOW TO HOLD YOUR JOB Your hat is your hat. It is to be worn. Know it, understand it, do it. Make it real. If it isn't real it is your fault since you are the one to take it up and get it clean with an Executive. If he doesn't straighten it up so you can do it, it's still your fault if it's not done. You hold a job in a Scientology organization by doing your job. There are no further politics involved – at least if I find out about it there aren't. So do your job and you've got a job. And that's the way it is. But on post or off, we only fail when we do not help. The \"public\" only objects to us when we fail to help or when we fail to answer their questions. So we have two stable data on which to operate whether we're on post or not: Help people! Answer people's questions exactly! When you don't you let everybody down."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"THEORY OF SCIENTOLOGY ORGANIZATIONS 5 OS-12 – HCO PL 2.11.70 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 169 17.11.12 NEATNESS OF QUARTERS - The public knows us by our MEST - A part of everyone's hats is keeping a good mock-up in people, offices, classrooms, quarters. Keep your desk and your Mest neat and orderly. It helps. And when you see things getting broken down or run down or dirty, fix them or clean them or if you can't, yell like hell on the right comm line. THE DISPATCH SYSTEM The Dispatch System is not there to plague you but to help you. Except when you've got to have speed, never use an inter-office phone to another ter-minal. And never write a dispatch and present it and you at some other point at the same time. That's \"off-line\" just as a phone is \"off-line\". A good use of the organization's lines reduces confusion. The other guy is busy, too. Why interrupt him or her unnecessarily with routine that should go on the lines? You'll usually get an answer in the same day or at least in 24 hours. The organization's comm lines are pretty good. They make it possible for this small handful of us to get more things done in this society than any other organization on Earth in terms of actual accomplishment. A comm line can be jammed in several ways. Principal of these is entheta. Ask your-self before it goes on the lines – it's bad news but is it necessarily important? Another is over-burden. Too much traffic jams a line. Too long a dispatch doesn't get read. Another is too little data. That can jam a line but thoroughly. It takes more dispatches to find out what goes. Another way is to by-pass the line itself – this jams the terminal. The final way, in broad classes, to jam a comm line is to put erroneous data on it. The last is a pet hate of Scientology people. Generally its form is \"everybody knows\". Example: \"They say that George is doing a bad job\", or \"Nobody liked the last newsletter\". The proper rejoinder is \"Who is Everybody?\" You'll find it was one person who had a name. When you have critical data omit the \"everybody\" generality. Say who. Say where. Other-wise, you'll form a bad datum for somebody. When our actions are said to be unpopular the person or persons saying so have names. IN SUMMARY A post in a Scientology organization isn't a job. It's a trust and a crusade. We're free men and women – probably the last free men and women on Earth. Remember, we'll have to come back to Earth some day no matter what \"happens\" to us. If we don't do a good job now we may never get another chance.

A small organization is composed of individuals. If you really understand this principle and use it properly you will be able to have a large organization. There are other factors such as (1) the desirability and quality of one's commodity, (2) the able promotion of it, (3) the ability of the heads of groups in the organization to catch dropped balls and (4) the close following and comprehension of the policies of the organiza-tion and its groups. But the gross monitoring law is as above. When one does not know this and apply it one has a small, semi-bankrupt organization that overworks everyone and underpays. This rule applies to a planet or a nation and is most readily seen in these gross terms. A planet with nations will be far more prosperous than a planet with one central government governing the individuals of a planet. Socialism fails (and it always fails) because of two factors: (a) The government seeks to run the individual, and (b) Socialism unmocks companies. At this writing the prosperity difference (and there is one, Russia currently starving) between the democracy of the US and England and the Super Socialism of Russia is that the \"West\" still has companies and the \"East\" (Russia and China) have abolished them. Russia seeks to run the individual. It has collective farms, etc., but they won't leave a manager alone – to manage – they govern his workers. To the degree that England and the US tax the individual and seek to govern him they will dwindle in size."},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"DANGER CONDITION DATA 2 HCO PL 28.02.66 WHY ORGANIZATIONS STAY SMALL EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 172 17.11.12 England at this writing is undergoing one unmock of the whole empire solely because it is by-passing the manager and the governor and directly seeking to govern individuals through income tax, \"benefits\", etc. The US is about to come to pieces. Like all big countries on the way out it never looks so good as when it is already about to fall apart. The US is by-passing the states and US com-panies and is therefore putting the governors, managers and the states and companies in Dan-ger Condition. This, unrepaired, will unmock states and companies and collapse the sub-group on which the big group called the US depends for an organization is composed of groups. Non-Existence is the Condition just below Danger. A Danger Condition carried on too long drops down scale to non-existence. A large group made up of non-existences is of course non-existent itself. Thus by-pass by the heads of a big organization of the heads of its internal small organizations works toward non-existence. It is really quite simple. To make an organization get smaller all one has to do is by-pass the sub-groups and run the individuals only and the org will collapse or struggle along at near-collapse no matter how bright its manager may be or how hard he or she works or how bright the staff is, or how good the product, the violation of the law in the second paragraph will decay. Fantastic, isn't it? All one has to do to make an organization grow is apply the law that a large organiza-tion is composed of groups. It is not composed of individuals. In absolute proof of this, in a tiny org it is always observed that everyone there wears each one all the hats. It is a madhouse of individual cross-endeavour. Show me an org that stays small and I will show you an org where every staff member is wearing all the hats in the place. They can't grow because they violate the law that a large organization is composed of groups. Russia, just yesterday sweeping the world has begun to lose ground and her empire withdraws. Russia won't allow companies. She never says to the head of Georgia \"Get your statistics up, bub\" and leaves him to it. Instead she governs the Georgian individual with spies, secret police and even income tax and is more apt to shoot the head of Georgia if his statistics do rise as he is then looked on by a paranoid central government as capable enough to be a menace. Russia once governed via cells and did so as long as she was expanding. Now she has Income tax! Russia expanded despite bad management solely because she was com-posed of cells and collectives – but she went too far and erased the individual entirely, so, though growing she starves. Her groups were mainly dedicated to politics, not production, which is a frailty of governments anyway. But the basic group is composed of individuals. (For heaven's sakes don't tell Russia as we don't want her growing – tell her she must govern her individuals individually and she'll vanish. You can tell the US, if you like, but only be-cause no president yet ever listened to anything except his popularity poll and with only a four year career, isn't likely to. In the US, the government itself vanishes regularly and only the companies, with plenty of interference, keep the civilization going.) England's sad old empire was great as long as India was run by the East India Com-pany, etc. etc. Its colonies and dominions did fine right up to the moment the government in Westminster and Whitehall started to run the natives as individuals, by-passing the company"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"DANGER CONDITION DATA 3 HCO PL 28.02.66 WHY ORGANIZATIONS STAY SMALL EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 173 17.11.12 controlled colonies. Then the \"Empire\" started to go broke because it never was a political empire but a commercial one. As a political empire it uniformly failed until about 350 years ago it began to charter companies to rule and govern foreign lands. Then it got an \"empire\". When it began to by-pass its company heads and set up crown controlled governors and then by-pass these it ceased to be an English Empire and it looks today that soon there won't even be an England. It could not control even one colony the moment it started to govern individ-ual colonial citizens on a by-pass of the colonial companies. You can use the same argument they use. That \"concentrating only on groups is hell on the individual\". Marx used that line. Well it isn't true. When you get too big a group the individual in it, suffering the whole pressure of the state suffers. The reverse is true – \"by concentrating only on groups the individual is protected and prospers\". Now we get to the philosophic question in the law, how large is large, how small is small. Oddly this is easily answered, unlike most philosophic conundrums. You have to have the answer to \"how big should a group be in order for the individuals in it to be effectively managed without oppression in order to get the job done\". That asks and answers it. A correct group size is one where the individuals in it are not made too small by the group being too large. This is a ratio question. The Government of England! and the individual Englishman are of incomparable magnitude. What the hell can Joe Cockney a citizen do against the Gov-ernment of England! Nothing! So Joe Cockney goes to pieces. You can't have a comm line between a Billion horsepower motor and one grasshopper! Something is going to explode and it isn't the Billion h.p. motor. It's the grasshopper. Therefore when the management unit is too big the individual (despite all the protection laws in the world) becomes apathetic and can't work or doesn't see himself as important enough to bother about. So what is a proper sized basic group? A group is a proper size when the individuals in it can easily approach the man-ager of that group on a familiar friendly basis and be sure he knows what they're doing and why and if they're doing it. The individual in that group is not oppressed. His charm counts. He feels up to arguing with that manager. The executive (with a deputy on his side) feels up to confronting the rest of the group. His own personality counts. The only reason you have strikes and labour unions is that this group law has been violated. Too many individuals in the group for them to know intimately their manager on a friendly co-operative basis. This is all Marx is about. Marx is really a protest against too big a group solved by creating a protective state (an overwhelmingly large group) that \"rescues\" the individual! So Communism is a mess. For by making a state group one overwhelmed the individual and sure enough the only criticism of Communism that a Communist will tolerate is that it has too big a \"bureaucracy\" by which he means too big a government for an individual to confront. Communism goes even further. It abolishes the individual utterly! It forces him to be a group. And that is very bad for individuals are the building block of the small group. So Marx nei-"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"DANGER CONDITION DATA 4 HCO PL 28.02.66 WHY ORGANIZATIONS STAY SMALL EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 174 17.11.12 ther knew nor solved the basic, problem of government. He didn't know the above 2 laws about organizations and groups so Communism, supposed to solve individual oppression, is the most individually oppressive form of Government on this planet. How many individuals can effectively compose a group? It depends on the ability of the manager to handle men on an individual basis. This varies. But such men or women as can handle a large number are very, very rare. So we take a safe answer. A fairly safe answer is six – the manager of the group plus five individuals, one a dep-uty manager. This is determined by the answer to this question: How many subordinates are you willing to work with on the job? Five others is about all you'd care to stretch it. Two others would be too comfortable – even too dull. But you can stretch it up to five. Thus we could stretch out an org composed of groups of six persons – a manager, a deputy and four – making 6 maximum in each group. And you now have the size of the largest building blocks it takes to make a big org. Six persons in each. If we pyramid this we have (each maximum): 5 staff members and their In-Charge as a unit; 5 units and the section executive in a section; 5 sections plus the department's director in a department; 3 departments and the secretary, a deputy and a communicator in a division; 4 divisions in a portion and the Org Exec Sec and a deputy and a personal see; 3 divisions and the HCO Exec Sec plus her deputy and a personal sec in the HCO portion. Or with a full Exec Division set up: 4 ES Comms in an Office for the Org Exec Sec and a personal see; 3 ES Comms in an Office for the HCO Exec Sec and her personal sec. But we build downwards by groups of six if we expand further, rarely exceeding 5 and an Executive. You see then that the moment the HCO Exec Sec starts handling Address in Charge, the jump is too great as it puts Address in Charge up against the equivalent of the total execu-tives of units and sections of HCO! It makes his group too big. It makes him too small (being such a small part). He gets rattled, feels oppressed, tends to snarl because he is over-whelmed – his group is too big so he is too small. Simple as that."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"DANGER CONDITION DATA 5 HCO PL 28.02.66 WHY ORGANIZATIONS STAY SMALL EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 175 17.11.12 So long as an Executive only handles 2, 3, 4, 5 people he can handle his job because they know him. The people under him can handle their sub-groups so long as they contact only 2, 3, 4, 5 people and themselves. For instance, so long as there are only 5 Continental Orgs, Exec See Communicators will feel comfortable, providing the Continental orgs have each 2, 3, 4, 5 orgs under them and have in their turn ES Communicators. So proper organization for expansion builds in blocks of 6 maximum – 5 + an execu-tive. That can be 5 groups plus an Executive as you go up or 5 staff members plus an execu-tive as you go to the bottom. Wherever this is violated the organization (whether a nation or a company or us) will dwindle. Where it is kept, the organization will grow. I warn you that 5 plus an executive sized groups is hard work, even a strain at times, but it can be done. 6 or 7 + an executive is quite too much. And a Government vs Joe Doakes is a complete smash as Joe is only maybe 1/70,000,000th as big as the Government! So never by-pass. Completely aside from the true mechanics of the Danger Formula where by-pass results in non-existence, it is hell on the Executive and every member of the organization to have continual violation of the maximum groups size. If an executive feels overworked, even with all Dev-T cared for and policed, then that executive has below him violations of group size and is by-passing some point that should have an executive below him, with a group under that executive. The overworked executive is trying to handle more than five other people directly. (Five staff members or five group ex-ecutives.) It's like boxes in boxes in boxes. But in this case 6 boxes at the most fit comfortably. If a department has 8 sections under its director, then we have to group the sections by giving the Director 2 who each control 4 sections. This is a very comfortable director for he has a group of 2 + the director. He can loaf. But his assistants will sweat. So add I assistant and divide the department's sections into 3 groups, 3, 3 and 2 and you will have a more effi-cient department. That's the way you juggle it about to prevent overwork by Executives and overwhelm of individuals. If you want to increase efficiency on a 5 + executive group, always make one of the 5 a deputy and slightly senior to the other 4. The four can then approach the deputy to see if they should approach the executive on matters they feel uneasy about. This adds a gradient. There are various ways to juggle this about. An executive with 7 sections can take 3 himself and give a deputy 4, etc. Lots of ways to do it but just stay at or below I + 5 if you can. The senior to the group exec is not counted as a member of the group."},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"DANGER CONDITION DATA 6 HCO PL 28.02.66 WHY ORGANIZATIONS STAY SMALL EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 176 17.11.12 Here and there we violate this. A Comm Ev is not as acceptable as a Hearing because one person faces more people. Jury trials are a horrible strain and a cruelty because one has to face about 14 people! (Judge, prosecutor, jury.) Too many! So those are the laws which underlie organization. But you can have it all on the org board and not practise it and collapse. If an Exec See is approaching 15 staff members past their executives, it can wreck the place as the staff members go into apathy, the secretaries go into non-existence and bang! no org. So completely aside from Danger Condition, violations of following proper group or-ganization will bring any organization, a planet, a state, an org, into a mess. This is what underlies the decline and fall of civilizations: the state begins to govern the individual! An organization is composed of groups not individuals. And that truth followed and practised in the flesh as well as on paper will bring about a happy civilization, a happy nation and a flourishing org. SUMMARY A large organization is composed of groups, a small one is composed of individu-als. The primary difference between the opulent West and the starving East is that the West still permits companies. This means to some extent the Western nations are composed of groups so they are still somewhat successful. A group is a proper size when the individuals in it can easily approach the man-ager of that group on a friendly basis and be sure he knows what they are doing and why and if they are doing it. More than 5 persons plus their executive tends to be too large a group. The persons under an executive can of course be executives of groups. And the five persons below each of those executives can be executives of groups. If things aren't organized this way the individual is crushed. The executive is crushed by overwork and the persons under him are overwhelmed. By-pass of an executive, aside from putting him in danger, overwhelms the members of his group and makes them do less and makes them feel attacked and lessens their sense of their own power. 2 + an executive is also a group but the executive is not really working to capacity. With all Dev-T cared for an executive will be overworked if he is over more than four subordinates. The principal reason orgs stay small is no matter how fancy their org boards they do not actually practise what is on the board but by-pass or pay no real attention to command"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"DANGER CONDITION DATA 7 HCO PL 28.02.66 WHY ORGANIZATIONS STAY SMALL EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 177 17.11.12 lines and so in actual practice are only one or two oversized goups – which results in them staying small and being overworked and also underpaid as their system in actual practice is inefficient.

As it is my hat really, no mat-ter how small the post is, it has to be worn as I would wear it. The air and attitude of how it's worn is important. Many an HCO Sec in the old days successfully got out of a tough problem by asking, \"What would Ron do in this situation?' And did it and all worked out. Therefore it is worthwhile to know how I would go about things. I could detail for hours the admin indicators and admin technology I use. But you've got the bulk of it already in org policy letters. There are only a few things I might add that would help. One is that I work exclusively on the \"Greatest good for the greatest number of dy-namics.\" I believe that to command is to serve and only gives one the right to serve. I have to be, above all things, effective and cannot fall short of being effective or ex-plain ineffectiveness away. I never compromise with a situation to be agreeable. In handling something I figure out if I want to play that game or not and if I don't I won't. And if I don't I will do anything needful to disconnect from it and if I do I will do any-thing I can to win it. There is at least one, however, that is wildly out in many executives. And that is how I handle other posts. My entire concentration is to put the person on a given post that possibly can handle it and then let him or her get on with it. The difference is this: others put a person on a post and then hammer and pound him with orders as to how to handle it. If the appointee gets in trouble, others give him streams of orders and directions."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"POST, HANDLING OF 2 HCO PL 12.09.67 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 180 17.11.12 I don't. If a person has been trusted with a post I also trust him to handle it. If he or she obviously can't, I find another person who possibly can. I give a person on a post a lot of chances. I know posts are hard to handle. But if the statistic goes down and down and stays down, and no admin or tech advice has been of any avail, I don't hammer away with streams of orders. I just find another person. This I know is a greater plus and minus than people easily tolerate. The plus is that I extend complete trust to an appointee. The minus is that, if the stat is down and won't come up, I find another person. There is no in between streams of directions or nagging. Also, after a time, I grant that people can change and give a removed person another chance. I don't consider they will be bad forever. When I handle a situation that is bad I han-dle it according to the greatest good for the majority of dynamics. Then, when it IS handled, I usually try to pick up individuals who have had to be shot in the handling. I don't forget them. You will see me handle situations ruthlessly and bring it all off and then you may not see that I try afterwards to patch up whoever had to be shot. People also try to teach me that it is useless to try to salvage a gone dog, a low stat failure who had his chance. I refuse to learn it. I still try. As time goes on I even love my enemies but after I have rendered them powerless to stop us. I put a person on a job and let him or her get on with it. I don't act unless it is obvious the roof is falling in. Then I find somebody else who possibly can hold it. And also I patch up the fellow I had to remove and some day give him another chance. Evidence of this is all around. I don't try to force a job to be held by streams of detailed instructions once failure is apparent. From the moment I see it isn't being held to the moment I appoint somebody new I will myself act to hold the post in any way I can, no matter how distant it is. But my attention is really on finding a new person to appoint and when that's done I get off the line and let him get on with it. It makes a far more forceful organization to handle things this way and a far happier one in the long run. A person always knows, with me, if his job is secure. If his stat is up, it is. I'll not ad-monish or permit him to be pushed about. This may seem to be a brutal way to go about things but remember this: We are a few and we have an enormous area to salvage that long ago went down for the third time. If we fail it is improbable the job will ever again be done as, on evidence that the problem still ex-ists, it has never before been solved in all the past long ages. So we can't really take chances. Not with the whole human race. So we do our jobs and see that our jobs are done. We have a trust which, if we fail it, condemns ourselves, our friends, our future to continued oblivion. So we mustn't fail. Or permit others to fail. And that is how and why we are getting the job done.

It does have a flaw. The basic flaw in organization is Inspection Before The Fact. That means inspection before anything bad has happened. Violations are so harmful they destroyed every great civilization – the Roman, the British, the lot. For every flow is slowed or stopped. The prosperity of any organization is directly proportional to the speed of its parti-cles – goods, people, papers. World trade, world shipping, world prosperity is dying only because of the cumulative effect of inspection before the fact. Passports, customs, safety regulations, general govern-ment interference before anything bad has occurred add up to a Suppressive Society and therefore, soon enough, a dead one. Penalty after the fact has occurred disciplines the criminals and does not pull down the majority to criminal level.

Here is one which if left out would cause mystery. This is the principle of traffic flows we now use. It is called the Fast Flow System of Management. A being controlling a traffic or activity flow should let the flow run until it is to be re-inforced or indicates a turbulence will occur and only then inspects the part of the flow that is to be reinforced or is becoming enturbulated and inspects and acts on only that one flow. This principle would operate on a committee of 3 in this fashion: the committee does not act as a body. Each member acts individually in three spheres of influence (three types of flow). There is no committee (collective) action until one of the three members wants concur-rence from the other two on greatly reinforcing a flow or until the other two, by observation, see the third is going adrift. Only in these cases does the committee act as a Committee. In other words all 3 members go about their work independently until there is a change in one of their three spheres and then they act. Otherwise the flows of orders and actions are independ-ent. Not doing it like this is why Committees have gotten the reputation of being unable and a waste of time. To do this one, of course, needs another principle: that of Indicators. An Indicator is something that signals an approaching change rather than finding the change is already present and confirmed. We get this from auditing. An auditor audits so long as things go evenly. He knows when they will begin to deteriorate or change by an Indicator. He acts on seeing the indicator. He doesn't wait until the collapse or total change of the pc occurs and then look it over and act. The pc could be run into the ground or a good process that was bettering the case could be neglected if an auditor could not predict from indicators how it was going before it was gone. In supervising a number of sections or departments, it would work this way: The person in charge does not examine every action or decision on the lines. If all despatches of all the activities went through his or her one pair of hands the volume would be too great and would jam. The executive's \"plate\" would be too full and this would halt any"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"ADMINISTRATION FLOWS AND EXPANSION 2 HCO PL 29.03.65 THE FAST FLOW SYSTEM EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 186 17.11.12 expansion of the activities as the executive would feel overworked, yet in actual fact would be getting nothing much done. The flows which needed watching would be buried in a huge vol-ume of flows that did not need watching. Instead, the principle of flows tells us that the executive should have statistical indica-tors such as OIC charts on every part of the activity each week and should act only on the basis of the charts' behaviors. If a chart went down the Executive would not wait for that area to collapse before in-specting it. At a dip point the executive should go over all the plans and traffic and despatches of the area dipping down and unearth the real reason why it did dip. If the matter needs minor remedy, it should be corrected. If then the graph still dipped down, the executive would not only be advised of it by the OIC Indicators but would know, having inspected earlier, what had to be done on a more drastic scale to get the graph going up again. The OIC system must be used and all data plotted and circulated to the Executives in an org before this system will work. If the OIC system is put into effect fully the executive can then (and only then) let go the comm lines and let the traffic flow. He then only needs to: 1. Keep alert for and correct Dev-T (off-line, off-policy, off-origin and non-compliance); 2. Keep an eye on the weekly OIC charts; 3. Find from OIC the upward trends and inspect and find out what's working so well it can be reported; 4. Be alert to any down dip and inspect the activity itself and correct the matter; and 5. Spend most of his time getting his own job done (since executives do have jobs be-sides supervision). The one thing he mustn't do is \"get reasonable\" about dips or zooms and not act to really check the decline or to reinforce the rise: (a) Thinking one does know when he has not gotten it inspected closely; (b) Not believing the graph and Indicators; and (c) Not acting, are the fatal errors. Doing 1 to 5 tells us who's an executive and doing (a), (b) and (c) tells us who should-n't be an executive. If this system is in effect the org can't help but boom. We will call this the Fast Flow System of Management. It is a very precise art. It's like auditing. One predicts the slumps and reinforces the tendency to boom. It can't miss.

A working installation is something that is operational. The most flagrant violation of this is tearing up Div A to create Div B. Division A is working. Somebody orders Division B to be strengthened. A stupid or suppressive personnel person will tear up Div A to get personnel for Div B. The correct action is to find extra or new people for the new action. Musical Chairs (transfers of persons around an org) is the single most destructive ac-tion to an org's stats. A failure to recruit and train new people leads one toward the destruction of working in-stallations. Whenever a new unit has to be made up, the failure to recruit and train shows up vividly. Essential people are ripped off their posts to form the new unit and the destruction of working installations by this action shows up at once in production stats. It takes a great deal of work to find, hat and post people and get them experienced enough to produce. It takes a lot of work to make a working installation. But in one swoop some irrespon-sible personnel transfer can destroy it. In mechanical matters the same thing applies. It takes a lot of work to make something op-erational. If for a while it is not used, a mechanic may rob its parts to set up something else in-stead of getting new parts for the something else. Then when the working installation is needed, it doesn't function and a great deal of trouble and expense is put in setting it up again. The trouble and expense is far more costly than getting the parts elsewhere. Never unmock a working installation. It will be far more costly than going to a lot of trouble and expense to get the people or parts elsewhere. L.

Whenever it has gotten into trouble it has slipped to effect. It is only the negligence or alter-is or non-compliance on the part of certain persons on staff or in the professional employ of org (such as attorneys, accountants) that gets the org in trouble. Such beings are uniformly degraded beings. They are at best pcs. They are not truly staff members or effective professionals. The more degraded beings you employ or retain as professionals to \"fill a post\" or \"need a lawyer\" or for any other reason, the more the org will be at effect. These are the people who get you and your org in trouble. Their characteristic is alter-is of tech, alter-is of policy, and non-compliance with Tech, Policy and orders. Where these characteristics are spotted in a person hired on staff the person is only qualified to be a pc and must not be retained on staff or as a professional contact. This is a different thing than a suppressive. A suppressive is seeking to destroy know-ingly and gets no case gain. \"Degraded being\" is a harsh term but a true one. It means a person who is at effect to such a degree that he or she avoids orders or instructions in any possible covert or overt way because orders of any kind are confused with painful indoctrinations in the past. This person cannot be at cause without attaining OT Level 3. Therefore they prevent the org from being at cause as they cannot be at cause themselves and will not let the org or anything else be at cause including executives."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"PERSONNEL REQUIREMENT 2 HCO PL 22.03.67 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 192 17.11.12 Persons who alter-is tech or refuse to comply with proper legal orders constitute a class of pcs we can process gently and happily but must not employ, Further, an org that goes mad on \"process the whole staff\" continually regardless of duties has a degraded being complex. (\"Us poor equal thetans.\") In such an org the degraded beings outnumber the Big Being staff members. Such an org is not at cause over the environment but is a sort of mutual aid society or a self treating mental ward where the inmates use Scn to treat each other but are but dimly aware of the outer environment. In a staff member we expect lots of auditing and case gain. But we do not expect him to be on staff yet only capable of being a pc (as he alter-ises and non-complies). We are completely happy to service such. We refuse utterly to use them on staff. A staff member must be capable of being, with the org, cause over his environment. It is policy that an executive may not retain on his staff or in his division or in the org any repeatedly alter-ising or non-complying staff member but must see the person dismissed, gently but firmly and put in a pc status only. Personnel Officers hiring persons who have little ability to be cause over their own life environment are in violation of this policy. We can process and bring up to stature such beings. But they are pcs entirely and can-not do other than bring an org down to the effect level and so get it into often severe trouble. They are the source (next above suppressives) of all org executives' overwork and woe. The cash-bills ratio of an org is a very good index of the proportion of degraded be-ings on its staff or even in charge of things there. An effective remedy for WW on such an org is to send someone to examine alter-is and non-compliance in that org and dismiss all staff so inclined. The org, even with 2 who are Big Beings left in it, will do better! This policy letter is based on new tech data concerning thetans. When complied with it will increase the effectiveness of orgs many times over. Our problem is to lift up people. We cannot do so if we are internally held down. If our orgs are not maintained at cause then we fail the millions for the sake of being stupid about a few. Remember, we have not abandoned anyone by refusing him or her staff status. L.

A hat essentially is contributive. It contributes to the general production of the team. Contributism is a philosophy in itself. You find it in The Factors. You also find it would apply in economics. One contributes. One is contributed to. By others contributing to others who then contribute back, one is also benefited. When contribution is cut or not allowed, denied or withheld, one gets the phenomenon of ARC Break in the form of cut C - Communication. (Where A is Affinity and R is Reality.) ARC Breaks precede harmful intentional acts. Thus you can expect that when contribution is not balanced to some degree, trouble and upset occurs. From such breakdowns we get the violence of strikes, political philosophies and even revolution. A welfare state requiring no contribution will at length be paid in revolution. A hat \"worn\" without contributing to the team or without contributing one's real ef-forts will cause (a) an upset and discomfort in oneself (b) a harmful reaction from others and (c) reactions within the remainder of the team. Morale is dependent upon production. Production is accomplished by numerous con-tributions of thought or effort. Any existing organization or civilization is the sum total of its past and current con-tributors in terms of thought and effort. Some contribute much, some little. Rewards are not necessarily proportional to contribution and do not necessarily estab-lish the degree of contribution. Actually a \"reward\" is what one desires, not what is given. Approval and validation are often far more valuable than material rewards and are usually worked for far harder than mere pay. Even being part of an important team is a return contribution. Thus \"customer ap-proval\" of the team is part of the rewards one achieves."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"SERVICE 2 HCO PL 27.05.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 194 17.11.12 The subject of what one receives in return for contributing is as variable as the desires of Man. Anyone who has a hat is expected to contribute the services outlined by the hat. Other teammates and customers or clientele or \"the public\" expect a staff member to contribute his specialized services to those who seek them. Thus Service is a keynote of a hat. Many years ago when I first looked this over, I had a high position of command. After a great deal of sorting out, I finally concluded that the only privilege it conferred on me was the right to serve. After that I could handle the post. And was happy with it. Certain it is that degradation is inevitable when the Right to Serve is interrupted or de-nied. It is worth thinking about in relation to happiness. L.

The prosperity of a business is directly proportional to the speed of flow of its parti-cles (despatches, cables, goods, messengers, students, customers, agents, etc.). To prosper, service must be as close to instant as possible. Anything which stops or delays the flows of a business or delays or puts a customer or product on wait is an enemy of that business.

So you wonder why the staff isn't paid better. In order to successfully solve these riddles it is necessary to know something about money. Basically money is \"an idea backed by confidence.\" The idea is that the exchange of goods or services kind for kind is too clumsy. To carry your dozen eggs all over town until you find someone who has bread he will exchange for your eggs so you can have bread, is too clumsy. That is called a \"barter (trading) system\" and is used in primitive tribes. To solve this, men get the idea of making metal or slips of pa-per represent the eggs and the bread. Thus you don't need to look all over town. Anyone will buy your eggs that wants eggs and give you money and anyone who has bread will accept money for it. Like: one money particle is worth five loaves of bread or one dozen eggs or two hours of manual labor or one booklet or a square inch of land or-or-or. Confidence comes in that the money particle (piece of metal or paper or some such symbol) will be further accepted after you have accepted it for your eggs. This extends to con-fidence in the country that issued the coin or the paper. As metal has other uses – gold, silver, copper, bronze – it is more likely to have confi-dence placed in it as the country could go broke and one would still have his metal. With pa-per one has to have more confidence in the country. So money is only something that can be exchanged confidently for goods or services. It is a symbol which represents value in terms of goods or services. When money is paid out without buying value (as in welfare handouts or war materi-als or bad stocks or just a promise with no backing) it itself gets into trouble. It begins to buy less because it no longer represents production or services or value. When one begins to receive and spend money he gets into a field known as econom-ics. To understand money one must understand economics. Or he'll be made a fool."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"MONEY 2 EXEC-03 – HCO PL 27.11.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 198 17.11.12 ECONOMICS Economics in modern language means \"the social science that studies the production, distribution and consumption (using) of commodities (things).\" If you like money or want money or use money you cannot remain ignorant of eco-nomics.\" The reason Marx and socialists in general can fool everyone is that there are very few people who know economics and economics itself is not a science but a primitive art. So just as you may stumble on this word \"economics,\" so can the supertotalitarian socialists make whole societies stumble and fall into their hands. The word originally meant \"the science or art of managing a house or household\" and that is still its first meaning. From this grew up a study of the whole community as a con-nected activity. Remember, money represents things. It is a substitute for goods and services. What governments, people and even our orgs can't get understood is that no produc-tion = no money, If one performs a valuable service and exchanges it for goods, he does so through the item of money. Production can mean producing a service or an item that can be exchanged for goods and services. If an activity does not produce and deliver and exchange with other activities, no money is possible. Example: Lack of good Division 6s (Public Division) in orgs makes it impossible to exchange with the community. Equals no money. This is what is behind low gross income. The steps to take are get the org so it can produce a valuable service in some volume and then exchange through Div 6 contacts that service with the community for money. Then increase the volume and quality of the service and increase the exchange through more Divi-sion 6 contacts. That builds up to a big GI that will continue to be big and not slump. As soon as one ceases to deliver the service the exchange breaks and the GI collapses. No matter how hard you sell, if you don't deliver, you get into trouble. The staff member, as part of the org, may think his pay comes from mysterious places. It does not. It comes from his own personal production. The combined services of staff members give the org the valuable final services it can exchange for money. If it does this, then the staff member gets paid and cared for. It is up to Division 6 to build up a demand for the services and a volume of people who then demand the service. It does this with surveys of what the public will buy that the org"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"MONEY 3 EXEC-03 – HCO PL 27.11.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 199 17.11.12 can offer. It then makes the public aware of this by ads and contacts. The public comes in and pays. The rest of the org keeps itself functioning and delivers it. That is really all there is to it. When you see a staff unpaid or an org not very solvent, it is the data above that is not grasped. When you see an org solvent and its staff well paid, then the majority there have grasped this and are doing it. When they do it well enough and in enough volume, they control more and more goodwill and expand. People today are very badly taught on this subject. All money comes from daddy. Governments roll it out in endless streams (and the currency becomes worthless). It's no wonder people believe in \"luck\" as the only thing that makes them rich and powerful. Or some wild idea that was never tried and would be a flop. The truths of wealth are  Income of money on sales must be greater than outgo on bills.  Books, auditing and training, tapes and meters, must be sold for more than they cost the org to produce or buy.  Money is simply that which represents delivered production.  Morale also depends upon accomplished and exchanged production.  Money does not equal morale. The idle rich are a wonderful study in psycho-sis.  And welfare money degrades because it is not exchanged for delivered produc-tion. These are all factors in economics. The way to good pay is an understanding of the subject as above and the work neces-sary to make it so. L.

It buys more funds back from the activity than it paid out and it buys the production of that activity. Finance is best understood as a commodity in terms of beans. So many beans issued to an activity and so many more beans back. Beans do not magically materialize into more beans. What brings back more beans for those issued is the production and industry of org staff and how wisely the beans are allo-cated. Even the interest one earns on a bank account is earned in fact by someone's produc-tion and ability to get more beans out of an activity than are put in. Where Finance uses its beans to buy production and industry and projected income at a cost which requires the activity to be viable it gets back more beans and a raised allocation - production ratio. The first rule of Finance and any activity is income greater than outgo. Where Finance can skillfully apply this to the divisions and personnel of an org as well as the org as a whole the additional beans materialize because what is bought is produc-tion and the products which add up to the product of raised income and viability. PRODUCTION Activities that allocate by need and fail to force and pay for production are the basis of failed economies and welfare states. \"We need....\" is taken by Finance with a yawn unless followed at once by a projected resulting valuable product or income realistically planned and immediately in view. Finance allocates against proven production and projected income."},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"BEAN THEORY FINANCE AS A COMMODITY 2 FS-07 – 19.03.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 202 17.11.12 The FBO looks at where the beans are going and what income and production they are buying. When he finds that the beans issued to an area or division are not buying production or income he designates a cap - in - hand status to that area and the beans issued become those essential to product only until the product emerges in the expected volume and quality. One org with a soaring payroll particularly in the Tech area while delivering less than 5 auditing hours per auditor per week had all on full pay and bonuses. The org had finance troubles and found sums needed to promote absorbed instead by high payroll. How? The org was on fixed pay (high) and gave only small production bonuses, obli-gating a high payroll expense without regard for production. Other errors aside, the Finance error is an absent demand that the beans issued to that area buy more beans or valid full capacity production. A reversal of this, setting low basic pay and high production bonuses, would have bought production for the beans issued and where there was no production would have issued no beans or a bare minimum. INCOME SOURCES The apparency that income sources devolve upon certain single portions of an org leads Finance into difficulty unless the products and sub - products of the org and its divisions are fully grasped. The tracing and reinforcing of income sources while a necessary and vital action falls far short of the total action of finance in its investment of beans. A company receiving income only after the fact of delivery would appear to an inept or unfamiliar Finance person to have delivery as its major income source. If Finance then seeks to raise income by forcing all beans into stepped - up delivery while neglecting the prior promotion and sales there is soon no demand and nothing to deliver and no beans. Income sources traced superficially to sales expertise alone, neglecting promotion and delivery again gives no beans. A Finance person seeing sales expertise as the company's immediate and major in-come source quite rightly issues more beans to sales. But if he leaves promotion and delivery underfinanced, sales suddenly finds itself selling an unknown product due to absent prior promotion, and sales made go undelivered or poorly delivered or even refunded. Finance tracing income sources to promotion alone and neglecting to follow up with sums to sales and delivery gives the same result. Thus, in addition to org income sources, Finance and org managers must know the valuable final products and sub - products of the org and its divisions and posts in order to wisely allocate funds."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"BEAN THEORY FINANCE AS A COMMODITY 3 FS-07 – 19.03.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 203 17.11.12 COSTING Income greater than outgo applies equally to each division and person in an org. If Finance is fully familiar with the products of divisions and key posts of an org and their costing and value to the completed org product and expected volume or capacity it can skillfully apply income greater than outgo individually to each. An org has valuable final products for which it collects income. Each division and area of the org has a product or products which contribute to the whole action which gets the org product promoted and delivered and the income collected. How much it costs to produce how much product is the costing of a division or org or post. It is not always possible to determine how much income a single post or division con-tributes to the whole activity. But one can know to what degree a sub - product is vital to the delivery of the org's valuable final product and one can know how much it costs to produce it. And one can expect each area and post to be productive and viable as a single activity. Costing to be real must also take into account the expected capacity or Ideal Scene of the activity. A plant producing at half capacity yet fully manned and running at full expense gives a product which costs twice what it should if the activity is to be fully viable and profitable. A costing of the Tech division described above would show that with production at 115 capacity, its product cost 5 times what it should cost to be viable as an activity and profit-able to the org., Thus, funds allocated to an activity by costing alone will not buy or ensure production or return more beans. If one were allocating beans by income and products, he would have to consider the costing of each product, the importance of each product (how vital it is to the Valuable Final Products of the org) and the expected capacity or volume of each area. One could juggle these about and assign an allocation value to each product and sub - product and key stat. So many letters out, so much bulk mail out, so many student points and well done hours = so much allocation. Under such a system the FBO would get production and more beans back for the beans put in. The Ad Council doing FP on such an allocation would shortly see what under - pro-ductive areas were causing a reduced allocation and would pound those areas to produce. Likewise, the activities of productive divisions and areas would be reinforced by the FP body."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"BEAN THEORY FINANCE AS A COMMODITY 4 FS-07 – 19.03.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 204 17.11.12 What accomplishes this is not Finance acting as org management, but Finance apply-ing income greater than outgo to each division and area of the org and handling money as a commodity of which one issues so much and gets so much more back. Finance becomes org management only where it ceases to handle finance as a com-modity like beans and where org managers themselves fail to grasp and understand financial realities. LOST INCOME Financial Planning is how one uses the funds one has to keep things running well and make more income. There is some degree of loss in a failure to prevent unreal and unprofitable expendi-ture. Orgs and FP bodies are sometimes improvident in their planning and Finance people are alert for this and have to be because they quite rightly expect beans back plus more for beans expended. But the greater loss to Finance is income lost or never made. The difference between what an org should be making and what it does gives Finance greater loss than any FP saving could ever recover. Foolish or unreal expense is prevented because it's a poor investment. But an org of $ 50,000 income potential making only $ 20,000 is a weekly loss of $ 30,000 to Finance. An org stacking up thousands in collected but undelivered services gives Finance a potential and staggering loss in sums refunded. An org seeking to save 10 shillings while neglecting to develop and boom a continent doesn't make sense. One knows the income sources of the org cold and one knows what sub - products promote and sell and deliver and collect income. One puts finance as a commodity first and most into these and never saves on them except to raise the viability of a vital division or area not producing well and then only to raise production. One seeks new income sources and means while reinforcing those already successful and reviving any no longer current. One gets sums already owed to the org collected with industry and in high volume. One handles emergencies by making more money and has lined up 3 or 4 valid income sources each and any one of which would provide the needed funds. One uses beans to buy raised income and production and refuses to finance non - pro-duction or fruitless expense."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"BEAN THEORY FINANCE AS A COMMODITY 5 FS-07 – 19.03.71 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 205 17.11.12 One knows cold the costing of vital and other org products and demands full capacity production and viability and income greater than outgo of each division and area and post of the org individually.

And one knows that more profit can be lost than ever could be saved on expense. Money is a commodity. It is subject to certain realities. Its realities apply to the whole org and equally to the divisions and persons in the org. Its realities have to be fully grasped by Finance and FP members and org; managers.

The idea of \"company property\" is both stupid and dangerous. That which is \"owned by everyone\" is actually owned by no one and falls apart. A company, corporation or state does not live or breathe and so it cannot care for anything. The doubtless noble experiments of totalitarian communal states such as Cuba or Russia starve and fail because of this one id6e fixe: only the state owns. That leaves nobody to have or take care of anything. Their enor-mous five year plans never materialize because their tractors will not run. Their tractors won't run because they belong to nobody. Saying they belong to the state is a way of abandoning them. A company can't really own anything since it has no concept of ownership. And you see how \"company property\" falls apart. Look at it this way: You own those things that are in your charge. When you take over a position you become richer by the things that go with it. You stay rich as long as you keep them in good shape. You get poor to the degree they go bad or won't work or get abused be-cause you incautiously lent them to a careless fellow worker. Righteous indignation because \"you messed up my typewriter\" or \"you scarred up my auditing table\" is not peculiar, it's quite in order. Look around you and see what you own in your position. If two people use it, only one, even so, can own it. It is curious that around orgs my own personal possessions are given good care. I never worry about my Mest being in org hands.

That's a long standing observation. But \"company property\" gets badly abused at times. If you figure that I own everything in Scientology and you own the things that go with your po-sition, we'll have more and have it longer. There are three kinds of possessions in Scientology organizations. Title A: These are permanent installations, buildings, walls, radiators, anything fixed in place. Title B: Valuable equipment which is not expendable. These are desks, typewriters, mimeo machines, blackboards, chairs, furniture, rugs, decorations, cars, etc. Title C: These are expendables. Office supplies, paper, chalk, stencils, dust rags, mops, etc. They are issued on the understanding they will get used up. In inventorying and making up cards of issue to persons in charge, Title A is issued to the head of the organization or department exclusively using them. Title B is made up to the head of the department or the person who is actually using them. Title C is issued to the per-son using the material. Stock cards are kept on Title A and Title B. The administrative head has to have a sig-nature for Title A and Title B as having given it to somebody who then signs for it. No stock cards may be written or \"Issued to Training Dept\" or \"Director of Training\". They are issued to Richard Roe, the person himself. The main building is not issued to \"Or-ganization Secretary\". It is issued to George George, a person who happens also to be organi-zation secretary. A car is not issued to \"Department of Materiel\". It is issued to John John, who happens also to be Director of Materiel. When a person is transferred, his possessions are signed for by the person, as a person, who takes over that position. And so long as the person who owned them has failed to transfer them to the new person, he or she can be charged up for them. Regardless of post transfers, the person on the Stock Card remains the owner and is liable for any loss or abuse until the possessions are actually signed for by somebody else. If it exists somebody owns it and has signed for it. And until a new person signs for it the old owner is liable for it regardless of his whereabouts or new post. Until it is signed for initially it is owned by the administrative head and if anything happens to it or it is lost, the administrative head is liable for it. The stock cards should be stiff cards of good size kept in a box that fits them. There is only one card per piece of equipment. The card says where it is and what it is and when bought and has ample area for owning and transferring signatures. Cards are prepared from Inventory and are checked by Accounts records. A new acquisition brings about a new card which is then signed for. The head of the organization is accountable personally for any losses up to July 1, 1964, which occurred during his term of office."},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"THE EQUIPMENT OF ORGANIZATIONS 3 HCO PL 15.02.64 EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 209 17.11.12 To dispose of Title A or Title B, or account for its loss, it is necessary to survey it. This is done by a board of three executives of departments who must see the equipment being disposed of or certify it as lost. A Survey Board is liable for any falsification of records. In organizations that have no Director of Administration, the head of the organization acts in his capacity and is responsible for having Stock Cards. We are pretty good withal on the subject of equipment. Its loss or damage is not one of our major problems. Only one organization, Johannesburg, has gone mad on the subject where one Senogles, temporary head of it, had a passion for \"losing tapes and tape recorders\". However, we are expanding. Expansion needs some orderly ownership. There is not very much Title A and Title B about so it is not a very heavy task to organize it. If we straighten this out now, we'll save ourselves a mess later. Further, at this time inventories for corporation transfers have to be done anyway, so we may as well get it all done at once. L.

Why do Parliaments pass such strange bills? Why does one get unreal solutions out of conferences? The facts are these as we have lately discovered. When a person comes to a Conference: A. He dumps his own hat. B. He picks up a planning hat. C. He expresses opinions not data. D. The Group Think is based on collective opinion, not on actual data. E. Results are unreal. Example: You call in a plumber, an electrician and a concrete man. You ask for their opinion. They decide on a building with a helicopter port roof! But they don't schedule when or how they plumb, elect or concrete! That's an example of what happens in conferences. You have 7 experts in their lines. They could contribute data which means Facts. But they can dump their hats and pool opinion! Thus an unreal solution can occur. One of those hats must be a planning hat. The others all tend to grab that hat. Their own hats will surely then fly straight up to the Manager or Commanding Officer or In Charge who then has to redo it all. The correct, vital actions of any conference member are: 1. Prepare your data before coming to the Conference. 2. At the Conference tenaciously wear, defend and don't depart from your own hat. 3. Refuse any temptation to wear a planning hat. Insist on the planning member doing the planning. 4. Express only data. Do not give an opinion even when asked for it. Differentiate be-tween summation of data and opinion about data. 5.

RON HUBBARD LRH:dz.ei.rd"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":" EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 213 17.11.12 FLAG ORDER 2478 17 June 1970 CONFERENCE ACTIONS (See FO on Conference Hat, FO 2408) Robert's Rules of Order, so famous and so abused, went out of style for us with the is-sue of Conference Hat. A democracy adheres to the principle that the majority rules and that the minority is either neglected or persecuted. The lazy action is to pass things with majority vote. The work comes in when a program or proposed ED or action has to be in such condi-tion of rightness that all conflicts with it are handled. A Divisional Officers' Conference or Advisory Council or Committee, for instance, represents certain different divisions. Supposing it proposes a resolution that all QM watches will be stood by Division 2 personnel. As the 2nd Mate in charge of Div 2 is one voice out of 9, this proposal could be passed 8 for, 1 against. So you see the idiocy of it. Robert's Rules of Order were all right until the Communists found how to manipulate meetings. (See a \"Short Course in the Secret War\" by Christopher Felix concerning democ-ratic manipulations in Hungary resulting in a Communist take-over.) In 1950 I saw a Com-munist chairman manipulate meetings so that no dissenting voice was ever recognized and any important issue was stalled and tabled. Robert's Rules finally had an alien tech catch up with it. So there must be holes in that procedure. We have no idea of anyone taking over our councils but we can see that they are often unreal. The bug is using Robert's Rules of Order – chairman, recognition of one speaker at a time, majority vote, etc. The chances are that a conflict in a meeting will always be a minority as the conflict-ing voice is probably the only one who knows the area which the proposed measure disturbs. Therefore, one should revise his viewpoint of committee or meeting duties. If one brings CSW and his own hat to a conference and gets what he needs and de-fends his area, then the whole idea is at once nullified by \"majority vote\" or any vote at all! The Chairman considers anything passed which is not protested. He considers it vital to revise anything that is protested until it is fully acceptable. These provisions apply: 1. The whole conference must be briefed on any measure."},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 214 17.11.12 2. The measure in conflict must be (a) adjusted at once in the conference or (b) returned to its submitter for better CSW. If an item or proposal is returned for CSW it is logged by the secretary as incomplete and must be taken up again in a completed form at the earliest meeting. Otherwise the meet-ing loses control. In the case of a prior Divisional Conference things coming up in it must be ham-mered into a general proposal by the Divisional Officer and submitted to the higher meet-ing. This proposal is taken up by the higher conference, any conflicts shaken out of it and when no longer protested is considered passed. Example: In Div Conference a student says he has no Checksheet. The Div Officer must look at why by taking it up in the conference as he does not control compilations. He proposes that urgently required checksheets be completed. It develops from the Div Officer over Compilations that his personnel is on a special duty. The first Divisional Officer then adds to his proposal so it reads, \"Urgently required checksheets must be provided and Compi-lations personnel are exempt from special duty until all checksheets are done.\" The personnel Div Officer says, \"No, there's no one available to do the special duty.\" The Conference de-mands why? and the personnel officer says he's not permitted to transfer anyone. This runs back the arbitrary. So the measure becomes, \"The urgently required checksheets are to be done at once by Compilations and the personnel officer is permitted to transfer personnel to remedy this overload of Compilations.\" There is no further conflict. It is considered passed, somebody else is transferred to the \"special duty\". Compare this to \"majority rule\". \"One of my students urgently requires a Checksheet. I propose checksheets are provided at once.\" Compilations Senior: \"My Compilations I/C is on special duty.\" Chairman: \"Votes! 8 to 1. Passed. Next measure.\" And so the action of the conference plasters the org with unre-solved arbitraries and crashes it. For obviously that Checksheet will never get done if Compilations I/C is off on Special Duty! So the Conference acts but nothing ever happens! Soon nobody pays any attention to it. Command should require all Div Conference notes and all papers of any DOC or higher Conference are forwarded to him and should get in the purpose and function of these conferences by carefully noting what officers should have brought things up and didn't and what proposals were passed without protest from the one who should have. It will quickly become visible that one or two are not doing their jobs. Inspection of divisions will result in confirming the neglect showing up in conference by one or two. Action should be taken ac-cordingly. The organization is an interplay of actions. One area not acting can stall the whole org. The visible point to command is the meeting of the heads of the various divisions of major functions. By getting officers who do make proposals and do defend their hats just by these two things the org will rapidly build up in effectiveness."},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":" EXECUTIVE ESSENTIAL COURSE 215 17.11.12 All the overload of command comes from unhandled divisional responsibilities. And it shows up at once in a DOC or Ad Council by (a) failures to make proposals and (b) failures to defend one's hat. The failures to present proposals on things necessary to running a Div is a symptom of neglect that will be borne out by inspection. Failures to defend one's hat result in strewing the org with arbitraries and will result in a crashed org. C/Os who try to make up for conference deficiencies without also putting in greater efficiency in conferences will single-hand themselves half to death. An org or a ship can be made to run well. Its survival depends utterly upon its running itself, not being hand fed and babied and excused. Checkouts or no checkouts, data or no data, plan or no plan, it is fully expected in the SO that the man on the post can do and must do his job. L.

The Admin TRs (training routines) are designed towards increasing one's causative-ness over the everyday confusions, randomities, justifications, excuses, traps and insanities of the physical universe (Matter, Energy, Space and Time) and people (groups). They enable one to comfortably confront such things when encountered. Needless to say, such abilities, if attained, would greatly increase any individual's sur-vival in this world and since these Admin TRs do produce these abilities they are of extreme value. These drills start off very gradiently and work up to a high pitch of confront and han-dling by the individual. They are done with a twin and they must be coached with full understanding of the need to give the individual doing them wins. He must not be driven out the bottom or into overwhelm due to forcing him to confront too much too quickly. Each drill is run to a win where the individual is doing the drill comfortably and with-out effort and is happy about his ability to do it. Even if an individual feels he will experience little change on some of the beginning drills, he will upon doing them, become aware of an increase in awareness or just a good feel-ing about doing them.
